He was so helpful with all my luggage and boxes. He gave me lots of tips for getting around and was so friendly and gentlemanly. \n\nThe bad:\n- No easy way to load in and out. There are some big black suvs often in the way. Some guy was sleeping in his and hogging up the \"designated\" hotel pick up spot. I went around the block 2 times just trying to look for a place to park the car to unload.\n\n- No storage space. They couldn't even hold three boxes for me and instead I had to take it to the room.\n\n- Understaffed at night. The heater in our room didn't work at all and it took many phone calls before someone even picked up the phone at the front desk. The technician reset the heater and when it didn't work, he had to open up the panel to find out the heater wasn't on at all because it was turned off from the inside. Seems like a weird thing to turn off in late November. \n\n- They do offer slippers here but definitely cheap and not plush for a hotel of this caliber. \n\nThe good:\n- Rooms are spacious. Definitely on the bigger side for hotels in Manhattan. \n\n- We had a north facing room so the view was gorgeous.\n\n- Bathroom was spacious, really liked the ledge to sit on though the frosted glass panel into the sleeping area was an interesting choice\n\n- Staff was friendly and personable but Jose was the best of them all.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

He had a huge smile on his face and was so genuine!  He gave us some information on local stores for items we needed and walking directions to the stores. He started our experience off in such a great way at Ink 48!  \nAs we were checking in we were told the room we booked had HVAC issues and we were immediately upgraded to a king suite.

The front desk staff Daniel and Christian were the best.  They were beyond nice and very helpful.  I ended up having such a nice conversation with Christian about theatre and dining in New York City.

Such a great person!   \nOur room was VERY clean and comfortable.  The housekeeping staff kept everything tidy each day.  We loved returning to Ink 48 each afternoon as it is in a quiet area (does not have the busyness of Times Square).  It was nice to take a break from the crowds of NYC.  As in any big city we were cautious at night and used Ubers to return to the hotel. Overall an A+ for us. Thank you for everything!  We'll definitely be back!    \n\nSome suggestions:  Please provided complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning. Having to leave the property to grab a quick cup of coffee is inconvenient.  There is a restaurant on property for breakfast...we chose to skip the sit down and get right to the city.  Coffee on the way out would have been nice. \nBring back the wine hour 5-6pm : )  \n\nOne last thought...Kindness goes a long way.  Treat people with respect and kindness and they will respond in the same way.  NYC big city with a lot of people.  Sometimes people just need a smile.  : ) ","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room was 82 degrees and humid, it was awful. Night two we were told we would be moved to a 1 king + sofa pull out room. When we arrived in the new room it was just a single bed, again they were unable to move us to a two bed room, so we had to share a bed (we are not on bed sharing terms). Had to stay there again night three. Night four we were moved to a functional 2 bed room with AC. That means only 1 out of 4 nights did we receive the accommodation we paid for.\n\nAdditionally the showers in every room were not clean (someone else's hair and fuzz), wipeable black stuff on floor and walls. The first room, I kid you not, had a wet spot on the carpet that soggied my socks. I wore shoes after that.\n\nWe interacted with four front desk people during our troubleshooting. Three of four were great, one was awful, unsympathetic, and unhelpful. That really stood out to me as a deal breaker, I mean, I understand being at capacity and a mechanicals failure, but there's really no excuse for poor treatment from staff. He was not just rude to us, but to others as well. One woman came down to the lobby to ask how she might get some hot water for tea, and he responded \"I don't boil water.\" \n\nThe associated restaurants were really good though, so I do recommend eating there, just not sleeping there.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Room amenities were noticeably lacking\u2014no coffee maker and an overpriced minibar with no space for personal items. The bathroom had a glass door without a lock, compromising privacy and lighting up the whole room during nighttime visits.\n\nThe hotel does boast an impressive rooftop bar with a great view, but this came with its own set of constraints. After 5 PM, the space becomes a 21+ upscale club open to the public. We were traveling with a minor and found ourselves restricted to visiting the rooftop between 4-5 PM. Furthermore, we weren't allowed to purchase alcoholic beverages during that 1-hour window due to the minor's presence.\n\nGiven the limitations and lack of flexibility, especially concerning the rooftop bar, we will explore other options for the next visit to NYC.

It lacked a in room coffee machine, it had no desk to work at, the extra space was mostly wasted by an oversized bathtub in the room (note the grout was falling out from between the stone slabs so bath water went where it was not supposed to).

I asked Ivan at the desk for help, and he found me a small sewing kit which saved the day. Thanks Ivan! The room was very nice clean, modern and well laid out. The staff really makes the place and that tells me they have a great General Manager. I was able to talk to \"Ponzie \"who serves as the initial security screening for the beautiful bar restaurant they have on the roof. He is a very interesting fellow and does a great job preventing problems. The place would be fantastic for anyone who will be cruising from the port here. Although I prefer historic and traditional versus modern, I really loved the place! ","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

We were in NYC to visit our son who lives in Hell's Kitchen. From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, we were treated as VIPS--the doormen were amazing and friendly, the front desk at check in was fantastic--Thank you Lynn for giving us a wonderful first impression of Ink 48 and for our fabulous corner room with views of the Hudson and 48th St (and funny, the back of our son's apartment!)\n\nWe went to the Press Lounge on Saturday night and had an equally positive experience there--excellent doormen, fantastic waitress. We had difficulty finding seats and one of the doorman found a place for us and brought us to the seats--I felt that was above and beyond and much appreciated! The food was delicious and so were the cocktails.\n\nThe room was bright and clean, the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom spacious. As mentioned above, the views were spectacular. Loved the blinds---room darkening as well as light filtering.\n\nThe location was perfect for us--half a block from our son's apartment, lots of terrific restaurants within easy walking distance and the theatre district just a few blocks away.\n\nCheck out was as positive as check in---Darnell was helpful, friendly and professional.

When I began to let him know we did indeed have two - he said I was mistaken and was extremely judgemental as though this hotel was my first experience.  Highly mistaken.  When I brought the confirmation numbers up, he disappeared and returned.  His attitude was better - but definitely short of welcoming.  We had to give our credit card for incidentals and he said they would handle it.  Well - we got charged for the second room by the hotel AND Priceline.  It has been two months.  Emails, credit card statements, phone calls with Priceline and the FRONT DESK that lets their phone ring and ring.  While our stay was pleasant, this absurd lack of doing what's right lets me sing no praises.  As a frequent visitor in the city, this place will not have a second glance.  The hours spent trying to rectify this is unbelievable, and the runaround\/attitude we have gotten from Sergio Sandoval, Andrew Brady, Andy Naibako, Daniel, and Carlynn Ramos - among others - is one for the books.

This is obviously done (and counted on) so that the guest can check in to the room without needing to pay for it, as it's how we accommodate VIP's and staff.  Imagine the frustration to have a VIP guest arrive and be told they could not check in because the room wasn't paid for, because unbeknownst to us, ink48 is crazily deciding behind the scenes not to charge the room ahead of time like you say you do.  Then the guest is told they can't check in without payment or without me showing up to take care of it.  A VIP guest that has travelled far and needs their room.  On top of this disappointing issue, the front desks staff is rude about it and insists there is no way to help the guest.  (1) ink48 needs to understand what a prepaid reservation means.  \n\nIf you don't actually charge it like you say you do, at least understand that we already agreed during checkout for the room to be charged and don't leave a VIP guest standing there rudely telling them you can't help them (2) have the common sense to figure out calling me or processing the reservation as advertised.  We had a negative experience in June with a similar issue when computer systems were down and rude front desk personnel.   \n\nManagement at ink48 needs to realize that the front desk staff is the first point of contact guests have with the hotel and stop placing any stiff unfriendly body they can put behind the desk and realize they need people trained in friendliness.  \n\nThe front desk experience at ink48 continues to ruin an otherwise great property.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Eerily similar scenario befell us. As we checked in - I walked up to the desk and said \"Let the fun begin\", and then it did. I booked through Booking.com two months before arrival. Two weeks out, I needed to shorten my stay by 1 night. Booking.com said I had to contact the property and, you guessed it, the property said I had to contact Booking.com. B.com then proceeded to try to contact the hotel directly and after several attempts (I was informed through a text chain), could not get through or get a response from the hotel. I also tried and no joy. The day before, B.com was still trying and as we were traveling the next day to the hotel, we were told \"no worries, everything will be sorted out\". We arrived and (you're good at this guessing game), no reservation, no track of communication from B.com. They continued to tell us it was B.com that was at fault, but from the previous review, I now suspect that may not be true. The man who was helping us HAS to be the one from the aforementioned review. I actually said nothing as he was being snippy and arrogant to me, but when he did it to the next two people (repeating the same sentence, verbatim, several times to the person, etc.), I called him out and said that if on the Friday of Labor Day weekend, he was already having this attitude, he maybe should not be in this profession, he proceeded to childishly defend himself - - again wrong response\/approach\/attitude.  \n\nNOW - the reason for my high review is because of Lynn, who saved the day and the made the rest of our stay in NYC enjoyable. She was gracious, apologetic, understanding, so helpful with the utmost professionalism. She upgraded our stay and comped the amenity feee, which since we had already spent an hour trying to check-in and were leaving the next day, was very appreciated! The room was lovely, the beds and pillows SO comfortable, and we enjoyed our stay, regardless of the rocky start! My advice - only check in when Lynn is working. ; ) If this hotel had been a $150\/night room rate - I would forgive all, but at $400\/night, be better.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The lobby area was modern and clean and looked great. When checking in, we were told that they didn't have our booking...which is where the fun began! We had booked this as the last stop on a honeymoon trip through a few destinations. We had not had a single problem before arriving here but were told that the company we booked through have obviously just taken our money and not booked the hotel. I actually had a personal contact number for our travel rep who was amazing and answered my SOS message even though it was midnight back at home...she had emailed over some final confirmations to the hotel the month before we arrived but apparently at that point the hotel knew that we were not on their system but didn't reply to our travel rep saying this so she assumed all was okay! \n\nThe man on the desk was actually incredibly rude and not at all sympathetic to the fact that we had been awake for 36 hours...he offered no solution just 'we don't have your booking so I can't help you' numerous times I might add...there was then a lady who took over who was more polite at least! She reserved us a room upgrade and said that once they have the booking confirmation from the company then we could go up. The company we booked through phoned the hotel to sort it directly but were put on 'hold' whilst they checked in other guests...unfortunately they had actually hung up and then the company couldn't get through again. \n\nWhen asked when we booked (Nov 21) the lady said 'ohhh that makes sense, we can't access the booking because we didn't work here then'...and told us that bookings go through individual email addresses for certain booking companies which seems utterly ridiculous to me! So there was no central booking system?! There were people who had booked last minute (that morning) who were being checked in whilst we sat there...no prizes for being organised!\n\nWe did eventually get into our room though and it had a great view. The bathroom floor though was covered in hairs...to be honest by this point we were so tired and fed up that we just wore flip flops inside and made do...sadly the fun didn't end there.\n\nWe requested a late check out the following day as we were not flying until 10;30pm 2 days later and were told that we could have a complimentary late check out at 2pm but any later would incur a charge - fair enough! Upon checking out, the man said that we owed money for the late checkout...we told him that someone else had put it on their system and said we could have it complimentary. He proceeded to quiz us on 'what was his name', 'what did he look like' 'what time was this that you were apparently told'. Eventually he put it through as complimentary but clearly didn't feel happy about it. We were told that the money taken for incidentals would be returned straight away as we didn't owe anything else.\n\nWe booked a taxi through the hotel to get to the airport as the ubers were all coming up as quite expensive anyway. \u20ac130 flat rate we were told but ended up as \u20ac140 including tax...fair enough I guess but seemed an awful lot of money for a taxi! I just wanted to get out of there though!!!\n\nUpon returning home, I checked my bank account and noticed that the money had not been returned to.my account yet. It is now 13 days later and still nothing...I emailed the hotel the other day (3 times before getting a reply). The sales manager was polite enough and told me he would forward my email onto the front desk...I waited a couple of days before chasing up. I then received the following reply 'good evening Ms Davies. Unfortunately we have no reservations under your name.' I have no other words...I have to wait 31 days before my bank can claim the money back from the hotel but honestly wasn't even surprised by this reply. Short, rude and incorrect information given.\n\nThe hotel itself is in a great location but the staff are, generally, rude and incredibly incompetent! Would not stay here again if you paid me (and that wouldn't be likely anyway as I'm still waiting for my money nevermind some extra!) \n\nThe travel company that we booked through have put through a formal complaint but we aren't holding our breath for a response...wouldn't normally like to write a review like this but this experience put an unfortunate negative ending on our honeymoon and we wouldn't want anyone else to experience the same!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

You can't use any external devices that plug into the TVs, like a Roku stick, as the TVs don't let you change the input to HDMI, you can only use them to watch regular TV.  This wasnt a huge deal to me, but for others that could be a big downside.\n\nBesides that, a really nice and friendly hotel, I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the city on vacation.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Therefore, hotel guests need to budget more than 3 times of your actual  total to stay at this place. If that causes overdraft on your account, your bank will charge you as well. \n2 ) my major reason to stay here was \u201cone of the city\u2019s most attractive bar\u201d as they advertised. However, as I tried to get in, a staff from the bar rejected me due to dressing code. I had regular summer outfit on but they required formal wear. I went back to the hotel and brought up the concern to another gentleman staff, he said \u201cthe bar operates separately, not under our hotel.\u201d In other word, the hotel used another business to mislead guests, once guests arrived, hotel doesn\u2019t care. At least put a big and obvious reminder on the website regarding the dressing code?\n3 ) it\u2019s not qualified as a 4.5 star hotel. No slipper, no water, coffee or tea. No coffeemaker or condiment kit. The worst part was sleeping quality. The AC suddenly blew out air with noise, it lasted about 10mins and stopped. After a while,it\u2019s acting up again. It\u2019s like a new born baby wakes you up every 2 hours. Further, there was no soundproof. I heard people talking on the hallway and in the rooms next to me, they were not loud, but I could hear.

Well why not ask them? They are literally in your building and come through the lobby to get into the elevator.  The hotel web site promotes the bar as its own.

We had many questions and one small issue with the tub, but all were addressed immediately and to our satisfaction.  Every staff member we came in contact with was pleasant and helpful.\nNo coffee pot: True and a disappointment - I like tea before bed - not sure why they can't include this.\nSmell of \"weed\"? We did not experience this @ the hotel, that being said if you haven't been to NYC in a while, the entire city smells like weed.  It's awful.\nLoud? Also we were lucky here too, despite a false fire alarm and some usual \"city noises\" we did not have any rowdy guests keeping us up, or hear the music others mentioned.  No complaints here, probably more dependent on the neighbors you happen to get rather than the hotel.\nDistance from subway - yup, but again, don't you figure that out before you book?\nDistance to Intrepid - can't get any closer.\nDidn't try either restaurant, and yes, that you can't even see the rooftop without paying (a lot) was super disappointing.  It's definitely a hot spot at night.  \nWorth it?  We paid more for a mid-priced room, and to me it's a lot of money, but I don't think it's out of line with all of the other NYC hotels I've stayed at (many).  NYC is expensive and a nice room is even more expensive.  That's just a fact.\nBOTTOM LINE:  I think the best way to explain this place is we got exactly what we were promised, so just be sure you look at what you are booking.  The room was nice and the staff was excellent.

Our room was a city view suite though the only view was straight in to the flats opposite.

I went down to the reception to ask if this was a mistake or where in the hotel we could get a drink from and was told nowhere for the next 2 hours there is no vending machine after the bar is closed there is nowhere on the premises to get a drink which is obviously very inconvenient.

We were left feeling so disappointed the next day we were out all day and returned to the room to find their had been no turn down service and no fresh towels provided.  At this point I decided to raise my issues with the hotel only to find that the phone in the room was broken. So I sent an email which was never acknowledged by the hotel all we received in the way of knowing they had got it was fresh towels in the room the following day but still no turn down service.\n\nI\u2019ve stayed in a hotels under a range of budgets and never had these issues which is shocking as it\u2019s not a budget hotel. I won\u2019t be recommending to any customers. It could be a lovely hotel if the service matched the rooms and the room descriptions were correct tight now the hotel feels very much like a budget hotel masquerading as something more high end","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

What a great hotel - my room had a wonderful view of the skyline, and it was also comfortable, quiet, and clean.   There's a coffee bar right in the lobby that also serves breakfast sandwiches and pastries, and it was so nice to not have to go out to look for my morning cup of Joe.  Print, their restaurant, is also lovely with a great menu and attentive service.  The portions were very generous and my salad and entree were both delicious.  There's also a rooftop bar with one of the most amazing views of the city.  I would definitely return to this hotel as I loved the character - nothing cookie-cutter about it and way better than the feel of a chain hotel.  The area is quiet and away from the real hustle & bustle of NYC, and it's a quick trip if you find yourself needing to go back towards the Midtown area.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The truth is that our rooms (we changed rooms) overlooked a nightclub with loud music blaring until 2AM. When we requested a room change upon checking into our room, the manager and front desk clerk looked at the available rooms for several minutes before the manager pointed to the screen and said to move us to \"that\" room. The front desk clerk said, \"really?\" I should have known at the moment that this wasn't going to be good. They obviously had several rooms to choose from given the amount of time they contemplated the room change. However, when we got upstairs our new room was three rooms down from our original room. When we, again, requested a room change, we were met with rudeness and told that there weren't any available rooms. When we requested some sort of compensation for the inconvenience, the manager said that since we weren't the only people to complain, she couldn't give us any added benefits because then she'd have to give the same to everyone who complained.\n\nFortunately we were only staying there one night before leaving on a cruise. It was a shame, though. It was my sister's first time in NYC and I wanted the first night of our vacation to be fun.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":1158753,"title":"Nice and worthwhile hotel experience with few small shortcomings","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-09-19","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"My wife and I stayed at the Ink48 hotel for our wedding anniversary, and thought it was a nice experience. There's a lot to like along with a few small-but-noteworthy shortcomings. I've broken out our thoughts into multiple categories below.\n\nWhat drove us to book it? We wanted a romantic and classy room that was nicer-than-the-norm. We also enjoy a boutique sensation, which this hotel does somewhat evoke despite being part of the larger Kimpton chain. There's also an **awesome** rooftop bar called \"The Press Lounge\" (and they do encourage advanced reservations); the cost to get in is $50\/person with dues being fully applied toward whatever food and drinks ordered through the bar.\n\nLocation: we wanted something moderately close to Broadway for a show, but didn't want an overly touristy area since we visit NYC often. Beware of two things. 1. the closest Subway stop is about a 15 min walk away (W 50th Street & Broadway). We consciously knew this and were OK with a combination of walking and using Uber\/Lyft. 2. The neighborhood can feel a bit seedy if you're new to NYC. We go to NYC often and weren't bothered by this at all.\n\nRoom: We originally debated getting a suite but chose the \"King Premier\" room since we were spending most of our stay away from the hotel. The King Premier is 50% larger than their regular King room. The layout felt spacious and it was neat that the toilet was separate from the shower; each has its own door so someone can do their business while another person takes a shower. The King Premier room also has a door-less bathtub situated in the middle of the room (away from the toilet and shower). Subjectively, my wife said the bathtub placement felt odd but judge for yourself since you can see it in a lot of photos.\n\nAmbiance: As other reviewers have said, the first thing you notice are the tall ceilings with tall windows. We had a city view that was really cool during both day and night. There was also a comfy sofa and lounge area adjacent to the windows helping you soak in the view. Things felt bright and chipper. If anything, the room's artwork felt a tad barren; there was one big white wall with no artwork whatsoever.\n\nCleanliness: the room was pretty clean. No real complaints. We did notice a likely-permanent wine carpet stain but it was not obvious. Everything else was clean and tidy. Their \"Clean Air\" in-room card prohibits indoor smoking. Smokers will be charged a $350 penalty if they're caught smoking inside.\n\nUpkeep: despite being renovated in 2016, I noticed minor details that momentarily snapped me out of vacation mode. 1. The shower stall's floor tiles were fading and needed new grout. 2. There were multiple shower knobs but one did absolutely nothing (and was loose to the touch). On the plus side, the showerhead and wand were very nice with good temperatures and water pressure. 3. The GFCI electrical outlet above the two vanity sinks was halfway pushed into the wall.\n\nStaff: everyone was friendly and we had no complaints. Other reviews mentioned that the staff came across as curt or unaccommodating. We didn't get that feeling whatsoever (and this is after interacting several times with multiple front desk staff, including the luggage guy, at check-in and check-out). \n\nFood & Room Service: N\/A. I don't think this was available when we stayed? There was a prompt on the TV that said to order room service through the TV digitally. When we went to that part of the TV's app, the room service section was blank. We weren't craving their food so we didn't actively call front desk or seek out food at \"The Print Lounge\" (their ground floor restaurant). The room's mini-bar was also (we assume) empty.\n\nElectronics: Wi-Fi was free with our room although we didn't feel a need to use it (we have unlimited data plans for our phones and cell reception was good the entire time). The TV itself was a basic (maybe 42\"?) flat screen 1080p TV - nothing special. The cable TV feed was clear enough and had plenty of channels to choose from. The remote control and TV apps were responsive enough aside from the aforementioned Room Service snafu. We never order Pay-Per-View content but the available selection felt pretty good including Still-In-Theater movie rentals. For anyone curious, there was no adult content to order - lol. One oddity was that music channels cost money which I've never seen elsewhere. Also, there was no option to hook-up-your-Netflix-account - a feature I've seen at other hotels. Last but not least, the digital thermometer worked correctly and the HVAC unit in the room cools the room down pretty quickly.\n\nCOVID-19: they reviewed our vaccination cards at check-in. The hotel didn't feel overcrowded so no concerns about social distancing in public areas like the lobby. Everything felt clean and most of the staff throughout the hotel wore masks.\n\nOther: Signs to the hotel are not that obvious; one of our Uber drivers completely missed it when he was trying to drop us off. There's also a big construction project across the street, as well as general street noise. As others have said, it can be audible (even at higher floors) if noise is something that easily bothers you. Not a big deal to us but may be to some. Also, check out the Intrepid Sea Air & Space Museum that's a few short blocks away - it's very impressive.\n\nOverall: We felt it was worth the money for a nicer-than-normal room without going overboard. The few shortcomings mentioned throughout this review prevent me from giving it 5 stars. Booking one of Ink48's larger suites is a tempting and appealing idea, but those same shortcomings are making us think twice.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

We stayed in a Hudson River Suite and were pleased with the generous size of the room, the comfort of the bed, and the \"WOW\" factor of the sweeping views from the floor to ceiling windows. I should mention in fairness, the \"view\" of this side of New York isn't terribly interesting or beautiful, and you're in a bit of a fishbowl to the neighboring building - but the wall of windows makes an already large room feel even more expansive. There were discomforts in our stay, but I understand that everyone is suffering from COVID-19 fall-out. Staff, if available at all, isn't the cream of the crop, and we're all getting by as best as possible with supply chains, money, and restrictions on everything tightening by the minute.

Traveling for a getaway with my husband, I booked the same hotel and room type and somehow ended up in a less pretty room half the size, with no seating area, and a small dining table with a single chair. It was also a LOT louder than the previous room, but that's probably because we were much closer to the window given the room size.\n\nRoom service etc. was suspended due to the pandemic, which is completely understandable, and I feel for this industry that has been hit by difficulties, so that is an informational statement only, and not a judgment. I assume that any mini bar items were also impacted, as these were not included in the room, though there is a small fridge.\n\nMy other callouts are just that the room seemed to be set up for one person. One chair, one robe, one of everything. We were informed by one of the men holding the doors in the lobby that we had an umbrella in our room, but unfortunately, ours was missing, as an example. \n\nI will say that housekeeping was fully operational, as we had actually not requested it, but came back to our room fully cleaned and reset.\n\nSo, I guess my experience was mixed. One trip was fantastic, and I declared that I would never stay anywhere in NY. The second was a bit disappointing, but I'm hoping it was just a sign of covid related times.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Since we have a $200 credit through American Express, we decided to book through their portal. When searching for hotels, we stumbled upon Ink 48 and by all accounts, it seemed like the perfect little spot to stay while we were in town - rates were reasonable, they are part of the American Express Hotel Collection (upgrade if available and $100 on-site hotel credit), and decently close to everything we were looking to visit when in town.\n\nInk 48 has a few different room types. We went through each room carefully and decided to book the King Premium room based on the description and pictures provided by the marketing team on Ink 48's website and the American Express site. \n\nSince we took a red eye, we were hoping & praying for a potential early check-in so we could take a quick nap before venturing out. By the time our plan landed, the hotel had already sent us a notification that our room was ready! It looked as though things were going our way!\n\nWhen we arrived at the hotel, we asked the front desk if there was any potential for any upgrade. Sadly, we were told that there was, but we would be charged for it. This was a bit of a shock, but decided to let it be until later since we were tired and not looking for any argument. Outside of that, the front desk staff member was super nice.\n\nWe proceeded to our room and found that the room we had been given was nothing like what was described or pictured on Ink 48's website or American Express' travel portal. We took a quick nap and then proceeded on with our day since we had activities that were at specific times.\n\nWhen we returned to the hotel, we asked the new front desk lady about the room and she wasn't super pleasant to interact with. She let us know that the room shown on the website has only a few rooms that look like that and they are reserved for VIP guests who stay with the hotel frequently. She told us that she would move us, but they were 100% full for the night.\n\nWe went back up to the room and while looking up review to see if others had experienced the same type of issue noted that the hotel still had plenty of rooms open still for our days of stay. During this same time, we had also noticed that the headboard was covered with what we can only assume was something from someone having a super happy evening of fun with someone else. \n\nSince the front desk didn't seem to be able to help or even really explain why things were not as advertised, we decided to reach out to the General Manager (Nick) who we noticed replies to most reviews in a quick and timely manner. Nick was 100% on the ball and willing to help explain the situation and offered to upgrade us at no cost to the Junior Suite (which is the next room type up it appears). Nick even agreed the descriptions and pictures were not really accurate for that room type. We moved into the new room the next day and it was night\/day different than the room we originally were assigned.\n\nThe beds and pillows were super comfortable. Make sure you pick up some cups from the front desk as the hotel has removed everything from the rooms. The bathroom products smelled great (might even buy some for home), and the spa like shower was wonderful to stand in when getting ready for the morning.\n\nWe did take advantage of the $100 credit by using the Print restaurant in the lobby. We shared an egg sandwich which was pretty tasty. You don't need to order via the website, you can walk in and order at the counter and they will deliver it to you.\n\nLastly, if you are planning to use the subway, this hotel is a bit of a walk (about 10 minutes or so) to the closest terminal. Otherwise, you can easily hail a cab right outside if needed.\n\nOverall, while the room situation was a bit of a failure, Nick and Anthony did an excellent service recovery on a holiday weekend. We enjoyed staying at Ink 48 and would recommend you trying it out.","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

I booked suites (December 2019) for my Memorial Day weekend wedding in 2020 and had wedding blocks set up for the wedding guests (January 2020). \n\nI made it clear that I had 2 dogs that are in my wedding and staying with me in my suite. They are part of my wedding party. I partly chose Ink48 because of the pet policy (no pet fees, no pet deposits, no size\/breed restrictions). I had to postpone my wedding to 2021.  When I had to make the date change in April due to Covid-19, Andreas gave me an addendum to change the dates but neglected to mention the change in pet policy and management.\n\nI noticed the change in the pet policy and emailed the sales director, Andreas, on October 1.  With this new pet policy, not only would I only be able to only have one dog but I also would have to pay $100 extra for something I thought was included in my reservation.  I asked for my wedding block guests and my own reservation to be exempt from this policy because I made the reservations while the hotel did not charge pet fees and did not have a size restriction.  I consider it being \"grandfathered\".\n\nHe did not respond for 2 weeks.\nIt was not until I complained to the concierge desk and asked for his superior that he responded to me.\nHe made an excuse about his reduced work schedule due to Covid as his reason for not responding.  I work on a reduced work schedule too. If it took me two weeks to answer an email, I would have been fired.  That was a terrible excuse. This hotel is a client relationship based business, is it not?\n\nHe did not exempt my reservation or wedding blocks from the rule change. His response was to tell me that the rate was $100 per pet for the entire stay. And that he would reduce my fee to $30 per day. Whether he meant $30 per day or per pet per day is unclear.\n\nWorse case scenario, I would have had to pay more than $100 for something that was supposed to be free and included in my reservation with your hotel. Best case scenario, I pay $60 for something that was supposed to be included. He made it seem like he was doing me a favor.\n\nCan you imagine the nightmare this would have been for me to check into the hotel for my wedding if I had not spotted this change? I would have been charged another $120 and not been able to bring my large dog into the hotel (who is the ring bearer in my wedding).  This is incredibly unprofessional and dishonest.\n\nI feel like this hotel is a complete joke for trying to pull wool over people's eyes.

The Hudson Suites are as lovely as ever, with floor to ceiling windows and views of the Hudson, capacious closet space (a seeming rarity in New York, even with suites), a huge bathroom and an attractive layout.\n\nHowever, if you are sensitive to noise, you might want to check on the status of construction as during my visit there was excavation going on between the hotel and the river, including on Saturdays.  The drilling jolted me awake at 7:00 a.m. each morning (particularly awful the first morning when I had arrived well after 2:00 a.m.) and the drilling started at 8:00 a.m. on Saturdays. Sunday was mercifully an off day for construction.\n\nOther than the construction, the stay was fine. The hotel charges the same ridiculous \"resort fee\" that every other hotel in New York now charges, but at least at Ink48 I got something useful for the fee -- a $10 daily credit for room service or the hotel restaurant (albeit not for the mini-bar).  However, I just checked the hotel's website and I do not see anything about the food credit, so maybe they took that away, which would be a shame, because it does make you feel less resentful about the resort fee.\n\nI do quite like staying in Hell's Kitchen, especially now that Hudson Yards is open, which is a few blocks south of the hotel.

Nothing was mentioned about my request until I asked. was told by the guy at the desk 'guess you did not get it\". Finally was placed in a higher floor room, 14th floor which i normally request to get a view of the city.  what i was not warned about was a club on the 17th floor on saturday nights where the music was thumping at 2am in the morning rattling our room. was not warned about this at check in and given an opportunity to get another room. Night manager was not very helpful; was asked why we were not warned about this at check-in she indicated things were in \"transition\" as this wioll not be a kimpton property much longer thus the slip in not telling us about the nightclub noise. weak excuse. To their credit we were comped the Saturday stay, and was told we would get additional ihg points (not received yet).

I asked for a quieter room and was told they would do their best, but that is would be difficult because of the location of the hotel. The room was reasonably quiet at night, but soundproofing between rooms sucks and it didn't help that the maid service slammed room doors as they were entering and leaving them.  During the daytime, noise was particularly loud\u2014either from construction or a nearby lumber yard.  The room was modern and well-designed.  I had a view facing south and east. I could see the Intrepid.  My main concern happened at checkout.  I was informed of a \u201cfacility fee\u201d.   I believe this was $30 per day, plus taxes.  I pointed out that this was not mentioned in my Priceline booking (such bookings put this amount as \u201cpayable at hotel\u201d and that if I had known about the fee I would have taken it into account in my choice of hotel).  When I showed the desk employee my Priceline bill (which did not mention that any additional fees were payable at the hotel), the employee said that every hotel in NYC and nationwide has such fees.  I pointed out that this statement was not true and that I was aware of that as I travel a lot.  I also pointed out that I wouldn't have booked the hotel if I knew it had a facility fee and that it was unfair of the hotel to only inform me of this after my stay.  The employee then removed the amount from my bill.  I am extremely unhappy with this interaction. I should not be deceived by hotels about the fees payable and for the employee to indicate that such fees occurred in all hotels is a blatant lie that attempts to normalize this deceptive conduct by his own hotel.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

He didn't reply when i questioned why they didn't even email me to say view was restricted from what was being advertised and he just shrugged his shoulders. He claimed floors below (up to 6th) are a little cheaper due to lack of view and offered another $50 but that's all he can do. Place was busy so i guess they can afford to not be bothered.

Despite the prior responses from the hotel\u2019s manager on TA, my stay was NOT on a Saturday night! The walls are paper thin, the windows are single pane, and there was clearly an installation error made when the windows were put in. We heard everything on blast including people talking in the hallway, toilets flushing, doors closing, traffic, and the music from the club. I took a video and you can clearly hear the music thumping and someone on a microphone declaring a \"winner\" loudly at 2:30 am. There was no information provided at check-in to indicate that noise might be an issue despite numerous complaints on this board. In fact, the hotel touts itself as being located in a quiet part of town (one of the reasons I chose the location), which is false advertising.

So many missed marks at this hotel, that if it wasn\u2019t for the heavy traffic and the hour it took us to find parking, we would\u2019ve just turned around and went home. Hotel front desk was consistently rude and dismissive. Upon check-in, the front desk agent did not greet us or look up once the entire time until he took my ID and credit card and fed it into the chip reader. Not until I had asked him what exactly what he was charging me for, that he finally looked up and ran through a spiel about a safety deposit and fee for hotel facilities which included WiFi, $10 credit for in room dining and on site restaurant, and printing up to a certain amount of pages. He went on quickly about getting to their rooftop bar and the hours of their bar and restaurant, without even stopping to take a breath. We could barely get a question in. We requested a higher floor and paid for a studio with a view but was given one on the 9th floor. The room was nice and clean with a decent view, despite the dirty windows and construction across the street which woke us up bright and early. They had an in-room minibar complete with drinks and snacks. I took a bag of gummy bears which totaled up to 9$, which I figured could be handled with the dining credit. Spoiler; it does not. No water or ice machines on the floor, so you\u2019re better off buying it from the convenience stores on the corner. The morning after, we realized we forgot toothbrushes. Made a call to front desk, and didn\u2019t get them until 20mins later. Causing us to almost miss check-out time. When we finally made it to front desk, the first agent I approached only responded with a no eye-contact (seems to be an ongoing theme here) and brisk, \u201cI\u2019m setting up.\u201d The desk agent at the end of the front desk called over and said I can assist you. Asked me for our room number even though I had already passed her the room key. She quickly printed out and handed me a receipt, without any explanations of the charges or any question of the quality of our stay. I was honestly so fed up and did not have the energy to argue. At this point I just wanted to get the hell out of Dodge.\n\nIt was this weekend that I proposed to my fianc\u00e9, and the whole hotel experience left a horrible stain on our entire weekend. If this was just a regular inn, I would have expected this level of service, but since we were paying 300$+ for one night I was expecting quite a bit more. Honestly, your money would be much better off spent at a more professional establishment, like a McDonalds drive-thru for instance. \n","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

If, however, you book a hotel in the reasonable expectation of getting a few hours shut-eye please RUN AWAY now and book ANYWHERE else. We booked in for three nights over a weekend in October. On the first night, a rooftop nightclub opposite started pumping out loud, thumping music at about 11pm. It was so loud it woke me up. I then put in earplugs and wore noise cancelling headphones over the earplugs and I could still hear it. The hotel rooms are not double-glazed and there is no sound-proofing whatsoever. I called reception to be told there was no way they could move us to a different room as they were fully booked and was casually informed that the nightclub would be playing their music until 4am. So clearly, the hotel knows this is an issue and has done for some time. Sure enough, the music continued at a decibel-shattering level until 4am, making sleep impossible. Then there was the added noise of people leaving - shouts and car horns and engines - for another hour. I can honestly say it was the worst night I have ever spent in any hotel. This is the first trip advisor review I\u2019ve ever written but I have to do it to tell you PLEASE do not book this place.

Great location as it's just a couple blocks from the cruise terminal. Our 9th floor room was directly across the street from some rooftop cantina nightclub. The noise from the DJ was overwhelming, with house music shaking the walls of our hotel rooms all night and morning. They say this is the city that doesn't sleep, but I wanted to. This nonsense went on until 3:30 a.m., at which time all of the drunk, coked up cantina patrons decided to beep their car horns in the street below and make a lot of other noise. \n\nThe Kimpton's rooftop bar area was an awesome space with incredible views. Unfortunately, it wasn't designed for hotel patrons but more geared towards younger affluent nightclubers who didn't mind paying $15 for a domestic beer. \n\nAs for the staff, the receptionist I spoke to about the noise couldn't care less. Understand she couldn't do much but show some empathy, and maybe throw in a breakfast for our troubles. The website I used to book the hotel was a trusted one as I used it in the past. The hotel is pricey but for what the website claimed was a 4.5 star hotel, I didn't mind. This was a three star hotel, nothing more, at best. Rooms were clean and some of the staff, particularly one of the doormen\/security gentlemen, were friendly and helpful. \n\nThe inability to get ANY sleep is enough to ensure that I'll never spend time at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

This Kimpton is waaaay on the west side of Manhattan, and for those readers not familiar with the island, know that there isn't an awful lot that is comfortably walkable from this location (other than Gotham West Market, the cruise terminal, or a bunch of car dealerships).  However, since it's so close to the Hudson River, you do get the benefit of some lovely views.  Nevertheless, quick cab rides will get you to all kinds of stuff.\n\nWe prefer boutique hotels these days, and this is a nice one.  The building is a former printing factory, and the newly renovated rooms are comfortably industrial chic.  You'll notice a number of nods to the building's history as well as to its location near the piers of the Hudson.  Now that Kimpton is part of IHG, my hubby's IHG Ambassador membership resulted in us getting a large, airy Junior Suite.  This meant that we had huge windows, a king bed, a vanity area, a sitting and dining area, and a bathroom that you could do cartwheels in.  There were lots of good things about this suite.  For example, the fridge wasn't one of those where when you move an item they charge you, so I was able to get some of our own bottles of water, sports drinks, etc. in there.  The bed was comfortable, the HVAC worked well, the lighting was nice, and the colors were calming (whites and tans with pops of navy and black).  \n\nThere were a few issues -- when we first arrived, inches from our room's door in the hallway was somebody's used wine glass with a napkin stuck in it.  Also, when we pulled back the sheets on the bed, the fitted sheet had some stains on it, even though it clearly had been laundered.  Of course we called down to the front desk and these things were rectified while we were out at dinner.    Details matter to me, though, and I would have expected these oversights not to have happened.  Speaking of details, while another thing I like about Kimptons and this place is that they have big glass containers of water with cucumbers, oranges, etc. in them so that you can sit in the lobby and have a little refreshing moment.  We went to do this and found that both of the urns had barely any water in them (we managed to squeak out two small glasses).  The front desk staff were maybe five feet away and we had to go and tell them about this.  The containers were clear glass and all it would take is a glance over there once in a while to make sure they are filled by someone.  To me, a hotel is truly excellent when amenities they offer are always available when they should be, without asking.  Again, it's the details.\n\nThe staff we encountered were pretty much all really nice to talk with.\n\nWhile not the hotel's fault, fyi, when we were there we were woken up very early by some very loud construction jackhammers at a property adjacent to the hotel.  So if this is important to you and you are looking to book in the near future, you may want to inquire about the construction going on nearby.\n\nThe rooftop lounge and the restaurant lounge (both I reviewed separately) are worthwhile visits.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Here are my lengthy, if not particularly brilliant, observations:\n1.  The staff was unfailingly polite, from check-in to departure.  The front desk sent us a free bottle of champagne for the celebration, it quickly repaired a stubborn sliding door in the shower, and best of all, the Hotel gave us three adjoining rooms without question or the usual lame excuses.  \n2.  The Hotel location, 11th Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets is excellent;  it is one block from the Hudson River Park and just minutes from the Intrepid Museum.  My daughter, now a savvy NYC dweller, however, felt it was not convenient to the subway system.  \n3.  Our room was very nice: clean, reasonably spacious, and well appointed.\n4.  The rooftop bar is simply incredible with wonderful views of the Hudson River and the New York skyline.  The service is excellent and the people-watching superb.  Please note that the bar is only accessible from the lobby, and you must show ID to the doorman.  (The bar is apparently a separate entity from the Hotel.)\n5.  I rise early, and the coffee in the lobby is good and plentiful.  We also enjoyed the water in the lobby in the afternoons.  (I  greedily filled my bottle several times.)\n6.  We had dinner in the Hotel restaurant on our final night.  The menu is a touch expensive and fancy for my pedestrian tastes, but we had a nice meal.  The host was very nice and pleasant.\n7.  I have only one negative aspect to report.  Our rooms faced North and were directly across from a rooftop bar, the oddly named Cantina Cantina.  It closed on Friday and Saturday night at about 3:30 am.  At one time, I might have joined the young revelers as they headed into the night laughing and having fun, but now, as I approach my dotage, I find sleep more inviting than late night shenanigans.  The Hotel obviously cannot control its neighbors, but you should certainly request a room on a different side of the building.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The young lady offered to text me when the room became available. Had not heard from her by 2:45 so we headed back from the Gotham Marketplace where we went for a bite to eat. Room became available as we were standing at counter waiting. I would also like to say that she (I neglected to get her name) was very pleasant. Our room the \"Hudson Suite\" was excellent. We did not have bathrobes (included in room). But after a phone call, the bathrobles arrived promptly. We were able to utilize both Print and the Press Lounge, I highly reccomend both of them! Be aware that the Press Lounge is often closed for private events, so check ahead of time. Upon check-out the following morning we were once again greeted by same young lady. She asked how our stay was. My reply, the property is lovely, room and staff were great all around. BUT...it is true, the noise that began early in the morning due to construction is HORRIBLE!

I booked two rooms through Hotels Tonight. I can say that I had a nice stay and enjoyed the hotel.

The front desk agent named Moustafa was very rude to me and friends during our entire trip. \n\nFrom the time we checked in, he was very rude and unprofessional.

The young lady that originally checked me in said that she can do what she could, then the gentleman interjected saying that check is at 3, he continue to insert himself in the conversation I was having with the young lady. The room I was checked into was 1001. Moustafa told myself and my friend who was checking into the second room that the room we were going to get was 1002, we asked if we can rooms next to each other. While we waited for the second room, I was in my room 1001. I called down to check on the status of the second room at this time it was 1:30. I called down to ask the status of the room and asked for new pillows for the room. He proceeded to lie to me over the phone and argue with me about the room, We were told repeatedly that 1002 was our second room, he proceeds to tell me that is not my room and the room I was getting was 1007. At 3:00 I proceeded down stairs and he gave us the keys to the room 1007, and I requested that I have pillows, it was not done when I first asked for them.\n\nHe was very malicious, when it came to making us wait until 3pm to check into the rooms. As someone who works in this industry, this is very unacceptable and unprofessional.\n\nMy guest and myself felt very uncomfortable after this first encounter. \n\nWhen we checked out, we asked for our bags to be held. When we returned to collect our bags, we had asked another young lady if anyone turned in sunglasses, one of my friends left them in the lobby. When we asked about the glasses, before even attempting to look, he once again interjected and said there were not any here. His delivery was sooo rude, all we asked were there any glasses left behind and look. He then began to argue with us again saying he was there all day. \n\nOverall the stay could have been better, I just feel that me and my guest were discriminated against from the beginning. I spent my money here for my birthday to be treated and talked to so nasty by one of your staff members.\n\nALSO, at check out I was charged an additional $53.00 \"service fee\". I was not informed about this charge and it is not posted anywhere on the website. This needs to be posted on your website and needs to be mentioned to guest at check in, if this is a such thing. After having $200 held on my card and then charged an additional fee was just the icing on the cake. \n\nI usually do not write reviews but I was very upset about my experience.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I opted into the last minute e-Upgrade and wound up with a FANTASTIC suite overlooking the river, the Intrepid and various cruise ships that were in NYC the weekend I was there.\n\nAside from that, let me say that the doorman, Jose, was super friendly and helpful as were Kelsey at the desk, the Front Desk Manager whose name escapes me but he did respond to my texts quickly, and my server in the restaurant when I stopped in for a snack.\n\nEveryone was really genuinely friendly and helpful.  My drinks were excellent, the room was spotless and comfortable (albeit a little noisy but it's a city, what do you expect!)  Coffee hour was on time, wine hour was a bit late (however, I was rewarded with some bonus points for patiently waiting, and adding a bit of humor too I guess).\n\nIt's amazing how much things can improve when you let the company know what they missed out on during prior stays.  Yes the hotel is pretty pricey but I snagged a really good rate by checking the Kimpton\/IHG site obsessively, daily!   \n\nThe hotel is close to a couple corner stores or bodegas\/delis and I actually grabbed a sandwich for dinner at Sunrise Market and it was pretty yummy.  \n\nInk 48 is walkable to the piers though it poured rain so that's not a walk that I'd take with luggage.

I checked in at 9pm to get a good night of sleep after the floors in my apt had been worked on.  I booked the reservation the American Express Platinum Services, which should have come with loads of perks and upgrades- none.  I was greeted by a rude man at the front desk who seemed to be bothered that he had to help me, insisting that I'd make the reservation only moments before I'd walked in the door.  That wasn't true, I'd made it at noon, but for some reason at 9pm the reservation still wasn't ready.  He offered me no information on the hotel, nothing. Just my room number. I was surprised to see the hotel has no Wifi, unless you pay $16 for it, more terrible service. My room was fine, absolutely nothing special, and tiny. I was not given an upgrade, nor was I offered one in this completely empty hotel.  Fine.  I went to sleep.  But what they failed to mention, was that the jackhammering across the street will wake you up at 7am.  They offered me earplugs when I called to complain.  They said I paid for a king room and that's what I got.  So no to this hotel, no to this service, no to this location and no to this staff.  One star all around.  I cannot believe how infuriating this is that NO ONE thought to tell their arriving guests that HALF the hotel rooms face this said construction!  HELLO!  Put me in a different room to begin with and we wouldn't have this problem!  OR at least forewarn me! Worst worst service ever.  I'm appalled.  I woke up at 7am, threw a fit and checked out at 7:10am. It isn't worth it. Not even for free.  I always put my clients in this hotel when they arrive to NYC.

Giant jackhammers (seriously, the size of bulldozers) start at 7am and do not relent until 5:30pm.

The rate is not cheap ($300+ per night plus all the taxes), but the value is evident in the quality of the towels, bath robes, bedding etc.  The area immediately surrounding the hotel is home to many low-rise businesses and so you get a great view of the waterfront and the city. It was easy to get to many attractions nearby by walking. There are plenty of great restaurants and museums nearby as well. I know some reviews have commented on noise, but we found that by putting the fan in the room on \"medium\" that the white noise generated masked the street noises. The meals we ate in the restaurant and drinks we had at the roof-top bar were pricey, but we were prepared for that.  The staff who I interacted with were helpful and friendly. I liked that they had complimentary coffee\/tea and papers out first thing in the morning. I didn't partake of the afternoon \"happy hour\" with complimentary wine, but there were people always crowded in that area so it was enjoyed by them.

I know much can happen in 5 years but this place is barely a shadow of what it used to be.  We were greeted coldly by a woman who wasn't even dressed like she worked at the hotel who begrudgingly gave us a high floor when we told her we got engaged at the hotel.  What she neglected to tell us was that it was right above the Press Lounge and that music would play until late at night.  We returned from dinner and immediately requested to be moved which took the better part of an hour to happen.  The new room was on a lower floor but was bigger and still had a nice view.  We were happy.  Until 7am the following morning when a horrible clanging and pounding started.  It was impossible to sleep once it started so I got up to look and right across the street the entire city block was a giant hole in the ground where they are constructing an office tower.  Several large machines were beating into the bed rock and others were lifting rock and moving it.  I placed my hand on the window and found it was a single pane of thin glass; completely worthless with no sound proofing.  I could have put my fist through it easily, that's how flimsy it was.  What kind of a hotel in Manhattan would not have sound proof windows??  I immediately called the desk and told them this was unacceptable and asked to speak to a manager.  Maybe there were dozens of other complaints but it took an hour and a half before a woman who said she was the hotel manager offered to move us to a suite that night.  That's the type of room we had stayed in before so I accepted and the hotel moved our things while we were out that day and when we got back the room looked wonderful.  We took a nap, went to see a show and have dinner and got back hoping to enjoy the room and a good night's sleep.  Until 10pm when a nightclub across the side street started playing music so loud we thought we were IN the club.  I called the desk and the agent told me they were aware of the problem but  the hotel was sold out and there were no rooms to move us to.  I asked to speak to a manager and when we spoke she offered to give us the night for free.  The problem was I didn't want a free night, I wanted to SLEEP.  We turned on the TV, the room fan, and tried to fall asleep which didn't really help much.  Then at 4am I thought there was a riot on the street.  As the nightclub let out we heard screaming, fights breaking out, and car horns blaring.  We were victims of the same poor windows in this suite, and the noise just kept going.  At this point I told my wife that I just wanted to go home so we packed up at 5am and left the hotel and we went to Grand Central to wait 2 hours for our train.  It was honestly much less noisy at the train station.  \n\nWhen a hotel cannot provide it's primary function which is to allow for a good nights sleep then that hotel should not be in business.  Ink48 seems to have taken a big fall in it's service standards and the noise is unacceptable and impossible to deal with.  The staff seemed not able to deal with the situation and we certainly did not experience any of the fun, joyous service that created such beautiful memories years ago.  All the managers and agents seemed tired, bored, and almost completely unconcerned.  I think that this hotel needs to close large areas of their rooms until the noise problems are fixed and they also need to make it very clear when people book what is going on because after this I will never stay there again.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I tried cooling down the room, but it was impossible. \n\nI went down to the counter and asked if I could be moved.

The bed was nice and there were blackout shades available. No additional couch, desk or dining table, but there was a small coffee table. My room had no tub, but there was a very energizing rain shower. Wifi speeds were pretty decent. Minibar was interesting - tons of local products, but still very expensive! No additional mini-fridge or cooler in room. \n\nFor being a hotel targeted to millennials, the lack of availability to link up your streaming services (Netflix, Hulu) to the TV is pretty lame. Otherwise, your only options are live TV channels. \n\nThere is free coffee in the morning and free wine in the evening - but no free breakfast or any other perks, although the resort fee includes a $10 credit for in-room or restaurant dining. \n\nHere are some other notes about the area: This hotel is in Hells Kitchen and is not the most \"touristy\" area in NYC. That can be a good thing because it's a bit more chill than staying in Times Square for example, but you do have to walk a bit if you want to get a drug store or a nice sit-down restaurant. There is a 24 hr. deli about a block away and a Halal cart that sets up shop at night. There are also some nightclubs and strip clubs adjacent to the hotel, if you are planning to bring family. \n\nAt the end of the day, I don't know if I would recommend or come back to Ink48. The room was comfortable, but nothing spectacular.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Due to our Platinum level IHG membership, we got upgraded to a Hudson river view suite. \n\nFirst arriving in the room, we felt we had hit the jackpot with our choice - the room was spacious with huge windows displaying a great view of the Hudson. Unfortunately, the great first impression was not lasting. \n\nWe were exhausted from our journey (9 hour flight) and were looking forward to a good nights sleep in our beautiful room. Unfortunately, the hotel is directly next to a rooftop restaurant AND a night club venue. For the first half of the evening we got to enjoy the latina music blasting from the rooftop restaurant, and then the night club was keeping us up until 3AM. The music was incredibly loud, and another testiment to the hotels lousy sound proofing is that after the club closed, we could literally hear people having conversations at street level - 9 floors below our room. Luckily the night club was not open any other night (only Sat-Sun) but the rooftop restaurant made sure that our evenings were filled with unwanted disturbance through 4PM-11PM almost every single day. \n\nBeyond the obvious issues with the noise level, the room was also not cleaned up to the standard you'd expect from a hotel of this level. The shower door was really dirty, as well as the bathroom counter showed toothpaste stains from the previous occupants when we checked in. The bathroom also had other problems, for one the tub would not hold water so we could not use it. The shower set up was the worst I've ever experienced; no hand-held shower at all (not in the shower nor the tub) and the jets on the wall were completely at the wrong height for a short person like myself. It was impossible to have a shower without getting your hair wet, since the highest of the body jets was literally spraying me in the face, and there was only the overhead jets as the other option. Not ideal when you just want to refresh a bit before going to dinner without ruining your hair in the middle of the day. I really can't understand how they've decided that this is a good set-up.\n\nAnother thing we found problematic is that the hotel does not offer breakfast. The restaurant downstairs does have an ala carte breakfast - but it's really expensive. You don't even get proper table service for the price (order at the counter and served to table), and since they only allow you to be seated in the bar area at breakfast, the tables are really not suited for eating. Our table was so tiny that just to fit two coffee cups and plates was almost impossible. We ended up eating at different places every single morning - but we do really prefer to start our morning nice and slow at a hotel breakfast, so we definitively missed having that. \n\nOverall, I don't think the hotel is worth the money we spent, especially because it was not the safe haven we would have needed after the days spent in the bustling city. Most of the staff was great though, my only complaint would be with the sometimes less than friendly gentlemen manning the door - who most often did not even greet us when passing. Unfortunately overall the hotel was a disappointment to us both.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This time, my husband surprised me by getting us an upgraded bath-spa suite. Unfortunately, the room was not clean, and thus uncomfortable.\n\nThe tub - the special feature of the room - had a large stain. The floor also had multiple stains. Hair was all over the floors and in the bed. A panel hung from the ceiling. The magazines in the room had food stains and scribbles on them. \n\nWe let the front desk know on our second day, not wanting to get anyone in trouble, but wanting the hotel to be aware. They had the room turned over, but not to much effect. Less hair this time, same food-stained magazines, I believe the ceiling panel was still loose, and obviously the stains on the tub and floor could not be addressed.\n\nWe never heard any follow-up from the hotel. I was surprised we were not offered a different room (they could have been full). I was surprised that they offered a stained bath in a bath suite, it was gross. \n\nThis was similar to our first Ink48 experience. At that time, I emailed them after our visit, but the conversation went nowhere. We were willing to give it another try this time because of my past great experiences at other Kimpton locations (pre-buyout, perhaps this is a factor).

I am a platinum IHG member because I love Kimpton and will stay at their properties any chance I get. I was excited to experience this hotel in Hell's Kitchen.  Unfortunately, I faced some extremely undesirable circumstances -- some they could have controlled and others they could not have.\nI arrived at the property to face over 30 dogs in the lobby.  Yes, I discovered, the Westminister Dog Show was in town.  I love dogs.  However, I could not get a seat for the wine hour because dogs were on the furniture, a drooling rotweiler was next to the only open seat and several boisterous dogs were barely under control.  Not their fault as a dog friendly property, but suggesting that dogs be kept in the room for the one hour a day there was a hosted wine reception could have mitigated the chaos, including several \"accidents\" on the lobby floor I encountered.  \nNext, I got an \"upgraded\" room looking directly out over major construction.  Only after the 7AM start of hydraulic drilling the next day was there any discussion with me about the construction.  The person behind the desk, rather than engaging, pointed to a printed sign on the desk offering earplugs.  I was not offered a room away from the construction nor was there an ounce of acknowledgment or empathy.\nOn my third day, at 4AM a barking dog persisted until 6AM.  I fell asleep just long enough to be awoken again by 7AM hydraulics.  I went to the front desk to complain and was met by a shrug and told, \"The dogs will be gone tomorrow.\"\nCleanliness wise, the hair I found on my shower floor the first day was there until I finally removed it myself on the third day. \nFrom a practical standpoint, although not about Kimpton per se, there was one day I was there in very inclement weather involving slush and sleet and hazardous walking conditions. If you have not had a chance to bring your own water and snacks, you will pay mightily for the mostly-junk mini-bar because there is no gift shop or nearby bodega for such things. \nIn my (at least) tens of trips to Kimpton over the years, and particularly as a platinum customer, I have never felt that my business mattered so little.  I hope this was because of the chaos of the dog show, but I also wish I had been warned of that and the construction.

The bathroom had both a bathtub and a walk in shower, and the rain shower had side spraying water massage option, an unexpected surprise.

He deserves special kudos for his customer service. Although I came in contact with only a few other employees during my stay, he presented the hotel well.  The wine hour attendant was also very pleasant.\nHousekeeping & Maintenance- Excellent.  The room was immaculate, and the bathroom couldn\u2019t have been any cleaner. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, facial tissues, and toilet paper were in adequate supply for single day stays. The carpet, windows, walls, window coverings, and decorations were in great shape.\nPool\/Gym: Not evaluated\nBreakfast\/Meal Options-.While we did not have a meal at the restaurant, the options presented were tempting, although not inexpensive.  The Presse Lounge upstairs was very nice.  The skyline views were very appealing, as were the drinks. Two drinks cost us $37, which was notable. \nLaundry- Not evaluated. The prices were appropriate for the venue.\nComputer\/Printer\/WiFi- Excellent. WiFi was strong throughout the hotel. Streaming video was a breeze.\nProperty Appearance- Very Good\nExterior- The property was branded effectively, and the entrance and lobby was very well cared for. A bar that neighbors the hotel is a serious detractor.\nInterior- Excellent. Stylish and well maintained is a clear standard for this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

(Why is it so hard for hotels to allocate rooms on a sensible basis?). On the first night it became clear that noise from a nightclub across the road on West 48th Street side was a real problem - the club is at roof level (about 5th floor of the hotel) and obviously loud music can be heard but also at closing time the noise at street level is really loud and included that night police in attendance etc! we asked to be moved and the 2nd floor room was changed to 9th floor same side - this was much better and a better view too! They could not change the other room as we had asked for twin beds and none were available...The next night same problems so I asked to change room and got a City View Studio King. This was on the 11th Avenue and 10th floor - finally quiet! The rooms are good and well designed for the price. If we had been in these rooms at the start it would have been a very good stay. The double glazing is not good enough. The staff are great, rooftop bar cool and the restaurant really good (tho not cheap).

To me this is a 2-3 star hotel at best, not a 4.5 star.  We were given a room on the second floor that was under the bar\/restaurant.  This would have been fine if you plan to stay up until the bar closes, but if you want to get some sleep before 3 a.m. it was a very poor room. We heard people talking, the blender turning on and off etc.  The next morning we asked to be moved and they told us to pack up, head out for the day and they would move our things between 1:00 and 3:00.  We came back to the room around 3:00 our things were still there.  We had to change clothes so we had to open up our suitcases again, then repack.  We left and returned after 8:00 p.m.  Our bags were still there.  We asked and they said our room was ready so we happily moved our own things.  The room itself was basic.  Once again, not a 4.5 star room.  Very very small, no hooks to hang wet towels,( we hung ours over the lamp), no desk, no chair, extremely small vanity, no place to put our suitcases.  You could put your suitcase next to the bed and not be able to get out of the bed on that side or choose to keep it on the floor by the door so you can't open the door all the way.  We would have put it on the luggage stand, but that would have blocked the only mirror outside of the bathroom.  Once again, this hotel was fine for a 2-3 star, but definitely not a 4.5 star hotel.  The best word I can use to describe this hotel is basic.  If you are looking for nothing special and a very cramped very poorly planned out room design that is loud, then stay at Ink48.  Otherwise, for the price find another hotel.  The roof top bar is very cool, but that's the only good thing I can say about this place.  I would never stay here again and I do not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for something above a 2-3 star hotel.  Extremely disappointed.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I dig the modern, cool vibe of the brand. After a recent stay at Hotel Eventi, another Kimpton in NYC, I wanted to try a different one. Happened to catch a crazy sale being offered at certain Kimpton properties, including Ink48. Especially for the rate I paid (on a Saturday night) I can't get over the value of this place. Regular king room was HUGE (for NYC standards). Vaulted ceilings?! Very bright, very well appointed (not a frequenter of hotel room mini bars but if you are, you won't be disappointed). Impressed with the list of items on the \"did you forget these?\" list displayed in the bathroom. Ha.\n\nTook advantage of the valet parking -- at $65 plus tax for my SUV I'm sure I could have found a lower rate somewhere else, but you are NOT going to beat the convenience of literally pulling up to the hotel right off the West Side Highway. No stress whatsoever. They say to give them 45 minutes when you need your car at checkout; it took nowhere near that long. All I had to do was inform the front desk that I was ready for my car, and a few minutes later, it was waiting for me outside the hotel doors. \n\nBellmen and front desk employees were exceptional. So warm and welcoming. In general, just fantastic hospitality at this property. Love the infused water in the lobby. There was also complimentary coffee and happy hour; we did not partake this time but will on a future visit. \n\nDid not make it to the restaurant or the rooftop bar on this visit. Really appreciated the fact that they kept hotel guest access and rooftop bar access separate at night (roped off elevator access); felt more secure that way.\n\nOne thing I can't get over: there was turn down service. I can't remember the last time I stayed at a hotel in NYC and received turn down service! It was such a pleasant surprise to come \"home\" to after a long day and night out. #littlethings\n\nI missed the Kimpton \"raid the minibar\" perk (I usually go for the snacks!) -- this time it was $30 off a spa service. Nice, but who has time on a quick trip to the city for a spa treatment? ;-) Nervous about how the the Kimpton rewards program is evolving since its takeover. We shall see. So far, still a devoted Kimpton-goer.\n\nIf you're looking for a stylish, service-oriented hotel away from the typical NYC crazy (which is only about 15-minute walk away), this is the hotel for you.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

You have it all here, and more.  Our first encounter with Stephen Field illustrates the Kimpton draw; a front desk and concierge manager who knows the local places to see and to eat, because he lives in the neighborhood, and his suggestions never let us down.  A small room selection glitch could have been major for us, but without hesitation, he took it in stride, eased concerns and just \"got it done\" without fuss or drama. Being a busy Christmas season, and fully booked, we didn't old out much hope, but were so grateful when it worked out for us.  I watched him consistently serve many guests; he was kind, patient, and above all, a careful listener to what people really wanted or needed, regardless of the request.  Not to miss the others, the entire staff, from help with the car, the room attendants (who  made it lovely to stay) and the onsite restaurant Print servers all did their part in welcoming us into a GREAT NYC stay. And did I mention the lovely wine hour at 5 pm?  (My only suggestion would be to have SOMETHING to nibble....even if just one thing).  I have stayed many times in NYC for work and play, but haven't found many places that achieve the easy atmosphere of understated luxury, at a great price, This is one of those.\n\nSadly we only saw the rooftop bar, and did not partake of the cocktails but you will NOT REGRET the view if you go there.  Another hidden perk!\n\nYes, as others mentioned, there is some noise on 11th Ave, with a lot of construction; but they seem to have soundproofed the lobby, which made it a lot cozier than I thought it would be.  And if you stay in NYC these days you know it is the City of Cranes, and you will likely encounter construction anywhere.  Nothing about this put us off, or made it less enjoyable.   \n\nSo, get ready to romp in the city, and come home to a warm, inviting place to rest and relax, in the lobby, in your room, in the bar.

We deliberately tried to forget these and take a positive attitude, even when we realised on arrival our 6th floor room overlooked the bar. Our check-in on Wednesday 21st after an extremely day was smooth and made us feel very welcome at the hotel. \n\nFollowing an evening watching the excellent Jersey Boys show, we returned to our room (608)and realised it was quite noisy but accepted this as being in a City. Also, it wasn\u2019t any different to the volume of sirens and car hooters sounding, \n\nHaving managed to get to sleep around 11pm we were abruptly awoken by the sound of screaming, shouting, fighting and some really colourful language! It was so loud that it sounded like it was only just outside the room, not 6 floors down. We tried to pass this off as a one-off, but some 30 minutes later was just getting louder and was followed by the sound of numerous sirens as police and paramedics arrived. Frankly after a full days travel, enough was enough.\n\nI went to the reception area and spoke with the night receptionist, Mostofe (apologies if incorrect) and explained the issue. We cannot praise his proactive and positive response enough, even considering in moving our room if we would be more disturbed by the elevators. He was a real STAR! Having agreed to move rooms we went back, packed and Mostafe then sent up the bellman with the keycards to the new room (802). We understand the room was an upgrade and was at no extra charge; the bathtub was most welcome after standing and watching the coldest parade ever. Even after making these arrangements and moving at 2am in the morning, Mostafe was inviting us the speak with him if we had any issues and made us aware when he would be working. \n\nIn that interaction, Mostafe displayed an immense level of customer service which reflects in a massive positive light for your company. If we\u2019re honest, before 2am on that morning we would be unlikely to stay, or provide recommendations, to stay in future.

After stellar stays at the Muse and the Eventi, this was our first time trying out their Hell\u2019s Kitchen location, and in spite of some reviews decrying the noise level (something that has never really bothered me) we wanted to see how this compared. \nWith magnificent views (depending on your room) of either the city or the river, the Ink 48, with its printing press theme and elegantly abstract book photos, leaves its mark on each guest. The room was bright and airy, the bed a little bit of heaven, and an extensive cocktail and snack collection as on hand for anyone who wanted such amenities. \nThings sorely beyond the control of management include a very noisy club across the street, which reached decibels that easily rose to our rooms (912 and 914) which kept my husband awake until after 3 AM. Our parents were next door, and were also kept awake through the night, so it wasn\u2019t a case of light sleepers. Kimpton mollified the sleepless night with a slight discount, but anyone looking for a sound slumber may want to check into other room options to find something quieter. \nDespite this one major drawback, the Kimpton magic was in full effect, from the care the employees took to ask at every opportunity whether there was anything else we needed, to their signature wine hour from 5 to 6 PM. Setting this location apart from others is the popular Press Lounge on the 16th floor, where sweeping views of the city may be found when it\u2019s open to the public (there was a private event on the second night we were there, so if the lounge is important to you, be sure to check ahead \u2013 and even then it might be booked as they said there were a large number of events held in the space).","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I opted for an upgrade to a City View Studio King (which are supposed to be floors 6-15), and requested a higher floor.  My room was on the 5th floor, which isn't even supposed to be an option.  Upon arriving in my room, there was a plate of treats and a bottle of wine to welcome someone entirely different.  Our room had  great view of the demolition of the building directly across from us, which you couldn't miss because the noise started promptly at 8:00 each morning.  (Not the hotel's fault, but no advance warning, and rubbed the fact that my request for a higher floor went nowhere.)  Was looking forward to the rooftop bar upon arrival, but it was closed for a private party.  Despite leaving the \"privacy\" sign up the next day, housekeeping came in and did their thing anyway.  Waited 20 minutes for complimentary coffee station the in lobby to be refilled before just giving up. Food service was slow both in the restaurant for breakfast, and at the walk-up breakfast bar the next day.\nI can't reconcile the great first stay that I had with the very disappointing (and much more expensive) second (and last) stay. It's great to be out of the midtown hustle, but not worth the disappointment in almost every other facet.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have spent 15 years in hospitality and can be a bit of a pain when staying at a hotel in or outside of NYC.  I know what to expect and am always truly excited wne a hotel can meet up to my very high standards.  \n\n This year I have had some personal reasons that have forced me to stay at hotels in my own city. After going to numerous properties I have truly found my HOME HOTEL.  Kimpton's Ink 48 is by far my favorite property in all of NYC.  The staff, the rooms, the style and the vibe make for a PET FRIENDLY and casual upscale stay.  \n\nWith so many superstar employees (Go HR!) it is hard to name a few standouts.  Elijah was the 1st superstar that I met more than 6 months ago when checking into this property.  The day I checked in I had a very traumatic life experience and he went above and beyond to make sure that my stay was perfect.  Besides the amazing upgrade the entire front desk staff asked me daily if I was feeling better and even offered personal help.  It is very tough to be vunerable to people you don't know and as a NYer we find it to be almost tragic to have to need compassion on any level.  The staff here did it in a way where it never felt like pity but they truly cared about my health and well being. \n\nAs life returned to normal I still continued to find a night away at ink48 to be a refresher every busy NYer needs.  I own and run a non-profit theater company for the Make-A-Wish Foundation along with my full time concierge job and am a caretaker for 2 parents in Upstate NY.  A night away in my own city is truly the only vacation I get sometimes.  \n\nAfter that 1st night my new \"family\" at Ink48 continues to impress me.  From overnight to evening shifts the staff is honest, respectful,, formal and professional every step of the way.  Naomi in reservations follows up on stays and even texts me to follow up  and confirm reservations.  Gwyan the Front Office Manager is a genuis.  He allows his staff to be successful and gives them the  freedom to grow these relationships and in turn make more business for the property.  \n\nKimpton should be proud of Ink48. They have created a GEM and I hope it never changes.  \n\nDid I mention the rooms are amazing and spacious and they have a rooftop that's views are the best I have ever seen.  \n\nBellstand, Room Service, Housekeeping, Security.  All Five Star.  A few properties in the area should take some lessons from the managers and HR at Ink48.  \n\nIf you have a choice of where to stay take a chance on this boutique hotel and I promise you will not regret it.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

Some aspects of the hotel are faultless but there is definite room for improvement in other areas.\n\nUpon arrival at this hotel you will be welcomed by very friendly doormen - always happy to help and always very cheerful. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the reception staff, who are rather unhelpful and extremely disorganised (more on this later!)\n\nBoth rooms I stayed in were clean and modern. If you're here on business some of the rooms aren't great for working in (very tiny tables, and the 'business center' in the hotel seemed to consist of a sofa and a few stools around a table). Additionally some of the rooms face a rather loud bar, with music going on until 3am or so at weekends. As I was so exhausted I was able to sleep through the noise, but I know some others in the hotel really struggled with this.\n\nOn my first trip to Ink48 I misplaced a denim jacket. I left this on the rooftop and, despite reporting it to lost property just a couple of hours later, it was not find. I have to take some responsibility here for being careless, but the hotel didn't seem all that willing to assist and I wasn't able to get up to the roof myself because it was closed and then there was a private party (these seem to happen frequently - so don't just expect to be able to visit the rooftop bar whenever you want!)\n\nOn my second trip to Ink48 one of my colleagues gave the front desk some extremely important documents, which our boss was to collect at 5.30am the next morning (it was around 11pm when said documents were handed over). Over the course of the next few hours the front desk managed to lose said documents and, in fact, never seemed to find them. These were clearly labelled with 'FAO: Name of person, Room number'. This was hugely inconvenient and stressful for all involved as it meant a number of us re-printing the documents at 5.30am. The hotel didn't ever issue any sort of apology or compensation for the inconvenience caused.\n\nThe hotel asks for a guarantee of 100 USD per nights stayed I believe. I put somebody else guarantee on my room (as they did not have the funds immediately available) but specifically asked for this persons room bill to be put on their own card, not mine. Upon checking out the hotel informed my colleague that the bill had been settled. It was only after I got home that I realised a total of 120 GBP or so had been added to my card. This was extremely frustrating and, even more so, as when we challenged the bill it appeared that Ink48 had added on an extra 50 GBP accidentally (we're still not quite sure how!)\n\nOverall, the hotel is a pleasant place and touches like the wine hour are great. However, the overall service is fairly poor and there is definite room for improvement.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We soon discovered why.  Our junior suite provided sweeping views of a fleet of Verizon service trucks and little else.\n\nAnother visit to the front to desk to ask if we could switch rooms was met with a curt \"I'm very sorry.  I do apologize.\"\n\nNo matter, this is a big, beautiful city.  We'll make the best of it, right?\n\nA wonderful birthday dinner and drinks with friends complete with a bouquet of flowers brought back to our suite to enjoy!  A quick call to the concierge to arrange for a vase to keep them was met with a curt reply that this hotel with a bar and restaurant had zero vases in stock along with \"I'm very sorry.  I do apologize.\"  No solution offered, but a pattern was emerging here...\n\nA quick trip up to the top floor to enjoy a drink and take in the view sounded great!  We we met by a gentleman at the ground floor, who could not look up from his phone long enough to tell us that the top floor was closed for the evening, but we did get the now familiar \"I'm very sorry.  I do apologize.\"\n\nBy the time our stay had come to an end, we'd had our fill.  The young lady handling our departure asked how our stay was, to which I replied how lovely it had been.  I don't think either one of us could handle any more saccharine apologies.\n\nThis place is Kimpton in name only.  Some views might be great, others not so much.  The rooms are adequate, but your experience here clearly appears to be a roll of the dice.  As for us, we'll vote with our feet and enjoy Manhattan elsewhere next time, and would encourage you to do the same!\n\nPlease enjoy the pics of our view and our homemade vase fashioned on the spot from a plastic water bottle to spruce things up!

The first thing to note is so many people are complaining about the noise from the club.  If you are a smart traveler and do your research before spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars on a hotel then you would have read about the noise (which is out of the hotels control) and find another hotel that suits your needs!  Also for those who complained about the location of this hotel you would know that it is about a 15 min to 20 min walk to the subway (from other reviews and gooogle maps) so please stop complaining when you have the choice to book where you want yo stay! We booked this location knowing it was right on the river, away from all the craziness and perfect for Intrepid\/Chelsea Piers boating activities and a 15 min taxi ride from the World Trade Observatory. \nEvery employee who we encountered were so kind, friendly and attentive to all our needs.  Maybe all these people who give such awful reviews walk around with frowns on their faces all day and who wants to be nice to Scrooge? \nThanks for the iced coffee every morning, free wine at 5, letting my dog stay for free, spacious rooms (compared to most NY hotels),  spectacular views, comfortable bed, refreshing bath amenities and most importantly the staff who made our stay so hospitable! \nSumo misses everyone at Ink48!

Here's my feedback:\n \n1) Receptionist were lovely. He allowed us to check in earlier, and was super friendly with our baby. However, that evening the receptionist seem to have changed and were not as friendly - maybe in the evening, you need to give off the moody vibe lol \n\n2) I fully respect that we are given rooms that are available, but I called two weeks ahead of time to book a room thats not near the club noise. Our little baby kept waking up. I'm really disappointed that the receptionist did not think of this when checking us in seeing as it is an ongoing problem. \n\n3) The lobby is always full of people who do not actually stay at the hotel. Waiting to get up to the rooftop was frustrating, and trying to get through the crowds of people was hard, especially trying to get through a throng of young merry people with a stroller. \n\n4) Loved PRINT. The food was yummy and the service was great. \n\n5) HATED ROOM SERVICE. We spent $150 for room service as there were 3 of us. I'm not cheap, and was willing to spend that much as we were celebrating. But the food was terrible. It was salty, the chips were burnt and my bread came up soggy. They also did not give any water (which nearly all hotels do). And please do not get me started on our 'cheese plate'. It's embarrassing that they felt this was worthy to be served to people who had pay over $400 on a room and then a further $150 on dinner. Its places like this that make you feel angry - charging people a lot of money for terrible food.\n\n6) There are NO kid friendly channels. Or any good channels for that matter.\n\n7) We got disturbed twice by the maids. Once was at 11.30am (half an hour before check out) whilst I was in the shower. Please, just leave us alone unless we need something. The other time the doorbell woke our baby up. We DID put up the do not disturb. \n\n8) Bring you own body wash - this brand of wash takes away any bit of moisture may have! \n\n9) Appreciate the anniversary gift that was given to us - that was a nice touch. \n\nWe had such high hopes here, and we are so sad that we spent a milestone at this hotel.

The hotel runs private functions on the rooftop and the entire time we were there it was reserved for others. The rooftop bar seemed to attract a very young crowd, which also generated extra noise, people and sometimes messy drunks.  The hotel is very noisy due to constant sirens and traffic but that may be common in New York (don't know).  My biggest gripe would be the staff.  Unfortunately most seemed to need further training in what hospitality actually means and carried an attitude.

A recap of my experiences. I booked two rooms for a friday night in late august. We arrived at 3am due to a flight delay. Upon checking in, he treated us as if we were sketchy people, ironic because I spend 80+ nights a year with IHG. I asked him if there were any complimentary, he smiled at me and said no- although I checked on my phone and saw that there was availability. He also said, hey it looks like one of your rooms isn't pre-paid I need to run your credit card again- both rooms were prepaid so I asked him if the charge was for incidentals. He said no and kept making me feel like I was wrong. Upon checking into the room I noticed it was not only extremely small relative to NY standards but that the shower had a few hairs that weren't cleaned. It was kind of disgusting considering that is supposed to be a luxury hotel. Furthermore, the AC sounds like a tank and it was impossible to sleep at all- literally the loudest AC I think that I have ever experienced. The next morning when we were planning to check out my GF if they had any lint rollers\/anti-static, in the bathroom there was this sheet that said it was one of the items that the front desk offered. So I called house keeping, they said they would get back to me shortly. An hour and half later they responded saying sorry we don't. So much for a listed amenity. Finally upon checking out there was no accountability for any of their wrongdoing, in fact the bellman accused me of loosing my luggage tag, when he had never given me one. I am not one to really write reviews but this experience was beyond terrible.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I wanted to love Ink48, I really did, but reality fell short of my expectations.  Honestly, I feel like I wasted a LOT of points to stay here.\n\nThe location, just a block or so from the Manhattan cruise piers was perfect for my needs.  I was in town to check out a new cruise ship and staying here was a great choice.\n\nI arrived early and didn't expect my room to be ready so I checked my bags and set out to explore for a few hours.  Once I got back, I still waited another hour or more for my room.  Granted, I was upgraded to a nice junior suite with a river view so I was ok with the wait though the staff could have at least given the appearance of being proactive in getting my room ready.  To me, it looked like they were not making an effort to expedite the room and nothing like that was communicated to me, just that the room wasn't ready.\n\nOnce I got to the room, it was fine although maybe I expected the junior suite to wow me a little more.  The front of the sofa was ripped, and the tear is very noticeable. One of the overhead lamps seemed to have been turned off at the light bulb as I was not able to find any way to get it to turn on without first jiggling the bulb.  Then it was able to be controlled with the ALL ON\/ALL OFF switch.\n\nI was walking around the room barefoot and the carpet in front of the a\/c unit was soaked.  That wasn't very pleasant to discover.  As a former housekeeping manager, I notice cleanliness or lack thereof.  My room was clean BUT the bathroom had a lot of dust in corners and some mold in the grout near the bathtub.  Not cool and NOT normal Kimpton standards.\n\nThe doors to enter the property are VERY heavy and NOT automatic.  The doormen were often nowhere to be found, or otherwise chatting and not paying attention. Either get more doormen to open these doors for guests, or change the main doors so that they open on their own.  \n\nI wanted to visit the rooftop bar and was able to once it opened but, as a guest, to have to go all the way to the lobby, through the rope line, past 3 burly security people at 4 PM made me want to NOT bother.  I'm glad I made the cut.  Sheesh, I really felt out of place going up to the Press Lounge at 4 PM on a cloudy Sunday afternoon to look around.\n\nOverall I was not really pleased with the staff.  When, after retrieving my luggage after the ship tour, I asked if they had any bottled water, the desk clerk said no, just the cups and water dispensers.  So as I was loading my luggage, I said that I was going to run to the dirty water hot dog cart for some water.  The doorman said, \"wait, I'll get you some!\"  Obviously, the hotel DOES have bottled water and the desk clerk could have given me one, heck I'd have paid for it too!\n\nI was really NOT happy that the AM coffee service was 45 minutes late.  The solution was for the desk clerk to tell me to go out to some coffee shop.  I didn't want to go out, but I did and $3.50 later I had a coffee.  Really??  It's COFFEE!! It's Kimpton's 'thing' as is wine hour, which they managed to get going only 1 minute late.  Why they were unable to get the coffee ready at 6:30 AM is beyond me.  It's not rocket science.  The hotel is staffed all night.  Make some coffee!\n\nThe hotel is rather dark inside and would benefit from brightening the place up.  All of the couches in the lobby have floppy cushions and they've tried to keep them attached by adding velcro.  Well, this doesn't work, nor does having the lobby housekeeper only fluff 2 of 4 cushions on each couch.  That's just being lazy and by the way, it's not nice to get stuck to the velcro.  Back to square one.\n\nI did have a cocktail at the bar, and even though the \"bartender\" was actually one of the servers, she managed to follow the recipe I had on my phone for a cocktail and it was excellent.  However, if you're going to have a bar open, pay a bartender!  \n\nSo, while the Ink48 is a nice hotel in a great location near the pier (and not too far from the train station), I was really not wowed and certainly didn't feel the Kimpton Love. I spent a lot of points to stay here and in hindsight, I should have either paid for the room, or stayed at the Marriott Marquis.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

Except, that they've taken out a real desk and proper chair you can work at which I always need to do on a business trip. You have a round stool and round table, like a coffee table instead.\n\nThe location is so-so, (except if you want to visit the Intrepid aircraft carrier which is around the corner!). It's not close to the subway, which is fine as we have Uber, but it is the wrong end of town for the airports.\n\nStaff are professional. Coffee \/ tea in the morning is OK. Evening wine is a poor affair with cheap wine, limited choice, and an area the size of a cupboard to sit in. Slight exaggeration but not much. Wifi and gym are good. AC works well and is quiet.\n\nThe top floor has a very large, impressive bar\/ restaurant where all the beautiful people of NYC gather at night. It's great, impressive skyline view, but beware can make the lobby area very busy and there is noise you can hear from your room.\n\nTip, if you want exercise not in the gym, you can walk to the High Line from the hotel and the High Line is a great walk, especially early morning when it is not busy (and cooler in summer).\n\nOverall I recommend this hotel. Quality of room and staff is very good. I think it's a great leisure \/ vacation hotel for singles \/ friends or a couple (not family with kids) and would happily return for that. I won't stay here for future business trips.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel itself is lovely. Our room was sleek, modern and spotless. The Press Lounge is great for a rooftop view of the city. Drinks are expensive, but that is to be expected. The location of the hotel is not convenient, if you are looking for that. The nearest subway is at least a 10-15 minute walk, but we knew this when we booked. The only complaint I had was that there is a rooftop bar across the street that is open very late and is very loud. Street noise is also loud due to lots of nearby construction. The Intrepid is a block away and that was perhaps the only nearby attraction we enjoyed. We did experience a lack in housekeeping our second night there, as we noticed housekeeping didn't restock our bathroom appropriately.

It's my first choice when planning any destination where these hotels are located.  I chose Ink48 because of its price relative to the other Kimptons in Manhattan.\n\nThis is really the first time I have ever stayed at a Kimpton where I felt they had become \"corporate\" since becoming part of IHG.\n\nI had some initial reservations about booking here due to its location from Times Square, where I knew we were going to be spending most of our time on this trip.  It is a short walk from Times Square, a little less than 20 minutes.  But when it's in the high 80's and low 90's, that walk isn't very pleasant.  Especially if you're dressed a little better than t-shirt and shorts.  But, if you're there for a cruise, I would imagine it's very convenient.\n\nThe room was fine.  Not much of view and very very very white.\n\nI have communicated to the management the condition of lobby with empty drinks strewn about and the water pitchers constantly being empty.\n\nThe wine hour, a defining Kimpton perk, really didn't seem to be a big deal at this hotel.  with no one there to pour when it began, much less have a smiling face there to do it.\n\nMorning coffee, another Kimpton staple, which you have to go down to the lobby to get, was constantly empty.  It's location also meant that front desk staff had to constantly be informed that the coffee was out.  So there was a wait while someone came and refilled the coffee pots.\n\nTo me, there just didn't seem to be the friendly smiling faces with that personal touch that I've come to really appreciate about staying in a Kimpton.\n\nLot's of folks have had good experiences here so I'm not suggesting this hotel is one you shouldn't consider; however, for my family's stay, they whiffed on our stay.\n\nI have stayed at Hotel Eventi (another Kimpton) and while this one might actually be a little closer to Times Square (if you're there to see shows like we were),my experience there was much better than here.\n\nNot to mention the rooftop bar at Ink48 seemed to have a quirky dress code.  We were actually intimidated about wanting to go up there. And I still don't understand why hotels with that feature don't do more to make it something guests at the hotel can have easier access too.  Not to mention, it's a great place for the wine hour!  My .02 anyway.\n\nThank you to the Manager for writing me personally when I originally provided my feedback and I truly appreciate the comments made to me.  I hope they have addressed my concerns.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms are spacious and beautifully designed.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":1158753,"title":"Reservations Should Come with this Warning","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-07-15","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"We love the room and it\u2019s spaciousness and the views even from our fourth floor northwest corner room are outstanding.  The bathroom is huge and the high ceilings are a plus. The bed is comfortable and the room has a cozy feel in spite of feeling large for a NYC regular non-suite hotel space. The coffee station in the morning is among the best I have ever experienced or tasted and the rooftop deck is just about the largest I have been to in NYC with spectacular views. I would recommend you come here ... \n\nhowever, allow me to give you some public warnings ahead of time to address the issues that have been well documented on Trip Advisor.  \n\nHad I read the reviews here prior to booking the hotel, we would have either done things differently, or more likely, we would have stayed elsewhere.  \n\n1. The most important thing you should know is that the hotel management is fully aware of the noise and clearly is not doing the following:\n\nA. Notifying hotel guests about the absolute and essential need for earplugs and a sound machine to drown out the chanting, screaming, loud fighting, noisy car leaping\/jumping, and clearly and unbelievably raucous intoxicated partiers who exit the nightclub from the 48th Street side.  I was informed by the night auditor that the management calls the nightclub hourly but I saw no one from the club outside to deal with the behavior. Having worked closing shifts from after hours nightclubs myself, what I see lacking here is a security presence for the revelers.  Being aware of the problem and doing nothing about their own safety in the streets makes everyone liable for their well being as well as the ability for anyone to sleep on the lower floors of those on the 48th side of the hotel. I should have done some phone video to show you just how bad the noise is and how unruly the partiers are.  No written review alone can truly prepare you for what you will encounter here. \n\nB. The only thing management is doing is to apologize after the fact and say they are doing something but they have not been able to accomplish anything since these issues were apparently published starting in 2016. I called tonight and there was nothing the auditor offered to me except to inform the night manager. I called the hotel prior to posting this review because I believe in communicating with a hotel before writing something negative on this site. It\u2019s the same courtesy I would expect were the shoe on the other foot. \n\n2. Of lesser import, be aware that unless you are taller than us, we are short at 5\u20194\u201d and 5\u20195\u201d, you will not be able to reach the shower head to move it because it is super tall. Never have I ever encountered a shower head in my entire life that was placed so high that I could not manage to move the shower head without leaping. It was originally positioned to displace half of the water against the wall.  Who is going to call the front desk once you discover this when you are already wet and naked?  Not I. I chose to use what little athleticism I possess in my middle age to attempt to get water directly on my head. \n\n3. The management still has not any outside door people, which would be fine for me and for probably most guests who don\u2019t care to have a door person were it not for the heaviest front doors I have ever encountered at a hotel.  They have known about this challenge for their guests for well over 18 months and have not installed lighter doors, or a push button door opening system. Tomorrow morning I will report back if I even see a sign in case someone does not have the ability to get into the hotel on their own. What would someone do if they had mobility issues aside from waiting for a well mannered hotel guest to assist them?\n\n4. Although the Kimpton developers put some excellent features in the building which are quite nice, they have yet to address what I consider non standard windows on the lower floors.  Having lived on the second floor of a NYC condo on 6th Avenue near 23rd, I know what street noise sounds like. And I am comfortable with it. I have been a major city dweller since 1989.  Thing is, these windows at Kimpton Ink48 block nothing short of about 10 decibels and I am not exaggerating. There has been ample time for management to address the sound and it makes me wonder if they do not believe the expense will provide any return on their investment. I think it should improve their guests\u2019 stays and ultimately their return visit rate. \n\nSo there you have it. My warnings about the place coupled with the amazing features of the hotel. If you are fully able, taller than 5\u201910, comfortable with extremely loud noise, stay in any room at this hotel and not to worry, you will five-star this place in a jiffy. I have to agree with the other posters who notice or mention that they feel this hotel is geared toward the younger or the party set.  Read some of the other observations and you will understand what I mean.  We are 40 and 49 and neither of those. \n\nMy recommendation is only to stay on a floor level above 12 and on the west side of the building facing the Hudson River. My fellow Kimpton Ink48 reviewers are probably right that the higher floors and the west side, mostly if not entirely, remove the biggest problem (the partiers\u2019 noise) and the sole reason I was immensely motivated to write out our frustrations at 4:30 in the morning. \n\nSo, yes. Do stay at this hotel but please heed our warnings. Thank you for reading my review.  I really didn\u2019t enjoy writing this but felt that I had to.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I arrived at 8 pm, tired from a journey from Europe. The front desk attendant was surprised to find that the room I was slated to occupy had never been vacated. Odd that they only discovered this at 8 pm. He offered me a free upgrade to a suite, and a $150 credit, which I reluctantly accepted as it had a river view and I much preferred the city view.

We are normally fans of Kimpton hotels, but this one didn't deliver.\n\nThe doorman was only sporadically available, and when he was there, held the door open barely enough to squeeze a suitcase through, rather than making it easy for guests to enter. We held the door for others numerous times when he wasn't there. \n\nThe maid service was really spotty \u2014 dirty drinking glasses were not removed, bathmat was not replaced, toilet cleaner was left in the toilet.\n\nHeat from the enclosed minibar left the snacks and drinks atop the bar very warm to the touch \u2014 not a big deal for Oreos, but surely not good for the small bottles of alcohol, left to slow-roast for who knows how long. \n\nThe roomy walk-in shower had only one small soap dish, which was not nearly big enough to hold soap, shampoo, conditioner, etc. With plenty of space, why not make it easier for people to put the items they need while showering within reach? Do the people who design hotel bathrooms ever attempt to use them? \n\nFinally, the doorman who had promised to have a ride waiting for us at 3 p.m. did not, and had apparently misunderstood the conversation. This delay mean my husband had to run a meeting via conference call en route to the airport, rather than in a lounge at the airport -- not ideal.\n\nWe mentioned the housekeeping and minibar issues when checking out, and the person at the desk removed the charges for a couple of minibar items, but didn't offer anything else and didn't really seem to care. \n\nAll in all, we were both disappointed in this hotel, and in their response to our issues.

This meant that on several occasions we got in the lift (dressed for dinner\/cocktails) and then found ourselves sharing the lift with the large industrial rubbish bin\/trash can. It was smelly - of fish, and dirty.

Overall its a beautiful hotel and between excellent amenities and location (walking distance from downtown time square and Broadway but far enough that your away from the lights and people) I'd recommend staying there.\n\nRoom - I had a king bed with a standard room. The room was large and spacious with high ceilings and very clean which is important to me. The aestetic is very modern and 'zen' throughout the hotel and that includes the room - they have really great calming spaces.  I find this can be difficult to find at a good price point in NYC Manhattan but Ink48 offers that.  The Bathroom was great as well with more amenities than one would need.  The only downer was the stand up shower size...its a bit small.\n\nRestaurants \/ Food - I'm a huge fan of fresh food and what I realized was that while I was searching for great spots for delicious food in Manhattan, my hotel actually had some really great options.  Although  bit pricey, I had a few meals and they were delicious... I still remember my breakfast! So if it's pouring rain out and you don't want to leave the hotel, you can stay and eat in the restaurant. \n\nThe Press Lounge is their rooftop Lounge and I have to say it provides some of the best ambiance and views of the city. Again pricey if you want to buy a drink (average 25$) but in the end its to be expected as you are staying at a basically 5 star hotel.  \n\nService - What I appreciated was that they do not charge a 'resort fee' witch many 4\/4.5\/5 stars in Manhattan do.  As there are so many places to eat and not to mention a great bakery down on 47th street, you wouldn't need a resort fee.  As well, they provide complimentary coffee & tea.\n\nUltimately, the staff make the stay memorable.  The men and women who are at the front desk ensure that you are having a wonderful stay...the service is 5 stars in my opinion and the staff and guests are diverse and it makes me feel at home... especially since when I usually go to 4.5\/ 5 star resorts the guest don't really tend to look like me.\n\nOverall A+","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

The music from the club was heard in my hotel room and the noise was outrageous the noise continued when the people from the club spilled into the street at 4AM. I complained to the girl at the front desk and she apologized but it would have been nice to be forewarned before checking into the room. It was the worse night sleep, ever!

It feels young, sophisticated and edgy, with complimentary happy hour and a very friendly pet policy (not that I had my pet with me but I am partial to hotels that are  welcoming to furry members). \n\nI selected INK48 in particular because of its proximity to the theater district yet a tad removed from all the hustle and bustle and easy access to the Lincoln tunnel and West Side Highway for our separate journeys into and out of the city.  \n\nThe lobby was modern and sleek, and our room was very spacious with high ceilings and tall windows and easily accommodated our two very comfortable queen size beds.  The bathroom was also a smart layout with opaque doors to allow for additional light yet give privacy. I could not have been happier. \n\nI have only given four instead of a five star rating because of the following two reasons. At no point during our stay did a door man (person) hold open a door for us, including when we each entered with our luggage,  when we returned to our hotel at midnight or when we checked out. Second, while I chose to park my car on my own in a garage on 10th Avenue (at a significant discount from valet), my friend used valet. Because she arrived around 4 pm, traffic starts to build up leading to the tunnel on 11th Avenue and she had difficult pulling her car over for valet to take her car.  She also learned that the hotel parks car in a garage on 8th Avenue \u2014 quite a distance away. Word to the wise, but call at least a half hour or 45 minutes before you need your car. \n\nDespite these two not so insignificant criticisms, I would still stay at this hotel again, with the hope that my comments will be taken into consideration. \n\nFinally, we had breakfast downstairs at Print before checking out and enjoyed a lovely and relaxing breakfast.  \n\n","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

As an Inner Circle member, I\u2019ve fallen in love with Kimpton\u2019s trademark \u201cridiculously personal service\u201d and beautiful properties.   The Ink48 has so many wonderful things going for it, however a few major issues still leave much to be desired.  \n\nI had three separate stays at the Ink48 in February.  The first stay was a pure delight.  America, a friendly and professional front desk clerk, checked me in and happily answered all the questions I had about the property and the neighborhood.  I hope management reads this and commends her for the high quality customer service she offers.  Due to my Inner Circle status, I was given a gorgeous upgrade to the Hudson River suite as well as a stellar welcome amenity with all my favorites.  Everything about this first stay was perfect!  Spotlessly clean housekeeping and all staff members I interacted with were helpful and pleasant.  Check out was as smooth and pleasant as check-in.  \n\nI then spent a few nights at the Hotel Eventi, another Kimpton property, which was a delight!  I returned to the Ink48 for a one night stay and that\u2019s when things took a turn for the worse.  I checked in with America, who was very pleasant once again.  I was given an upgraded room (no suite but still beautiful!) and a welcome amenity.  \n\nThe problems started at approximately 7:15 AM the following morning when there was extremely loud renovation\/construction noise and people talking.  I look through my door\u2019s peephole and I see maintenance workers and a ladder!  I call down for earplugs and I\u2019m told that they don\u2019t have any.  I was up working till 4:00 AM and was looking forward to sleeping in.  Since it was only a one night stay booked on awards points, requesting a room change for essentially a couple of hours would be silly and wasteful.  In summary, getting a restful sleep when staying at any hotel is not too much to expect.  This was a complete waste of valuable points.  When checking out, I mentioned what happened and I was given a quick apology but nothing more.  \n\nJust as I\u2019m walking out the door, I get a call from my boss telling me that I need to stay in NYC another night.  I book another room at the Ink48 on my IHG app and this time the stay went somewhat better.  I was given an upgrade to a Studio Spa room and another seamless check-in.  When I entered my new room, there was an overwhelmingly strong smell of cleaning fluid.  The maid must\u2019ve just finished servicing the room.  It was so strong that I had to open the window as wide as I could.  Because it was February, it was frigid outside so I had to crank the heater to help balance the temperature.  The only other issue with this room was that the sink was not thoroughly cleaned.  Nothing too major but not up to Kimpton standards! \n\nI sent an email to the hotel outlining the above but received no reply.  In the rare case that something goes wrong, I generally always like to address issues privately first.  Not getting any reply was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nIn summary, I stay at A LOT of Kimpton hotels so I\u2019m quite aware with the brand\u2019s standards.  My visits to the Ink48 in previous years were just as great as the first stay covered in this review.  The latter two experiences combined with the lack of email reply, however, made me a bit concerned.  I am fond of this hotel and it\u2019s many lovely aspects and staff members.  I just hope that they can work out a few issues and be even better.  \n","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

My big hits here were the fact that the rooms are a little larger than the typical NYC Utility Closet style rooms, and those rooms were very comfortable.  While Hell's Kitchen is about a 10-15 minute walk from Times Square, that's what I loved about it.  It has a slower, more relaxed pace (for NYC), and if you can walk for 5 minutes, you have numerous dining choices.\n\nIt's not a great business hotel - my room didn't have a desk, and breakfast doesn't start until 7:00 AM - not great if you have to get going early as I did.

The Ink48 in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood was a surprisingly good location for all we chose to do. A short walk or uber got us in the direction of plays, great restaurants, and the sights. However, it was the encyclopedic knowledge of the concierge Stephen Field that made the deep impression.

When my ship came in, it was visible from the hotel\u2019s roof (Thank you, Mr. Manager for taking me up there early my last morning with you so I could get a shot of the ship before I embarked.) and, of course, the top floors of the hotel were visible from the top deck of the ship.\n.\nI had arrived a few days before my departure date to make sure I didn't miss the boat and to have an opportunity to see some of the Big Apple, especially the 911 Memorial and Museum, a world-class exhibit. Everyone should visit it.\n.\nThis was my first time as a tourist here with time to see something. I am particularly grateful to Concierge America who checked me in early into a great room the day I arrived and who gave me excellent advice over the next two days on where to eat (The restaurant in the hotel was her good counsel--I had great dinners there twice), what to see in town and how to get there. Who knew taxis would be cheaper than Uber? Thank you, Miss America. She is a great hotelier in the grand tradition of that honorable and ancient profession.\n.\nValet Jesus was also a great person to meet, not only taking charge of my car and returning it when I needed it back to drive the last mile to the dock, but also with giving good advice about the area as we repeatedly walked by his station at the front door. He also got us a great cab ride downtown in a flash.  His estimate of how long it would take to get to the Memorial was spot on. Thank you, Mr. Jesus.\n.\nBoth nights I took advantage of free wine at the hotel happy hour. Thank you, Miss Generous-pour Sommelier. Unfortunately, this potable magic elixir is not portable: it could not be carried into the restaurant as the eatery is run separately from the hotel. I find this policy short-sighted. Why would Print risk alienating diners over a few sips of wine just as you are opening and your waitstaff is anxiously waiting for someone to serve in order to start earning their pay? Not to mention giving potential customers time to reconsider and possibly walk out the door altogether never to return.\n.\nThis is only an issue when you are opening up for dinner and your dining room is empty as the wine flows freely in the hotel back lobby for a very limited time in the very early evening. A more forward-leaning policy might be to pour the errant wine into your distinctive glasses at the table. You\u2019ll secure the diners that you may have lost and you will make your customers extremely happy as they will think that they are getting away with something. Not that anyone on your staff did anything like that for two clueless bumpkins from the distant burgs the first night they were there.\n.\nMy room in the hotel was great; everything was perfect, with a spectacular view--I couldn't stop staring out the big window. Maid service was excellent. Friendliest room staff I\u2019ve ever met, the morning team and the evening team on my floor. The room did lack a mini-fridge and a microwave, which I've come to expect in lesser hotels; but, since this was New York City, I took it as the local normal.\n.\nI had stayed in a Kimpton hotel near Boston a dozen or more years ago for a wedding. I remember well the wedding but not too much about the hotel. Which means everything went well. Great hotels, like Kimptons, should be unobtrusive and supportive of your purpose for staying in a bed away from home. This one did that in spades. Thank you, Kimpton, for near perfection.\n\nI look very much forward to returning here next time I sail from Manhattan. It would be great to see you here, too, and, if we are lucky, America and Jesus will be there to greet us with a smile and take care of our every need. Wine at four in the lobby and dinner in Print at five, okay?","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Ink48 did it well. We stayed here 8 nights. Great hotel, we paid for the \u2018standby\u2019 upgrade and got a corner room. For a hotel in Manhattan, this had large rooms and was very light and airy with large windows on two sides. Because it\u2019s down on 11th Ave, it was away from other tall buildings, so wasn\u2019t overlooked and this helped with the light. We had views over the Hudson and towards midtown\/uptown. Location was great and close to 9th Ave, where In Hell\u2019s Kitchen, there are plenty of restaurants. If you are not that Mobile, the walk to the nearest subway station on 50th and 8th, is a bit of a hike(approx 15 minutes with traffic lights) but 46th, 47th, 48th, etc are full of 8nteresting cafes and bars and we were happy to walk a lot. 17 mins or so to most theatres, 15 or so mins to the start of the high line at Hudson yards. There is a bus stop virtually outside the hotel. The rooftop bar is fantastic, if a little pricey and not run by the hotel, so you can\u2019t charge to the room. In the evening, they lock out 2 of the 4 elevators for the bar, so getting to\/from your room in the remain8ng two can take a while. The restaurant was great, we ate breakfast there once and dinner. Also a bit pricey, but food was good and service great. Of course, the Kimpton wine hour was its usual great self, although the area for it was a bit small and people moved into the main lobby as well. As I said, rooms were great. One complaint about the room, was that whilst the room was air conditioned\/heated, the bathroom was freezing cold and we were there during a spring snow storm, so if you need the bathroom in the night, rug up. The gym was a little small and had no windows, but was useable with new equipment.  One other minor thing was that the front doors were heavy and It seemed that the doormen were always \u201ctoo busy\u201d to actually help us with the heavy door.they were pretty consistent with this over 8 days...probably too cold to stand outside and help with the outer doors.

For New York the rooms are amazingly spacious. Modern, updated decor throughout and a great atmosphere. Very comfortable beds. The rooftop bar is to die for, gorgeous views with glass windows, you feel as if you're really in the heart of the city with all the lights.  \n\nBut for us the real highlight was Stephen at the Front Desk. I've stayed in many many wonderful hotels, and Stephen provided me with the best service I've ever experienced in any of them. After an amazingly smooth check in, Stephen discovered we were going to the opera later that evening, and charmingly told us about what to expect and tales of a friend of his who worked there, along with some useful practical information on its location in relation to our chosen restaurant. \n\nMy husband forgot his cufflinks, and after calling down to Front Desk, Stephen called us back within minutes, with a detailed strategy on where to get a new pair. My husband went off to get the cufflinks, and while my grandmother and I were waiting we were offered some complimentary wine, and without asking or being prompted, Stephen realized we would be late for our restaurant reservation, called them immediately to let them know we would be late, and also requested quicker service since we were off to the Opera. He knew what time our show started without us telling him. \n\nWhen my husband arrived, soaking wet from his cufflink jaunt, Stephen hailed us a cab, and I kid you not, ran off to get some towels to offer him so that my husband  may enjoy his dinner while dry.  He also offered us two umbrellas to avoid a soaking since he knew we would be walking between the restaurant and the opera. \n\nTruly spectacular service, never to be forgotten.  I will forever recommend this New York hotel based on the service I received from Stephen.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Be advised the nearest subway station (50th Street and 8th Avenue on the C and E lines) is about .6 miles away. That said, it was no trouble getting an Uber and the hotel will help you get a cab. \n\nHotel: Not much to look at on the outside, but it's gorgeous on the inside. The lobby has a pair of nice sitting areas including one where they do the nightly wine Happy Hour, a bar and a restaurant. There's also another restaurant and bar on the 16th Floor for which I recommend getting a reservation. \n\nCheck In: We were able to get into our room at 12:30 PM which was a big plus. The check in agent was friendly and helpful and explained that we'd get a $15 minibar credit for being IHG Platinum.\n\nRoom: We received a corner King on the 7th floor which was very lovely. The bed was quite comfortable and there were outlets on both sides. The bathroom was also nice and having windows in there was a nice touch. Obviously as this is New York there was some noise pollution so if you are sensitive to this earplugs might not be a bad idea. The $15 minibar credit got us one split of Proseco with $3 left over which isn't worth much. \n\nOther: We had brunch in the lobby restaurant where the service, menu selections and food were all very impressive.\n\nI used a Chase CC free night here and was glad I did.

It had a list of things that they would supply in case you forgot ranging from phone chargers, sewing kits to feminine products. The list was extensive.  I was so impressed I took a picture.  They have an awesome rooftop lounge with beautiful panoramic views of the NY Skyline.  My only complaints are that I asked for a late checkout and got it, but still two different people came to the room inquiring about my checkout and housekeeping despite the fact I had my privacy light on.

His customer service skills are off the charts and he makes my stays worthwhile. I don't think I have seen him greet me once without a smile.\n\nAll of these staff member have made my Ink 48 experience great and I am glad that you have people like them doing an excellent job. \n\nFrom,\n\nRachel McNair from CBS Sports","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

If you enjoy the comp coffee in the lobby - only 7 am - 9 am - you are NOT allowed to bring into resturant even if you are going to order their coffee - staff is very rude. In your guest room - there is a stocked mini bar with no price list and NO coffee options inroom. As a business traveler, I would choice another hotel.

Prices are typical for NYC room-service, so when you pay $20 for an egg sandwich, the expectation is that it arrives as described. He ordered the egg sandwich with brioche and side of greens.

The hotel is all shiny and new and the staff work really hard at making sure you are well taken care of. That said, it's a hike from anywhere and you will have to get an Uber if you want to get downtown. The subway is also a hike and it's several blocks from anything (drugstore\/coffeeshop etc.) The rooms are large and spacious and the king suite with the soaker tub is quite lovely. Couple of comments (and they may well be out of the purvue of the hotel) -- the bar doesn't hold any space for hotel guests, it need stools at the bar and also more seating (what's with the large empty space between the couches and the bar (with no stools). It was populated by what looked to be locals not drinking and taking up space the two nights that we tried to get a drink up there. If you can't into a bar at your hotel when there isn't another bar within miles then that's an issue ... small thing, but a big thing. The resto is lovely and breakfast there was imaginative and the staff great so that's a good thing. It's a solid hotel for NYC in the mid price range if you like quiet and don't care about access to NYC sites.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are clean and spacious (by NYC Manhattan standards) with consumables; you can down call to ask for anything else you may need (razors, shaving cream). \n\nThere are several elevators (so you aren't stuck waiting for 10 minutes for an elevator) and the lobby space is big enough for you to find a corner to chat should you want to get out of your room. I also like that access to the gym is 24 hours with well-maintained equipment. A little disappointing was the wifi; it was frustratingly slow during busy times of the day (evenings, mid-mornings).

We checked in on Christmas day for a 4 night stay to be \"tourists\" in NYC. We arrived early @ 12:30pm and pleasantly surprised our room was ready. Check in was friendly, fast, and efficient. Elijah reminded us that happy hour was from 5-6pm and would feature a chardonnay and a cab plus a holiday special - a Spanish eggnog.  We made it back for happy hour later in the day and the cab was fabulous as was the eggnog.  Our corner room was an upper floor room with a lovely view of the Hudson and into MidTown.  The room was large by NYC standards, modern, and quite comfortable.  The full size bathroom was well stocked with amenities and a lovely large glassed in shower with rain shower head in the ceiling. We asked for a complimentary Keurig coffee machine to be brought up, and had our choice of making coffee in the room or going downstairs for the complimentary coffee in the lobby. Every, and I mean every staff member we met was friendly and asking how our stay was going and if they could help with anything. \n\nWe liked that the location was quieter than being in Times Square\/Theater district but still only a 10-15 minute walk away.  We walked to the Al Hirschfeld Theatre to see Kinky Boots and it was only a nice 15 min walk there. Search TripAdvisor for solid dining in Hell's Kitchen -- there's a lot to choose from. We enjoyed Lilly's, O'Neils, and The Mercury when dining nearby.  Rudy's, a classic and fun NYC dive bar was a treat, and The Jolly Goat, a coffee shop 5 minutes away that had lovely Stumptown coffee and baked delights was a must stop.  If you don't mind a 5-10 minute walk (burn off those calories) this is a great location. And, we never had a problem landing an Uber or a cab to get us to other parts of the city.\n\nAlso, the hotel has Print, it's first floor restaurant, which is a great option if you want to stay in with a varied menu of farm to table selections.\n\nDefinitely become a Karma member for free wifi and a $15 mini-bar credit (although they are merging in to IHG's rewards program in early 2018, but we belong to that, too).","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I got an email from Allison this morning around 6 am- hoping I am feeling better and letting me know that my reservation was all set, and she even managed to book my Kimpton Karma reward night despite what must be a high occupancy rate. I also worry I will leave someone out - but everyone at this property is amazing.

The room was spectacular with great views of the city as well as posh furnishings and decorations. We were lucky enough to get one of the rooms on the highest floor (17) and while it did come at a premium it was well worth it for the full length floor to celling window and amazing view. The room was the perfect size for two. Did not get a chance to checkout the rooftop area but I can imagine that it was amazing.

The photo on the web site of this style room does not resemble our room much. Our view was of a wall and we had a ton of street noise, including from a nearby club.  There was about 24 inches of space between the foot of the bed and the dresser so it was very narrow.  The bathroom door is frosted glass, so you can hear everything going on in there and it does not lock.  I just find that weird.  There are no hooks to hang towels or coats when there are plenty of spots on the walls where they would make great sense.  Our room did not get made up at all the first 2 days so we had to call housekeeping and have them bring towels, glasses, toilet paper, etc., even though we had pressed the housekeeping button by the door.\n\nThe wine happy hour is just a crowded mess and totally not worth it.  The staff seems very attentive when something is brought to their attention but we would probably not stay here again.  The price was not good enough for the room and the lack of detail.  They seem to miss a lot of conveniences that could be added and the noisiness of the street meant we did not sleep well.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We made the switch from a hotel that was closer to Lincoln Centre a few years ago when we discovered a new Kimpton had opened. Being an extra few blocks away from the opera house is more than made up for by the staff at Ink 48 who make the Hotel feel more like a home than a hotel. \n\nKimpton Hotels set the bar high for service, but the staff at Ink 48 are the reason it has become my favourite hotel in the world. Every time we check in, it\u2019s the same friendly faces greeting us - front desk, bellmen, restaurant staff as well as housekeeping. The staff greet us with things like, \u201cNice to see you again\u201d, \u201cHow are things up in Canada?\u201d, \u201cHow long are you with us this time?\u201d We feel more like old friends than just customers.\n\nConcierge, Stephen Field, has been particularly attentive and an indispensable resource for us in making plans during our stay. His restaurant and theatre advice is always spot-on. He clearly loves what he does, and it\u2019s the places where he eats and the shows that he sees that he is recommending. \n\nI will leave additional aspects of the hotel for other guests to describe, but suffice it to say we never have any complaints. While the hotel exceeds our expectations in every way, it\u2019s the people who work at Ink 48 that keep us coming back. ","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I was upgraded by their always gracious staff with a sweeping view of the north side of the city and the Hudson River, with a separate bench banquet for window gazing.\n\nHip Bar & Happy Hour: there's always a complimentary wine hour with light snacks provided at the Kimpton properties which is lovely, but the true happiness here is on the happening rooftop bar, The Press Lounge, which is worth visiting for the sunset, the skyline and a quick cocktail if not the food (the menu is not extensive).\n\nQuiet Please: I always request a quiet room because I only crash for a few hours and for those precious hours I need to sleep, but my room upgrade had me placed over 11th Avenue so there was middle-of-the-night truck noise--my only complaint. But how can you truly complain, really, over such a spacious and kind gesture? So I'm not complaining!\n\nInsider's Tip: If you book directly through Kimpton, they have their own rewards program called Karma Rewards (with little bonuses like free wifi and a $10 mini bar credit to use as you please): I'm a member so I get the emails. If you book through another entity but are still in their Rewards program, they kindly still honor the free wifi which is a plus.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I spent the day in the city and was headed to the hotel to check in, (10:30 p.m.), I received a call from the hotel that they no longer had a room for me. Their solution was to move me to another hotel, the Kimpton Muse on Times Square. That room, apparently the last one they had, was on the second floor overlooking the sidewalk. The thermostat in the room was broken, so I was unable to get it below 78 degrees. Also, when I visit Manhattan, I prefer to avoid Times Square (except for theater).\n\nThis was upsetting on a number of levels. I had a reserved a room at the Kimpton Ink because I was attending an event there the next morning.

Bathroom was all modern fixtures and spotless, with a very nice, quite large walk-in shower that would be especially appreciated by anyone with mobility problems.

{"helpfulVotes":17,"locationId":1158753,"title":"DETAILED HOTEL REVIEW:  Some pros, some cons...  overall very good","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-10-16","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"(If you read this review and it provides value, please click 'like', it helps me justify why I spend my time writing these reviews)\n\nThe Kimpton Ink48 is located on the west side of Manhattan in Hells Kitchen (corner 11th and 48th), one block east of the Hudson River and the cruise terminal for many cruise lines.  While this may make it convenient if arriving on a cruise ship, the location is probably the pro\/con for this hotel.  On the pro side:  less chaotic area, great views either over the Hudson or the NY skyline as very few tall buildings in the area, and close to the Hudson River Parkway & USS Intrepid.  On the con side:  NO SUBWAY anywhere near here.  The ABC or 123 lines are a good 3-4 avenues away (avenues are much wider that the N\/S streets) so the only way to get to\/from is taxi, uber or bus, or a good long walk.  Also, directly across the street on the north side of 48th is an event space that hosts a male strip club on certain nights that lets out at 4am.  This can lead to a lot of street noise.\n\nRooms:  We stayed in a two queen room.  Very spacious for NY standards with comfortable linens and pillows providing a good nights sleep.  Window can be cracked open for natural air (lot of street noise), A\/C only goes to 65F.  Plenty of storage. No desk. Free wifi (sign up for Karma rewards).  Minibar. Flat screen TV but with no HBO and no NBC Sports network.  Bathroom:  shower only (water far too hot and couldn't get a cool shower - likely valve problems), one sink.  Robes provided.\n\nLobby \/ Restaurants:  While Kimpton provides its customary happy hour and morning coffee \/ papers in lobby area, the hotel also has 'Print Restaurant' and the 'Press Bar' on premises.  See separate reviews for complete details.  In summary, neither are owned by hotel which leads to a few issues.  The popular Press Bar on the roof, with great views, appears to often be closed to private parties. People under 21 are not allowed on the roof which is annoying if staying here as a family, also would not allow you to charge anything to your room.  The ground floor restaurant (Print) offers breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Meals were excellent and could be charged to the room.  There is also a bar in the restaurant area.\n\nOther local spots to eat:  Just south of the hotel is the Landmark Pub (oldest Irish pub in NY?) offering very good pub food at reasonable prices.  Also 2 blocks south is the West Gotham Market food hall offering counter style service from a broad selection of foodie-type spots at excellent prices.  Well worth a visit.\n\nNo pool.\n\nOVERALL:  Recommended.  However, no convenient subway could be a big problem for many.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Wir haben aber dann trotzdem unseren Aufenthalt im Ink48 gebucht.\nWir hatten ein geiles Zimmer mit Blick zur Stadt und es ist richtig, dass es die ganzen Nacht (au\u00dfer Sonntags) recht laut von der Stra\u00dfe ist. Wenn man also empfindlich ist, dass sollte man Ohropax einpacken. Aber das Zimmer selbst und der Blick aus dem Fenster (wenn man im Bett liegt) ist so mega, da sieht man \u00fcber den Verkehrsl\u00e4rm gerne hinweg.\nEin weitere Kritikpunkt, welchen wir ein paar Mal gelesen haben, die n\u00e4chste Metro Station ist so weit weg. Dies ist auch richtig, ca. 10-15 Minuten, aber wir haben diese nur einmal in der Fr\u00fch und max. einmal abends ben\u00f6tigt und wenn man New York besichtigt, dann geht man sowieso extrem viel zu Fu\u00df und verzichtet dementsprechend h\u00e4ufig auf die Metro. Das Hotel liegt so zentral, dass sehr viel fu\u00dfl\u00e4ufig erreichbar ist und so toll ist es in der Metro wirklich nicht, dass man besonders scharf drauf sein d\u00fcrfte, mit dieser zu fahren.\nEin absolutes Highlight ist die Dachterrasse (Rooftop Bar)!

So I offered to pay cash and settle everything in cash and offered advance payment and deposit, to which the manager Roger came and refused and said they needed a card for security reasons. I have no idea how a credit card is more secure than hard cash! They insisted I call up my banks that were NOT in the US on a Sunday and check with them as their machines could not be faulty. After having spent 40 mins on hold with my international bank as it was a Sunday. My toddler had been waiting patiently after a 20 hour flight and we had been trying to deal with this situation for over an hour I refused to get in touch with my bank and said u take the cash and I will sort this out tomorrow my child needs food and a room right now. They still refused claiming it's their policy to have a card on record. The manager Roger and front desk person Steven made it so difficult for me and were not understanding or cooperative at all and I am an international traveller who had been in the US for 10 days using all the cards before going to NYC. I left the hotel and checked into Westin Times Square who were most efficient, gave me an upgrade and all my cards worked perfectly fine here. \nRest assured I will never be staying at any of the kimpton hotels anywhere in the world!","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Both rooms were very spacious and comfortable with amazing views of the Hudson and even a fun view of the Intrepid Museum down below.  Waking up with panoramic scenes of the river, NJ across the water and sky were so invigorating I almost didn't want to leave the room for the day.  I couldn't get over the floor to ceiling\/wall to wall windows.  The Hudson River Suite also allowed us some city scape views from our large side window as well.   The room itself was well appointed with a spacious bathroom with soaking tub.  The decor included a nod to the printing company which once occupied the space.  Regarding it's location, there was a bit of a walk to get to the busier restaurant area in Hell's Kitchen and the subway, but it was well worth it for the value, luxury and comfort of this hotel.\nSomething else that made our visit extra special was the care that the staff took with us.  Stephen Field in particular made sure that our stay was extra special by checking in as to what, if any, special accomodations we might need especially since we were traveling as a family.  He clearly went above and beyond any concierge we've ever worked with surprising us with extra treats for the kids and for my husband and me.  We also appreciated his help finding local places for some of our meals.  His recommendations were spot on.  Finally, I was particularly struck by his pride and \"ownership\" he had of Ink48.

Having just returned from NYC I wanted to review it sooner rather than later.  The hotel itself is not far from Times Square (approx. a brisk 15 minute walk straight up 48th Street) and you can walk to the Empire State, 5th Avenue and Central Park rather than sitting in a taxi in hideously busy traffic.\n\nThe Intrepid Aircraft Carrier is about 5 minutes walk, Battery Park (for the Statue of Liberty) and the 9\/11 Memorial is definitely a taxi ride away.\n\nThe room(s) we had was big, clean and comfortable and the staff were very helpful.  We had a twin room first on the 6th and then the 11th floor.  Sadly, being higher up did not help with the noise emanating from the street below and the roof top bar\/restaurant next door and thus we did not have one night's sleep that was uninterrupted.  The glass in the windows must be very thin and felt that we had left a window open.  \n\nWe had breakfast one morning that was nice and comparable given that we did not have to walk 20 minutes to get there.\n\nLike another reviewer said, I'm not sure what the noise was like on the other side of the hotel.  However, we did have a view of the Hudson river which was nice and very pretty at night.  I guess its a lottery when it comes to any hotel but lack of sleep spoilt it a bit.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we arrived, the hotel only had 2 of the 3 rooms. The hotel was sold out. We had no other choice but to take the 2 rooms. This made accommodations very uncomfortable. \n\nSecond, neither of our guest room doors would not close and lock correctly. \n\nThird, the snacks at our snack bar in the room were old and stale. Also, the towels and linen sheets were old and worn. Not what you would expect at a boutique hotel. \n\nForth, we had a minor emergency which required us to go to the emergency room. Unfortunately, we didn't get back to the hotel until 11:50am. I explained to the Front Desk Agent (FDA) about the situation. It took several minutes of conversation to convince her to allow us a \"customary\" late checkout to 1pm. The hotel was not sold out and 1pm late checkout is normally customary in the industry. \n\nAnd the fifth, my room along with another guest key cards timed out.  We both had a late checkouts. The keycard's timed out at noon. My family waited in the hallway while I went down to get the new key. STEPHEN the FDA was working alone at the front desk. He was assisting a guest with a billing issue.  We both waited patiently at the front desk while STEPHEN worked on the billing issue. STEPHEN never once acknowledged our presence. It took about 10-15 minutes to resolve the issue. After the guest walked away, STEPHEN continued to work on the guest's folio, again failing to acknowledge our presence. Finally, STEPHEN asked if there was something we needed. The other gentleman informed him that both of our room keys timed out for both of our rooms. STEPHEN proceeded to re-key the other gentleman's key. Once completed, he handed him the key. I then attempted to hand him my key. He intentionally turned away and asked a customer walking up to the front desk if he could assist them. I immediately asked why he was not taking my key. He completely ignored me!  It was the most oddest thing I've ever experienced from a FDA. I then moved next to the customer who had walked up to the desk and demanded STEPHEN'S attention. He finally looked at me and said he would be with me as soon as he finished with the customer. I informed him I that I had been standing there for over 15 minutes. The customer standing at the desk acknowledged to him that I was there before her. The guest stepped back and insisted he service me. He reluctantly agreed. \n\nI understand the previous guest with the billing issue may have aggravated him with the number of billing issues, but STEPHEN is suppose to be a trained professional.  I absolutely did nothing. I never once made him feel rushed to finish with the other guest. I'm completely baffled why he would have ignored me, knowing I had been there for sometime without assistance. \n\nI informed him I would write a review based on his rude behavior. It didn't seem to bother him, nor did he attempt to apologize for his behavior. \n\nBtw...  I never mentioned to him or the management we own several award winning IHG hotels. I understand the expectations and duties of the agents who work the Front Desk. I can certainly sympathize with the situations and guests they sometimes encounter daily. Although, STEPHEN's attitude was completely unacceptable and inexcusable.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We enjoyed our stay enough to recently return and write a new updated review.  \n\nFor our second time around we booked a Hudson River Suite which was a very smart move and worth the extra money.  This suite has a major wow factor as soon as you walk in and see the sweeping views from the floor to ceiling windows that wrap around the corner, basically the entire length of the two rooms. Our view included a head on look at the Intrepid aircraft carrier with all of its toys on display including a Concorde. Of course the Hudson River is the star here and the busy boat traffic is fun to watch, not to mention cruise ships also docking right in front of you.  You even have decent city views from the side window. Outstanding view aside, the suite itself was very nice with a stylish modern d\u00e9cor with a touch of whimsy, and included a big couch facing the river.  The bedroom had a small table for two which was the perfect place to have some food while continuing to soak in the view in two directions. Standard rooms also offer nice views from big windows and the same stylish d\u00e9cor.   \n\nThe rest of the hotel is also very nice with a darkish hip looking lobby and an attractive on site restaurant.  The big deal at the hotel is the trendy roof top lounge and terrace with views of Manhattan in all directions.  We did not go up this time, but we did notice the line for entry, but assume hotel guests can cut in but don\u2019t quote us on that.  There is also a standard small hotel gym.  Of course we enjoyed the Kimpton happy hour, but space is tight at this location and it was busy, so we just got a drink and went back up to our suite to continue to enjoy the view.   \n\nWe like this location as it pushes us into a part of the city that we otherwise do not visit much.  It is an interesting area but it is several blocks west of the action and subway lines if that matters to you. That said, Ninth Avenue is two long blocks away and continues to evolve into one the best streets in the city with tons of restaurants.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Make sure you sign up before your reservation for their program, Karma.  You'll get some extra rewards that will make the extra 3 minutes trouble week worth it.  \n\nThe location is not very convienient to restaurants and other venues. However, the hotel and staff more than make up for it.  9th avenue is about a 15 minute walk, and has a lot of offbeat and interesting restaurants.  The is also a food court 3 minutes south on 11th avenue, that has a very wide selection of foods, including vegan selections.  No table service, but the food choices are plentiful. \n\nThe hotel is extremely well appointed and well thought out.  Since I was on a group rate I wasn't expecting much.  The room was the smaller of their layouts but still very large for Manhattan.  I have stayed a few places in Manhattan, and was very pleased with the size.  Additionally I had a city view from my room, which was possibly the best view in all Manhattan.  \n\nI have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world, and the staff here is on-par with any I have ever experienced, which is amazing considering that even the rack rate.  The doorman who appears to be a body builder was exceptional, the desk staffers very knowledgable and friendly, and you could expect no better anywhere.  Whomever does the staffing here should be commended.\n\nThe room on arrival was perfectly clean, and every detail addressed by the cleaning staff.  Perfection!\n\nBeware the so-called mini bar....it was the best I have ever seen, and while the prices are not cheap were lower than I have seen elsewhere.

Located in Hell's Kitchen, right next to the Hudson River and the beautiful Hudson River Park, we weren't terribly close to a subway station, but still felt it was worth the little extra walking to get to the train station.  We seriously had the best check-in experience ever.  The gentleman at the counter (Friday, July 28 at 9:30 pm) could not have been more welcoming.  I hope his employers know what a great job he does and how well he represents the hotel.  I recommend going online before your visit and signing up for the Kimpton Hotel perks, which you do just by giving your email.  This will allow for some extras, like a $15 gift card for the mini bar, free wifi, and points toward other things, like an upgrade.  Our room on the 11th floor was spacious and decorated in a white modern theme, with black and white images surrounding the king-size bed frame and on the walls.  The bathroom was large enough, but not for two people at once.  The beds were comfortable, the shower had good water pressure, I really like the soaps and shampoos they provide, and we had a little view of the Hudson and the Intrepid.  I love that they texted me immediately to ask me how I liked the room.  They checked in on me via text from time to time, but were not intrusive.  I asked for a second bath robe, and it was brought to our room within fifteen minutes.  They allow dogs in the hotel, and there was a dog water bowl at the entry to the hotel, welcoming them.  There is construction in the area (always construction everywhere in NYC) and noise on the street from the bar adjacent, but the room fan blocked the noise out beautifully.  We ordered breakfast from their walk-up bar, which is in between their restaurant (Print) and the hotel lobby.  We really enjoyed our breakfast sandwich (called the Farmer's sandwich, I think).  It was $11, but hotel food is always expensive and so is everything in NYC, so we weren't shocked.  There is free coffee every morning in the lobby every morning until 10, and a free wine bar from 5-6 every afternoon, both of which we enjoyed very much.  The elevators were fast, but they seemed to be having a little bit of trouble with them on Saturday night.  One of the hotel employees, though, was right there to make sure they got us up to our rooms.  The hotel rooftop bar (called Press, I think?) has the most amazing views.  You must go up and check it out.  Yes, it is crowded, yes, there are some obnoxious people, yes, service can be pretty bad, and yes, a beer is around $12 and a glass of wine is $14.  It is expensive.  All of the comments and reviews we had read about the rooftop bar were accurate.  However, for the half hour we were up there, we took in the gorgeous views and relaxed with a drink (only one).  If you know what to expect before you go, you won't be so aggravated.  Hotel guests don't have to wait in line to go up to the rooftop bar, which is another great perk of staying in this hotel.  This hotel is just a short walk to Hudson River Park, which I highly recommend visiting and hanging out for a day.  We walked along the water, stopped for some drinks at Buoy Bar (thumbs up) and took a cruise on the Circle Line boat.  I would come back to this hotel again and again.  It was a great experience.

Throughout the two years we stayed at a handful of hotels trying to find the right one in the area and we finally did! Our visit started after check in to a comfortable king size room with an amazing shower and a nice view of the city. After our first night I ran into the Guest Services Manager - Allison before heading out for work. She asked me about my stay and how they can make it better. I mentioned it would be amazing to be on a higher floor so I can be on top of the world. A few hours later my wife gets a call for a complementary upgrade. We went from the 8th floor to the 14th floor now I'm impressed! I had a few questions about billing since the company was cover the hotel stay. Just to ensure everything was taken care of I spoke to Gwyan - Front Office Manager and he got on the line with my company's booking service. Made my life even simple. Barbara made it super easy to get my car from valet and answer my super weird questions. Another perk is your paw-ter (paw daughter) or paw-on (paw son) stays at no additional cost! \n\nOverall Ink48 was a breath of fresh air.

Quite cool and woody decoration, very warm welcome, complimentary drink between 5 and 6, the first contact is very nice. I was in a superior room, with a huge bathroom and a nice view on the east part of the city. Bedding pretty nice, bathrobe in the cabinet, an impressive number of power outlets (I counted 22...!): really cool. On the 16th floor, a deck with an inside (including a bar) and an outside, with very nice view on the west Hudson river and also the north and east view. Very modern and woody design, nice staff. You can access to it from lobby (dedicated elevator) by showing your room key (if not a hotel customer, you might be turned down if too crowded). Great place to drink and watch the sunset. A romantic place to know if you want to make an impression to your beloved one. There is a BUT: even if my room was on a high floor (above 10th), there was just a very thin glass at the window, giving the impression that there was no sound barrier between you and the noise of the 11th avenue. I can tell that this is a VERY noisy avenue at any time of the day and the night. It is impossible (at least to me) to sleep without being woken up by the usual siren, super engine, loud music or else. For a four-star hotel, it should be a must to have the appropriate window glass thickness. I cannot imagine what is might be at a lower floor...So if you want to stay there, you can ask for a non-11th avenue room, then ensure you don't take a room with a number ending by 01 to 06, or bring your ear plugs and sleeping pills.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

There wasn't a view we could find that could beat it. \nWhen we were checking out, Daniel at the front desk could not have been kinder. Helped us keep our bags while waiting for the train, recommended the most PERFECT brunch spot. All the way around... i could NOT be more thrilled and impressed with this specific property. \nBeing from the hotel industry, there were MORE than dozens of times I made note of how amazing this property ran, and how i wanted to take back to my own property some of the amazing things I saw. \n\nI can't stress enough... this place should be 100% your next stop when staying in NYC. I cannot WAIT to go back. Another huge thank you to Elijah, David, Daniel... and so SO many more than I know I am forgetting. \nYou guys killed it!!!!","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The staff are really friendly and the hotel offers a lot. Definitely a very good 4 star and I would stay here if I ever visited New York again!\n\nHotel\nThe d\u00e9cor of the hotel was very modern and chic, great way to welcome you to New York. It was very clean and just a nice place to be throughout! My only very minor comment would be the lifts could do with sprucing up to match the rest of the hotel although it looked like it was being done up anyway. Could do with making the numbers easier to see in the lifts, save everyone squinting \uf04a\n\nRoom\nAs it was my friend\u2019s birthday we were very kindly upgraded to a King Deluxe Room. It was lovely! We were on the 10th floor with great views over the city through the full length windows. There are all the amenities you could want, flat screen TV, fridge, hairdryer and lots of plug sockets! It was fairly spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was nicely decorated too and the shower was huge and very efficient!\n\nRestaurant\/Food\nThe hotel serve complimentary tea and coffee in the morning (7am-9am Mon-Sat, bit later on Sundays) which is useful and then there is always water infused with fruit available during the day. Unfortunately I was unable to take advantage of their hosted wine reception 5pm-6pm everyday but sounded good! We only dined in the restaurant (PRINT) for breakfast but it was really good \u2013 nice d\u00e9cor and the food was amazing (I recommend the blueberry pancakes and French toast) and actually fairly reasonable. Useful when you don\u2019t have time to eat out. \n\nStaff\nThe staff were very friendly and helpful. They went the extra mile to make it special for my friend\u2019s birthday by sending a card, cakes and a bottle of wine as well as the upgrade \u2013 thank you Daniel! Also when our safe wasn\u2019t working, they came within minutes of us phoning to fix it and even though they had to replace the door they fixed it within 20-30mins \u2013 very impressed! \n\nLocation\nThis is one of the best parts about this hotel,  its only about 10-15min walk to Times Square and only 5 min walk to the restaurants in Hell\u2019s Kitchen (mostly along 9th Avenue). It\u2019s also far enough away to provide some peace and quiet from the noisy and busy tourist areas which you will be grateful for when you constantly hear sirens and car horns all day and night!","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Superb hotel in every single regard.  Staff was extra-friendly and helpful to a person.  Shout out to Daniel and front desk staff, but also to the oft unsung cleaning staff, who kept everything in great shape.  The hotel is a repurposed old printing building, and so ceiling are high.  Room was spacious, and the interior was modern but also warm and welcoming.  We are sort of coffee snobs, and the morning lobby coffee did not disappoint.  GM  Linda deserves kudos for this management, and the obvious atmosphere among guests in the lobby was that people enjoyed being here.  A great central location, a shade outside the Times Square craziness but close enough for a walk there or to Central Park.  And you are close to the river for a fun walk both up and down, to easily connect to the high line elevated walkway - very cool.  Good ethnic eats a few blocks away, but we also had breakfast at the restaurant which was just excellent.  Thanks Ink48 for a very special 2 night stay.  This is great hotel value as well.

The rooftop bar - while not officially part of the hotel - is a real asset for the hotel. As a guest, you get to skip the line and head on up. The gym was superb for a boutique hotel with good equipment. The neighborhood is good, but the hotel is a bit remote from Times Square and the heart of Hell's Kitchen. One (long) block to the East, there are quite a few restaurants, shops, and bars, however. The only negative I would like to point out is the street noise.

Room Air-conditioning. During our stay, the weather was unusually hot. The room air-conditioner needed to be activated.  When it periodically activated during the night, the fan was unusually loud, disturbing sleep.\n\n2. PRINT Restaurant for Breakfast.  On the first morning, we ordered breakfast the the PRINT restaurant.  The service was EXTREMELY slow.  Our order was not that complicated. Worse, my daughter ordered a bowl of fruit and when it finally arrived, she found an inch worm in it.  The server took the bowl back to the kitchen and replaced it.  However, a more appropriate response should have been \"sorry\" and \"no charge\" for the order.  Instead, she defended the inch worm but telling us that the produce came directly from the farm.  Some of your staff needs to be better trained. In addition, the menu states the the orange juice is fresh squeezed.  It was not.

I've been fortunate enough to stay at Five Star hotels around the US and elsewhere, lived in a Ritz Carlton for several years, and feel I'm a pretty good judge of a great hotel property.  I tend to look for a great hotel and return if I love it.  I first stayed at Ink48 while my NYC apartment was having some work done, and love it so much I literally gave up my apartment and stay here exclusively when I travel to NYC for work or otherwise - over a dozen times at this point.  I just returned from another great stay and am booking again for next month.  \nThe hotel rooms are very accurately described on the website, and the staff is happy to give you further details by phone.  I prefer the rooms with separate walk in showers and large soaking tubs - a real treat for a NYC hotel.  Even the smallest rooms are large by NYC hotel standards, especially for a boutique hotel experience - and the bathrooms are massive.  The beds, linens and duvets are always fresh and incredibly comfortable, and the bathrooms incredibly clean. \nI joined the free Kimpton Karma program and the $15 free mini bar credit along with free wi-fi is another nice perk, along with the complimentary wine happy hour daily.  Although with my work schedule I don't typically make it in time for that, it's great when I do!\nHands down - the best thing about the hotel is the service = the staff.  I have had great experiences from housekeeping, front desk staff, all the doormen including Jose, and the incredibly patient and accommodating room service staff.  I particularly appreciate Stephen Field, Concierge, and Roger Sawh, Manager.  These gentlemen go above and beyond to help guests, and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get the job done whatever the need is.  I've had them personally help me with baggage, deliver extra pillows in the middle of the night, and so forth - and follow up with a text to make sure things are to my liking - something no other hotel I've stayed in provides.  During my stay last week, I made the mistake of lying down for \"a minute\" after my shower before getting packed and heading to the airport - and the comfortable bed took over and I fell asleep.  I woke up in a panic and running very late to catch my flight.  The hotel staff helped me quickly pack and zip things up and get into an Uber, and then double checked the room for me and emailed me to confirm everything had been packed - I thought I had left something but they had tucked it right into my suitcase!  Stephen Field checked in on me every day of my stay and after I checked out as well - has been particularly kind to me attending to my preferred room choices, expediting things for me, handling packages and such.  I can't thank Stephen and Roger enough, and all of the Ink48 team.  \nThe restaurant is incredibly delicious, great service, incredibly well managed.  I don't tend to take advantage of the upstairs bar but one of the great things about the hotel is that the rooftop bar patrons use a separate elevator and I don't experience noise from such a popular place.

Press Lounge on the 16th floor is a must visit. The lounge affords beautiful views of the Hudson River and the NJ shoreline.

Great view rooms!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-05-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Where can I begin? We stayed at this location two adjacent weekends during which we had a cruise in between. First the arrival welcome and greeting by staff was top notch, they were courteous and welcoming. This was appreciated after a long trip with weather delays from the West Coast. Our room had a phenomenal corner view of the adjacent cruise terminal, only to be further surpassed a week later by a full onset view of the ship we sailed on! \n\nThe service from the bellman and front management Stephen Field was again top notch. He provided recommendations on both arrivals, one for the delicious Print restaurant within the hotel which had the best gnocchi I've had and the short ribs which my spouse had.  The recommended brunch place with my lifelong friends from NYC upon our return was just as welcome. Absolutely delicious and the cocktails at the restaurant indeed were quality NYC! \n\nI would highly recommend this especially for the ease to mid town, the ease to NJ and the airport as well as the cruise terminals.....quiet location as well we found! \n\nWe will return and have suggested already to friends who are traveling on a cruise to consider this hotel in Manhattan.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is a very nice hotel, the rooms are very modern, yet cosy. I slept well and the bath was really spacious.\nThe location is good. The next subway is a few blocks away; it is very close to the Hudson and the Interpid Museum.\nThe real downside of this hotel was any single interaction I had with the service staff. On check-in, the lady was just interested in me paying the bill in advance. Doing so, she completely forgot the check-in speech and did not talk about any services the hotel had to offer.\nAt a later point, waiting in the lobby, I was bossed away from the seating as it apparently did not belong to hotel but to the restaurant. The waitress was very determined to get me out of that space (it turned out, that it was one booth too deep into the restaurant, the one next to it would have been okay - i had to find this out on my own).\nOn check-out, the receptionist rolled his eyes on my request to adjust the billing address, gave me heavy attitude and gave me, once again, the feeling of not being welcome, even though I am definitely not a demanding guest. \nTo sum up, this was one of the worst hotels, I have ever stayed in, in terms of their non-existing  compassion for guests.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The rooms are clean and your standard small size for NYC. We had a great view of the Hudson River. The staff at check in were great. We had a couple of small issues. When we arrived we could not get our air conditioner to work. I went to the front desk as our room was 79 degrees and they said they would send someone. I waited about 30 minutes and called guest services and someone finally came up and it started working. Our second issue is something that is probably not the hotels fault but I recommend you really inspect the mini bar before use. My husband got a bottle of beer from the mini bar one he had never tried before. He said this tastes terrible. I then tried it and to me it tasted like water. We then dumped it into a glass and it definitely did not look like beer more like water.  Not sure if someone had drank the beer that was in the bottle and put the cap back on. We did notify the front desk and they were extremely apologetic and made us feel like a valued guest. \n\nLoved the free bikes that you can take out for a spin. We went around central park and the city. They are first come first serve but definitely a great way to see the city. \n\nA must to go up to the roof top bar the views are fantastic. Children are not allowed and there is a dress code.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Staff were great and easy to chat with. Room spotless and bathroom the size of my home. Slept very well, but knackered anyhow after walking, walking and more walking this fabulous city.. Room top bar offers amazing views but drink prices make sure you pay for it, and you cannot charge to room as not part of the hotel. Tea and Coffee in the foyer in the morning to help yourself to was great in a morning. 3\/4 mile from Times Square and jogged there and back and Central Park while in area and if interested in running an excellent path by the river also past the Intrepid past the various Piers. No noise on street outside so a quiet area and walked back all hours and never felt threatened in any way..My only criticism, I asked that they may acknowledge my wife's birthday while there in some way and duly sent a card way in advance for my wife to open. never saw the card and no mention of her birthday so was a little disappointed in that as they said they would.. Small thing however and would stop here again without reservation...","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}
