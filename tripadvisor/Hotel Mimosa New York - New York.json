The rest of the staff is excellent as well, always ready to help with recommendations, amenities, directions, or whatever else you may need. The hotel itself is immaculate. The neighborhood outside is very loud but as soon as you enter the lobby you're met with sense of calm and quiet, and this peace is throughout the entire property. The rooms are small but not cramped, clean, and thoughtfully furnished. The bathroom is large, clean, and bright. The shower is hot and has a great shower head. The Manhattan Bridge and train were directly across from our window - you could see them but not hear them. The soundproofing is incredible. Blackout curtains make the room completely dark. The AC works great and is quiet. The bed and bedding was super comfortable in every respect. I have not slept this well in a long time. The hotel is in the heart if Chinatown (but not the tourist area) so you'll get the authentic Chinatown experience and there's plenty of food everywhere. The subway station is a quick 5 minute walk. Little Italy is a quick walk away also. I booked this property based on good reviews and was not disappointed. I will absolutely return to this location for future NYC trips.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

We were impressed to have a view of the World Trade Centre from our bedroom window. The staff are welcoming, and the list of recommended local places to eat is a great idea.\n\nThe soundproofing on the windows is excellent. In fact we found it stuffy with the windows closed, so we started sleeping with a window open. You can certainly hear the subway trains on the Manhattan Bridge, but it wasn't loud enough to disturb our sleep. The street itself is very quiet, especially at night.\n\nUnfortunately we did have problems with noise from within the hotel itself. The bedroom doors don't block sound at all and the corridors are quite echoey, so we could hear absolutely everything. The problem with this was that during the night there were frequently loud groups of people talking, laughing and (it sounded like) partying in neighbouring rooms and in the corridor itself. On two of the five nights of our stay there was a lot of noise between 11pm and 3am, so we didn't sleep much at all. There was a sign in the corridor asking for \"quiet time\" between 10pm and 8am, but people ignored that. At one point (around 1am one night) I complained to the receptionist, who tried knocking on people's doors and asking them to keep the noise down - but I'm not sure they even heard him. The management tried to help, installing a draft excluder at the bottom of our bedroom door, but unfortunately that didn't have much effect.\n\nBy the third night here we were desperate for sleep, and even considered checking out early and paying again to stay somewhere else. Luckily there weren't any noisy groups for our last couple of nights and we were able to sleep soundly.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"NONE"}

For those who have no trouble sleeping with a fan or AC on, there should be no problem with the noise level. For light sleepers, the rumbling from the train will be noticeable.\n\nThe hotel runs on central air so you cannot entirely control the temperature of your room.

Though check in time is supposed to be early evening, we were able to drop off our bags at the front desk around 11AM - giving us plenty of time to wander around Chinatown for delicious food. The room is very small; as soon as you walk in, there is a desk against the immediate wall, a queen size bed that takes up the majority of the room, a flat screen TV opposite the bed, and a bathroom. We did not mind this at all since our days were spent exploring, and the hotel room served as a place to sleep and shower. The bathroom had bottles of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand soap for guests to continue using, which was GREAT - LOVE the eco-friendly mindset with that. The hotel is right across the Manhattan Bridge, so you will hear the subway come through multiple times. With the windows closed, it honestly sounded like an AC unit hum. We even slept with the windows open a few nights to cool off, and the sound really didn't bother us. The staff were also super kind and had six lists of places to check out nearby. It was really a great experience.\n\nOur only con: those pillows are pretty cheap. They are thin and feather-filled. We had to stack two to sleep on.

Don\u2019t let the location frighten you; although it\u2019s right next to the Brooklyn Bridge it was actually the quietest location I\u2019ve ever stayed when visiting the city. No honking cars, loud music or screaming drunk people. There is also a subway stop in close walking proximity, so getting around Manhattan and the other boroughs is quite easy. They provided a ton of food etc. recommendations and we had a great cup of coffee at a local spot on their list. The day we were leaving we had a few things to do before getting our car and they allowed us to keep our luggage downstairs while we ran a couple of errands. I will definitely come back and would certainly recommend to any friends. Thank you to the staff at Hotel Mimosa for our enjoyable stay. :)","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

From the prompt and courteous check in, to the detailed recommendation sheets (where to go for breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, etc.), to the comfortable, cozy, quiet room -- and all the friendly \"hello\"s and \"see you later\"s as we came and went daily-- this place is wonderful.  We were very impressed with the nightly quiet hours and firm no smoking policy.  The hotel is small but lovely -- very clean and new-feeling.  It is close to the raised train, which you can hear but it is so muffled by the double insulated windows that, after the first night, you don't notice it at all.  The memory foam beds were like melting into comfort each night.  The TV was very new and afforded hundreds of channels, plus easy connectivity to our Netflix and Prime accounts, among others. The bathroom is quite ample for the small size of the room, with a full shower that was plenty hot and had great pressure to wash off the city after the end of a long day running around, shopping, eating and having fun.  The room is small but most rooms in NYC are small...it's plenty big enough for two people to move around - two twin beds, a small desk and chair, a second chair, two little nightstands each with a light, and a rack to hang clothes and store a small suitcase.  Also had ice bucket, hair dryer, and a very nice assortment of sundries (large pump dispensers of shampoo, conditioner, body wash; lotion, toothpaste, 2 toothbrushes, a shower cap and a razor!)  We were in easy walking distance of all of Chinatown and Little Italy, with many shops and food options, and easy-to-access metro stops nearby.  A couple people had cautioned us to avoid staying in Chinatown, but we found that to be baloney...if you want some bougie, overpriced, overcrowded-with-pushy-tourists experience, go ahead and stay uptown near Times Square (we know -- we did that last year).  But if you are OK with the less flashy parts of NYC, and you want more of a cultural experience, near areas that are more residential, and more off the beaten path, with fabulous Chinese and cannoli nearby, stay here.  It was every bit as nice as a 42nd Street hotel without the high price and heavy tourist presence.  Of course, as in many places in Manhattan, it's best to get back to the hotel at a reasonable time after dark, and stay on the main and well-lit streets, but as two petite middle-aged women on foot, we never felt threatened as there were always people out and about.  The hotel locks down at midnight and you have to have someone let you in after that (show your key to 24-hour front desk person), and we found that very reassuring.  We highly recommend Hotel Mimosa to anyone who wants a very quiet and pleasant experience for a great value!","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Prices start at a couple of hundred per night for modest accommodations in NYC. That is typical NYC. The closer you want to stay in the heart of the Big Apple, the more you can expect to spend. This is why Hotel Mimosa is simply a fantastic find. This place exceeded our expectations and was a smart choice, considering the combination of quality accommodation and service we received. This hotel was the best deal we found in New York City.\n\nThe check-in experience was seamless. The staff will even hold your baggage if you arrive earlier than check-in time.  The room they provided us was VERY clean. The bed and pillows were so comfortable that it was easy to unwind every night after a long day exploring the city- and you will explore! Front desk will give you a list of places to dine, drink, and be merry. We used the kindly provided lists of restaurants within walking distance with great descriptions- making it a cinch for us to decide where to go for our meals. Mimosa is very walkable and centrally located to good, inexpensive food spots and cafes. (It is only a block away from an affordable michelin starred restaurant!). The metro station is a mere five minute walk, with a straight shot to or from JFK airport. \n\nThe fixtures in our room were well thought out, creating a reasonably spacious bed and bath.  Although this hotel is directly in front of the Manhattan Bridge, we could not hear any noise at all from outside and we were able to sleep undisturbed.  Hotel Mimosa provides a generous supply of added toiletries for guest convenience and their thoughtfulness did not go unnoticed.  We have suffered in other hotels that have provided less while charging us more. There was no in-room fridge or microwave but there is a fridge, microwave, a snack vending machine and an ice machine at the basement level common area.\n\nEveryone at the front desk was genuinely friendly and helpful, they even arranged a well-priced cab service to take us back to the airport for our departure. If you have any reservations I would say do not hesitate to book! \nWe enthusiastically recommend Hotel Mimosa, and we have already re-booked with them for our next trip to New York City next month.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

My friend and I were recommended to stay in Chinatown by her cousin who works in NY. He said it was the best area for ease of access between anywhere in Manhattan and Brooklyn. And he was right! A young guy I had met selling chocolates in the Oculus mall who happened to live in Chinatown (he was white), said the same thing. So big plus to this hotel for location.\n\nCleanliness. My friend and I were really apprehensive about booking hotels anywhere in NY mainly due to what we heard about NY\u2019s prevalent  bed bug infestations. But seeing the inside of this place, we breathed a big sigh of relief. The beds and the bathrooms were both very clean.\n\nCustomer service. My friend and I were also initially apprehensive about customer service. My friend and I both grew up in predominantly Asian areas, we\u2019re used to Asian customer service (mainly restaurants) being a little abrupt and less personable. But Hotel Mimosa exceeded our expectations. Though we always woke up late missing the usual cleaning service time, we were always able to get our room tidied up if we called front desk. We were always able to get extra toilet paper if we asked, extra towels\u2014my friend at 2am in the morning even asked for an extra blanket. We always thought we were being a burden and expected them to either ignore our request or take a very long time to follow through, but we were very wrong. On the phone, the front desk person was always very gracious and a worker would follow through on the task promptly.\n\nSo five solid stars for this hotel!!","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Of course you hear the trains coming across the bridge every few minutes, all night long! Other than that, completely silent hotel and area at night. The trains didn\u2019t bother me or my son.\n\n2. The surrounding area IS very sketchy. Please know this. Please see my pictures. I was not comfortable walking around with my young son but would be ok as a couple.  I mean, you\u2019re probably fine, honestly, but, wow, it just looks terrible. So much graffiti . And we passed \u2014daily \u2014 multiple unfortunate people sleeping on the street and urinating in public. All that said, had I been there as a young person or just with my SO, I still like the Chinatown vibe. My complaints are meant to be given only for the benefit of other parents taking kids to the city. \n\n3. Staff is wonderful. Rooms are clean and very, very comfortable. No smells. Would love a coffee pot but otherwise zero complaints with the hotel amenities.  Except maybe one more: I really dislike being unable to personally control my room\u2019s temperature. I found the room to be cold at night.\n\n4. Not sure where all the other reviewers were visiting, but, for us, it really wasn\u2019t convenient to major sites or Broadway. I mean, it\u2019s Manhattan, you can almost always walk to a subway stop anywhere within 10 minutes. But, If you have kids, it\u2019s so much easier to stay midtown or upper west side. SO much easier. Can\u2019t even believe how many people are acting like it is convenient to walk 7 minutes to a subway, wait for a train, probably have to change a train to get to your destination, then walk from that destination\u2019s subway stop. It\u2019s at least 30 -45 min to Broadway during busy times, with kids. We took a yellow cab back to hotel and it was much easier for $24. \n\n5. Area is not easy to find a quick bite to eat for a finicky, child eater. \n\n6. The entrance to this place is on Eldridge, not Division. Can\u2019t even see it at night from Division Street. \n\nHonestly, unless you are a super-cool, hipster parent, find some place uptown to stay with kids for a typical, touristy vacation.  Plenty of cheap hotels out there are the moment. Enjoy the Mimosa if you are young and unencumbered!","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were sitting stranded in the airport at 4am, exhausted and feeling a bit despondent, with nowhere to go when we found Hotel Mimosa online. We phoned ahead and asked whether we could check in early (like 5:00am early) and they were so helpful and accommodating, they had a room available and the early check in fee was very reasonable. We immediately hopped in an Uber and within the hour were tucked into a super comfy bed, grateful for a place to get some sleep and safely store our heavy luggage that we\u2019d been dragging with us. The black out curtains and the windows made it easy to sleep - considering it\u2019s right on the street and in the hustle bustle of Chinatown, you\u2019d never know it as it\u2019s so quiet. A few hours later, we were up and ready to take advantage of the days\u2019 layover. The room was great, small but very functional and nice and they went above and beyond our expectations with the toiletries in the bathroom (ie, toothbrushes, toothpaste in addition to nice quality shower gel, shampoo and conditioner). The staff are friendly and knowledgable about the area and they gave us a printed comprehensive list of places to eat with accurate write ups, so if you\u2019re unfamiliar with the foodie scene Chinatown, you can be confident that you\u2019re going somewhere good. The hotel is perfectly situated and most places are a short five minute walk away, so for the 24 hours we had available, we were able to visit several dim sum spots and peruse the wonderful Asian markets.

I moved to New York from Los Angeles on January 1st of this year. \nIt was a big move so I was too tired to try and find a place I could rent as a studio. Instead I decided to go to my favorite hotel once a week, a place that had won my heart because of its very name, Mimosa, which in Spanish, my mother tongue, means affectionate, loving, cuddly. \n\nSo every Wednesday, in what I\u2019d later call Mimosa Wednesdays, I\u2019d take the train to Grand St., buy trinkets at some store in Eldridge St. and have lunch at 388 Cafe & Deli to later check into the Mimosa Hotel. \nQuickly, Mimosa became my bubble and my office, somewhere I looked forward to going to every week to write and put my ideas in order. \nThey have a coffee machine in the lobby, so I\u2019d fix myself a cup, head to my room and write until my head spun. Then, I'd go for a nightly walk around Chinatown, smoke a cigarette in Confucius Plaza or get a massage with a masseuse I had met a few years ago at a now defunct \u201chealth center\u201d in Canal St. coincidentally called Mimoso. \n\nDespite it being a modest accommodation, the rooms are bright, clean and quiet, with amazing views of Manhattan Bridge. Wifi is fast, the bed is comfortable, there\u2019s a working printer in the basement and most importantly: Hotel Mimosa has the nicest, most polite and helpful hotel staff I've ever encountered. They always go the extra mile to make sure I feel welcome. Sometimes they even give me special Chinese teas that they keep in the back ;-)\nLast time I visited the hotel was on March 5th, only 10 days before lockdown started. \nUpon checkout, a Chinese woman was trying to get directions to Times Square. I had probably spent the night with the last bunch of tourists allowed into the city. \n\nReally looking forward to coming back to the Mimosa Hotel! \nManhattan, get well soon!","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Also, they offered a very reasonably priced car service to the airport (they do not offer pick-up).  Were their things that could be better?  Sure.  The light switch in the bathroom needed to be jiggled to stay turned off and a couple other little things like that, but nothing that distracted from my enjoyment of my stay.  Can't recommend them highly enough!","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was our first trip to New York, so I don't know if it's common in other hotels but I was very impressed that they had even provided toothpaste AND toothbrushes, I have never encountered this in other hotels. Especially after a long flight, small things like that can really make such a difference - plus points for that. \nThe hotel is located at a relatively noisy corner, however we were not really bothered by it as the windows block the noise quite well. That being said, I also think it's one of the most vibrant and authentic neighbourhoods in the city, so don't miss the opportunity to explore it further. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Our king room wasn't particularly big, but it's plenty of space to base yourself for an exploratory city break. The bed was great, enabling some healthy and much-needed rest. The bathroom was clean, the shower had strong pressure and ran nice and hot. Also provided were full sized body wash, shampoo and conditioner bottles, as opposed to the mini ones you tend to get. A couple of nice additions were the provision of a disposable razor, toothbrushes, toothpaste and a comb. We were initially concerned about the noise of general traffic and subway trains on the bridge - very evident outside, but once inside, the room was well soundproofed, with extra glazing on the windows to subdue the noise.

Storage in the room consists of 2 small drawers and a small hanging rail with hangers, the drawers were only big enough for underwear. I piled my t-shirts onto the bottom shelf of the hanging rail and then hung my jumpers and trousers up. I used the end of the rail for coats.

They have a quiet policy from 10 pm - 8 am and it was rare that I heard the other guests making noise. \nWe travelled with hand luggage only so we used the provided toiletries (shampoo, conditioner & shower gel) which were lovely, smelt like oranges. They also provided toothbrushes, toothpaste and a razor (all wrapped) which we didn't need.\nThe basement has a little area with a computer and printer (I had to print one trip voucher out) a vending machine and a fridge for storing food (we put some breakfast items in there for when we had an early start one day). They provide a pen and post-it notes so you can label your food.\nWe always walked to Grand St subway stop (about 5 mins) as it had access to the B & D line which takes you to most of the tourist areas, this means walking past a park where it was lovely so see groups of people doing Tai-Chi in the morning.\nOn the last day they were happy to lock our bags up so that we could continue exploring until the taxi came to pick us up, they gave me the matching tag so that no-one else could take our bags.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Hotel Mimosa really is a hidden gem.  Don't be put off by the 2 star status, they provide 5 star service.  Rooms are small (but not the smallest we've stayed in in NYC).  Bathroom is reasonably sized with an overbath shower.  (I usually hate shower curtains, but this one was spotless and had magnets to keep it in place.)  There were plentiful toiletries and extras provided (e.g. toothbrushes, razor, shower caps).  \nWe were in room 206, it is VERY close to the Manhattan bridge, and even with the quadruple glazing, you can hear the subway rumbling past.  I didn't find this annoying, however the soundproofing INSIDE the hotel is poor (if other guests don't whisper in corridors, you can hear every word they say and I heard someone's phone alarm going off one morning).  If other guests are considerate, this won't be a problem.  \nSome of the lovely touches:  we were celebrating my hubby's 40th and there was a balloon bouquet in the room awaiting us, such a lovely touch.  There's free Nespresso and tea in the hotel lobby (as well as complimentary candy!), and bottled water can be purchased for $1.  \nThere's an ice machine in the basement, as well as a communal fridge.  I thought this was fantastic.  \nThe aircon is centrally controlled and the room did get very warm, even in October.  If you phone reception they will adjust this for you as many times as you wish.  You really feel that nothing is too much trouble.\nThe closest subway lines are 6 and 8 minutes away (East Broadway and Grand Street).  The hotel provides printed maps and information about how to get to all major attractions from Mimosa.\nStaying in Chinatown is really an experience, there are sights, sounds and smells everywhere you go, it is colourful and vibrant, although some parts are run down.\nThe hotel organised transport back to JFK airport for us, it was a private transfer and cost less than what we paid for a shared ride with Super Shuttle on the way in.  \nWould I stay here again?  Absolutely!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The location of the hotel ideal for us; a few minutes' walk from the F line Subway, which took us straight to all the action in around 10 minutes.

There was free tea and coffee in the reception, and plenty of places nearby to get breakfast, including a Chinese bakery right opposite. All of the staff we met were friendly and helpful, which is an important consideration. The hotel is well-priced for New York, and all in all is highly recommended.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were so happy we made the choice to stay at Hotel Mimosa during our NYC weekend. Located in heart of Chinatown, a few blocks walk from the Subway, Hoel Mimosa is convenient, clean, comfortable, and very affordable. The room is small, but that is expected. The bed is comfy and we appreciated the room amenities like the toothbrushes and toothpaste. Also, our room faced the train line, but never heard more than a soft rumble. Very quiet and restful!\n\n But what really stands out is the helpfulness and welcome of the staff. We immediately felt like honored guests. The weather was iffy and we were offered hotel umbrellas to use. There is complimentary tea and coffee service at checking desk and $1 water bottles (super cheap compared to the $5 Times Square cost of the same). We had a late plane departure and they offered to let us stow our luggage (for free!) at the hotel after check out if we wished.\n\nThe hotel staff are serious foodies - definitely rely on their recommendations on where to eat! They gave us a two page list of food outlets which was useful (as well as directions from the hotel to major tourist spots). On check out, we said we wanted steamed buns. Their recommendation was Cheatham St Dim Sum Restaurant which was amazingly good - and cheap! \n\nWe will absolutely stay at Hotel Mimosa again and recommend others to give it a try, too!","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I come to the city three or four times a year and look for a place which is clean an economical. I've stayed in many different hotels in Manhattan, but this is my favorite. It's like a European family inn, and I know by experience. The staff are friendly and efficient. If you need something, they will follow through. You will have a unique experience in Chinatown, because the owner will help you decide where to eat, as he grew up there. He will recommend not only a good Chinese restaurant, but the restaurant which serves the kind of Chinese food which is their specialty. Okay, that's food. As for the Arts, the owner can direct you to what's happening in the city as far as painting, music, opera, theater, etc. And by the way, the rooms are quiet at night, street noises will not wake you up, as often happens at other places in the city. In sum, I can tell you that staying at the Hotel Mimosa will not only be pleasant, but will result in a broader experience of New York than you could possibly have with glossy tourist pamphlets as a guide.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Loved it.  The location is slightly off putting when you get there since you are facing the Manhattan Bridge and it has a train track?  However, no idea how they've done it, but the rooms are completely sound proofed??  It's almost eerily quiet?  Small rooms but this is Manhattan - unless you can afford top $$$$'s most rooms are small? They are small but well equipped and very clean.  The bathroom has more to offer than a lot of larger hotels I've stayed in?  So you get toothbrushes, toothpaste, shower cap, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel?!  The location was fabulous for us as we've been to New York many many times so didn't want to be too central but it is a bit far downtown for maybe 1st time visitors.  You're right in the centre of Chinatown which is fascinating and a short walk to Little Italy and the Brooklyn Bridge\nMy main recommendation for this hotel, however, is the staff?  They really cannot do enough for you?  My husband was ill and I asked to extend our room for a late check out?  They did it complimentary and offered to get medical help?  We didn't need it but the offer was there.  And they organised a transfer to the airport?  Nothing was too much trouble?  The free tea\/coffee on reception was a lovely touch too?  \nI would definitely recommend this hotel","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Llegamos a la parada de metro de Grand Street desde JFK, sin saber orientarnos todav\u00eda en Manhattan, pero no tuvimos problema en llegar al hotel. Se encuentra en Chinatown, con el peculiar aspecto de este barrio conocido de verlo en mil pel\u00edculas, y tal cual lo encuentras, pero llama la atenci\u00f3n cuando llegas al hotel que su fachada desentona por la buena presencia del edificio respecto a los colindantes y al barrio en general. Entramos y nos encontramos con una atenci\u00f3n, presencia y amabilidad impoluta, propia de cualquier hotel de 4 estrellas en Espa\u00f1a. Nos dan una gu\u00eda de restaurantes, recomendaciones, etc. y accedemos a la habitaci\u00f3n. Primera impresi\u00f3n de la habitaci\u00f3n, si bien no es muy grande (imagino que no podr\u00edan mantener estos precios con este servicio y un numero mas reducido de habitaciones mas grandes) no necesitamos m\u00e1s espacio ya que nuestra intenci\u00f3n es pr\u00e1cticamente ir a dormir solo. La habitaci\u00f3n respecto a limpieza estaba impoluta, tal cual se ve en las fotos que pod\u00e9is encontrar aqu\u00ed, con ba\u00f1o privado muy limpio con todo tipo de accesorios de higiene incluyendo maquinilla de afeitar, cepillos de dientes, etc. Las vistas directas al puente del Manhattan por donde pasa muy cerca el metro, pero con dobles ventanas sorprendentemente que a\u00edslan de todo ruido del exterior; descanso garantizado.\nBajamos la primera ma\u00f1ana y si bien es cierto que el hotel no ofrece servicio de desayuno, que nosotros no busc\u00e1bamos pues nuestra intenci\u00f3n era salir a la calle desde bien temprano, su personal tan amable te ofrecen caf\u00e9 (los que quieras) que te puedes servir tu mismo en una m\u00e1quina nespresso. Con esto, nos vamos a la calle y te das cuenta de la buena localizaci\u00f3n del hotel, a pie  del puente de Manhattan, a 15 minutos andando (o menos) del puente de Brooklyn, de dos parada de Metro que en 15\/20 minutos te dejan en el Rockefeller, o a pocos minutos a pi\u00e9 de la zona del World Trade, Wall Street e incluso ferry para la Estatua de la Libertad. Esa misma noche ten\u00edamos entradas para los Knicks y pudimos imprimir nuestras entradas en el mismo hotel, que cuenta con un ordenador e impresora a disposici\u00f3n de los clientes sin coste alguno (muy nuevos). Tras nuestra semana en Nueva York, el ultimo d\u00eda hicimos el check-out y pudimos dejar nuestras maletas en recepci\u00f3n, donde te las guardan y te dan una pulserita con tu n\u00famero, y ellos mismos las guardan y despu\u00e9s te las sacan, con lo cual pudimos aprovechar todo el dia de vuelta (nuestro vuelo salia a las 20.00) por Broocklyn, Chinatown y Little Italy.\n\nSi la experiencia de ir a Nueva York en \u00e9poca de Navidad ya de por s\u00ed es incre\u00edble, sin duda la localizaci\u00f3n, servicio, tranquilidad, descanso y gran amabilidad encontrada en el Hotel Mimosa suma mucho en el recuerdo que nos traemos de la Gran Manzana.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There's a noticeable effort with windows\/glazing in the room to soundproof. They have earplugs at reception - I asked for a set on the first night but didn't end up using them.

Also a lot of really good (and cheap) bars nearby easily found on Google Maps - Whiskey Tavern and 169 Bar to name a couple.\n\nOverall it was an excellent stay in an area I would have not really have considered previously but is definitely worth a try if looking for value for money and a different part of Manhattan.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They took our bags and told us to come back 30-60 mins later which we did. The hotel room was lovely! Nice decor, very clean bathroom - comb, razor, toothbrushes, toothpaste, shower gel, shampoo was all provided! Great shower, VERY quiet room which was pleasantly surprising as the hotel is literally next to Manhattan bridge - you couldn't hear anything apart from the hum of the trains on the track at about 6am which was fine for us as it was barely noticeable. Air conditioning was perfect. ice machine, vending machine, microwave, sink, paper cups, hot water, clean fridge, computer, printer was all provided the bottom floor in a room which is open from 7:30-22:30 - very convenient! \nAlways greeted by the very kind reception staff when we came in or out of the hotel. Every time we went out for the day, we would come back to an empty bin. \nThe night before we went home David told us about their taxi prices to the airport (JFK) and it was $40, whereas when we came it was $62 including tip! So it was a lot cheaper and convenient as they organised it all for us :-) \nThe surrounding area of Chinatown is very authentic and friendly, did not have a problem at all . We felt very safe there and everyone got on with their own thing.\nOverall, I think this is a brilliant place to stay in New York, worth the money and would 100% come again.\nDavid was very interested in us and the UK, asking us where is a good place to stay, and loved having good conversations with us - thank you David for having us - thank you ever so much!","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Este hotel tem um dos melhores pre\u00e7os de hospedagens, principalmente para quem como nos pretende passar mais que 5 dias. \nPontos positivos: \nLocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o: Poss\u00edvel ir a p\u00e9 ao memorial 9\/11. Esta\u00e7\u00e3o de metr\u00f4 (East broadway) ha 2 quadras do hotel. Est\u00e1 na \"cabe\u00e7a\" na Manhattan bridge e pr\u00f3ximo a Brooklyn bridge.

Nosso quarto foi privilegiado, mas \u00e9 poss\u00edvel sim ouvir Bayer de porta e vozes nos corredores.

No nosso caso nosso voo foi noturno e n\u00e3o tivemos problema, mas o hor\u00e1rio de entrada e as 16h e se chegar antes disso e bom torcer para conseguir um check-in antecipado.\nHa muitos restaurantes, mas nem todos ficam abertos at\u00e9 tarde. E os supermercado s\u00e3o bastante direcionados ao p\u00fablico chin\u00eas. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o for chin\u00eas, sugiro, como nos, ou comer antes de voltar ao hotel ou comprar sua comida de onde estiver e trazer. Outra coisa, alguns restaurantes tem card\u00e1pio exposto na frente s\u00f3 em chin\u00eas.\nN\u00e3o tivemos caf\u00e9 da manh\u00e3 no hotel e este \u00e9 um ponto dif\u00edcil na regi\u00e3o. E bom se organizar para ter algo para comer no quarto ou sair para comer na cidade porque na regi\u00e3o \u00e9 dif\u00edcil encontrar caf\u00e9 da manh\u00e3 \"convencional\".\nDica: atravessando a rua a direita de quem sai do hotel tem um restaurante bem simples de esquina onde todos os pratos custam 5 d\u00f3lares.

It was like staying in a noisy youth hostel.\n\nConstructive criticism for management - maybe investigate ways to reduce the noise from every door loudly slamming shut?\n\nAdditionally, both our cards to the room failed on numerous occasions, requiring us to go downstairs to reception to get replacements, and over 4 days the cleaners did little more than make the bed (e.g., the full trash can was emptied maybe once?).\n\nPositives: The shower was terrific (hot with great pressure).
