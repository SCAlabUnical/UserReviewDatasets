The hotel's distinct ambiance, characterized by moody, dimly lit hallways and rooms, imparted a particular atmosphere that, while captivating for some, might not entirely align with everyone's tastes. One noteworthy issue we faced was a light out over the closet, which created a visibility challenge. Though we reported it, the solution came in the form of lamps rather than a light bulb replacement. \n\nThe room's temperature controls presented their own quirk, seemingly adhering to a consistent temperature of around 69 degrees, regardless of our adjustments for heating or cooling. Nonetheless, the hotel's location close to the subway was undeniably convenient, although it's vital to mention that the nearby food pantry attracted a lot of displaced individuals, leading to their occasional presence around the building. Additionally, on the day we checked out, one of the elevators was unfortunately out of service, causing a bit of a bottleneck.\n\nIn terms of rating, the Maramara Park Ave Hotel seems to sit comfortably within the realm of a 3-star experience, not quite reaching the pinnacle of a full 5-star establishment. \n\nDespite these nuances, the hotel's rooms were a breath of fresh air\u2014spacious, comfortable, and perfect for unwinding. The darker ambiance might not suit everyone, but for those who appreciate a cozier setting and prioritize a conveniently located stay, it offers a unique charm.\n\nOne distinctive touch we encountered was the pervasive scent of bergamot throughout the hotel. While some might find it pleasant, I personally found it a touch overpowering, especially as it extended to the soaps and lotions provided.\n\nOverall, the Maramara Park Ave Hotel offers an experience tailored to those who appreciate its specific atmosphere, convenient location, and unique scent. It's an excellent choice for those seeking something a bit different, but perhaps not the best fit for those desiring a more traditional or versatile accommodation experience.\n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I really wanted to have a fridge & microwave in my room and this is not an easy thing to find in NYC unless one pays top dollar. I was hesitant at first, because it isn't located in an area I was looking. It's on the east side, Murray Hill.\nLiterally from the first phone call I made to the moment I checked out, every single one of the people who work at this establishment were professional, kind, helpful & so, so friendly. I cannot say enough about the level of their professionalism & service; both those who are the face of the hotel in reception, etc. and those in the reservations office. Before checking in, I was given a little tour, on request. I was given literally every single thing I asked for during my stay (extra coffee for the Nespresso machine in the room, for eg!). Nothing was too much of an ask! And they managed to maintain this level of service throughout my stay, which was 12 nights in total, with a short break in between. I even requested the same room on my three-night return and they obliged.\nThe hotel itself is stylish and has a \"boutique\" feel. There's gentle, calming music in the lobby. The restaurant is in the lobby too, but slightly \"hidden\" around a corner, so there isn't a busy feel to it. There is lounge-type seating on one side of the lobby and tables\/ chairs for the restaurant, on the other. So one has a plethora of choices of where to chill, should one not want to be in the room or on the streets. Their roof top bar has gorgeous views & excellent service. My room had a balcony and was so much larger than anything else I've seen anywhere, far less in NYC. Much to my surprise for a NYC hotel, it was also really quiet.\nLastly, the hotel has a wellness centre in it's basement. Besides massage services (at a cost, obviously), there is a gym, a hammam and slightly heated, SALT WATER(!!!) pool that is just glorious.\nI was so glad that I got over my desire to be in a different neighbourhood of the city, because I loved this hotel so very much and will definitely return. I got used to that side of town pretty quickly. It also helps that the number 6 train (that runs all along the east side of the city) is a half a block from the hotel's front door! And there are buses on every avenue on either side of the hotel. As one who loves Indian food, \"Little India\" is three blocks away, where one has an endless number of restaurant choices at the most reasonable costs. Of course, there are other cuisines and restaurants in the area too, all within a few blocks","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

We had two full size bedrooms (the second bedroom could also accommodate an full-size extra bed for our third child), two bathrooms (the master en-suite being enormous), a lounge and full kitchen plus washing machine and separate dryer for those who need to turn some clothes around).  We were blown away by the space and comfort this provided. 3. The bed and sheets are super comfy - loved them 4. There is a pool, gym and turkish bath for a bit of jet lag recovery \/ exercise (including a Peloton Bike) 5. There is a restaurant and rooftop bar - I have to admit to not taking advantage of these as we were out and about, but they are here if you want. 6. The staff are fabulous - super friendly and helpful.  In particular, I would like to give a big shout out to Lesley and Angie who helped us with a late check out on our final day when our flight home got cancelled and we needed time to sort out a plan - THANK YOU plus, Mayerly, who checked us in and was super kind to our son who was travel sick and vomited on the lobby floor as he entered the hotel after the car journey from the airport.  You were an angel and we won't forget your kindness.  THANKS MANMARA PARK - you rocked.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Rude manager","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-05-08","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"We recently stayed at your hotel for 2 nights from Sunday night in room 1209. Whilst the room had been paid for already, at check-in your colleague made a mistake and charged me again for another $698. Mistakes happen. He confirmed that the manager would call my room within a couple of hours to confirm the refund has been made and that they will instead block $150 for incidentals. \n\nThe manager, Cassandra never called. At night, I spoke to another colleague who then confirmed again that a mistake had been made and that the manager would call me on Monday morning. I had left my mobile number and email, but no calls.  There was also no message left on the room phone. When I insisted on speaking to Cassandra, a 3rd colleague connected me with her. She suggested that she had called my room (no voicemail, no message) and still no refund. She said she would email in the morning to confirm that a refund will be made. This email was never sent.  When I expressed my dissatisfaction at no communication from her, and no action, she rudely asked me to check out and that she would refund my whole stay. I left the hotel shortly thereafter (instead of staying for the full 2 nights). Still no refund.   How is this rudeness tolerated and lack of customer service permitted by your hotel? I have no issues with your colleagues Tyrell, Angie, Tylor. However, your manager, Cassandra clearly does not take courteous guest relations seriously.\n\nI am writing this review several weeks after my trip, and I can confirm that I have only received a partial refund of the over-charge.  Whilst you have claimed that Cassandra insists that she tried to call me, there is no evidence of this at all.  Perhaps you can clarify how she tried to contact me?  When can I expect to receive a refund for my stay?  This is the only acceptable redress given the way we were spoken to by your manager, and the lack of concern from your staff.   I should not have to follow up continually to correct a mistake your team has made.  To this day, no one has called me or emailed me directly from Marmara Park Avenue to apologise or explain what is being done.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Is it perfect no, but from my point of view comes pretty close, especially the rooms. The staff are welcoming and friendly and very responsive.\n\nLoved the spaciousness, high ceilings, artwork, and cleanliness of my room. The bathroom was beautiful, however one drawback was there is no bathroom counter space, and so if you're someone who likes to lay out your toiletries then this will bug you. Could easily be fixed by hotel if they installed a couple of small shelves in the bathroom. Other than that I think the rooms are amazing. \n\nIn my room there were tiny issues like the toilet wouldn't stop running unless you remembered to manually stop it by pushing the flush pad that gets stuck - again an easy fix for the hotel to address along with the casing on the door handle that kept falling off. However, these are small niggles and would definitely not prevent me from staying again. I intend to make this my default hotel stay whenever I am in the city.

The good things first; the location is top notch right off a 6 train metro station in the heart of Midtown. We received an upgrade to a 1BR apartment suite which would normally go for double we paid for a regular two queen room.\n\nFirstly, I'd like to say that the 'spa' is pretty much non-existent. The pool looks way more appealing in the advertising. In reality it's a rancid, unkept dungeon. The 'turkish bath' wasn't functioning at all (temperature was way too low) and there was a persistent smell of urine which I only know from the restrooms at train stations. Further there were two staff on duty which were rather unmotivated and pissed to answer questions. Secondly, we needed a murphy bed prepared since we initially booked a room with two seperate beds. The staff that showed up spoke no english, we needed to actively help them and then they left leaving the bedding unmade (!) on the bed. I had to call twice to get them back to actually make the bed. Hilarious.\n\nThis hotel has a 2 star service and probably is more like a 3 star property.

We were very appreciative of the housekeeping staff. Not only just clean, but one morning we were not quite out the door yet when housekeeping knocked and she was so friendly and agreed to come back in an hour. She also saw there were 4 of us and left us enough towels (we had to request more when we first arrived). We ordered room service a few times and it was good and delivered in a timely manner. The mattresses and linens were very comfortable. The size of the room was an unexpected surprise. However, we wish they had taken some space from the room and given it to the bathroom. The bathroom was so tiny there was hardly room to move. We were thankful for the kitchenette because that was where we brushed our teeth and did our makeup, as there is zero counter space in the bathroom, not even enough to put a tube of toothpaste. The toilet is so low to the floor, my 43 year old body almost needed assistance getting on and off lol. The hotel is in need of some tlc, things are definitely looking dingy. Dinged up furniture, chips in the paint, messy caulk in the bathrooms, etc. I  also have some new dings in my shins from the corners of the platform beds - ouch. Our entire floor reeked of marijuana 3 out of the 4 days we were there. It once woke us up at 4am it was so strong.

There\u2019s a pool in the basement (a big winner with the kids) and a kitchenette in the larger-than-average and extremely well appointed and clean hotel room.  It certainly looks very starry, perhaps even the five of them that it claims.\nSo why the three star review? \nBeware mutton dressed as lamb my friends. This is a brilliant three star mid-range hotel, but that\u2019s about as far as it goes. Think of it as a really classy top of the range holiday inn and you\u2019re about there. \nWhy? There\u2019s no bar and restaurant, well there is, but it\u2019s basically the hotel lobby with a few tables and pot plants chucked in. It\u2019s certainly not somewhere you\u2019d feel comfortable sitting and having dinner or breakfast. The menu is extremely limited and the wine list at the bar is mostly unavailable, but they do have a large selection of Turkish reds for you to try, which are all awful. The corridors are SO dark (this is a thing now, apparently) that you need a phone torch to find your way. Reception isn\u2019t really that helpful, check-in seemed like an inconvenience to them and there was no question of anyone helping this single dad with two daughters (having jumped straight off an 8 hour plane journey) to the room at midnight - just a wave of \u2018there\u2019s the elevator\u2019.  The laundry bag left outside of the room for the \u2018same day service\u2019 the next day failed to materialise before check-out two days later. When pressing the hotel on the matter they eventually found it in later that afternoon in a cupboard - it had never been sent, so off we went in filthy clothes. Rather than an apology or at very least a nod to the inconvenience, we were met with \u2018well, we can\u2019t guarantee a same day service\u2019. That\u2019s not hospitality, that\u2019s rude.\nThe location is fine, it\u2019s certainly quiet and out of the way so you\u2019re not kept awake all night by the horns and sirens. Don\u2019t expect the hotel to help you with directions or local deli\/restaurant recommendations, they simply don\u2019t have the info. \n\nThis hotel is ok.

The beds were excellent and exactly the level of comfort required after averaging 30k steps a day!\n\nThe hotel was clean and well presented, perfect to celebrate a birthday trip. It did seem extra special to be there in December because it was decorated for the holidays beautifully. As a birthday surprise we were greeted with a lovely cheeseboard and prosecco for our first evening which really helped start the celebrations.\n\nThe hotel location itself is ideal - it's midtown on 32nd\/Park Avenue and is right on the subway #6 line which is great if you want to get downtown quickly. Close to a traditional American diner great for breakfast on 33rd\/Lexington, ATMs and Macy's. It's also easily walkable to Union Sq and Times Sq.\n\nThe staff were superb, from the desk staff (Paul, Omar & Mayerly) to the doormen who were all super friendly and always keen to assist. But special thanks go to Kajsa who went above and beyond even before we arrived to make our stay perfect. When the testing rules unexpectedly changed during our stay Kajsa was on hand to assist and arranged for a COVID testing firm to come to us at the hotel and test us for free, which not only saved us a lot of $$$, but also allowed us to maximise our last two days to enjoy and explore New York.\n\nIf we return to New York we will be sure to stay at the Marmara Park Avenue and couldn't recommend it to others enough!!!","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I\u2019ve stayed in countless hotels and rarely post a review unless a Hotel is exceptional. Marmara Park Avenue is magnificent! I was thoroughly impressed by the staff, the accommodations, and the location. I love the fact that a parking structure is located adjacent to the hotel. I checked in late in the afternoon, so the parking structure was full, and could not accommodate my large Cadillac SUV, so I parked down the street. I walked in To the Marmara to check in. I was instantly impressed with the beautiful lobby. I was cheerfully greeted by Herdi and Kajsa upon arriving. I mentioned to Herdi that there was no space left for my SUV, so he gave me an upgrade to a suite with a kitchenette! I arrived upstairs I was delighted to see a super clean, modern and very large room! I love the view of NYC from the window, and the Nespresso coffee machine, the  large TV and the iPad was awesome to see as well! I slept like a baby within 30 minutes. The next day I woke up to fresh coffee in the lobby, and very cheerful, attentive  staff. Paul was at the front desk and gave me several new coffee capsules for my room. Upon returning later in the evening I heard a singer performing live in the lobby. I would up extending my stay two times, and the only reason I left was to avoid a snow storm that was heading to NYC. During the stay I enjoyed the fabulous Midtown Manhattan neighborhood with its excellent restaurants, beautiful views of the Empire State Building, and all the elegance of Park Avenue, that I had read about. Everyone at the Marmara Park Avenue, and even the Parking attendants next door, showed me such kindness and attentiveness that I consider them to be friends! They are wonderful ambassadors for the New York City! I look forward to visiting New York again, and I will most definitely be staying at Marmara! I can\u2019t wait to go swimming in the fabulous pool next time I\u2019m there. My advice if you are going to visit New York, is to book yourself a room at The Marmara Park Avenue!

We went into the room extremely disappointed because there were no shower stall and only a curtain between the sink\/toilet and the shower. We called to request a different room and was told they were sold out of double queens. We were pretty upset because the room appeared in need of renovation and not what we expected from a 5 star accommodation that cost $450\/night. The concierge offered a king room but the space was much smaller and my sister and I wanted more space. After that, they didn\u2019t do anything more to make our stay better despite giving our room away. To make matter worse, we asked for more towels in the evening - never received them. Then the next day when we left our room, the cleaning staff came into our room without our consent to drop it off while we weren\u2019t there. We felt that our privacy was violated since our personal belongings and valuables were left out. \n\nThe hotel is in dire need of a renovation - chipping walls, elevator wallpaper held up by scotch tape. They also seem to be sort in staff and the rooftop bar was a small balcony with a few small tables and sofas. The decor was tacky. \n\nI would not recommend you stay here if you want 5 star services, accommodations or amenities. The location is great but there are better hotels nearby.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

When we returned we knew exactly where we were going to stay.  Our prior hotel at which we have stayed for the past 8-years on the UES of NYC unfortunately closed permanently due to the pandemic; however, there is a sister property in Midtown East - The Marmara Park Avenue.  I have stayed there on several occasions previously, but this is the first time as a family.  Marmara - Park Avenue never disappoints.  The hospitality of every staff member is outstanding.  The suites are some of the best in the city, and the location is excellent.  Highly recommend The Park Avenue property for anyone visiting NYC.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Not sure if because of Covid or what, but it's really run down and not very clean. Everything is a bit dirty if you look closely, with a few items left by other guests in my room and the shower stall less than clean. The tiny balcony could have been a nice touch, but it was very neglected. The view itself is crap, so they need to spiff things up a bit.\nThe pool area and the water were so cold it made swimming unpleasant, and the couch was stained. The decor looked cheap and peculiar as well. The whole downstairs area was really sad and tacky. Are they about to remodel? There were bits and pieces in disrepair.\nI was disappointed by how much I spent and the quality of the accommodations, and, oddly, the room I was given had what I could tell after closer observation, a Murphy bed. Also, no fridge in the room, which is usually a given. I actually needed store some items and didn't think to ask while reserving. Was told I could store things in with staff, but then I would have had to go downstairs every time I nee something.\nI would not stay here again unless they  make some major improvements.\nWas quiet though, and the room was nice and dark for sleeping.

Upon checking in, the front desk agent asked how old my kids were (12 and 15) and then I was told that there would be an additional charge of $65\/per night for my 15yo. Nowhere on the website does it ask for children's ages (like on hotels.com or or other third party sites). IT IS COMPLETELY WRONG TO ADD THAT CHARGE AFTER WE ARRIVE WHEN IT IS TOO LATE TO CANCEL WITHOUT PENALTY! We come into the city every chance we can get since we live 35 minutes away and have stayed in many different hotels, looking for our favorite ones and never has this happened in other hotels. The website should indicate additional charges for kids above a certain age so that a person who is deciding between hotels can make an informed decision.

Good quality bathrobes and slippers\n* Good sized exercise room reasonable stocked with equipment including free weights, treadmill, eliptical, rower, etc.  EXCELLENT pool and lovely hammam....exceptional for this sized hotel.

Lobby area walls, furniture, etc are worn and dirty and need maintenance immediately.  Likewise the interior of the elevators.\n* . The elevators are annoyingly slow even at off hours.\n* . In this day and age, every hotel should have bedside outlets....NONE.\n* . Zero counter space in the bathroom is a huge inconvenience\n* . Service can be a bit spotty.

I expected a spacious studio and hoped that we would get a balcony. \nThis was the most disappointing hotel I have ever stayed in. \nIt\u2019s in no way a 5* and unfortunately the disappointment is not rectified by the staff. \nA couple of days before travelling to New York we got an e mail to say the changes we requested for had been done and that the new cost would be roughly another $1000. Which is shocking to say the least. \nWe called the hotel to clarify and after argument we had the pricing reversed to the original. \nAt check in we were early, but they stored our bags and they promised to call and let us know when the \u2018studio\u2019 was ready. They did. \nOnce we went to the room I was shocked with the small size it was. It was actually smaller than the standard and double rooms that they advertise. I looked at photos on their direct website, trip advisor and booking.com before booking and they all matched so I was satisfied I would get something along those lines however the difference is quite drastic. \nI asked the receptionist what room we were in and she reluctantly said a studio and that it was one of the smaller size ones, also that the hotel was full and could not change it. \nI told her about the advertised photos and she said that they get this from booking.com all the time as they advertise the wrong photos !! I told her that all websites advertise the same photos but then she just argued and said there was no space. She also said that if we wanted a bigger studio it would cost more and if we wanted a balcony it would cost even more\ud83d\ude21 she said we should have called the hotel after making the booking to make sure we would get a studio with space. But there was no space and nothing she could do. \n\nWhen I returned to the room I saw housekeeping and asked again. That lady said our room was a standard and not a studio!\ud83d\ude33\nSo .. what do you do ? Start looking for another hotel and loose payment ?\nThen I started to understand. You make a booking through booking.com thinking you\u2019ll get a spacious studio with possibly a balcony. They don\u2019t charge you until you go there. They try to up the charges before you arrive. If you challenge the additional cost you get downgraded and they call a standard room a studio! I feel that this is the biggest scam hotel. And felt rather stupid for falling into their trap. \n\nThat aside, we stayed and had no contact with any of the staff. \n\nThe location is ok, just a little out of the way. \n\nThe room could have been cleaner. There were stains on the carpet and one of the towels was dirty. The bathrobes were frayed. \n\nThere was a nesspresso machine which was great. \n\nThe bathroom was tiny with no space for your own personal effects. The shower pressure was good however there was issues with hot water and we had to complain almost daily to get it working. \n\nThe room lighting was very bad. No ceiling lights at all. And no sufficient lamps. \n\nThe hotel in general could use better maintenance. \n\nI never used their spa or pool. \n\nI would never stay here again. \n\nIf you choose to, contact them in advance . Ask them to send you photos of the room you will get. Confirm the pricing in advance. Be ready to pay their resort fees. \n\n","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When you walk inside- you know you are walking into an elegant but not stuffy boutique hotel.  It is understated, tasteful, and modern.  The interior design elements chosen for the lobby are so memorable- from the glass entryway, to the modern bronze statues, to the flying bird installation to the sleek sofas.  The restaurant and bar in the lobby don\u2019t overrun the lobby- it isn\u2019t a party atmosphere- it is a sophisticated elegant atmosphere you can be comfortable to have a meal or a drink, wait for friends or just enjoy the decor.  \n\nThe staff is very friendly.  The restaurant is very willing to work with any dietary restrictions you may have and make modifications to the dishes as they are able.  The front desk staff seems genuinely happy to be working here and greets you cheerily with a smile, and with repeat visits, they make you feel like you have just returned home.  \n\nIm obsessed with our room- so much so that its our 2nd time in the same room!  My daughter, my luggage, and I have plenty of personal space!  I love that we are not on top of each other!  It is very difficult to find hotel rooms in Manhattan that are not the size of shoe boxes and do not show the wear and tear on the property.  The Marmara is a standout on this point.  We don\u2019t have to shimmy around our beds and luggage to walk around the room or go to the bathroom.  Because there is enough space to live and exist, you can walk upright unhindered, and really enjoy the room without bumping into anything because the room functions actually the way it was designed to be used.  The room itself is chic and beautiful.  The entire room has dark wood floors and much of the custom furniture is made of the same.  We have 2 super comfortable queen sized beds a large window, and a kitchenette.  One of the things I love most is being able to make myself tea in the evening with a proper super clean hot water pot.  The marble bath isn\u2019t big- but it is really nice and clean and has C.O. Bigelow Pharmacy products throughout, as well as cushy bathrobes and comfy bedroom slippers.  \n\nIn case you need it- there is space for your glam squad.  You don\u2019t actually have use your bed as a staging\/seating area for anything.  There are sensible, appropriate height chairs, a beautiful small glass dining table, plenty of outlets, and space to maneuver. \n\nAnother plus is that the 6 train is literally right outside of the hotel, and the next stop is 42nd Street where you can connect through to pretty much every train line.  \n\nThis is our new favorite spot we will be returning to on the regular!  In case you are checking out the hotels in this area, we also tried the Mondrian which is a block away and it did not hold a candle in any way to The Marmara.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Travel being a lifestyle function, each city I frequent across North America, Asia, Europe, and the South Pacific consists of one hotel that I call home. In NYC, that's the Marmara Park Avenue. I've stayed many places... The Plaza, Four Seasons, Ritz, etc. The Marmara tops all of them here. \n\nI love city views. The 280 degree view of the entire Manhattan skyline from the roof rivals being atop the Empire State Building (which you can see, just up the street). The rooms are well refined, without sacrificing homeliness and comfort. The bed is amazing. Located between Park and Lex on 32nd... FiDi, Gramercy Park, Greenwich, Meatpacking, NoMad, Midtown, and Central Park are all easy access (relatively speaking, it's NYC). The subterranean work out facility, pool, and turkish bath are second to none. \n\nMore important than anything to me and above all at this hotel are the staff. I have never been treated more like a resident, friend, valued guest, and family member than at the Marmara. From my first stay forward, everyone knew my name and greeted me when I walked in and left the building. Need quick dry cleaning and the in-house loads were sent out for the day? Yolanda and her amazing staff will find the nearest spot, take your items, and have it back same day. You do not find this type of personal-professional touch anywhere, especially in Manhattan.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":6610567,"title":"Plusses and Minuses but Overall Good","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-07-08","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"Recently wrapped up a 3-day \u201cstaycation\u201d here and here is my honest review.  I will caveat this by saying I know Manhattan and specifically chose this hotel due to its proximity to Koreatown which is two blocks away.\nFirst, the area is very convenient for thise travelling by train or subway, as Penn is a few blocks away and the 6 stops right on the corner if coming from Grand Central.  Also, the area is very quiet on weekends as it\u2019s off Park on 32nd so far enough away from Penn\/KTown\/Herald Sq area but close enough to walk.  Downside is there\u2019s a homeless services center literally right next door so lots of homeless congregate at all hours right near hotel entrance and particularly during mealtimes and also at the corner near Subway.  However this is not the hotel\u2019s fault and NYC has homeless everywhere anyway so it doesn\u2019t faze me.  Now to the hotel itself.  We enjoyed a 1 BR \u201csuite\u201d, wet bar (not the full kitchen) on 15th floor with views of Chrysler and Empire State Building.  We specifically asked for this view and thankfully request was honored.  I can say that it looks like the only balcony rooms were on the 13th, 15th and 17th floors so most rooms do not have a balcony.  frankly, not sure you need it as after one night the thrill wore off.  The room itself was nicely appointed with two massive Samsung tvs (one remote didnt work but I didnt complain).  The wet bar is nice and it had nice furnishings and bedding.  The bathroom is very small but we got by and the water pressure was outstanding.  \nThe Hotel lobby is nice, we had breakfast there one day and the food was okay, very overpriced but not unexpected.  Lobby bar is understaffed (as is hotel in general).  \nThe pool and Hammam in basement are very nice.  We went to pool twice and were only ones there.  Pool is 4 feet to 4\u20196\u201d and has life guard.  Hours were 7-9.  The Hammam was stunning and a true luxury.\nThe rooftop bar was nice and offered open views of July 4 fireworks which we enjoyed however was understaffed and dis not have full drink or food menu.  Also, the last night we were there the hotel literally pasted a note in the elevator at like 8 pm that it was closed for private party which was disconcerting as we had planned to go up there after we came back from dinner.\nAlso the service.  I wouldnt say it\u2019s bad I would say it\u2019s more nonexistent.  It seems more a corporate housing hotel or one for those like me who don\u2019t really need blanket service while in NYC.\nOverall a fine hotel probably a solid four stars (nowhere near five).","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Bad start - as a swimmer, I\u2019d chosen this hotel as it has a nice basement pool, just room for 3 people to do laps.\n, so naturally I want to know when the spa and pool opened. The girl at reception first of all had us sign a list of monetary penalties we\u2019d incur for stealing items from our room ; breakages ; smoking in the room and more !! Welcome to the Marmara ! She confirmed that the pool opened at 9am,so in the morning, I woke early,but hung around waiting for 9am only to discover, when going to the pool,that it actually opened at 7am !!\nAm expensive midtown hotel,and our basic room was small,and with a bathroom without anywhere to put all our toiletries,so naturally these and other items had to be placed on top of the drawer unit and fridge provided. Unfortunately, despite the limited room size, the huge bed impeded movement,so that my wife and I were constantly trying to avoid bumping into the very sharp corner of the bed base without success. Finally coming back on our final night at 9.30pm I bumped again but this time,the sharpness of the corner made a severe gash on my leg. Luckily we had ice in our room,and with that wrapped in towelling,it stemmed the blood flow only after a half hour or so. In the morning we reported this to 2 receptionists who told us their admin boss was on her way back to NYC and would like to speak to us. Not possible,as we were returning to UK,the Spain shortly,but my wife had taken 3 rather gruesome photographs,which one of the staff couldn\u2019t look at. We did email the management lady,including these photos,and a rather pointless weak reply arrived a few hours later.\nNo further correspondence resulted after I made it clear that waiting to hear her apologising would have been a complete waste of our time anyway. We all understand that \u2018sorry\u2019 is the most abused word in the English language unless accompanied with some form of compensation, which to date, has not happened.\nAll in all a disappointing experience in a hotel which looks better online than what you get in facilities and service. I still have these photographs for anyone interested.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Here is some of the good and the bad:\n\nPros:\n-Location - it's located right outside of the 6 train, and if if you walk two more avenues, you'll have access to the B, D, F, M, N, Q, R, and the Path train. Two more avenues in the opposite direction will take you to a load of restaurants, bars (warning - most of them are bro bars), a Target, and a Trader Joe's\n-They give you a pair of slippers. I've never seen this in an American hotel - only hotels in Asia, so this was a nice touch\n-They have an indoor pool, and a Turkish Bath you can use that's included in your stay. The bath is kind of like a sauna with wall to wall marble. It's nice to relax in there - however, it closes at 8:45\n-Next to the Turkish bath was a shower you can use to rinse off, which has 9 shower heads. Could have been nice if we were able to figure out how to get it to spray warm water, instead of water that was ice cold (especially since you're coming from a steam room)\n-There's an iPad they use for servicing - meaning you can order toiletries from it, select a time preference of when you want them to clean your room, and they even have turn down service!\n\nCons:\n\n-No fridge. These are apparently available in all rooms except for the standard one\n-There's a balcony but it's a bit weird - it's connected to the room next to yours so technically, strangers can walk over to your room from the balcony. Would be cool if you are traveling with friends, but creepy if you are not. Just be sure to keep those doors locked\n-Sink is small, so there's no where to really put your toiletries\n\nI don't know how much it was per night, but I'm guessing it was not cheap. But if you're willing to pay the price, this is a great hotel if you're visiting NYC. It's located in Midtown, so it's a good jumping point to explore Manhattan.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I stayed in Mid- April for a couple of days and the weather was a bit wacky but the complimentary umbrellas were a life saver. The room was decent, a bit on the small end but we did book the standard room but the Queen size bed was really comfortable. The wellness Center was amazing I slept like a baby. Upon arrival, I was impressed. I was greeted by Yari who gave us a complete overview of the hotel and was completely outstanding. The doorman Udu was also a charm. Highly loved their customer service and definitely recommend to look for them if you are there. It seemed though that not everyone else there was up to the same standard. The bar staff seemed very rude with one word answers but I think it's a language barrier? They did end up telling me that the hotel is Turkish. Also upon checking out with Natalia it all seemed so rushed, as if she was trying to get rid of us as quickly as possible which did not feel like 5-star service & was not a nice finish to our lovely stay =. I do always ask for names because I like to acknowledge those who deserve it. \nOverall, I recommend The Marmara 100%, it can really be a home away from home with the amenities it offers.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Here's a detailed review! Upon booking, I explained to the front desk that I am a new mom and would like a room that is quiet so I can get some sleep! The front desk assured me that they will do their best with my request. Upon check in, my partner and i dropped off our stuff and left. We didn't return to the room until it was time for bed (probably 9pm).  We got into bed, and were instantly terrified by the horrible creaking of the bed (if I could attach audio or video evidence I would!) We both looked at each other and \"uh-oh'ed.\" I know I should have called concierge to complain and be placed into a different room. Fearing that it would take another hour before that happens and potentially having more issues in a different room, we decided that once asleep, the creak wouldn't bother us. Alas, we kept waking each other up just from turning our head. Needless to say, I did not get any sleep. At 6am, I called and spoke with Yari Guzman, who told me that the manager isn't on site to address my complaint. I instantly called Expedia and explained the situation.  Very long story short, after almost two weeks of back and forth with the hotel, management told me the beds are new and refused to issue compensation leaving me no choice but to write this review warning other potential customers.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We weren't told why and we didn't ask, but the front desk did know we were sitting waiting for our room. \n\nThe room itself was clean and spacious, we had a room with a kitchenette area that we didn't need but I can see being very helpful for people staying for an extended period of time. The bathroom was on the smaller side, the toilet was practically pressed up against the wall. I am a bigger guy (6'2) and when I was on the toilet I pretty much had to sit sideways so my leg wasn't hitting the toilet paper holder. Sorry if this was TMI haha. \n\nThe highlight of the hotel should of been the indoor pool and the Turkish bath. We tried to use the area 4 times, all of the times we were met by a wall screaming children as soon as we exited the elevator. There didn't seem to be any rules as far as kids go, they were running back and forth from the pool to the Turkish bath which didn't make for a relaxing environment. \n\nThis was a critical review in a beautiful hotel, we would go back but not at the very high price this hotel normally costs. Maybe if I can find slightly inexpensive dates we will return as the location and potential is great.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This is unacceptable in our opinion, we had to ask for a menu and while one staff member brought it the other seemed to have disappeared. We ordered a drink each and asked if we could pop outside to look at the beautiful nigh time view to which the response was \u2018Yeah\u2019 not yes of course or good idea it\u2019s such a great view just \u2018Yeah\u2019. It was thanksgiving day evening and was exceptionally cold and windy so we didn\u2019t stay out there long just long enough to take a couple of pics and a quick Snapchat for friends and family back home. We came back in and sat down to enjoy our drinks, we were thinking of having a few as the menu offered more than 1 we wanted to try but the menu had been taken away and neither staff member was in sight, so we thought we would ask to see it again once we were almost ready to order again. Our minds changed because while we were sat chatting there was no interaction from either staff member no \u2018Soo have you had a good Thanksgiving\u2019 or \u2018what have you been doing today did you see the parade\u2019 nothing just an occasional head would pop out from behind the wall beside the bar. This made us feel very very unwelcome so decided we would leave, I had to go to the bar to ask for the check but no-one  was visible so I walked around the side of the bar where I saw both staff members were there playing on the phones again one sitting on a stool and the other leaning against the wall and in my opinion waiting for us to leave so they could continue to lounge in the chairs they had occupied before our arrival. We went back to our room and had a much earlier night than planned. Our check out the next morning was with a staff member we hadn\u2019t encountered before so we didn\u2019t mention the issue to her. Once we returned home I emailed the contact I had communicated with on numerous occasions and who had been most helpful as always her response was almost immediate and promised to pass on my concerns to the relevant head of department for further investigation. This is now a week ago and we have had no further contact which is very poor in our opinion hence the low rating. We will not return or recommend.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My room had black out blinds but they did not fit the windows properly, on the first morning I really wanted a lay in but it was impossible due to the poor fitting of the blinds and the terrible light which came into the room.

It is a Turkish-owned hotel and we found it very comfortable indeed.  We were given a very big room on the 14th floor, which had painted wooden floors which I so much prefer to carpets - you never know how clean the carpet is.  It was very quiet, we never heard the lifts or anybody else's doors opening or closing.  There wasn't a lot of space to put stuff in the bathroom:  some shelves would be good.  If you wish to eat, the \"restaurant\" is in the foyer, which is interesting as you can watch people go by.  But it is not romantic, if that is what you want!  The service was very good and friendly, and the hotel is within walking distance of Times Square and the theatre district.  And the Metro station with a direct line to the 9\/11 Memorial and Museum is just across the road, which made it very easy to get there.   We did not spend much time in the hotel, but were very happy with it when we were in it.  I don't know what our room cost, as it was included in a package deal with Imagine Cruising:  fly BA to NY, come back to the UK on the Queen Mary 2.   I would think it was probably very expensive,  But then, so is everything in New York, we found.

There was plenty of room to have a decent size bathroom. And hooks and shelving. \n\nWe were told that there was a Restaurant. But there were a few chairs in the lobby with a tiny bar. Breakfast was \u20ac36 plus tax plus service for a buffet continental offering in a soulless area. \n\nThe hotel location has one plus point. The subway station was very close. But there was nothing else close by, except Starbucks! \n\nAnd when we checked out we were told that there was nothing to pay. But a few days later they took $18 plus tax per day Resort Fee. We knew nothing about this and had booked 9 months in advance. We did manage to sort it out, but..\n\nSo we wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel.

It is located by Park Ave, meaning you can get to attractions like the Empire State or Herald Square with a few minutes walk. If you're there for business I'd recommend something more central , though. Rooms are large for NYC standards, the same goes for the bathroom with a really good shower and tub.\n\nCons:\n-Walls are thin, so be prepared to hear what goes on in other guest's rooms: couples arguing, TV, dogs barking (it is a pet friendly hotel), babies crying and couples making out.\n\n-The restaurant has a really limited menu.\n\n-A\/C was noisy and not really responsive to controls. It was not a dealbreaker to me at all, but I assume depending on the weather this can be a critical thing.\n-Possibility of early check in seems to be practically non-existent. I tried to arrange this prior to arrival with the concierge (who said would do the best to try to obtain a room), but ended up only being able to get a room way after the regular check-in time. While I totally understand that early check-in is in no way guaranteed (as mentioned by the concierge, they would do their best), I expected that at least I would be able to check-in in the regular time, which did not occur. Management was good in defusing the situation and I got a courtesy drink, though.\n\nPros:\n- The rooftop restaurant\/bar is very nice. While the menu is the same of the restaurant, so not a lot of options if you want to eat, the bar (and the wine menu) are excellent.\n\n-Staff is really helpful and friendly. Keep up with the good work guys!\n\n-Subterranean pool and the Turkish Hamam (it's like a turkish bath) are excellent to relax after a busy day in the city. Beautifully maintained, relaxed and family-friendly atmosphere.\n\n-Pricing is reasonable for a hotel of this level in NYC.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

He had saved up for months to treat me. \n\u2022\tHe told the Hotel that we would be coming to celebrate my birthday and asked them to put a happy birthday Note in the room, this was not done. \n\u2022\tOn arrival, no welcome drinks or anything that one usually gets at 5 star establishments after travelling for 24 hours from Cape Town, South Africa! \n\u2022\tWe asked the check-inn assistant, Michael, to please give us a room with a bath tub, he told us there would be a charge, we asked him to show us the original room, and then the upgraded option. \n\u2022\tThe original room, 13th floor was tiny, and the upgrade was spacious with a kitchenette. The cost to upgrade for the week we would be staying there was $75, we agreed, and paid Michael, who gave us change out of his wallet, which we found strange. \n\u2022\tWe did not ask for a receipt, as we usually get a bill at the end of our stay. \n\u2022\tI am Gluten intolerant so could not have the breakfast on offer, we queried this with the hotel, and asked if I could get an omelette (cheaper than the free breakfast on offer) and was told no. I literally had to go to target, buy gluten free bread, and bring it down to sit and have breakfast with my husband. \n\u2022\tAnd my husband also queried the lack of birthday note in the room, to which the response he got was \u2013 we gave you a free upgrade, wasn\u2019t that enough? \n\u2022\tHe mentioned that we had paid for the upgrade, and the response he got was no, you didn\u2019t. There is no payment on the system. He explained exactly what had happened, and still got the response, there is no payment on the system, and we can\u2019t help you.\n\u2022\tI then took to Tripadvisor to state our case, low and behold, a few hours later we get an email invitation to breakfast with Yolanda, Garcia. \n\u2022\tThe breakfast was awkward to say the least. She did not bring Michael, the person who had ripped us off to the meeting, or offer her apologies at first. \n\u2022\tInstead she told me that I am making very serious accusations. I explained the entire story and then she said yeah, she saw the footage, but Michael said it was a Tip. Her response to us then is \u201cI have the money, I have the $75, I can give it back to you\u201d. Of course we want our money back, we were conned by a member of your staff! \n\u2022\tThe most awkward thing is that she had us go back to the reception the next day to ask for the money back. She should have just given it back to us in the first place. \n\u2022\tWhen querying breakfast, and telling her about the unhelpful way the staff dealt with any queries (a simple solution would have been for one of them to order gluten free options and charge it to our room!), she said that all the breakfast staff during the time we stayed there were training. They weren\u2019t yet full members of staff. \n\u2022\tThe passing the buck attitude was appalling. She made us believe that there was something wrong with us for complaining in the first place. \n\u2022\tThe cherry on the top of all of this was the fact that she told us that she has a very high rating on tripadvisor, and that she will assist us with all the issues we may be having if we remove the rating. \n\u2022\tI did this for the duration of our stay, but feel very unsatisfied in the way that our query was dealt with. \n\u2022\tThere was barely an apology, and the attitude we got from Yolanda was one that made us feel as though we\u2019re a burden to the hotel. \n\u2022\tI\u2019ve stayed in many 5 star hotels in the world. And I can tell you that it\u2019s the attention to detail that matters. \n\u2022\tThis is a gorgeous hotel, get the service levels to a level that matches the beauty. \n\nThis was a very expensive holiday, one that we don't get to do often in our lives, and it was truly marred by the hotel experience, and the attitude of the staff. I was truly left with a pit in my stomach at the notion of being conned by a five star hotel, on the day we got to New York City.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The beds were comfortable with nice sheets. The downside for me was la k of any counter in bathroom to put toiletries or make up and poor lighting in room. There was lighting for reading but not for rest of room making it hard to locate clothing. There is also dim lighting in hallways which may be for either ambiance or to save energy, but I would have liked brighter hallways as well.\nThe lobby has large windows, and is very comfortable .

The room had a Murphy bed tucked in an alcove. There was no room on either side for nightstands and no lights at the bed. You take these things for granted until you have no place to put down a book or your glasses, which was really moot since there was no light at the bed anyway. \n\nThe bathroom was pleasant and clean, but there was absolutely no counter surface to put anything down.

Wasn't a fan of the fixed, half shower only partition as it prevents the immediate shower area from reaching optimal warmth as well as increases water from going onto the bathroom floor but that aside, everything else was fine.  The physical location of the hotel is also nice since it's close to various sites in the city but for the most part, in a quieter part of town (Murray Hill).

Was equipped with all the things you would need for a short break in a hotel .The hotel even had a swimming pool , spa and Turkish bath, which not many hotels have in New York , unless you stay in the really posh ones . The Marmara is a 5 * but is reasonably priced compared to other 5 stars .\n\nThe staff were very helpful , attentive and professional at all times , nothing was to much trouble for them. We were able to check in early which was a bonus and on the last day our luggage was securely stored for us , so we could spend a few more hours looking around New York before we left .\nIm am hoping to return to NYC in the future and I would stay in the Marmara Park avenue again .

It was a very cold January week and the plumbing in the hotel froze. We were on a high floor. \n\nWe chose the Marmara hotel mostly for the location, but also for its the elegant style and high rating. The modern and impressive foyer with two fireplaces, bar and a restaurant. \nWe knew we would be in and out of the hotel at all hours of the day and night,  as we arrived in town on moments notice for the birth of our granddaughter in a nearby NYU Medical Center. \n\nI made reservation over the phone mid-afternoon, on the day of our arrival. \nKing size room, high floor. Very helpful young lady ( Rishnu) assisted with the booking and parking details and promptly emailed back confirmation.\nWe were on our way. \nOn arrival we walked in the beautiful lobby and asked for a valet to park our car. After a while waiting, already checked in, no-one seemed available to park our car. Not wanting to leave the car on the street and risk a ticket, my husband parked the car in the garage himself, while I waited in the lobby. Just a slight inconvenience not expected in a 5 star hotel.\n\nOur room was fine at the first glance as was the bathroom with a walk in shower. New and modern. \nWe left the hotel quickly, to Uber over to the Medical center. \nExcited and happy we barely noticed how cold the room was, even when we returned briefly for about an hour. My husband adjusted the thermostat. Just after midnight we were again summoned to the hospital, this time for real. We were able to see the excited new parents and the baby. The hospital allows for family visit till 1:30 am. I am including this detail to show that we were in and out of the room that night and very early morning and did not realize how freezing the room was, till we returned. Too late to do anything at that point. And that was only the beginning of the hotels heating system problems. \nWe were freezing half of the night, using a thin shabby worn out blanket we found in the closet. We did not get much sleep, there was also a lot of noise from the pipes \"banging\" throughout the night. We left the cold room\/cold shower in the morning in a hurry to meet with the rest of the family in the Langone maternity center. \n\nWe came back to the hotel after late dinner.  We were stunned to come back to water pouring from the ceiling on our heads in the lobby. Staff feverishly mopping the floors. \nWe were shocked and disappointed because we picked Marmara for the elegant lobby, to enjoy with the rest of the out of state family for an after dinner drink by the fireplace. That was now out of the question. \n\nThe lobby, the bar, the restaurant , the fireplace were out of commission. Tired and frustrated about the situation we went to the room, which was thankfully not flooded, but of course extremely cold. We overheard guests in the elevator and lobby complaining about the same situation, freezing cold rooms. We had no time or energy to move, when it was offered. We thought it was hugely inconvenient and would be a waste of time after hearing others complain. Because the whole hotel's heating system was obviously affected, whether they admitted it or not. \n\nMy husband started to feel the effects of the two cold sleepless nights. He stayed in bed most of the next day. Best laid plans ruined. But he needed to recover some sleep before a ride home. We survived the third night coughing and they opened up the lobby restaurant by the time we were checking out. \n\nI spoke to Yolanda Garcia before we checked out and she comped one night of our three night stay. Even with that we spent a substantial amount of money that did not commensurate with the quality of our stay and seriousness of the hotel's problem. \nWe certainly did not expect our highly anticipated visit to Manhattan to turn into such nightmare.\n\nThe hotel also has a unique facility - Turkish bath(probably a good place to warm up) and a pool - and both were out of commission during our stay, or so we have been told. Surely this is also a part of what makes Marmara stand out and the room rates reflect that.  \n\nUpon return home I followed up with an email to Ms. Garcia, detailing our complaint and dissatisfaction. I have not heard back. \n\nI am convinced that a true 5 star hotel would have done more, as the comfort of their guests should be a high priority. \n\nWe travel extensively, chose high rated luxury hotels and expect the best. Needless to say we were hugely disappointed.  \n\nThroughout the ordeal, we found the front desk staff pleasant, apologetic and trying to be  helpful...\nThe valet parking if you can get it would have been $65\/24hrs for our large Benz, less for smaller sedan. The next door self park garage is convenient. \nThe location is great too, and if they get their heating\/cooling system fixed it could be a great place to stay. \n\nThe poor rating reflects our unfortunate experience in January....","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":7,"locationId":6610567,"title":"Unfortunately, a Very Bad Stay For Us","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-01-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Firstly, we really wanted to like this hotel like how we were initially impressed by photos and reviews to choose this hotel.\n\nBeing a 5 stars hotel, we booked this hotel for 6 nights as the hotel for our last half of our NY trip. We stayed in a 4 stars hotel during the first half our stay. The comparisons between the 4 stars hotel we stayed earlier and this are miles different. \n\nIn summary and TLDR, we changed room 5 times. It could have happened the 6th time but we got so sick of packing\/unpacking our luggage. \n\nIn detail:\n\n1st room - decently sized king sized bed with balcony. Lovely room except for the fact that there is no sofa but just a single chair for seating. The bathroom is tiny and inconvenient for two to get ready in. Air conditioning cools nicely but was making clicking noises every 30 seconds. The clicking noise could not be fixed by the engineering team (he knew about the issue and it is appalling how the hotel still putting guests in the room and hoping for the best) and thus a room change was offered. \n\n2nd room - Upgraded a higher class room but this room's air conditioning was not working properly. The lowest temperature for the hotel\u2019s rooms seem to be 21 degrees but the air conditioning here decides to cut off much more regularly and leaving the room stuffy and warm. We left the air conditioning on and hoping to come back to a chilled room after dinner. Unfortunately, the room was still stuffy and warm.\n\n3rd room \u2013 As we only found out about the issue late at night, the Night Manager upgraded us to an apartment sized room with separate bed room, living room, laundry and kitchen. Unfortunately, air conditioning was blowing but not cold air. It then thinks it hits the right temperature and cut offs refusing to start.  Again, we swapped rooms.\n\n4th room - Much larger loft sized room with a crazy large bathroom that had dual sinks. Now, two or even more people can get ready in this bathroom. The air conditioning here was effectively cooling such a large room. \n\nUnfortunately, the person who designed this large room\u2019s only bathroom was either trying to be funny or have not thought out how a regular shower occurs. Firstly, the only shower is by using the bathtub. However, there is no place to lodge the shower head on a handle to shower hands free. You have to hold the shower head to wash yourself. The water pressure is strong and while soaping yourself, you cannot just leave the shower head in the bathtub as the shower head will flying and spraying around in circles. Therefore, you have turn off the water and re-adjust the temperature again when turning on. Do you really expect guests to take a bath each time instead of a quick shower? \nMoreover, the hanger to hang your towel is placed around 10 feets away - meaning you have to get out of the bathtubs in the cold and wet to walk around the large bathroom to retrieve your towel. \n\n5th room - Considering we did want to go through all the hassles with just taking a normal shower and that this would be the fifth room change, we were angry. The next morning, we asked for the Duty Manager, whom agreed with the design flaws of the bathtub shower and hanging your towels. Further, we were advised that he encountered the same problems with some other rooms in the hotel with this bathroom design, and, management were actually looking in renovating the bathroom shower. He also offered free breakfast during our stay.\n\nThe fifth room that we were put in was back to an apartment sized room with separate bedroom and living area. The air conditioning works for the living area but not the bedroom. This time, we were so fed up we decided against changing rooms. Considering both air conditioning units were identical, it is blatantly obvious you can observe each unit\u2019s behavior as well as the cold air coming out to feel the room\u2019s temperature.\n\nOther than that, the breakfast was not great. Even though it was offered as compensation to the room changes, we skipped the remaining mornings. Again, comparing to the first hotel we stayed in, the selection was poor and even easy things like bread\/bagel are not fresh. The person serving the breakfast was also very unfriendly and refused to engage in a welcoming manner with hotel guests. Hello, it is breakfast, first meal of the day and you would nearly be the first other person that guests will interact with. \n\nNot a big issue to us but when we were there, the pool\/spa was closed. We were not told about this prior to booking our stay. \n\nLocation-wise, you are steps away from the Subway and good walk to most of Manhattan's must-dos. \n\nPerhaps it may be a New York thing with air conditioning being cold but the first hotel we stayed in, the air condition operates perfectly like how it should operate. \n\nSorry, we do not like rating a hotel a one star but our experience with this hotel was so horrible that it ruined our plan to end our NY trip on a good note.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The management sent a nice fruit platter to compensate for difficulties with the room.  The hammam was fun, but lacked service.  There were zero attendants.

I am so excited that I discovered the Marmara.  \n- This hotel is very luxurious.  The lobby is gorgeous and very refined.\n-The rooms are standard NYC size (which means not very large) but they are beautiful.  Some rooms even have a balcony.\n- All the staff are very friendly and tremendously helpful.  A special mention to Stephanie at the front desk who was instrumental in making sure all our needs and multiple rooming arrangements were sorted out.\n- the pool is very nice.  Far more elegant than any standard hotel pool.  And since it is a smaller hotel, it means less guests, and thus the pool was never crowded.\n- my favorite was the Turkish bath.  I don't even like saunas or steam rooms normally but I loved this one.  It is not too hot and it is very large, and once again not crowded at all.\n\nI will be back!  Both with the family or even on a romantic adult trip.\n\nOne observation - the balcony on my room was a shared balcony with another room.  I was surprised there was no divider on the balcony to maintain more privacy for the guests.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

However, it needed some better maintenance and maybe an upgraded continental breakfast - you can only have feta, olives and hard boiled eggs a couple of days in a row. \n\nThe poor service is the reason I won't return. The bellman was great however the young woman with glasses at the front desk was pretty annoying. First, she ignored me as she proceeded to rifle through some papers. Then finally I gave her my passport and credit card. She checked us in and then she started to talk about their amenities - adding \"but you don't have breakfast in your rate\" - and I let her do so. Then I proceeded to point out that my confirmation email which I showed her did indeed have daily breakfast, a welcome drink, a room upgrade and late check-out. But of course she only gave me breakfast vouchers for 1 day so I had to confirm with the booking agency that daily breakfast was included in the fee. Then she proceeded to ask me for photo ID for my fianc\u00e9, who was driving away to return the rental car, as well as mine. I honestly had to wonder if she was discriminating against us as we have never had to produce photo ID of both parties - the last time I did this I was in Russia 10 years ago. Then for some reason 2 of our Canadian credit cards weren't working even though they were just fine according to the bank. We had to use a US credit card. Maybe they have an outdated IT system. She was not trained by a 5 star hotel or if she was, she failed the grade.\n\nGenerally, you can tell when a hotel is doing well and the employees are happy. This did not feel like one of them. We all want to feel like our hotel is a home away from home and being at the Marmara felt like a punishment.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Needless to say when you book a 5 star hotel and pay similar prices to such it's what you expect when you arrive but, as nice as this hotel was, it wasn't a 5 star.  Perhaps it's EXPEDIA's fault in that they're not rating the hotel accurately but when I book a hotel that is 5 star rating I expect a little more attention to detail.\n\nOverall however, the hotel is good let me sum up why:\n\n1.  The hotel rooms are clean as is the hotel in general except for our bar encounter\n2.  The staff are friendly and very helpful\n\nHowever there are areas for improvement which are:\n\n1.  The one (and it then became the only time) we had a drink in the bar I found flies in my drink.  Small annoying flies that weren't flying around me when the drink was served so they must've landed in my drink en route to my table.  For this reason we didn't go back for another drink nor did we ever eat there.  My glass that held my drink wasn't clean either and smudged.\n\n2.  The bar area and general reception area whilst decorated white is \"scuffed\" with black marks along the bottom of the decor which again, I'm a stickler for attention to detail but it does show the hotel as needing some improvement in some areas\n\n3.  The downstairs toilets whilst they are individual units are unisex.  This is a personal bug bear of mine I prefer to keep my toilet separate from gents especially when I once entered and found the toilet seat up and urine over the basin.  Sorry to any men reading this but this is why women generally prefer their own toilet I know you're not all like this!  My husband doesn't feel the need to wee all over the seat but let's keep the toilets ladies and gents anyway shall we?\n\n4.  The mattress on our bed became \"inverted\" as my husband and I slept on it so we would essentially roll into each other.  My husband and I are average size but a decent mattress shouldn't allow for that.  The bed itself was also too high off the floor.  I'm 5ft6\" and shouldn't have to slide off the bed I was also 14 weeks pregnant so didn't feel particularly comfortable with a bed that high off the floor I had to hop onto it which anyone who's pregnant\/been pregnant will tell you isn't a great idea.\n\nIn short this hotel has the promise of being great but didn't quite live up to it nor did it live up to what we were told by EXPEDIA (rightly or wrongly) was 5 star quality.  The staff however were great I will give it that.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are spacious, there\u2019s a subway stop steps away, and the in-room amenities are well-suited for longer-term guests. All you really need is a toothbrush and your clothes because mouthwash, shower gel, lotion, a shower cap, vanity set, shampoo, and conditioner are all provided. The room also has a mini (but larger than usual) refrigerator, tea kettle, coffee maker, toaster, and dishes. If you need an iron, you can request one. \n\nWhile I think the hotel is a really good option for longer-term guests, there were some things that I wished were different. When we arrived, a valet staff person wasn\u2019t outside or immediately available. I had to go in and try to find someone to help us, so it wasn\u2019t an ideal first impression. Aside from that, the staff (including the valet staff) were super professional and seemed willing to assist in any way.  (I really thought they were exceptional.) The hotel was clean and had a nice aromatic scent, but I was just a bit underwhelmed. The elevators were a bit dark and the room doors a bit scuffed. The stand-out was the balcony, which we really enjoyed. \n\nOverall, I give the hotel a rating of very good, especially for longer-term visitors to the city.

No throngs of tourists passing by (though there were a few people smoking off to the side of the hotel entrance which was not necessarily appealing) or incessant traffic noise. \nWe loved staying at The Marmara and wished we could have extended our stay but I think we're started a family tradition and will surely be making our way there again, next year.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When I checked in a regular room was not available so I was upgraded to a suite. The room was huge for just one person. The bed was comfortable, however, the bathroom was small and there was no place to put my makeup bag so I ended up getting ready in the huge closet that was there. The shower door is a partial door so when you take a shower, the cool air from the bathroom goes into the shower. The pressure however in the shower was great. The biggest downfall for me was the air condition. I did set the air condition to be 66, however, it never seem to get cold in the room.

Stay was mixes with some strong positives but also negatives. \n\nFirst, the rooms were nice and spacious (for NYC standards) fitted with a small kitchen, giving the room a serviced apartment feel. Great if you have little ones. The bathrooms were a touch small though. The room also had unobstructed views (again for NYC standards) and a great balcony.\n\nSecond, the area was relatively quiet, away from the throng of tourists. Also quite close  to decent restaurants\/ bars, midtown etc. \n\nThird, the indoor pool was a great respite from the NYC summer heat.\n\nUnfortunately the bad news. My wife lost her bracelet in the room. We had to chase up security to look into this matter. Security informed me they would contact me after checking the video tapes but we still have not heard back from them after leaving our email addresses. The hotel at least, could write an email acknowledging the issue.\n\nLast, i did not try the food despite staying 4 nights. We just found lots of great places nearby serving brunch (sarabeths, le pain quotidien) and a couple of handy late night delis.\n\nIf you are going to stay here, ask for a higher level room with a balcony at the back of the building.\n\n","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location was great for getting all around especially since the subway is on the corner. Staff was personable, helpful, and informative.  The room was immaculate and very tastefully furnished.  We took the large suite which is basically an oversized studio with a kitchenette and office corner.  The negatives are what I read in other reviews before booking--small things that really didn't matter.  The bathroom was a bit small with only one sink and not a lot of room to put toiletries.  For some reason , we were put in a handicap accessible bathroom and so the shower floor was part of the bathrooom and thus the water got on the floor in the bathroom.  Also, I would have preferred a small couch in the room instead of the two small, short chairs near the windows.  The kitchenette was a nice bonus with a table and two chairs, but we didn't really need it.  Next time, I will book the deluxe guest room and pay less for the space I really need. The bed was comfortable.  Great towels and robes.  The gym was more than adequate.

Not a 5 star, but clean, quiet, comfortable, and a great value.  This was my first visits, but it will be one of my top NYC choices (ant that's saying a lot because I've stayed at most of the top Manhattan hotels).  \nHere's what I loved:  \n1.  QUIET--I was on the street side on the 9th floor, but heard almost no street noise. \n2.  more space than many midtown hotels.\n3.  my room actually had a small kitchenette with microwave, tea kettle, coffee pot, pots and pans! (I asked for an upgrade, and was in the King Deluxe room) \n4.    I got a 2 BR, 2 Bath room for my parents and sister who also came on the trip.  My sister is disabled and needs some help, and it was better than going with 2 rooms.  It was like an apartment--bigger than my sister's apartment in Brooklyn--and it allowed for my parents to have some much-needed R&R, while giving my sister her own quarters, with a shared dining\/living room.  At $600 it wasn't cheap, but a similar suite would go for FAR more in most hotels, if they even had something like that.  \n5. Wonderful, helpful, low-key, service-oriented unstuffy staff.\n6.  I'm vegetarian and it was just a couple blocks away from inexpensive but fantastic vegetarian Indian, Israeli, and Korean restaurants.  (Ahh, NYC!)\n7.  Beautiful lap pool, and a Turkish Hamman which unfortunately i did not have time to use.  \n\nThings i didn't like:\n1.  The AC\/heat did not seem to really work.  My room was roasting (for me), about 75 degrees, and under a comforter you could really bake.  I set the thermostat to 67, but it took 24 hours (I kid you not) to get the temperature down to 70, and then another 12 hours to finally get to 69.5 and i could not get it any lower.  \n2.  Not all rooms have tubs, so ask if you want one.  \n3.  Some rooms of the same type are smaller so if you don't like your room, ask for another.  \n\n","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"NONE"}

It is conveniently located near public transportation, there's a Citibike across the street and there's plenty of good local food.  \n\nIt is in a quiet location. If you are a light sleeper you will be disturbed by other guests room doors slamming near your room.  There's simply no way to quietly shut your room door. \n\nThe are a wide variety of rooms: with and without balconies; wood floors only and carpeted floors; with stove tops and without; with and without bathtubs. It's a bit tricky to find the combination that works for you. Every room has a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker.   \n\nThe room I was in had a blackish stained wood floor. It was funky not elegant and a bit \"cold\" feeling.  The bathroom was small, no tub and no vanity to put down any toiletries.  The shower had a weird old fashioned shower head with no way to adjust the water flow or pattern so I was forced to get pummeled by water.  \n\nThe furnishings are functional but not elegant or comfortable.   There is no side chair in the room to relax in.  The bed is fine.  if you are used to staying in Courtyards or Hampton Inn this is an upgrade.  If you are used to Four Seasons, Peninsula or St Regis this is a significant downgrade.   A functional place to stay but certainly not a WOW.   \n\nOne last thing. I'm a vegetarian and there was nothing I could eat for breakfast not even oatmeal or cereal.  If you are vegan your toast.

Gone to someone else obviously, despite the fact we'd booked our room way ahead of anyone else.\n\nThen from non attentive door\/bell men to cold robotic check in and reception staff (where we even stood lost and had to ask where the lifts were to get to our room) through to the hassle of having to actually request times daily for housekeeping (which didn't happen on requested time anyway) and needing to ask daily for what should have been automatic replacement of complimentary items (such as water and coffee), to awful leaking showers (no bath) in both bathrooms that flooded the bathroom floor no matter what you did - this was so not a seamless luxury five star hotel experience at all.\n\nSadly as I see so many other reviews raving about the staff our experience was so very different - we stayed 7 nights and no staff member made an effort to speak to us in a warm friendly conversational way even once, not even at check in.\n\nWe won't stay here again and I wouldn't recommend it.

From the moment I booked it, right up until the point we left to come back home, the staff were absolutely incredible and the level of service was second to none! I had several dealings via email with the concierge team prior to our visit and they could not have been more helpful, offering advice and recommendations for things to do and places to eat during our stay.\n\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by the friendly doorman, who helped us with our bags. The check in process was a breeze, and we were then shown to our room up on the 17th floor. The room was amazing with everything you could possibly need for a relaxing and enjoyable stay, and we also had our own private terrace which enjoyed views of both the Chrysler Building, and Empire State. Along with the facilities in the room we also took advantage of the pool and hammam which were an extremely welcome indulgence after a busy day of sightseeing. \n\nAs well as taking my girlfriend out for a nice meal on her birthday, I also decided that I was going to propose to her, and I let the hotel staff in on my plans. We had a fantastic evening out in Manhattan, and upon our return to the hotel they had been in and decorated our room with rose petals, and left us a very nice complementary bottle of champagne! Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at the Marmara Park Avenue, and they went above and beyond to make our stay as special and memorable as possible.\n\nI have been lucky enough to have stayed in some fantastic hotels around the world, but the Marmara Park Avenue has set the bar to whole new level. My fianc\u00e9e and I will definitely be returning to New York at some point, and there is only one place that we will be staying. I could not recommend this hotel enough!!!!....\n\nI'd just like to finish this review by saying a massive thank you to all of the staff at the Marmara Park Avenue who helped to make our stay so amazing!

We were there to celebrate by husbands 40th birthday, and loved everything about this hotel.  The room was beautiful, the bed very comfortable and the location was perfect for us; close enough to walk everywhere and with the added bonus of being just a few steps from a subway stop when our feet had had enough.  But best of all were the staff.  Everyone we encountered was extremely pleasant, courteous and professional.  We took our time trying to choose the right hotel and are so glad we ultimately chose this place because we felt that we received personal service rather than the anonymity of say a larger chain hotel.  The reception is as beautiful as it looks in the photographs and it smells divine.  We spent a very relaxing few hours in the Turkish bath and spa area which was a fabulous place to take a break from our sightseeing.  In fact we had the area to ourselves the entire time.  Be warned though, as other people have mentioned, the lighting is very low in the hotel and it is difficult for us ladies (or men!) to apply makeup with any degree of accuracy.  I even spent a frustrating 10 minutes one morning rummaging around half blind in the wardrobe trying to find my socks.  However this did not detract from our stay at all and the mood lighting certainly created a very relaxed and romantic environment.  This will definitely be our first choice of hotel should we be lucky enough to return to New York soon, and I would like to thank everyone at the Marmara for their contribution to making our stay so special.  Oh, and if anyone is visiting soon, make sure you stop at Penelopes for a bite to eat.

And Hong Kong does not have abundant of space. We went down to the reception right away where we got a new room which fit our booking. But first we had to show our booking and really emphasize the first given room didn't fit neither the size, nor having coffee machine or minibar.

From the initial booking direct, and then subsequent calls before our visit we found the staff to be friendly and efficient. They kindly arranged for flowers, champagne and chocolates to be in the room on arrival, and although could not guarantee in advance our request for a room with a balcony - they were able to accommodate this as well. We had a deluxe room with a balcony, which included a small kitchenette area. The bathroom was very nice, but as mentioned by others this was the only place with mirrors and the hairdryer socket, which caused problems if we both wanted to use the bathroom. The separation of the bedroom area within the room was nice, and the living area was well set out. Both had massive flat screen TVs. The balcony was 'heaven' a treat to have outside space in the city to enjoy breakfast or a complementary soda. The duel views of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building was special. The location of the hotel was good for those who want to be away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square, but close enough to all the major midtown attractions. Also a subway station is on the corner of the street, which will take you downtown. The staff at The Marmara were so friendly and helpful, and attended to any issue immediately - including arranging a car to the airport. A special thanks to Randy for all his assistance, and thanks again to the rest of the team - we will definitely be back on our next visit to New York.

The staff are warm, welcoming, professional. The decor is stylish, all the finishes are high end. They're maybe a little too fond of black\u2014the lobby restrooms are almost invisible because everything's black and the lighting is minimal. But it's really the odd configurations of the rooms and bathrooms that flaw this otherwise wonderful jewel in Manhattan. Example: the larger bedroom\/bath in a suite is great, lots of room and closets. But the smaller one had no lamps, closets in the hallway by the front door, and a ridiculous bathroom. It had a bath\/shower combo with a deep soaking tub and a rainshower head. It was a hazard to step in and out of\u2014but the flaw was that the shower head and the tub faucet both stuck out the same length from the wall! So you had to straddle the faucet to get under the shower stream. It also had a small, narrow trough-style sink with another long faucet that guaranteed that you'd splash water all over the floor when washing your hands. It also had an amber art glass lamp over the sink that threw low amber light down, so you couldn't see to put on makeup in the mirror. The large bathroom also had lots of recessed lighting in the ceiling, none of which illuminated the sinks\/vanity\/mirror area so you could apply makeup or shave. The kicker was the shower's hot water system. In both showers, you had a range of Scalding Hot to Boil You Alive\u2014my associate, in the smaller bathroom, had to turn on the bath faucets to regulate the temperature and get a little cold water into the mix. My tub was separate, so that wasn't a workable option for me, I ended up not being able to take a shower. They also have almost zero towel racks and one tiny stubby hook for hanging a robe or nightgown on while bathing. There were slightly different but still un-ergonomic issues with the first suite's bathrooms that I stayed in. It made you wonder if the designer ever tried using the facilities! The kitchen in the suite was all high-end stainless steel appliances and great flatware, glasses, etc.\u2014but really, who is going to use a rotisserie in a hotel room? Also a full size washer\/dryer. This would be great if this was a residence type hotel, but I found it odd to have those kinds of accommodations (the kitchen was almost bigger than my home kitchen!) and yet squeeze out a tiny bathroom and bedroom that are sub-par in amenities. I'd rather they had a hotel kitchen and room service and maybe a modest kitchenette in the suite. Breakfast, FYI, is not included in the price, and is continental in the lobby area. So, I don't know what to think about the Marmara Park Avenue. The beds were comfy (although I hate the hotel trend of giving you just a heavy duvet (no sheet) to sleep under so you can't regulate the weight of the covers you use), the view is great, the location's very good. Service is super. But I don't think I can ask my biz partner to stay in the smaller room of a suite there ever again. And someone needs to deal with those showers!","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was our first time in NYC and we loved the hotel. It was clean and beautiful. We had a large corner room and enjoyed the Nespresso machine and Bigelow bath products. The heated floor in the wet bathroom and hard wood floors throughout the room were a plus. The metro station was just around the corner and easy to navigate. We didn't even notice the homeless shelter next door. But, and this is a big BUT, we had a terrible customer service experience which will prevent me from recommending this hotel to anyone. With so many hotels in NYC to choose from, people don't need to go to one that uses deceptive practices to make money off of its customers. \n\nWhen we first arrived, I was wondering if the hotel offered breakfast, but we didn't see a restaurant or food area - just a bar - so we weren't sure if anything was offered or not, other than room service. Nothing was mentioned when we checked in. Our second morning, however, there was a sign outside of the elevators indicating \"Breakfast\" with an arrow pointing to the direction we needed to go. We found a small dining table in a conference room where there were a few people eating. On the counter were some light pastries, coffee, fruit, and yogurt. There was an attendant replacing food items and we just assumed this was a typical complimentary continental breakfast that is offered at almost every hotel we have ever been to. There were no signs indicating otherwise except for a price list for hot breakfast items like omelettes, eggs Benedict, bacon, etc. We sat down to enjoy some food with several other people who came and went. Some folks grabbed some pastries and left, others took some food up to their rooms, one guy sat down, ate and then left quickly. My husband and I were mapping our day's events so we lingered for awhile. The attendant came and went during this time and only spoke to us when we stood up to leave. She asked us for our room number. She didn't ask anybody else for their room number, but she also wasn't in the room the entire time. When I asked her why, she said that breakfast wasn't free. I asked her why she didn't tell us that when we first walked in? She just let us eat and didn't say anything. There was no sign or anything to indicate that such a simple and sparse spread would actually end up costing us $55! I was furious. I asked to speak to the manager but I was told he was in a meeting. I asked to speak to a manager later that evening, but he was gone for the day. The next day was Saturday and the manager wasn't on duty and we had to leave to catch our flight. I left my business card with the receptionist and she promised she would speak about the situation with the assistant manager, who was supposed to show up that afternoon, and that I would get an email. I never received any email. \n\nI found their behavior concerning breakfast to be very deceptive and the lack of manager presence indicates to me that they're not very concerned about their customers or their satisfaction. If breakfast isn't complimentary then customers need to know upfront. Put up a sign or have the attendant tell you BEFORE you start eating. Having to pay $55 for a couple of pastries, coffee, and bites of fruit was absolutely ridiculous and the reason why NYC gets such a bad reputation. Now I know why people were coming, grabbing food, and leaving so quickly. We were probably the only schmucks they caught that day to pay for the food. \n\nAs I said, this is a beautiful and lovely hotel, but if you decide to go and stay - make sure you're clear on their breakfast policies!","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is simply no place in the bathroom to put down your toiletries, eye glasses, shaver, etc. With a bit of thought, I feel certain that the hotel could come up with a fix to this very vexing problem.\n\nOn my prior visit to the hotel, the soft drinks and bottled water were free. When the pleasant and helpful bellhop bought me to my room, he seemed confused about the current status of which, if any, drinks were free. He said \"I think the waters are still free\". But, after he left, the \"minibar\" information card on the table indicated that the waters would indeed be charged. Management should educate their staff better so that guests are clearly informed. Also, the \"minibar\" is really just an assortment of snacks, liquor, and wine, spread out on the small dining table, obstructing the table from other use. This is rather annoying, and again, I think management could find a better place to display these items,  perhaps on the spacious dry bar.\n\nOther than these annoyances, this is still a good, comfortable hotel, in a great location, and with nice staff. With a little effort, management could turn this from a good hotel to a great hotel.\n\nOh, and the free wifi and free premium streaming movie and tv channels are still fantastic.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was pleasantly surprised on many levels, and I will happily stay here again. \n\nThe Marmara does many little details that combine to make this a lovely place to stay. A pet peeve of mine is that stupid, rapacious credit card hold that hotels put on visitors. Marmara does it, too, but at a reasonable, easy-to-swallow $100 rather than the cost of the room for the entire length of your stay. A second small--but-appreciated detail is that the minibar is stocked and no additional charge. Thank you! Not having to pay $4 for a soda makes me want to pay for other services at the hotel and to leave a nice tip for housekeeping to boot. \n\nBut those are just little details. The important things are that the rooms are big, the staff is helpful and competent, and the location is super easy for any midtown or East side activity. A 6 train stop is literally right at the hotel door, Grand Central is a few blocks North (or one subway stop), and Park Ave. cabs are plentiful. This is an easy hotel from which to maneuver in NYC. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, there's no restaurant. I don't count that as a negative. There's a gazillion services within a block or two of the hotel. Anything you want can be walked to or delivered. Plus, in addition to the stocked minibar, the minibar has room for other items you buy and there's kind of a kitchenette with plates, glasses, and silverware. In my room anyway I felt that I could've had anything from a business meeting to a romantic weekend in my well-appointed room. \n\nThe hammam and lap pool are also pluses to be taken advantage of. Bring your swim suit. The spa\/pool area is clean and safe and are next to a nicely laid out gym. \n\nThe Marmara is great value for money. I liked many of their value added features. So, a comfy room, helpful staff, decent free wifi, and an easy location all add up to a winning combo in the crowded, over-priced NYC market. If there's any complaint it's that my bathroom was super small. yes, that's normal for NYC so I don't really hold it against them. Plus, staff told me I can upgrade to rooms with bigger bathrooms so I know it's not a feature of every room. I'll stay here again. Recommended.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The property itself is beautiful, very conveniently located and the staff helpful and friendly. Here is why it's 4\/5 stars:\n\nRoom: The room was very clean and pretty big for NYC standards. It had a small seating area in front of the bed, a kitchenette with a kettle, nespresso machine and a toaster and a free minibar. The bed was super comfy, although we only noticed the next day it was a sofa bed?! I'm not sure if it was only our room config that had a sofa bed, but for that price, I was a bit surprised. But main point is it was soooo comfy! And the pillows! I would buy a few if I could. \n\nBathroom: Very clean, well lit and beautiful! You couldn't open or close the door if you were going to the bathroom though because it was a bit small. Great amenities. But the water pressure in the shower was negligible. We asked the front desk to have it checked out and fixed because it was literally just trickling, so it was so cold and took forever to shower. We got back to the room that night and it was the same. The next morning we went to the pool and hamam and just took a shower in the changing room instead. The pressure was better there.\n\nBreakfast: We were lazy and had breakfast for $18++ p\/p but  would recommend going out and finding a bagel shop or breakfast place nearby. There are lots of options. But the breakfast area is a bar in the evening, and it was very cozy. I just love the lobby!\n\nLocation: Fantastic location. Right next to a subway station (1 minute walk). Very convenient, walkable (perhaps not in winter) to main attractions uptown (Times Square, Grand Central station etc.) \n\nStaff: Very friendly, helpful and professional. Carlos was great and very helpful! \n\nOverall, it was a great stay! The hotel is beautiful and chic, very convenient, the staff made it very welcoming, and most of all the neat freak in me was very happy it was very, very clean!","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It made sleeping under their cosy duvet and on their giant pillows even better. (One firm, one soft for each guest). \n\nKudos to the designers for creating a truly relaxing experience in such a busy city. After seven or eight hours of walking New York you need a way to rest deeply and quickly so that you can keep going into the night. The Turkish bath is probably the most luxurious and effective way I've ever experienced of doing that. Not to worry, if like me you don't know what the heck to do as there is a very kind and informative attendant who explains how to get the full experience.  An entire floor of the hotel is dedicated to exercise and relaxation and it's done with the same elegance and eye for detail as the lobby.

What a wonderful birthday weekend I had! Thanks to the wonderful staff for all they did for us. The staff is the cream of the crop---top notch!  I cannot say enough good things about this lovely place.  \n\nThis new gem feels more like a residential luxury condominium than a \"hotel\".  The hotel is definitely high end luxury, but unlike other NYC high end properties, missing was the sense of stuffiness and attitude.  The hotel is pleasant, relaxing, luxurious...and feels like a spa. \n\nThere is a wonderful fireplace in the lobby, and some sort of aromatherapy in the air, also.  It's just heavenly.\n\nThe hotel actually has its own indoor pool, as well as a Turkish haman, which is basically heated tiled benches and \"beds\", where you may use the water feature to cleanse yourself, have a massage on the tiled bed, or just rest and recenter yourself after a busy day in the city. Its not overly hot like American sauna, but the tile is heated and this creates a relaxing ambiance unlike anything I've ever experienced.\n\nOur room had a huge balcony (You MUST stay in one of those rooms if you can). Also, visit the bar area....the creative drink menu is fantastic. Front desk staff were very efficient and kind.  The service was world class, cordial, proactive---without being obtrusive or overbearing. \n\nAlso, the hotel is steps away from a subway station!\n\nI can't wait to visit Marmara Park Avenue once again.

The Marmara Park Avenue is an exception to this rule, masterfully executing a refreshing take on comfortable sophistication.  Its lobby is awash with crisp whites juxtaposed with the warmth of two fireplaces and smart use of metals.  Opposite the full bar is an installation of a flock of white birds which playfully complement the towering birdcage entryway; across the room is a table with water cascading down its sides.  Such a stunning first impression sets a high standard for the rest of the stay, but my experience was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nIt became clear that the Marmara was no ordinary hotel when the bellman, Fernando, gave me and my friend a tour of our gorgeous room after he carried our bags upstairs.  He explained all of the room\u2019s amenities, pointed out the view from our gigantic balcony, and encouraged us to enjoy the complimentary water and soft drinks inside the mini bar\u2019s refrigerator.\n\nWe were quite impressed by the size, design, and cleanliness of our room.  Its furnishings were beautiful and contemporary yet comfortable and functional.  The clean white walls near the bed popped against the dark and dramatic wallpaper in the entryway, and its wall of windows let in both ample natural light and views of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings.  But the real showstopper was the spotless marble bathroom, complete with a spacious glass shower and floor-to-ceiling mirror.  When I made the reservation with the concierge, Franck, he said he would put us in his favorite room, and I believe he actually did.\n\nThe OneOneFour Bar is reason enough to visit The Marmara.  I had the pleasure of being served by Rick, the bar manager, with whom I had a great conversation about whiskeys - my drink of choice for the night - and his passion for mixology.  It was refreshing to speak with someone so knowledgable about his craft; sitting at his bar was like visiting a friend.  I have since been back to OneOneFour to sample Rick\u2019s new signature cocktail menu which he has expertly formulated to compete with the best bars in Manhattan.\n\nThe staff at The Marmara went out of their way to make our stay as effortless and enjoyable as possible.  Prior to our arrival, Franck personally reached out to us offering his assistance with planning our weekend activities.  He was able to work with Rick to confirm a reservation at an exclusive nearby lounge, something I was not able to secure on my own.  The front desk also graciously accommodated a late checkout the following day, even storing our luggage for the afternoon while we went sightseeing.  Both were free of charge and much appreciated gestures.\n\nI cannot wait until my next stay at The Marmara.  It has earned itself this discerning guest\u2019s approval, not only for its exquisite design and amenities, but also for its staff\u2019s genuine desire to provide unparalleled service.  It\u2019s an A+ in my book.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Read on to find out why.\n\nPositives: This is a very new hotel, according to the attentive and friendly doorman who greeted us on arrival the hotel opened in September 2015.  Unlike other hotels in NYC that seem to be re-purposed older office or apartment buildings, this building seems to be purpose-built as a hotel, and it shows. The lobby is beautiful and dramatically decorated, the staff seems eager and enthusiastic, and the rooms are very nice.  \n\nThe attention to service started as our taxi pulled up in front of the hotel. We hadn't even stepped out of the taxi, and the doorman had already popped the trunk of the cab and had our bags out and ready to go into the hotel. As we stepped out of the taxi, he asked for our name, welcomed us, and spoke our name into his sleeve. Seconds later we were inside, and the front-desk was ready with our paperwork for a quick check-in. Very professional!\n\nThe room was modern, but simple, and bright and nicely decorated. A large TV mounted on the wall provided ample (actual digital) content (why are other hotels still showing analog lo-definition content on modern LCD TV's?) as well as a lot of free on-demand content. This is as good of a TV offering as we've ever seen in a hotel.\n\nOur \"deluxe guest room\" had  a larger minibar-sized refrigerator, and it was stocked with free soft-drinks and waters! Plenty of room in the fridge if you wanted to bring some takeout back to the room - which was also equipped with glasses, plates, coffee maker and pods, and a toaster. \n\nThe furnishings are all very new and they show it, and the king size bed was very comfortable. As readers of my reviews may notice, I am a stickler when it comes to the sleeping conditions in a room (isn't that why you come to a hotel in the city?) - I insist on a comfortable, and quiet, environment to sleep. Great bed? Check. Super-quiet and effective heating\/AC? Yes, and Bravo! I've been to too-many hotels in NYC where the heat\/AC is super-noisy, and not terribly effective - leaving me shivering and putting in ear plugs to try to sleep through the racket. But not the Marmara - it has a beautifully engineered heating system. \n\nOh yeah, and they have fast and free WiFi! I clocked it at about 30mbps.\n\nNegatives: Overall, I am very enthusiastic about this new hotel, but I do have some concerns that are keeping me from giving this hotel 5 stars.\n\nThe bathroom - it is nicely decorated, with ample toiletries, but.... the bathroom had only one (partially used) roll of toilet paper, and was not stocked with a backup roll anywhere. Likewise, a near empty box of tissues, with no backup elsewhere in the room. So, we quickly exhausted the tissues, but luckily we didn't quite get to the end of the roll! Such a simple issue to fix - there should always be backup of these essentials somewhere in the room. \n\nMore about the bathroom - I guarantee that the decorator of this bathroom didn't wear glasses. How do I know? Because there is nowhere, I mean nowhere, to put your glasses down when washing or showering. The sink has a sloped edge that is perhaps half an inch wide, and the back of the sink area is tiny. But there's no vanity. Other than the high towel rack with very widely spaced bars, there is literally nowhere in the bathroom to put your glasses, hairbrush, cosmetics, etc.... This is a major design flaw, and a significant inconvenience in the bathroom. (If you look on the Marmara's website for photos of the Deluxe Guest Room you'll see a small table to the right of the bathroom sink. Our bathroom didn't have such a table, and indeed there would have been no room for it)\n\nOne last issue - the shower head is mounted too low - and doesn't look like the one shown on the Maramara's website. Luckily, we are medium height, and only had to duck a little to wash our hair - but a taller person would have had problems. \n\nIn summary - is this a great new addition to the midtown NYC hotel scene? Absolutely yes! Would I come back despite the flaws? Yes, but I hope they will  try to refine what is almost a 5-star act.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

All rooms have kitchenettes with complimentary waters and sodas, toasters, coffee makers and intelligent iPads in each room.  Our room was a deluxe King which was very roomy for a NY hotel.  We had a tour of their larger rooms - studios, one, two and three bedroom suites which could easily hold corporate functions.  Views are amazing on the upper floors that have wrap around outdoor balconies.  Architecture and design are top of the line with marble, original art, clean lines and great lighting.  Staff are all very welcoming and professional.  They now have  a lifeguard so the pool is operational.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The single room had a balcony with a view of the empire state building which was lovely (room1701) the other was spacious and lovely (1704) Both rooms had a small kitchen (microwave, fridge sink - no hot plate) Both also had a large lounge area and table and chairs.\n\nNo washing machine which was a pain for a 2 week stay, so if you're staying longer ask for one of the other rooms that have machines (the staff were so incredibly nice to us and let us use one of the unused rooms that had a machine as it was Christmas day and all laundry would not be able to be done for days - LOVELY STAFF AT THIS HOTEL) Laundry done by the hotel is not expensive though, we used it twice and it was fine (about $20 a bag of washing)\nThe beds are INCREDIBLE, so comfortable I could have stayed in it all day. Bathrooms are tiny, but who cares??!!! You are only in them for such a short time of the day! Give me a big bedroom and lounge room any day!  They provide a proper hair dryer which is lovely and a nice change from those ones on the wall!! (I have long thick hair, these things are important to me!)\nWe had weekly service to the room, this could have been better if it was every 4 days - 7 is too long for towels etc and rubbish piled up - they don't have a rubbish shoot on the floor to take it out yourself.\nBreakfast was included each day - basic but nice. Could be improved only with providing bread and a toaster (they serve bagels and sweet buns and bread rolls and cream cheese and  jams) there is also apples and oranges and juice, yoghurt and coffee. So for a free breakfast I could not complain. The lovely staff were learning to use the new coffee machine and I am sure they will get better with time and practice. Most days they were pretty good! \nThe highlight of our trip was meeting Rick at the bar, he befriended our whole family of 5 and not only gave us great drinks, but helped us with restaurant selections, places to go, how to get around etc. He is seriously a great bartender and we are so grateful to have met him. He is a big reason we had such a lovely time there. Each day we would head to the bar after being out all day and before heading out at night and he was always keen to hear about our adventures and guide us on to activities at night. He helped us choose one of our favourite restaurants in NYC and told us about an improv comedy night we would not have known about and one we loved. We also met Darius there and he is also lovely and helped us a lot.\nAll of the staff were just so incredibly helpful, kind and warm. From the doormen, to the girls and guys on the front desk, to the cleaners and handymen. Every single person we met wanted to help us and were genuinely nice people.\nThe location is fantastic. A very quick walk to the subway up or down town, 10 min walk to times square, 5 min walk to empire state building or madison square garden. Great spot\nHighly recommend staying in this hotel for a stay in NYC, long or short. We will come back for sure. Thank you to the Marmara Park Ave for making our stay so wonderful. \nI know they are opening a food service\/restaurant soon so that would make it even more wonderful.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The apartment we stayed in was spotless and beautifully appointed, it's been recently refurbished to a very high standard. One of our TV's wasn't working properly when we arrived, it was sorted out immediately. The continental breakfast is served at one large dining table which we liked a lot, it meant that there was much more interaction with the other guests during breakfast. Obviously, being on 32nd street you're a stones throw away from some the best tourist attractions and only a $15 taxi ride to anywhere else. My only criticism would be that the corridors are a little too dark, I understand it's part of the overall feel but it was on the limit for me.
