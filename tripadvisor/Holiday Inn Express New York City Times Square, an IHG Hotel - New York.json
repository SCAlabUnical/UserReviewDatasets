But the sister property, The candlewood suites, is better!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-08-19","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"Whenever I visit New York city. I would like to be reasonably close to times square. Because of its central location, it makes it easier to radiate out to other tourist attractions from there.\nNormally I stay at the candlewood suites, times square location.  But this time, I took the Holiday inn Express times square, for my hotel stay.  Understand that the candlewood suites and the Holiday inn Express, are actually part of the same building.  Even though they are vertically sectioned off one from the other.\n\nMy first disappointment, was when I got there early, they said no rooms were available.   That happens often enough. The problem is, although they asked for my number, to let me know when rooms would be available, I never got that call or text.  So just arriving in the city, I had to walk around several hours, kind of just checking things out, without knowing that my room was ready.  With the warm weather, and wearing my travel clothes, versus my casual clothes, that was quite uncomfortable.\n\nSecondly, the quality of the room itself, in relation to normal maintenance appearance, was not up to the standard of the sister hotel next door, The candlewood suites.

Sin embargo, al hacer el check-in el primer d\u00eda, nos llevamos la horrible experiencia de encontrar pop\u00f3 (excremento\/caca) con mucho papel en el servicio higi\u00e9nico del ba\u00f1o de nuestra habitaci\u00f3n, es decir NO hicieron una revisi\u00f3n correcta de que todo estuviera limpio antes de entregarnos el cuarto porque claramente alguien extra\u00f1o a nosotras hab\u00eda utilizado ese ba\u00f1o y se hab\u00eda olvidado de bajar la palanca. En ning\u00fan hotel, ni en los m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicos o econ\u00f3micos en los que me he hospedado he tenido que experimentar esta desagradable situaci\u00f3n. Sin tratar de hacer problema ni amargarme las vacaciones, decid\u00ed solo bajar la palanca del servicio y esperar que se fuera todo lo que estaba ah\u00ed, sin embargo la taza del ba\u00f1o qued\u00f3 manchada con pop\u00f3 en los bordes por lo que decidimos llamar al front desk para explicar lo que hab\u00eda sucedido y pedir que alguien viniera a limpiar la habitaci\u00f3n (porque no hab\u00eda un cepillo apropiado para hacerlo yo misma). Esperamos m\u00e1s de 10 minutos y volvimos a llamar pero nadie apareci\u00f3. Como ten\u00edamos apuro de salir, bajamos del cuarto y le dijimos a la se\u00f1orita de la recepci\u00f3n del hotel que hab\u00edamos llamado para que alguien nos fuera a limpiar el ba\u00f1o y nadie fue, nos inform\u00f3 que el n\u00famero del front desk no era del hotel sino de una \"central\" y que por eso no hab\u00eda ido nadie tan r\u00e1pido a resolver el problema. En todo caso, avisamos nuevamente, esta vez con la se\u00f1orita del lobby, que necesit\u00e1bamos que alguien fuera a limpiar el servicio. Quiero resaltar que la se\u00f1orita con la que hablamos en recepci\u00f3n hablaba espa\u00f1ol por lo que pudimos explicarle claramente cu\u00e1l era la situaci\u00f3n. \nDespu\u00e9s de 8h de estar en la calle paseando, regresamos por la noche a nuestra habitaci\u00f3n solo para encontrarnos que nadie hab\u00eda limpiado el ba\u00f1o, por lo que ya bajamos bastante molestas a indicarle este tema a la persona de recepci\u00f3n y fue muuuy grosera y ten\u00eda una p\u00e9sima actitud para solucionar nuestro inconveniente. La soluci\u00f3n al problema era tan f\u00e1cil como enviar a alguien a limpiar el ba\u00f1o.  Esta persona dijo todo el tiempo que la persona de mantenimiento estaba ocupado (con un tono de voz muy grosero y quemimportista), hasta que por casualidad apareci\u00f3 el se\u00f1or de mantenimiento y al escucharnos molestas reclamando subi\u00f3 con nosotras a limpiar el servicio higienico tal como hab\u00edamos solicitado 8h antes. El se\u00f1or fue el \u00fanico que se disculp\u00f3 por las molestias, pese a que no era su responsabilidad. Lastimosamente no s\u00e9 el nombre del se\u00f1or pero agradezco muchisimo su atenci\u00f3n y empat\u00eda para con nosotras.\nEn los siguientes d\u00edas, tuvimos una serie de conversaciones con el staff de recepci\u00f3n (todos ten\u00edan una p\u00e9sima actitud y ninguno se disculp\u00f3 por el inconveniente) y la manager Valerie tanto en la ma\u00f1ana como por la noche en la cual ped\u00edamos que nos compensaran de alguna forma esta terrible experiencia, sin embargo no nos daban ninguna respuesta. Mi hermana tuvo que reclamar en voz alta y muy enojada para que alguien pudiera reci\u00e9n ofrecerle el \"gran regalo\" (enti\u00e9ndase mi sarcasmo) del 10% de descuento, y esta oferta solo apareci\u00f3 luego de haber reclamado varias veces. Les dijimos que esta oferta nos parec\u00eda muy poco para compensar el p\u00e9simo momento que nos hab\u00edan hecho pasar y sugerimos que deber\u00edan darnos al menos la primera noche gratis porque nos estaban cobrando una noche por el servicio de limpieza que incluye entregar la habitaci\u00f3n limpia y no fue lo que hab\u00eda sucedido. En todo este intercambio de palabras, NUNCA nadie se disculp\u00f3. Solicitamos varias veces hablar con la manager Misko y tampoco nos lo conced\u00edan. La \u00faltima noche que nos hospedamos, RECI\u00c9N la manager Misko intent\u00f3 contactarnos por tel\u00e9fono y correo electr\u00f3nico (algo que pudieron haber hecho desde el comienzo si es que en serio les interesaba tener feliz a sus huespedes) y al fin nos ofreci\u00f3 una disculpa diciendo que por favor la contactemos para hablar con ella y ver como pod\u00edamos solucionar el tema. La llamamos y nunca contest\u00f3. Le escribimos un correo y tampoco contest\u00f3. Hasta el \u00faltimo momento en que estuvimos en el hotel nunca nadie m\u00e1s se contact\u00f3 con nosotras.\nDespu\u00e9s de ya regresar a nuestra ciudad de origen, y luego de algunos d\u00edas, y revisar el estado de cuentas de la tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito que utilizamos para la reserva, nos dimos cuenta que s\u00ed hicieron la devoluci\u00f3n del precio de 1 noche como lo solicitamos. Al parecer, para obtener una compensaci\u00f3n justa hab\u00eda que pelear durante 3 noches seguidas y alzar la voz para que alguien pudiera escucharnos.\nMe da mucha pena que nuestras vacaciones hayan tenido que ser opacadas por este evento desagradable porque la habitaci\u00f3n y el hotel en general fueron muuuy buenos. Nunca regresar\u00eda de nuevo porque la atenci\u00f3n del personal de all\u00ed es p\u00e9sima pero debo reconocer que la ubicaci\u00f3n y estructura del hotel, la comodidad de la habitaci\u00f3n y el desayuno son muy buenos. \nNO SE HOSPEDEN AQU\u00cd A MENOS QUE QUIERAN QUE LOS TRATEN MAL.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The receptionist Alex, what unprofessional employee. The few encounters we had left me with a poor impression about his personality and his lack of customer service skills, he was very apathetic and disinterested emplyee. \n\nWhen I arrive I believe he judge me by my look ( I have a beard of a week, wearing shorts and t-shirt and I admitted, I wasn't in my best look ) I was standing there asking him if he was available to check me in, he just looked at me saying \"NO\"; I noticed it he was not taking care of none, asked him again and he totally ignored me, it took him minutes to realizes I was there to check in ( at this point he didn't know I was the person he spoke with early that day ). \nDuring the few minutes I was doing the check in, there wasn't a welcoming conversation, not recognition for being IHG member, not friendly at all and very distant, he seemed very upset and miserable.\n\nAfter checking in went up to my room, noticed it a red spot on the carpet, wanted to reported but after the unprofessional welcome I received I'd rather to leave it alone. We were about to go to the concert but, all of sudden we started to smell like something was burning inside the room, we checked the bathroom but, we noticed the heater was on..weird...Temperature outside was 71 F and humidity 78%, we tried to turn it off but it was impossible, we read on the AC label that heater activates by outside temperature..??..It's Summer in NYC..so..we said, it will be off when we come back...\n\nAt 11'00pm we came back from the concert and, went to the front desk to get a new set of keys because we went through a lot of metal detectors at MSG and keys might get deactivated. I took a deep breath because I had to face Alex unprofessional manners again, while he was making keys, I asked about some cups. I didn't even finished my question when he shut me down saying \" I'm making keys ..Let me finish \"..WOW.. We grabbed the cups and went up to the room..SURPRISE!!..The room was hot as a sauna, the heater was on the entire time while we were at the concert, I went down and talk to Alex again, God this guy has some issues, told him about the heater in the room, No apologies, not empathy nor acknowledging the inconvenience the hotel was causing us, he just wrote down out room number and bye...\n\nI've had enough of his attitude. I called IHG to report this kind of behavior and the lady on the phone told me it will be addressed. His mannerism and attitude made us feel very uncomfortable, it's sad and embarrassing for a hotel chain like IHG to have a spiritless and overbearing person like this character.\n\n***UPDATE*** I forgot in the room a plastic bag with two electronic toothbrushes, dental floss, dental paste and a comb. I called today June 28 around 5:45am and spoke with a lady who doesn\u2019t has an idea what time housekeeping department open, I was asking for lost and found and her vague response left in shock, she said housekeeping start working at 11am which is the check-out time and I should call at 12noon..REALLY??..Asked her what time the DEPARTMENT open and she has not clue what I\u2019m talking about..THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel also has a major recurring problem with its key cards not actually working to open doors. Picture yourself having waited 15 minutes to get to your room: the elevator leaves but you discover you can\u2019t unlock your room door. You\u2019re trapped in a small corridor, with no means of contacting reception. You call the lift, but the call button keeps turning off- the lift is under manual operation and the calls are being wiped. You are stuck on the 35th floor. 20 minutes later I was eventually successful in not having a lift call cancelled. 40 minutes of my life I will never get back getting a replacement card and getting back up to my room again - whilst fearing the same thing would happen again.  \n\nHaving complained to the hotel - they made it clear that they didn\u2019t care about making it right. Having made it clear I was concerned being trapped in a corridor was a safety issue, they eventually offered to send a member of staff to confirm the key card didn\u2019t fail again and that I didn\u2019t get trapped. When I arrived back at the hotel at 10pm tonight - I was told tough luck, no one was available to accompany me.  I was fortunate that my card worked, but watched another guest suffer the same problem on my way up.  It is a disgrace that the promised remedial action to make the situation safe was then not available. If it was physically possible to have left the hotel and checked in somewhere else with my schedule, I would have done.\n\nIf you care about not waiting 15-20 minutes to get to your room; if you care about not being trapped - DO NOT STAY HERE; it was clearly not an isolated incident.\n\nI also didn\u2019t get any housekeeping service.

The elevator and hallways were never vacuumed in the 5 days I was there. I kept hoping \u201cmaybe today is the day\u201d. The only time my room was cleaned was the day before I checked out. I was usually gone by noon everyday so couldn\u2019t figure that one our. I really don\u2019t require daily housekeeping service when I travel but at least refresh the room a bit and take out the garbage. The staff broke the cardinal rule in the service industry and that is \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d. Upon check in I pointed out that the safe in my room wasn\u2019t working to the front desk only to be told \u201cAre you sure?\u201d That\u2019s right, I\u2019m an idiot cause I can\u2019t program a hotel safe. There is no variety of choice for breakfast. Everyday it was either scrambled eggs or \u201ccheese\u201d omelettes, sausages, oatmeal, apples and bananas. That\u2019s it. Maybe they\u2019re not used to multi night stays. I had better food and service at the Pret a Manger on the corner and I was certainly hungry cause you have to run the gauntlet of pot smokers hanging around the front door everyday.

This time we were there over Thanksgiving and enjoyed the parade, a Broadway performance and some great food. We chose this Holiday Inn Express as our basecamp since we had stayed there previously and enjoyed our other stay. This time was quite the letdown though... and not so much because of anything the hotel can control. Here are my pros\/cons and an explanation.\nPros: \n- Decent\/free breakfast\n- Close to Times Square\n- Slightly more affordable than most similar options\nCons:\n- The breakfast area got a bit crowded but it wasn't too bad... my family of four was always able to find somewhere to eat\n- The location, while close to many of the sights, has really gone downhill lately. Lots of homeless people around. People that were peddling drugs. Marijuana smoke everywhere. Trash left in the street and on the sidewalk. I used to feel safe walking in this area late at night but not any more.\n- On the 14th floor (our floor) there was a very strong weed\/pot smell when we came back one night. Someone had obviously been smoking a lot in their room and it seeped out under the door. I believe the hotel sent someone up shortly later to clean the public area as it smelled like cleaning spray, and that helped a fair amount, but really disappointed that this is even an issue at the hotel.\n\nI don't know if I'd stay at this hotel again, based on how it seems this part of town has gone downhill. Really, it seems like most of the city is this way now. If you get a hotel right on Broadway or 5th Avenue then it seems like those areas are still well maintained, though those hotels cost considerably more.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

We decided to go to New York for our 20 year anniversary for a week and stayed in an indigo hotel in the Lower East Side, which was fine. For our last three nights we decided to move closer to Times Square and booked this hotel as it had 4 stars on here. \nI can honestly say this is the worst hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in. There are homeless in the street  injecting pretty much outside the hotel, I know this is nothing to do with the actual hotel but it\u2019s a disgrace. When we checked in I received no welcome points, drink or complimentary upgrade, when we got to the room it was just beyond tired and I wouldn\u2019t say it was that clean either. I payed stupidly \u00a32400 for three nights which wasn\u2019t even worth \u00a3100 a night. You couldn\u2019t sleep with the air con on, there were handles missing off furniture, leather patches torn off the office chair, stains on the carpet, a leaking toilet etc\u2026 I complained straight away and was asked to email the manager, which I did. The next day we returned from a lovely day out to the room not even made up the only thing changed was towels which had been replaced with thread bear towels. Again not happy so I emailed the hotel manager again as well as the email for the hotel, no response to either. We stayed three nights and the room wasn\u2019t cleaned once, in fact the whole hotel was dirty with bits on the carpets to the landings. \nDuring check out I refused to pay until I seen the manager, who did actually come and see me at this point I wasn\u2019t happy and she was told so. She apologised and agreed the hotel was tired and told me she had been at a conference and hadn\u2019t had chance to catch-up with emails and wished she had known as she would have moved us to another hotel. She discounted $958 from our $2544 bill FOR THREE NIGHTS. Which if honest I still was far from happy with. \nTo top this off we returned home to find out that the hotel had charged us another unknown bill of \u00a3351 to my credit card on top of the original discounted bill. I have emailed the manager and hotel twice in the past two days with no response (must be on another conference) I have now gone through the diamond elite contact to push it on. \nThis hotel and management are a joke, please avoid.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

IHG offered Holiday Inn Express as an alternative. I have to admit, after reading reviews I was less than impressed with the curb appeal. However staff (and elevators) all seemed to be working just fine. The not-so-impressive lobby area is actually quite functional, and staff was helpful with storing luggage after a super early arrival. I cannot say enough about the location, at 39th you are a short walk from Times Square, but also very close to Hell's Kitchen restaurants and even the arts center down towards Chelsea. I am traveling alone, so space is not a big concern, but desk and internet are appreciated. I do have to maneuver the chair out of the way when not using the desk, but that's really not a big issue. Another great perk is the free breakfast. I'm an early riser and close to 6am it has never been more than me an 3\/4 others in the breakfast area. Each day has been a slight variation, all good and a great (cheap) way to start your day. I 100% recommend this property.

When we asked to be possibly located on the same floor, she managed to get 2 families of each of our groups together which was very nice. When we requested another blanket and an extra bar of soap, she quickly arranged that to be brought up to our room by a very nice young man. On our last night there, she also was gracious enough to grant us permission to use the breakfast room for our large family group to enjoy a takeout dinner together. Of course, as agreed upon, we cleaned everything up and put the room back in order when we were done.\n\nBenjamin- what a wonderful and pleasant young man! He worked so hard to keep the incredibly busy breakfast area stocked with food, the vacated tables cleaned up as quick as possible for the next group of hungry people and the coffee pots full for us caffeine dependent souls. He kindly assured me that the coffee was brewing and would soon be available when I inquired. Considering how crazy the breakfast room had been as I oversaw the slow process of my grandkids, niece, a few nephews, a couple of my daughters, both of my sisters, and all of their husbands fill their belly\u2019s before venturing out for the day... Benjamin could have been rude, but he was NOT!

A couple weeks before we were to arrive, another one of my daughters was given permission to have the time off work and asked if she and her 2 kids could join me in my room. I called and talked to a nice young man at Booking.com and he then talked with someone at this hotel and arranged to change my reservations from a room with a king size bed to a room with 2 double beds for the total cost of $1,500!!!!!!!!! Mind you, this was only for 2 nights! My daughter quickly managed to look online and found a room with 2 double beds on the Booking.com website for $1,100 for the same hotel... really? I cancelled my room for a king size bed, and took this one, but wonder why, since I already had a room reserved, there was no consideration? Why couldn\u2019t I just switch the type of room without having such an incredibly steep price difference. I did have to pay the horribly more expensive cost because I didn\u2019t want to disappoint my family, but am not happy about it, and will not likely choose to stay at a Holiday Inn Express again.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

My expectations weren\u2019t high being a past guest of Hotel Carter I don\u2019t expect much. I knew up front that rooms would not be cleaned, breakfast would be limited and possibly other things could be impacted.\n\nThe front desk was ultra friendly and tried but they just can\u2019t fix everything and you can\u2019t complain about everything. I was a IHG member  staying on points.\n\nMy first surprise came a few hours before check in. My credit card was charged $225 for a room that was already paid for. When I called to find out why I was told it was for incidentals like charging things to the room. They said they charge $75 per night up to $450  total but you get it back up to a week after check out. Here is the catch though, they don\u2019t have a restaurant or almost anything to charge to the room. They have a small snack shop. You would have to buy 75 sodas to spend that much. No where on my confirmation or the ihg website is this $75 per night frelisted. \n\nWhen we arrived to our room there were two noticeable problems. The first was a good size stain on the carpet. Stains don\u2019t bother me (remember I\u2019ve stayed at Hotel Carter before) but what did bother me was the fact that it was still sticky. Stains are acceptable but for it to still be sticky makes me wonder if any effort was given to clean it?\n\nThe second issue was the safe. We regularly use the safe and when we tried to lock it, it wouldn\u2019t work. We called the front desk and they sent someone up. A guy came into the room and didn\u2019t do much more than I did looking at the safe trying to get it to work. He said I\u2019ll be back and left the room. We waited a hour and he never returned. By this point it was 11:30 pm and we decided to go to sleep.\n\nThe next morning we explained to the front desk again about the safe and were told they would send someone right up at 8 am to fix it. We asked again at 7:45 because we wanted to go explore the city and was told it would be closer to 8:30. We waited until 9 and no one showed up. Not wanting to waste our day her left and assumed it would get fixed and hoped our valuables wouldn\u2019t get taken.\n\nWe came back to our room that night and the safe still wasn\u2019t working. We called the front desk again and they called the maintenance supervisor up. Within about .15 minutes he got the safe to work. However the next morning, it wasn\u2019t working again. At this point we gave up on having a working safe. \n\nThat evening our children dropped a toy behind the night stand. When I went to grab it a found a half full bottle of soda that was a flavor we never had in the room. Another indication that room wasn\u2019t cleaned well.\n\nOther room issues during the stay included the toilet paper holder falling off the wall and the bath tub faucet falling off. Both things were were able to put back on but again not something you expect from a IHG property. \n\nThe final disappointing thing was they wouldn\u2019t hold our bags at check out, which is customary at most NYC hotels. I was told it was due to covid. Not sure how holding my bags in a closet spreads covid and other hotels are still doing it. At first it was suggested we visit one of the local stores that would do that service for us for a fee. Eventually late check out was offered (thank you friendly front desk staff) which helped some but didn\u2019t fix our entire problem.\n\nOverall my expectations weren\u2019t high but for a 3 night stay we had issue after issue. The front desk staff saved the rating from being a zero.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

In hindsight we shouldn\u2019t have bothered, more of that to follow.\n\nOne the plus side, the location was ideal, the complimentary breakfast provided a good selection of hot and cold items. The staff were very helpful and friendly - a special mention for Mayely on the front desk who was extremely polite and helpful.\n\nThe hotel was very busy as you might expect, the breakfast area is very small and so fining a table can take a while, we managed ok with a family of four - sometimes in two shifts. The hotel is a high building but the footprint is small so there isn\u2019t much that can be done to enlarge the breakfast area so be prepared to wait.\n\nThe hotel only has two lifts, both of which were constantly busy, they are used by housekeeping also,  our choice of a high floor in hindsight was a mistake - if we had been lower down then we would have used the stairs - a twenty minute wait for a lift in the morning around breakfast and checkout times was not unusual.\n\nOn some days house keeping did not get around to servicing our room, we wondered if they were just busy with changeovers, under staffed maybe or just that we were points paying customers and therefore further down the list ? One one occasion only one bed was made up in the room, when we mentioned it to reception we were told if there is anything left on the bed then they are not allowed to touch it !

There is a huge amount of waste in this hotel as they provide paper cups throughout, as well as paper plates for breakfast which I think is a bit lazy and really unnecessary.  The room was VERY poorly lit.  The beds are quite small but not uncomfortable.  There was no view from our room, but can't say we really expected one. \n\nThe lifts, as many people comment on, are a bit of a pain.  I dread to think what they would be like in peak season.  One morning we waited 15 minutes for a lift.  When one did arrive it had the cleaners in it who turned out the lights and told us to get another lift.  We eventually gave up and walked down the stairs.  \n\nThe day we were due to check out, I called down to reception to ask if we could keep the room a little later and was told we could have it an extra hour (no charge).

The elevators were a huge issue as we were on the 27th floor and every single day I was there, one of the elevators was broken down some point of the day. There was some instance we waited over 10 minutes to take the elevator and when we FINALLY got to the top, both our keys were deactivated. When we put it on the sensor, they blinked red. That means the key reader on the door needs a battery replacement or our keys were made for only 2 nights. Anyways, we went down to get our keys and the \u201csupervisor\u201d who worked at night (pushed hairline) was interrogating us and insinuating we incorrectly handled our door key. I don\u2019t understand why he felt the need to be rude and talked to us like we were crazy! All he needed to do was shut his mouth and give us a reactivated key!

It got off to not a great start as we had paid for a room with a city view and weren't given one, so had to complain to be moved.  However, the staff dealt with this and we were moved to a room with a good view of the city.  The staff in this hotel were very friendly, courteous and accommodating and answered all the questions we had about getting around the city well.  The hotel could definitely do with more than two lifts, we stayed on the 35th floor and the waiting times for the lift were tedious.   The hotel was very convenient for all the sights of New York, though the street that the hotel was actually on wasn't that great, rubbish everywhere and smelt of weed.  The seven eleven on the corner was handy, but hanging around outside were alot of questionable characters. The hotel itself felt safe and was very comfortable but reaching it was another matter.   The breakfast was extremely good, lots of variety and we loved the pancake machine, however the breakfast room got very crowded and was very small so we often resorted to taking the breakfast up to our room.  We were very happy with the concierge service in this hotel who organised a return airport transfer for us when our holiday firm Jet 2 let us down badly.  They also organised some excellent theatre tickets for us too, so a big thank you to them.  If I went back to New York I probably wouldn't return to this hotel even though the staff in there were very pleasant.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

From the lobby, one can see the dining area across. Small but manageable. It gets crowded but the lady on duty replenishing breakfast offers was perfectly managing the guests to get a table or share a table with others. Busy breakfast time was posted inside the lift so guests were forewarned of the busy time.\n\nWe had issue with the tv channel and we informed the reception about it. Quickly the maintenance arrived but seem clueless how to manage the channel listing. No CNN and channel programs were limited.\n\nOn the second day, a note we received that we enrolled in the green program of the hotel which we did not register and was unaware of. Meaning towels and bedsheets will not be replaced. No issue. But together with this is non collection of garbage!? Good thing we only had shopping bags as garbage,  but what if we had food and other rotten fruits? We hang the notice outside for a room cleaning but no action taken. \n\nGood WiFi connectivity inside the room.\n\nBeware of the shuttle service counter. It is not connected with the hotel and is a third party provider. We booked for a private car for airport transfer to maximize travel time and pay a higher price. Was surprised to see other passengers inside the service. The dispatcher and the driver pretended to be unaware of the booking and helped them unload their luggage when we complained. They never helped us with our luggage though. Inside the service, a note was posted for the tipping rate...option for $10 or $20.

As such I fully expected us to have to leave our suitcases and go find a coffee shop until the 4PM check-in time. Lili though from the front desk was our savior - we were able to check into our room immediately! She also ran through the check-in process quickly but in a friendly manner, just what is wanted after a 7 hour flight!\n\nWe were able to get a lift straight away and the general first impression was good - everything looked clean and tidy. Our room (on the 23rd floor) matched this impression - it was very clean but the bathroom did appear dated. \n\nAll the linen was clean and well laid out, after the first night we were given an extra set of towels which helped given we were sharing. The hotel also takes part in a greener scheme where you can choose to launder your towels or not. I couldn't fault the house-keeping, we didn't see many of them for the hotel size but they did a great job.\n\nThe bed was comfy and there were two pillows per person, one of which was firmer than the other which meant you had a bit of choice. \n\nThe only issues we had with the room were it didn't get very warm (we tried fiddling with the air con units) so if you're not used to the colder air con that is standard in NYC this might take some adjustment - however the room was never cold. The shower was also a bit fiddly, in particular trying to get the water to use the shower head and not the tap, but once I got the knack to this it was easy enough. There was a bit of elevator noise but it didn't disturb our sleep. I imagine if you were in the 04 or 05 rooms on a floor it might be more of an issue, but in the 02 room it wasn't too bad. If you wanted to be sure though I'd suggest asking for an 01 or 06 room as they were furthest away.\n\nAs other people have said the elevators can take some time to arrive, but there are signs in them that warn of the 'busy' hours so to be honest with some planning you can avoid the wait at breakfast time.\n\nTalking of breakfast I was quite impressed with the variety (though bacon was only available once during our stay - a shame as this was lovely!). Every day there were some choice of eggs, sausage of some kind (or bacon) and often there were hash browns! Tea and coffee were available in the outer area, along with various juices - the cinnamon buns others have mentioned (so tasty!) and a pancake maker. Next to the hot food were a variety of bagels (with jams (or jelly's) and butter), and various yogurts and cereals. \n\nIf you're at breakfast rush hour you will struggle a bit, there were a lot of nationalities there and shall I just say that not all of them queue... but the lady in charge (blond, very friendly but I never caught her name) was very good at managing things, making sure people didn't cut in line and got seats quickly. I would say the earlier you got to breakfast the better though!\n\nI want to take the time to make a mention of Felipe on reception. He was always polite to all guests, ready with a smile and was really helpful. He helped get my mothers phone onto the Wifi and then on check-out day gave me a temporary code so I could check on our flight whilst waiting for pick-up despite having checked out earlier in the day.\n\nCheck-out time is 11am but the staff seem happy to store people's cases for as along as necessary, as well as allow them to stay in the lobby area. This can make it crowded in the late afternoon - manageable but Friday afternoon was very busy when we were there.\n\nLocation wise this hotel is really well placed. 39th street is close enough to Times Square you can walk there in about 10 minutes, but its far enough away to be quieter. There are a variety of sub shops or restaurants nearby as well.\n\nIf I go back to NYC I would certainly look into staying at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Everybody at the dinning area was very nice and helpful.\n\nI was received by Hillary Hardin, she was very nice and informative. Felipe, at the Reception desk was really nice too and helped me solved a problem I had.\n\nFor the days I visited NYC I felt that it was a little expensive, don\u2019t know why from September 15th to 18th was higher than other days during the year. But I definitely would consider to stay at this hotel when I visit NYC again if I catch an offer.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

As expected for NYC, the room rate was a little higher and square footage was significantly less than a typical HIE room.  But we were pleased with the room itself. However, it felt as if the hotel was overwhelmed by the number of guests.\n\nWhen we arrived at 5PM (check in posted as 4PM), our room was not ready.  The front desk stated they would check with housekeeping and asked us to wait in the lobby.  We did for 20 minutes.  Finally I went back to the desk to inquire and a different woman said it was indeed ready.  How long we would have waited... I am not sure.\n\nOn check out, we asked them to keep our bags for us which they happily agreed to.  Upon our return, we waited patiently in line for our turn and presented our tickets.

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":1139717,"title":"Clean, comfortable hotel near Times Square","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-06-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We just returned from a 5-night stay at the Holiday Inn Express NYC Times Square. This was my first time in the city and I was so excited for the trip. We were traveling together as a family of nine and booked three rooms. \nAfter reading the reviews about the frustrating experience others had had with the elevators, I called several days before our arrival to request a lower floor and have the rooms be together or at least, close by. When we arrived, we were given one room on the 8th floor and the other two on the 26th. I asked if there was anything available for lower, and the front desk staff moved two of our rooms to the 16th and one to the 13th, which worked out pretty well. The hotel is very narrow, with only 8 rooms per floor. Our rooms all faced an adjacent building with absolutely no views, but that was fine. If a view matters to you, I suggest asking for it, because as I understand, some of the rooms have spectacular ones. Our room itself was very small, but clean and comfortable. My room had three people in it, myself and my teenage daughter and niece. We\u2019ve stayed in cruise cabins together before, and this room was somewhat larger. It had two full-sized beds and a tiny bathroom with no counter-space. We kept our toiletries on a little shelf below the sink. The bathroom towels are stored in the shower, which we thought was weird, but happily, they never got wet. Although it was small, the bathroom was clean and the water was hot with plenty of pressure. There was only one luggage rack in the room, a tiny closet and no access to underneath the beds, so finding somewhere to store our suitcases was a bit challenging. There are drawers you can unpack into, but we preferred to keep our things in our suitcases. After some shuffling and improvising, we made it work. The beds were comfortable. The pillows are extremely soft and without support. Some people may like a super soft pillow, but I have neck problems and hated them. I picked the one in the room that was the most firm after a miserable first night, and it did the job. The teenagers in the room thought the pillows were comfortable (youth\u2026lol!!!). Overall, the room was perfectly fine. We were right outside the elevator, but with only eight rooms per floor, there was little foot traffic or noise. We could hear the street noises below, but it didn\u2019t bother us. \nAs others have noted, the hotel is severely lacking in elevators and their accounts of the circumstances are accurate. My advice is to take the stairs going down, if you are able. From the 16th floor, it only takes about two minutes, which sure beats a 15 minute wait. Going up, bring your patience, especially during the busy times (mornings and afternoon check-in). We made sure to have everything together and be ready to go to avoid trips up and down. One note, and major annoyance, was our room keys continually would not work. This was the case with all our rooms. I had to have them replaced no less than four times during our stay. The front desk kept saying not to keep them near our cell phones, but that couldn\u2019t have been the problem as some in our group had their key cards in their pockets and phones in their bags. They also suggested going in and out of stores could deactivate the key cards, but if that were the case, no one in the whole buildings would work!! One of the front desk people told my brother-in-law it was an ongoing issue at the hotel, so be forewarned. I didn\u2019t so much mind the inconvenience (arriving at your door after the elevator ride and having all three keys not work was frustrating) as being told repeatedly it was something we were doing wrong. Other than that, the hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. They even have cookies at the front desk, which the kids really enjoyed, and iced-lemon water which is very welcoming when you arrive back after a full-day of walking. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are always available in the dining area too. \nWe ate breakfast at the hotel each morning. The room was crowded every day, but we always managed to get a seat. People are very willing to share their table, so just ask. The hotel had even expanded its breakfast hours until 10:30 am, which was great. The food was good, like most other hotel breakfasts. However, the menu never changed in the five days we were there. Never. At all. I thought that was odd. Kitchen staff was very friendly and kept the place clean and nice. \nAs for location, the hotel is only a block away from the nearest subway station (Port Authority at 40th and 8th). Get a subway map from the desk as soon as you check in and orient yourself if you\u2019re new to NYC!! We arrived through Penn Station, but Port Authority is much closer to take the trains uptown and downtown. Times Square is about a 5-10 minute walk. There are tons of restaurants near the hotel. We found two nice Italian places and a good deli within a block on 9th street. \nOverall, I enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn Express. It\u2019s clean, comfortable and not far from Times Square. Clean and comfortable are the most important things to me when I\u2019m staying at a hotel.  Whether or not others would like this hotel probably depends on what you are used to when you travel plus how picky or critical you might be. I\u2019m pretty easy to please, so I thought it was a perfectly adequate hotel that suited our needs just fine for this vacation.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

In my opinion unless it\u2019s the Four Seasons or a 5 star hotel all NYC hotels are pretty much the same. This hotel fit that bill. Tall skinny building with about 8 rooms on a floor. The rooms are small but have what you need. I did like the pillows. Will give them that. The problem with these hotels is they are built with two elevators to service over 30 floors. In the morning it makes for a rush. After waiting 15ish mins for the elevator I got on an already cramped elevator on the 36th floor (top floor). The elevator stopped on over 20 floors on the way down. These elevators should be programmed to go down to lobby after 5 stops. The fact that we stopped on almost every floor was ridiculous. Most people couldn\u2019t even get on and continued to wait. But some jerks crammed in, putting us way over capacity. Finally the elevator stopped on the 4th floor and was stuck. For about 10 minutes with 15 people and luggage in an elevator built for 10ish. Thankfully it was only 10 minutes. But they got the doors open on 4 and we all walked down the stairs.

Nothing fancy but superb location with great staff & very clean & comfortable. We stayed here as a party of four a girls trip for 5nights. The location is perfect a few minutes walk to times square couldn't get a better hotel for the price if you want to be close to everything. Our room was small but manageable their were four of us two double beds which were very comfortable we all slept each night comfortably. The bathroom clean & the shower powerful. We were on the 18th floor there was lifts & stairs lifts were quite packed every morning but it was fine. The breakfast which was included was basic but satisfying and tasty. The staff throughout the hotel were all very friendly & helpful. If I return to NY I wouldn't look up any other hotel this would be my Go to & will 100% be reccomending it to anyone I know who will be visiting NY. ","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We were delighted to have a complementary upgrade in the room with skyline view to the river , empire state and a wonderful city view ..... the rooms were clean and tidy bit small but with everything available including tea\/ coffee maker..... The best thing about this hotel is its superb location couple blocks away from everything: broadway theatres, station, subway, all restaurants, center of times square. Yet the room was very quiet. And above all great value for money. I highly recommend for short vacations and couples trip. The only drawback was elevator, although during my stay this problem we did not face, but its highly probable to occur as its bit time wasting to have 2 elevators to serve a 36 floor hotel .... waiting time could be a waste .... but we were happy we did not suffer with that eigther.

The hotel is very centrally located within walking distance everything Manhattan has to offer. I had read some unfavourable reviews online about the breakfast so I was surprised with the variety on offer. The experience was made better by the friendly staff, particularly one male and female (I regret that I did not get their names) who went over and beyond to welcome everyone with a friendly hello and assist with any problems they may have had. Their hospitality certainly got each day off to a bright start.\n\nThe rooms were a touch on the smaller side as you would expect for central New York but the beds were large and comfortable. Given we were not spending a whole pile of time in the rooms this suited us perfect.\n\nThe only downside was that their could be a significant wait for the elevators around  peak times e.g. breakfast and check-in.

Check in was fast and efficient even surprised us with the fact that breakfast was included which were were not expecting. We did show our selves to our room which I don't have a problem with, the room it's self was great it had two beds in it, had they been the typical English single the room would have been twice the size as the beds were huge. Made up with clean, fresh, crisp linen pillows to sink your head into at the end of a tiring day, the mattress was firm just how we like them. \nThe bathroom was small but addequate with lovely soft towels and lots of complementary shower gel\/shampoo etc. Considering how cold it was outside we had a lovely warm room which we could control the heating.. There was a tv but didn't use it. \nWhich brings us to breakfast ... The restaurant is small and if you were down early there was no problem with seating but leave it till much later and there were some standing around waiting to be seated. The choice was lovely I'd say something for everyone I can highly recommend the hot cinnamon rolls perfect you could even make your own pancakes with the natty machine. Over the 4 breakfasts we had there was always plenty to choose and a good selection what ever time early or late you ate breakfast. Breakfast was a hit for us and set us up for the long day of sight seeing.\nNow the staff well what can I say they were brill always had a welcome smile and defiantly eager to help, we called at reception every morning explained our plans for the day and they gave us good sound advise and posted out what sub way we needed to use. They were so helpful I cannot praise them enough they helped make our experience a memorable one. Would definitely recommend the hotel great location.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We are both IHG-members.  \nWe arrived finally after 24 hours travelling  (delay plane, snow storm in New York, traffic completely blocked, completely wet)  in Holiday Inn Express New York Times Square at 10pm. \nWe were very surprised that our booking was cancelled because a month ago I had to cancel my credit card. The girl at the front desk (Cynthia) asked her colleague (Tyler) to help.\nHe was telling us that the hotel was fully booked and he could do nothing for us. It was our fault because we cancelled the credit card. I asked him why he didn\u2019t send an email to me to request a new credit card. Especially for IHG-members and employee. \nHe said that we were in New York and he followed the procedures.  It was our fault and he didn\u2019t want to help. \nWe asked if he could help us because there were no more rooms available in Manhattan for less than 400$\/N. His answer was that we had to make a reservation ourselves. He should not make a reservation for us. After a discussion that he had to help us, he finally called CRS  (reservations) but he gave me the phone immediately. \nI was on the phone four about 15 minutes. CRS found a room on employee-rate in\u2026 Holiday Inn Express New York Times Square !!! We booked the room on CRS demand ! When I said that we had a reservation for 1 night in H.I. Expr. Times Square to Tyler he became angry and said that they had no rooms available and that I was bullying him. Also an IHG-employee told me on the phone that the front desk employee had to help any IHG member. He made a report about our case.When I told Tyler he still refused even after the IHG-employee called him. \nAt midnight my friend said several times \u201cS...\u201d and then Tyler started to yell that he was cursing on him. He became extremely rude and yelled loud. I think they could hear him on Times Square. He wanted to call the police. He said he could book a room (much more expensive) on Long Island or Jersey or the other choice was that we left or he called the police. I told him to call the police. He started to dial but probably he realized that he was wrong and stopped the call. My friend wanted to leave and looked for an Airport hotel to find a place to sleep at a decent price. \nAt once the female front desk employee Cynthia told him that they had an early check-out and there was a room available. We only had to wait 15 minutes to make up the room. \nShe was very affected about everything what happened the last 2,5 hours and she did everything she could to convince Tyler to give us the room. For us she\u2019s the employee of the year 2018 !! Around 1am we could finally go to our room and at once we could even book the next 2 nights on employee rate ! \nEverything was impeccable for the next 3 days as we experienced on previous stays in H.I. hotels. We just had a bad feeling when we passed the front desk and saw Tyler. That guy doesn\u2019t fit into a Holiday Inn Hotel. He better fits as a warden in Guantanamo prison.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Arrive early as very popular. Just turn right out the hotel and right at the end of the road and keep walking a few blocks. Or if your sightseeing near Times Square can recommend Juniors too!! Lovely cooked breakfast. \n\nCan also recommend Ellen\u2019s Star Dust dinner for dinner again very popular so you will queue.

Geen last van lawaai van de straat.\nWinkels en veel highlights op loopafstand. \nWij zaten op de 31e verdieping (familiekamer) en hadden uitzicht op One Tower en Empire State Building.\nHet ontbijt was prima, druk, maar goed verzorgd. Personeel is allemaal erg vriendelijke en zeker behulpzaam. \nIn het hotel kaartjes gekocht voor Empire State. We werden ook goed ge\u00efnformeerd.\nVoor de terugreis ook de transfer via het hotel geboekt, dat is veel goedkoper dan met een Uber.\nZal zeker weer naar dit hotel gaan bij een volgend bezoek aan New York en dat gaat zeker gebeuren!","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Every single one of you helped make our trip a fantastic one.  Especially to the young lady in the breakfast staff (black and pink headband I believe her name is Michelle) who went above and beyond each morning to assist us and start our day out right.\n\nI was nervous about traveling to NYC with my 7 year old daughter and it couldn't have gone better.  \n\nThe location of this hotel is absolutely perfect!  Just a short walk to the the Port Authority subway station, Times Square, New York Public Library, Top of the Rock and Broadway St James Theatre.  We also walked from the hotel to Pier 83 where the Circle Line Best of NYC Cruise picks up, Central Park and the High Line.   \n\nThe free hot breakfast started each day out right.  Super friendly workers each day!  My daughter LOVED the pancake making station. \n\nWe arrived early on a Tuesday before check in and left late Friday afternoon after check out. It was an easy and wonderful service to check our bags at the front desk when we arrived and on the day we checked out.\n\nI highly recommend the Irish Pub \"Tir na Nog\" just a few steps from the hotel on 39th street.  \n\nWe also \"braved\" getting to the hotel from LGA via bus\/subway instead of cab or Uber which saved us a lot of money.  We packed light just for this option, only 2 suitcases and a stroller for me, my daughter and my mom.  That process was much easier than I expected.  From Terminal 2 baggage claim at LGA go up to the 2nd floor (the bus also picks up at other terminals), pick up a Metrocard from the machine that is located at the exit just past Hudson newspaper stand.  You can get an unlimited one for the week for around $30 but we chose to do the pay per ride since we weren't going to use the subway much so we loaded the card with $10.50 each.  Cross the street to the green bus stand.  Get on the Q70 bus (they didn't check our metro card on this bus so we didn't need to swipe it until we got to the subway station- but on our return to the airport we did need to swipe our metro card to get a free ticket for the bus).  Get off the bus at Roosevelt Ave\/Jackson Heights station.  Hop on the \"E\" train that's headed towards the World Trade Center.   You will get off on the 42nd street \/ Port Authority station.  Then it's just a short 7 minute walk to the hotel.     The Q70 bus had luggage racks and on the subway we just stood next to our luggage. \n\nI would definitely stay at this hotel again.  I agree with the other reviews that the rooms are small but since we were just there to sleep it didn't bother us.  Also, since we were packing light it was great that the hotel supplied shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap and body gel so we didn't need to pack any of those items.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I thought the room was comfortable for 2 nights in the city - enough room for 2 people and a bit of luggage. The room was right next to the elevators, but we didn't hear them. The annoying part of the stay was actually the availability of the elevators. The hotel is tall - 36 floors - and only has 2 elevators. The location of the elevators makes it quite cramped while waiting and makes it difficult for people getting off and getting on to exist in the same space. If you want to use an elevator mid-morning on a Saturday or Sunday, good luck. Many people are checking out and\/or heading out into the city. You may be waiting 15 mins or more. A similar bottleneck begins late afternoon into the evening when people are checking in and\/or heading to dinner before seeing a show. During our stay, one of the two elevators malfunctioned two days in a row, which meant there was only 1 working elevator. When I say malfunction, it would stop at every floor for no reason, and the door would bounce back open instead of closing completely, thereby preventing you from actually moving to another floor. Again, the rooms themselves were comfortable. The problem is accessing them in a timely manner. (FYI: I was on floor 28 and did take the stairs down on one occasion because the elevator was taking forever).","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Situado en una calle tranquila (toda la tranquilidad que puedes encontrar en Manhattan). Nosotros fuimos en agosto 18 y el hotel estaba bastante lleno. La entrada es peque\u00f1a y en la recepci\u00f3n hay dos trabajadoras que hablan espa\u00f1ol. Pedimos poder hacer el checking de salida m\u00e1s tarde ya que el avi\u00f3n sal\u00eda por la noche y nos cobraron 10 $ por cada hora de m\u00e1s.  Encontr\u00e9 bastante caro pero era el precio que ten\u00edan (en total pagu\u00e9 60$ m\u00e1s).\nLa habitaci\u00f3n que nos dieron era en el piso 11. Hay dos ascensores para subir y son bastante r\u00e1pidos. Solo hab\u00eda problema a primera hora de la ma\u00f1ana cuando todo el mundo va a desayunar. El resto del d\u00eda no tuvimos problema para cogerlos.  \nLa habitaci\u00f3n es muy vieja. Con moqueta bastante deteriorada y sucia. La luz no va con tarjeta como todos los hoteles, sino que va con interruptores de los de antes. Con este detalle se puede comprobar que el hotel ha quedado bastante anticuado. Adem\u00e1s la habitaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 llena de muebles que dificultan poder moverse en silla de ruedas. Yo voy con una silla manual que hace 60 cm de ancha. Al final tuvimos que sacar sillas al pasillo y mover alg\u00fan mueble para poder moverme por una parte de la habitaci\u00f3n. Imposible llegar hasta la ventana o hasta el armario, no pasas con la silla.\nEl aire acondicionado funcionaba bien, aunque era un poco ruidoso. La cama es alta y muy c\u00f3moda. Nosotros dormimos muy bien y no siempre encuentro un colch\u00f3n tan c\u00f3modo en los hoteles. Esto despu\u00e9s de las largas caminatas de cada d\u00eda se agradece. \nEl lavabo no est\u00e1 mal pero tampoco es de lo mejor. El wc tiene las t\u00edpicas barras americanas que no entiendo como las ponen ni a quien le van bien. El protector del desag\u00fce era de risa (adjunto foto) y la ducha era a cota 0 pero con deficiencias: la banqueta aguant\u00f3 mi peso aunque se mov\u00eda un poco. Y desde la banqueta no llegas al grifo por lo tanto alguien te tiene que ayudar a abrir y cerrar el agua. Y lo m\u00e1s importante: sal\u00edan unos bichitos del desag\u00fce que no hac\u00edan muy buena pinta. No s\u00e9 si llegaban hasta la habitaci\u00f3n porqu\u00e9 con la moqueta uno no ve\u00eda nada.\nA destacar que el personal de limpieza de las habitaciones no da abasto y tienen como prioridad limpiar las habitaciones que entran ese d\u00eda por lo tanto a veces tardaban mucho en limpiar la habitaci\u00f3n nuestra y hasta por la tarde no estaban hechas. \nEl personal de la entrada no es que fuera muy simp\u00e1tico, e iban muy atareados siempre sin hacerte mucho caso.\nEn cambio el personal del desayuno era muy atento y muy simp\u00e1tico. \nEl resumen es que por ese precio seguramente puedes encontrar otros hoteles que est\u00e9n mejor. Aqu\u00ed entra el desayuno en la tarifa pero es un desayuno bastante pobre. \nYo recomiendo que tampoco te obsesiones en buscar un hotel muy c\u00e9ntrico. Vale m\u00e1s la pena buscar un hotel con estaci\u00f3n de metro accesible cerca. Igualmente estar\u00e1s arriba y abajo todo el d\u00eda. \nDisfruta de NY, vale mucho la pena!","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

You can easily walk from the hotel the Herald Square where you can take the subway to Wall Street, Staten Island Ferry, 911 Memorial etc. One negative i would say is be careful booking hop on hop off buses. Once again i paid $200 for a 3 day ticket for 4 of us and only used it once. We could have used the subway for $3 each. We've been to New York several times now (our favourite city) and like any main City Centre expect crowds, expect prices to be higher than the outskirts but make sure you plan your days and make the most of the vacation.

The breakfast buffet was more than adequate and an easy way to start the day.  The only complaint are the elevators.  Waiting sometimes for more than 10 minutes for one to arrive meant that many mornings we took the stairs down to the lobby.  The location is great for walking to many midtown sites including Times Square, Macy's, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Building and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

Fortunately we found 2 rooms at the Holiday Inn Express in Times Square on 39th Street. Unfortunately our driver dropped us off at the Holiday Inn and we had to walk to the correct hotel. The walk at midnight to the hotel was certainly not pleasant, complete with prostitutes, young men in gangs smoking marijuana and sketchy people everywhere. At the hotel we are greeted by a very friendly woman who said unfortunately I cannot get the two of you on the same floor. Ok fine whatever, just need rooms. Finally get our keys, head to the elevator and a middle aged man gets on with us. He tried to make small talk asking way more than he needed to know and gets off the elevator. I get off on my floor and my staff member goes on up to hers. Standing outside of my room I can hear voices. Wanting to make sure they were from my room I walked over to another room to listen. Nope the male voices are definitely coming from the room I was assigned. I head back to the front desk where the front desk clerk acts surprised. Then arrives my co-worker. Not only did I find my room occupied but she did too. She did not hear any noises and walked in the room to find luggage and men's clothing! Front desk clerk still acts surprised - other clerk looks at her and says did you actually put them in xxxx rooms and then shakes her head. We get new rooms - somehow on the same floor - told they just opened up. Really at 12:30 am and within 5 minutes? We get back on the elevator. Funny this same large man gets on with us for the 2nd time. He says hey what happened and very briefly say we needed our rooms updated. He looks at the button we pressed on the elevator and he looks at my co-worker and says oh I bet you are in room 1704, I will see you later. How in the world did he know what room she was in? We both had our keys hidden in our hands.\n\nWe were both absolutely shaken by his comment and at this point who do we trust? Is this a set up? A scam? We are both extremely tired and hungry and had been at the airport for over 12 hours. We knew we could not leave the hotel because where in the world would we go? Cannot trust the front desk agent and who is this man? What if I would have walked into that first room? What if that man would have been in the room my co-worker walked into?  We were so shaken, I had my co-worker in my room for our safety and even pushed the chair and table up against the door for added protection.

The main issues were the lifts and the stairs! We were there 3 nights and there was only one lift in use. Sometimes the staff would take manual control of the lift (during busier times)  and unless you phoned reception it would never appear. We walked down twice. The lift is shared with staff, so often had bin residue and was generally not an acceptable situation for a large chain hotel, wasting our time and being a general inconvenience. I guess we all had to accept this inconvenience as we were not offered any discount to the rate we paid- nor were we advised of this beforehand. The other issue is a little more worrying. I noticed (on my walk down the 20 odd storeys) that several landings had black bags of rubbish. I brought this to the reception staffs attention, out of concern for fire hazard. The next day, this was still the case. I would urge the hotel to please review this and make improvement as it would appear to be the normal.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We always walked the 21 flights downstairs (which isn't practical for everyone) and just waited for the lift up a although did walk it up once when there was about 20 people ahead of us queuing. They did have someone controlling the lift at peak times so if you phoned reception they would get the elevator to stop at your floor.

The hotel staff is terrific \u2014 very friendly at the reception desk, extremely friendly at breakfast (and great at moving people along when seating is at a premium). Our room overlooked another high-rise, but we had a wee glimpse of sky so could guess at the weather in the morning. The room was small but adequate, with a desk and lots of plugs for devices. The AC\/heating system was really good and easy to operate, though noisy. Take your earplugs! Other than the fan noise, the room and hallways were quiet. The bed was extremely comfortable with clean, crisp linen. The bathroom was small but worked for us.\n\nOn the downside, there were some issues that should be addressed. The security chain on the door was missing a screw, the bottom of the bathtub needed a good scrubbing, and the easy chair in the hall needed a thorough cleaning or, better yet, replacing. On the plus side, the lighting was good for reading or for working on a laptop.\nThe complimentary breakfast had lots of options \u2014 hot egg dishes, bacon, sausages, cereals, fruits, yogurt, etc. Delicious cinnamon buns!! But be warned: if you don\u2019t get there early enough, you won\u2019t get a seat. Between 6:30 and 7:30 is your best bet, but even then, you\u2019ll probably have to share a table.\nAs with many hotels, the Holiday Inn uses disposable plastic or Styrofoam cutlery and dishes. Very distressing to see the amount of material that\u2019s thrown out every day. Styrofoam cups and plastic glasses in the rooms as well. And the pathetic signs (often ignored) to \u201csave the planet\u201d by re-using your towels. When will this nonsense stop?? Use glassware and wash the dishes!","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This is a tall, skinny building. The hallways are very narrow (barely wide enough for a housekeeping cart). People waiting for the elevator on the ground floor are in the way of people using the stairwells and also in the way of people going to and and from the breakfast area. The breakfast area is small and cramped, and the signs in the elevators warn you that it will get more crowded as time passes. They are telling the truth. A good choice is to take a tray back up to your room, since it can be very hard to find any place to sit.\n\nWe weren't surprised that our room was small. It was smaller than most \"studio\" rooms we've seen. With the king bed and a little bit of furniture, it was tight. Two adults could not move around at the same time. Just getting dressed in the morning required careful choreography. The tiny bathroom had no counter space, although there was a tiny shelf over the toilet. The towels were hung in the shower instead of on the wall, so they tended to stay damp all the time. This is the first time we've stayed in a Holiday Inn Express that didn't have a small refrigerator in the room, which was disappointing. But, seriously, there wouldn't be room for it unless you got rid of something else. \n\nThis 36-floor building is served by two elevators. There is almost always a long wait for the elevator, and it is worse in the morning when people are checking out and the elevators fill up with bodies and suitcases, with the elevator stopping on almost every floor, only to disappoint people who can't squeeze in.\n\nApparently there is no good place to store the housekeeping carts. One was always left parked outside our room overnight, partly blocking the doorway.\n\nThere was a really nice looking vending machine on our floor, but it was out of order the entire week we were there.\n\nOn the positive side: We didn't hear too much street noise in our room, because we were on the side of the hotel not overlooking 39th St. We used the fan to block outside sounds. The bed was comfortable. We appreciated having a good-sized safe in the closet. The WiFi worked well most of the time. The building is in walking distance to restaurants, subway stops, and Times Square. There is no guest laundry, but there are laundromats in walking distance. The people working the front desk were courteous.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

On entering our room I was pleasantly surprised and not what I was expecting as a holiday Inn Express brand, the rooms were more furnished to the Holiday Inn brand. The room was clean and well-furnished and the bathroom had both a bath and shower with proper toiletries by Bath & Body works and not the usual dispenser attached to the wall as normal Expresses. Good choice of items for breakfast (apart from the sausage gravy which was on offer one day). We liked the pancake making machine. Breakfast area is on the small size and can become very busy at times but the staff kept it moving and a very short wait for a table or offer a tray to take back to your room. One good idea I liked was that they put in the lifts a coloured coded guide for breakfast times stating the most and least busy times which can help plan your day. One note of caution, due to the close proximity of the hotels which back onto this hotel, one day my wife was opening the curtains and got more of a sight then she was expecting from the gentlemen opposite. The hotel is ideally placed within New York to reach all the attraction either on foot or the subway which is a two minute walk away. The nearest subway station 42 Street is on the direct \u2018E\u2019 line with JFK Airport. This is a good choice of hotel for a short break visit.

I was on the 21st floor and only had to deal with a 10 minute elevator wait once during my 3 day visit, however, the people on the elevator coming form the higher floors, told me they had waited over 25 minutes! I hope the hotel can figure out how to time the use of elevators during busy times of the morning.  Also due to the footprint  of each floor with  the two elevators, when guests closed their doors, it was very loud.

We had a good night sleep. Hotel was quiet at night. The construction right in front of the hotel didn't bother our sleep. Quite spacious room. It has closet with seats we can sit or hang our stuff. \n\n3) Bathroom- has enough space for me but for my tall hubby (6\"3 ft), he says a bit small for him. Bathroom is Clean and smells clean. We got free toiletries and clean towels everyday. You can request other stuff like toothbrush and such. The only thing I was hoping they will have is bidet.\n\n4) Breakfast- variety is quite ok. My hubby is happy having bacon on our first day but they replaced it was replaced with sausages on the 2nd day. I'm not a bacon person so I like that they got fruits, milk, juices, coffee, bread, pancakes, diff varieties of yoghurt, scrambled egg or omelette, and turkey burger. So it was quite ok for me. It made me full and happy as I start the day. I was only hoping that their pantry will be larger to accommodate more people like the ones we had at Paris Canal Villete or Amsterdam Central. But I didn't have any issues since we have our breakfast by 7-8am. \n\n5) Customer service- staff are great and accommodating. I guess that's basic for every holiday inn express, it's their brand service. Their smile made me home and comfortable with every inquiry or request I made. Kudos!\n\n6) Location- location was great. We just walked going to Rockeffeler, Grand Central Terminal, Central Park and Times Square. There are a lot of restaurants and convenience store at the area. Also just 2 blocks away from the subway and bus station.\n\nHotel is very basic and quite old building.

First of all the lobby is impossible to navigate because it's so small. With the influx of people, staff and the ridiculously small hallway near the elevators, it's a nightmare to wheel a cart of luggage and things in and out of. \n\nThe room itself was tiny even for NYC standards. It was also dingy and dirty. When I went to wash my face before heading out for the day the towel I used literally had an imprint of what looked like makeup (as if someone threw the towel on their face with makeup on in an effort to wipe it off). Usually I decline room service on quick stays but on this one I wanted new towels, when I returned to my room late in the evening on day 2 I was hoping my room might have been serviced but I'm pretty confident all that was done was fold the same sheets neatly back onto my bed and guess what? I had no new towels! The old ones were collected and the remaining unused one was all I had left. Also, I couldn't get the TV to turn on or respond to anything until the morning of my departure.\n\nThis hotel is tiny, dingy, and disappointing.

It seems the way the airlines of America have somewhat different standards than the rest of Europe and Middle East, hotels also have different standards. I've got to say the staff are somewhat great but it is the system and hotel as a whole that could have been better. The hotel is usually well overpriced yet unlike its European or Middle Eastern HIEs, it doesn't even have a refrigerator to store water\/drinks or basic necessities e.g. medicines. Ageing furnitures and or airconditioning unit needs to updated\/with full of dirt (raises hygiene issue - something that probably wouldn't be tolerated in Europe. Electric switch and sockets seems like ready to come off, making one fear for the hotel security deposit amount blocked on the card. \nNearby construction is an issue and may affect the sleep for those who are sensitive to noises or who wants to lie in beyond 7:30am (which in my case I wanted to do following previous day long flight).\nBreakfast is OK but again could do much better with fresher and better quality produce rather than producing mass produced ready made warmed up food. Vegetarian option lacking\/cross contamination is an issue, which are again better enforced in Europe. \nLifts\/elevators are a big problem as it seems to take ages to arrive (allow extra 10-15 mins on hand) if one has meeting to attend or going for breakfast before the cut off time).\n\nIt seems the hotel owners are indifferent to service improvements due to knowing of the fact that high demand would always remain regardless, thanks to location.

Crowded buffet breakfast, but it works. You may have to wait for a table at peak times.  The lifts are a problem, but not a game changer.  Tip: if you're on a higher floor waiting to go down, press both the down and up buttons.

Pros: close to Times Square about 5 blocks less than half a mile, a little farther from Broadway theaters about 15 to 20 minute brisk walk. There are dining places everywhere, some open 24 hours. There's Grays Papaya across the streer, pizza places, Kungfu Chinese restaurant. Hells kitchen is within 5 minutes walk. The room is large for New York standards and the double bed room was spacious and contains a bathroom with tub. The beds are super comfortable. There is a Keurig machine, no refrigerator, there is a safe. Toiletries are Bath and Body Works. The view is ok, buildings. You can hear the street but noise is manageable. The staff is friendly. Breakfast is basic-omelettes,fruit, bread,yogurt,juice,coffee,tea, sausage,biscuits and gravy,cinnamon rolls,and the pancake making machine is amazing. The space was super small but the staff did their best to seat people. You can always take the food back to your room or eat at the main lobby table. My sister and I decided to eat breakfast between 730 and 745 am and this worked,since at 8 everyone arrives at the same time. There is a microwave and water machine in the breakfast room. The elevators are slow in the am and sometimes only 1 is working so this is the definite con,but we were not in a hurry since we planned our schedule to leave earlier if we have to meet a reservation. Used a Lyft from the airport to this hotel about $60, Port authority is about a 5 min to 10 min walk if commuting.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I have had good experiences with Holiday Inn before so I thought my hotel stay was the least of my worries while in NYC.  We were there for 3 days and on the first day, one of the elevators was out of service and there was a 20 to 45-minute wait to take the elevator.  On the second day they had an employee operating the one working elevator and this was even worse as the elevator often bypassed your floor because the elevator was too full, and we had wait times of 45 minutes or more.  Mind you, we would have walked down the stairs had we known how long it would take, but being on the 26th floor I was not looking forward to having to walk down.  The day we were to check out was the worst of all.  We left early because we knew there would be a delay but did not imagine that it would be a minimum of 1 to 1.5 hours to wait for the elevator.  We had a flight to catch so I had no choice but to carry our two bags down 26 flights of stairs!  By the time I got to the 18th floor I was so exhausted and in pain that I could hardly lift the bags, and having to carry 2 bags side by side caused them both to scrape against the stairwell walls.  When we got to the lobby, I was so out of breath that I could not even talk and both bags were completely ruined.  I wanted so badly to complain but I didn't have the strength or time to do so, and just left as quickly as possible.  To make it worse, we ended up missing our train and had to wait nearly 2 hours for the next one to our destination.  I am thankful that I will never set foot in NYC; let alone in that hotel.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Everything in New York proved to be expensive, especially when close to Times Square and the hotel's price of about $270.00 U.S. a night was definitely steep, for the quality of the hotel, which is pretty basic.  The front lobby entrance is not overly impressive, nor was our room, which was quite small, but clean. However, the staff at the hotel was excellent-very friendly and informed, especially the different concierges that were there, during our 10-day stay.  Issues were dealt with quickly and efficiently. e.g. the stopper in the bath was not working well and an engineer was sent right away.\n\nOne day there was a problem with 1 of the elevators (2 in total)and people were waiting longer than half an hour to get one.  Some got very irate, because they were leaving that day and had luggage with them.  This problem did not occur again. \n\nNearby 9th. Ave offers lots of choices for places to eat, as does 7th and 8th Ave.  Do also try the food trucks on the street!  Unfortunately we did not try them until fairly late into our trip and they provide yummy food at a more reasonable price than the restaurants.

First, we arrived around 10:00pm on a Tuesday night. We drove, so of course we needed valet parking. We checked in and asked about what we needed to do. The front desk lady told us to take all of our belongings out of the car and then bring her the keys and she would have it taken care of. We did as she instructed, went on up to our room and got settled in. We decided to go for a short walk, so we headed on back down approximately 35-45 minutes after we had checked in. To our surprise, our vehicle was still sitting in the street, unattended. This was our first  clue that perhaps the hote wasn't as dedicated to customer service as they should be. When we stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square, they took your car and drove off as soon as you unloaded! However, we decided to go on towards Times Square for a little bit. We returned to the hotel sometime after 11:00pm, and our car had been moved. We went up to our room and noticed a strong smell of smoke. The air conditioning unit had just kicked on, so we didn't think much of it. However, the smell of smoke was strong every.single.time. the unit came on. Concerned, I called the front desk to report the problem. Immediately, the gentleman that answered the phone assured me that I had the heat on, instead of the air. I informed him that the thermostat was set to 60 degrees, so I was pretty  certain that it indeed was not the heat. He said he would have an engineer come up within 5 minutes. 5 minutes later, the engineered entered our room and declared \"Oh, its working now, huh?\" to which I replied that the unit had always worked, but smelled of smoke every time that it turned on. He said the same thing as the front desk, that I must have the heat on, to which I offered him a look at the thermostat. This behavior struck me as unconcerned because this guy hadn't even attempted to LOOK at our unit or the thermostat and was already offering excuses. So I told him that I didn't feel as if he could declare the unit to be problem free if he hadn't even looked at it. He literally walked over to our unit, looked over and put his hands over the unit and assured me that there wasn't a fire and that it was fine. Then he went on to say that there were no other rooms available so he didn't have any other suggestions. I should just take his word because he had worked on those units for 9 years. Somehow, I didn't feel any better about the situation. He then left the room. After his departure, I assured my family that this would be our one and only stay at HIE NYC-Times Square, and probably Holiday Inn\/HIEs in general. What a terrible first night of our NYC trip, compliments of HIE NYC-Times Square!! ","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"NONE"}

The most convenient way to get to the hotel is Yellow Cab from the JFK Airport. There are shuttle busses (only online detailed reservation guarantee your seats, which might be a problem with your flight or passport control delays), Big Bus service (does not go to the Manhattan Centre), and a Train-Underground connection with multiple changes (might be tough with luggage and jet leg:). The yellow cab will cost you between 60-65 dollars from JFK to the Hotel front door, and if you consider to arrive in style it is better to do it as an outward journey rather than return one, which is always more expensive: around 10-15 dollars more.The shuttle bus service (up to 6 passengers) from the hotel to the Airport is available to arrange from an independent provider at the hotel reception (around 25 dollars per person). I booked en-suite twin double-bed room- good size room with a tea\/coffee express, a big TV screen and Free WiFi just to mention these. There is a free of charge computer lounge with free printing facilities for the guests, which we used to print our museum reservations and boarding cards. On checking-out you can safely stove your luggage on request at the reception (no extra charge). There is a free breakfast included: not just a piece of toast and a cup of coffee but a real feast. There is everything you could possibly wish for: you can have French-style breakfast, or English fried-up or eat in American style. I loved self-made waffles with strawberry or choc chips with maple syrup, and hot jam-rolls\/ buns and fruit and choc cup cakes. Varied selection of cereals\/ porridge, meat and egg meals,yogurts and fresh fruit. Breakfast served between 7 and 11 to suit everybody's schedule. After that time, there is 24 hour tea and coffee service available in the hall with take-away options. How nice is that: a cup of coffee on your way to Times Square. Hotel staff friendly and discreet, always helpful and patient with your requests. Very quiet hotel at night time - best quality sleep I had for months. Ten-floor rooms had a lovely window views. There are two lifts for guests and they seemed to work a bit slow especially at breakfast time. The hotel was planning to undergo redecoration, so be ready for some improvements. In America the weather is measured in Fahrenheit degrees, so do not get excited if you hear on the weather channel - 25 degrees, as I did:). I had to learn how to do conversions into Celsius: 32 F is equal 0 C degree, but it is not only about deductions, since the formula is more complicated, eg. for 25 degree it will be: (25-32)x5\/9. I have seen hotel guests staying with their dogs, so there must be a possibility to do pet-friendly bookings. As far as I know there is a fitness room, however I preferred to run outdoors, along Broadway to Central Park. I had absolutely lovely time in Chelsea Holiday Inn and I will definitely look for more promotions to do another booking soon.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We've stayed at this location as well as the 5th avenue location in NYC before as well as dozens of other cities.\n\nDisappointments: In our first room, we arrived to a leaking toilet. At first we hoped it was just a dirty room with shower water left on the floor but that wasn't the case. We notified the front desk on our second day. Someone came within a few hours. The next morning we woke up to even more water on the floor and could see that it was coming out of the base (gross). We called again. Someone came at 9 at night and then randomly again at midnight! He scared us to death. We were told it was fixed. The next morning we woke up again to puddles everywhere. The front desk offered to move us rooms. We didn't really want to pack and unpack again but we didn't want toilet water on the floor either so we moved. My second disappointing issue was the daily housekeeping service. We stayed 8 nights - most days we came back to a random number of things (like no floor towel, 1 washcloth, 2 lotions instead of a conditioner, not enough TP). It didn't seem to matter what floor or what day it was - we never had the correct amount of anything and either had to make do or call and ask.  Unfortunately the air conditioning was frustrating too. We had it set for 68. Every 10 minutes or so it automatically changed to 72. It was a heat index of 98 this week. It was ridiculous that we couldn't cool the room down. And lastly, although an issue in NYC in general, there just aren't enough elevators. We waited 35 minutes to make our first trip to the lobby to checkout. \n\nPositives:\nThe location is great. 10 minutes to Times Square. 30 minute walk to Central Park. A few restaurants a few doors down (an Irish Pub, a sandwich\/coffee shop, etc.). Front desk is friendly. Breakfast staff friendly. Although the free breakfast isn't anything I really eat, my husband and daughter found something every morning. There's a parking garage right before the hotel (opposite side of road).

I selected this location because it was close to Times Square and other points of interest. The location is very convenient as you can take the subway from 42nd street and it's a short walk from Penn Station.\n\nWe were greeted warmly by the front desk and they mentioned my IHG reward membership. Our attendant mentioned our room would be upgraded (although I'm not sure what this entailed - perhaps a higher floor with a view?). Our requested accommodations were noted and the most important thing to us was to have 2 double beds in a non-smoking room.\n\nOur room on the 24th floor was clean and had moderate space (it is NYC). The bathroom was clean as well, but the sink drained slowly and we were only given 2 towels despite my noting of a total of 4 guests. I called the front desk and more towels were delivered in a timely manner. The beds were comfortable and the shower had good water pressure. There is a hair dryer in the bathroom. Note that there is no mini-fridge in the room. Free wifi is provided and that was fine, although my boyfriend mentioned at times it was a bit slow.\n\nWe partook in breakfast every morning. On weekends it runs until 10am and weekdays until 9:30am, I believe. The quality of the food and the selection was decent and matched other Holiday Inns I've stayed at before. The dining area is a little tight so you might have to wait for a table to sit down.\n\nDuring our three night stay, our room was picked up once but towels were forgotten. I'm not sure if this was due to the issues with the elevator, but again we called and replacement towels were brought up in a timely manner. \n\nSo the elevator issue. My suggestion is that if you stay here, select a room close to ground level so you can take the stairs. This entire hotel is serviced by only two elevators, so going up and down takes a significant amount of time. If you are trying to catch a specific train, leave with ample time to get down to the ground floor or be ready to take the stairs the entire way.\n\nIf that wasn't the worst of it, on the last morning after breakfast, my boyfriend and I were in the elevator with at least 11 other guests. We were trying to go back to the 24th floor and the elevator stopped at least 4 times, denying other guests from getting on because there was simply no room. Around the 10th floor, 2 guest pushed their way on, we hit the weight limit, and were stuck on the elevator for at least 10 minutes. The technicians arrived as quickly as they could (the time it took for them to get to us was probably them climbing 10 flights of stairs). \n\nUpon checkout we mentioned the incident and the front desk was apologetic.

Can't fault the hotel at all.\nI wish there was an option on travelzoo to buy breakfast.\nThe hotel can not beat travelzoos price. $194 per night at the hotel about $40-50 cheaper to buy via travelzoo.

I still think its a good location to Times Square and the staff are still friendly. The rooms are the same - pretty cramped but standard for the price and location. The room furniture is starting to look worn and the elevators were out of order several times during my week long stay. There are 6 rooms per floor and the elevators or people talking in the tiny hallway can be heard clearly. Breakfast is still in a tiny space but the wait for a table is not too long and the selection of food is good. This time however there were bugs in my room! I was promptly moved to another better room and the staff apologised profusely and dealt with the situation. In conclusion although the hotel is starting to show its age and can do with some upkeep I think I will still stay there next time as I trust the staff to provide excellent customer service in any circumstance.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I requested 2 beds and when I checked in they said it wasn't guaranteed. The front desk clerk was nice enough to give us a king instead of 1 queen, but it was still a bit disappointing. \n\nI noticed on another review that they said they had laundry service. Come to find out, the laundry service was next door in Candlewood Suites in their basement. Housekeeping in that hotel was also using the washers and dryers so you had to wait for one to be available. Since I was in the other hotel and doing 2 loads, I was walking back and forth and jogging up and down basement stairs, which was a bit inconvenient so head's up about that. \n\nIn the morning and evening, expect to wait a while for the elevator. There are only 2 and they are used by the hotel staff and all guests. You can wait up to 10 minutes when it's really busy. In the afternoon the housekeepers are in there with their carts. Also, we had housekeeping come at 6pm one day and when we asked for basic amenities (shampoo, etc) the housekeeper said she didn't speak English so we didn't get what we wanted from her.\n\nThis was my first time to New York. I would say the location was fine. It's about a 5-10 min walk to Times Square depending on how fast you walk. In the mornings it is complete madness because you're close to the bus station, which is the busiest in the US. There are a lot of eating places and a drug store nearby if you need one. \n\nI wouldn't feel comfortable walking around at night. Although there's a bunch of hotels in a row, there are some shady characters just sitting on the sidewalk or near ATMs and such. \n\nThe breakfast was good and the staff was very friendly, which was nice. I used Apple Concierge to take a private shuttle to the airport ($70). I didn't think this was that bad considering how far the airport was and the fact that we made good time and beat the morning traffic. \n\nAll in all, I think this hotel was an okay choice for our first time to the city. It was relatively close to Times Square, offered shuttle services to the airport, had laundry service (even if it was in the next hotel) and if you're traveling by bus, you can't go wrong.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There was only one bell person working so it took about 10minutes before someone could assist us. \nWe came back to the hotel around 4:30pm to check in. The room was complimentary due to the hotels Best Rate Guaranteed Program, but it looked like the hotel was unaware of this. I was told by their corporate phone number that it would all be taken care of by the time I got there. When I informed the front desk of this they told me I would need to call the corporate office to resolve it. I asked the hotel to check me in and then I will take care of it when I got upstairs. \nWe walked to the elevator and found out that only 1 out of the 2 elevators were working. There were 36 floors and we were on the 30th floor. After walking everywhere in the morning we were too tired to take the stairs. So we waited 15 minutes for the elevator. \nRoom:\nWhen we got to the room it was quaint and clean. I had no problems with the room at all. AC felt nice after a long hot day. \nAfter taking a quick shower and with no time to spare I got ahold of the hotels corporate office. The gentleman I spoke with said he would take care of this. He had me wait on hold while he called the hotel. He said he spoke with Melissa and it was all set! I then hung up with him and called Melissa, she acted like she had no idea what was going on. She had me wait on hold for 15 minutes. Then she took me off hold and said, \u201c How can I help you?\u201d I told her I was waiting on hold and she was supposed to have figured out what happened with the room rate. She then said, \u201c We are busy with check-ins and we will have to investigate and call you back.\u201d I had no problem with that answer. MY PROBLEM was that she left me on hold for 15minutes just to tell me that!!!!\nElevator:\nAfter not getting much rest at all it was time to go to dinner, we went to the elevator and clicked the button. The button wasn\u2019t working which is when we notice a sign. The sign read that the elevator is out of order and the engineer is working on it, so if you want it please call the front desk. I then call the front desk and she said it would be up shortly. 7 minutes later and with a dinner reservation to attend to, I called them again. The girl said it would take a long time because the elevator had to stop at every floor going up and every floor going down. AGAIN, WHY was I not told this when I first called!!!! So then we took the stars 30 floors down. \nService:\nThough In my opinion, I thought the service was a 1\/5 the 1 star is because of Henry. That evening Henry emailed me telling me he was able to resolve the issue and that the room was complimentary. Much appreciated!\nCheck Out: \nThe hotel provides you with a bill already in your room when you wake up, this was very helpful. I took a quick glance at the bill and immediately noticed I was charged, then refunded, then charged again! I went to the front desk to resolve this, but I had to wait 15 minutes because both agents were already helping 1 family. Eventually the manager noticed us and asked the other fd agent to help us. \nLuggage:\nWe arrived back at the hotel at 6:10pm to retrieve our luggage and then to go catch our bus at 6:30pm. We had to wait 10 minutes for our luggage because the Front desk had to call the bell man. Why could the front desk not help us? Why did the concierge lady taking selfies of herself o snapchat not help us? Why did we have to wait for this one man?\nOther:\nIce machine is only on select floors.

I frequent in Manhattan but had to take this Hotel specifically because my family wanted to do the NYE Times Square Ball Drop. If you're planning to do that I'd say this is a pretty good location and especially for it's price, I don't think you can find any hotel in that area of the same rate especially around that time. They jack up the price up to 400% because of the Ball drop. \n\nOverall, minus my two issues which I will explain further below, the place was decent. Only 2 blocks away from Port Authority \/ Subway where all lines pass. The only draw back to that, it's a VERY big station and could be confusing if it's your first time. As far as the rooms, they were super tight. We had a room with 2 double beds and we can barely move around because there was absolutely no space to stash our luggage. All of that inconvenience though is forgivable in my opinion esp since I'm not exactly expecting 5 star. \n\nThe two things that I would warn people about is the ELEVATOR AND THE OVERCHARGING . Do take note these issues have already been resolved with their manager. However I thought I should still give a fair warning  esp if you're the type who don't double check your credit card bill. \n\nThe elevator problem happened on January 2nd. About 8-10 people were stuck in between 8th-9th floor for about 20 minutes before we were able to get out. The bell button was not working correctly and it took some muscle to get somebody to respond. Do take note that this happened during Winter so everybody in that elevator were wearing thick coats and it was all adding up to the claustrophobic anxiety we were all about to get into. At situations like this people are quick to panic . There was also no signal inside the elevator so we couldn't make a phone call. Of course the hotel said it has never happened before but I seriously doubt that. Given that the elevator was overloaded, its safety system should not have allowed it to close its doors the moment it reached its threshold. For something like that to happen means something is off with the hotel's preventive maintenance. \n\nWith regards to the overcharge, this happened 2 months after we left NY. We found on our credit card bill that we were charged $470 even though we settled our account in cash when we checked out. If we hadn't been thorough in checking our statements that $470 would have been a total giveaway. Called the manager about this and in fairness to him he was quick to give me a refund. However, it's never a good thing to be in a hotel that charges you erroneously especially after being victimized by their faulty elevator. \n\nWould I recommend this place? Not Really. What I encountered is enough for me to stay away and I advice you to do the same.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We booked a total of 3 rooms and had requested rooms with 2 queen beds so we could sleep 4 to a room. Check in was supposed to be at 3, but all of the rooms were not ready at that time. They gave us one room to \u201cstart with\u201d that was a king bed only. When we called the front desk to notify them we were given the wrong room, we were told they were completely booked and they gave us all king rooms. We explained our original request for 2 beds and they stated there was nothing they could do. We then requested extra cots or chairs, as there would be several of our guests (one being pregnant)with no bed to sleep on and again, they stated there was nothing they could do. I called again and asked for a manager and requested a transfer to another local holiday inn. They stated they don\u2019t do transfers and all reservations are made through a central scheduling line. The front desk then said they would call their \u201csister hotel\u201d next door and then call us back with more information. We received no return phone call and when I called back I spoke with a different receptionist and was told they had changed shifts from the previous receptionist, then having to explain our issue all over again. As per the previous discussions, there was \u201cnothing they could do.\u201d The other rooms were ready so late that we almost missed a show that we had purchased tickets for. Also, the rooms were supposed to be in a block, but they ended up being scattered throughout the hotel. \u00a0Other issues included the safe in the room being broken, as well as trash in the stairwells. Normally, I would not have taken the stairs down from 22 floors up, but there are 2 tiny elevators that sometimes took 15 minutes to arrive at the floor. Finally, after much complaining, the hotel agreed to return a small amount of our money for our inconveniences. We are truly not a group that complains, just a bunch of friends that were hoping for a great stay in NYC to celebrate a friend\u2019s upcoming wedding. The bride actually has rooms reserved at a local Holiday Inn Express for her wedding and is considering canceling the block due to this past weekend.

If what you want is affordable comfort in the heart of Manhattan then the Holiday Inn Express in 39th Street is an excellent choice.\nThe street itself is a bit tired but the hotel, which is being gradually refurbished, offers a decent   breakfast, endlessly helpful reception staff, free Wi-Fi and lovely comfortable beds. The staff overseeing the breakfast buffet were patient and ensured fresh food was available throughout. We never had to wait for a table. Whenever we returned to the room after sightseeing, it had been cleaned and soaps, coffee etc replenished. The housekeeping staff could not be faulted. The refreshments that are permanently available in the foyer were welcome.\nThe hotel is ideally situated for all we wanted to do. It is close to the theatres and we had a ten minute walk to see a fabulous production of The Lion King. A short stroll to the west will take you to the piers where you can take the landmark cruise to catch the main sights and have a potted history of New York. Trips to the Top of the Rock and The Empire State Building were worth the short taxi rides. Penn Station is conveniently close so we took the subway to the 9\/11 Tribute which was as informative as it was moving.\nI know that should we ever visit Manhattan again we will book the Holiday Inn Express, even if I could afford one of the swankier places around Central Park.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

In camera c'\u00e8 veramente tutto quello che viene riportato nel sito. Le stanze sono ben pulite e viene rimpiazzato tutto ogni giorno. Avrebbero bisogno di un ammodernamento.  Noi avevamo prenotato tramite booking un'offerta di \"camera con vista citt\u00e0\" ed in effetti ci \u00e8 stata assegnata (27\u00b0 piano). Abbiamo goduto della vista dell'Empire cos\u00ec come di un tramonto stupendo. Per il fatto di essere cos\u00ec in alto non abbiamo avuto problemi di rumori e abbiamo dormito benissimo. Avevo fatto richiesta di 2 camere vicine ed in effetti \u00e8 stato tenuto presente assegnandoci 2 camere su 2 piani vicini (27 e 28).Noi non abbiamo avuto problemi di ascensore e sovraffollamente perch\u00e8 scendevamo a fare colazione alle 7 e mi pare che qualche problema di sovraffollamento ci sia dalle 8 in avanti. Cos\u00ec come per la colazione abbiamo sempre trovato posto nella saletta. La colazione \u00e8 abbastanza varia e tipica americana con dolce e salato, camerieri disponibili per eventuali richieste particolari (non c'era latte caldo e io lo facevo scaldare). Alla reception sono stati tutti estremamente gentili fino all'ultimo giorno in cui abbiamo chiesto di lasciare i bagagli una volta liberata la camera. Preziosa la presenza di 2 PC con stampante nella hall che abbiamo sfruttato per acquisto e stampa dei biglietti per il Top of the rock e per la stampa dei biglietti aerei. Poco distante da Times Square e da tutte le principali attrazioni. Sicuramente il prezzo \u00e8 vantaggioso per le famiglie da 4 (tenete presente che si dorme in 2 letti alla francese) mentre diventa un po' pi\u00f9 impegnativo economicamente per quelle da 3 perch\u00e8 la camera costa uguale. Rimane, secondo me, una ottima soluzione soprattutto per il fatto che c'\u00e8 la colazione compresa e restano fuori solo le tasse e l'imposta di soggiorno, mentre negli altri hotel ti aggiungono altri costi per servizi. Consigliato.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I would definitely recommend asking for a city view room. \nThere were only a few minor problems I had with the hotel. The pillows in the bedroom are too soft for my personal preference. They are labelled soft and firm but they all feel incredibly soft. The room could do with a small fridge just for putting in drinks overnight, we had to buy fresh bottles of water daily as there was no fridge to keep it cool. This isn't a bit issue, but can be a bit of a pain when you need to buy fresh bottles of water daily, especially if your staying in the warmer weather. And lastly they could do with a small shop, their sister hotel (candlewood located next door) has a small shop where you scan your keycard, get your items and pay at reception. A little facility like this would be extremely useful just for basics like drinks etc. \nOverall the hotel is fantastic, staff are friendly and always willing to help.

Clean enough, but the rooms are so cramped full of useless furniture like cupboards and dressers. \nNo view, but no need. \nI guess you'd hardly be spending time in your room in NYC, but if you want to relax and unwind in your room, this isn't the place to be. \nThere's a concierge who can arrange a shuttle to Woodsbury Common - we didn't have time to go. \nThere's also breakfast included, but its very basic, I'd suggest to skip it, unless you're starving. Plenty of better calories available along the street outside! Also, the utensils and cutlery are disposable plastic and styrofoam. The hotel has a go green initiative - choose not to change towels and sheets daily, but all this just seems fake when they provide plastic and styrofoam plates and cups. \nOh and there are only two lifts and during breakfast\/peak hour, they take AGES TO COME and you often have to wait for a few lifts before you can fit in!","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I needed a hotel, and fast. I walked in to the Holiday Inn Express and was thankfully able to book a room for that night and the night following. The front desk clerk was friendly, approachable, and genuine. He quickly booked me into a room and I was on my way within minutes. \n\nI went upstairs to my room on the 20th floor and was very satisfied. The room was very clean, spacious (by New York standards), and well laid out. The king size bed was very comfortable and the linens were soft and cozy. The pillows were soft and fluffy, making for two great nights of sleep. Upon unpacking, I phoned the front desk to ask for more coat hangers and they promptly brought up the exact number that I had requested. The bathroom was spotless, with plenty of towels and shelf space for my toiletries. The room also had a safe, an iron, and an ironing board which was handy. Overall I was perfectly content with the room. Nothing flashy, but very clean, comfortable and enjoyable. \n\nOne thing I wanted to mention was the speediness of the elevator. I think there were 33 or 36 floors in the building, and only two elevators. I don't think I ever waited more than 15 seconds for an elevator. It was awesome. \n\nOn an aesthetic note, the front of the hotel was decorated with pumpkins and hay and looked rather charming. Made my autumn trip to New York all the more autumn-like. The gentleman that worked at the front door were always friendly, saying hello, smiling, and bustling around. In combination with the great front desk staff I felt welcomed throughout my time there.\n\nOn a constructive note, the concierge staff did not stand up to the welcoming standards of the other staff mentioned. Every time I entered the lobby the concierge was sitting behind their desk, looking rather disinterested and not overly happy to be there. On the one occasion that I did approach their desk to ask for a map and directions, the girl didn't even stand up to greet me or attempt to initiate any sort of conversation or banter. I would have rather received a map from the front desk and had more decorative barrels of hay replace the concierge desk. \n\nI never made it down for the complimentary breakfast in the morning, but was very impressed that that was even offered. Great touch!\n\nOverall, the Holiday Inn Express nailed all the basics of a good hotel. Nothing flashy or fancy, but a good solid basic stay. I very much enjoyed my time there.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

S\u00e9 que algunos pensar\u00e1n que est\u00e1 algo caro para ser un hotel \"express\" pero lo que est\u00e1s pagando es estar cerca del centro de la ciudad.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is almost walking distance to everything in Times Square but the hotel is actually in a quiet location, which we all loved. We all had a good night sleep. The room was pretty small compared to the HI Express we stayed at. They still offered the complimentary continental breakfast. My only concern was the elevator. It had a long time to get in and out of the elevator. There were only 2 elevators for the entire property so you had to make sure that you give extra time if you are in a rush or if you have an appointment. The staff in the breakfast area were both amazing! They kept the food trays refilled at all times. They were also very enthusiastic and helpful to guests who didnt have seat. They were there to help sit the guests and not only refill the breakfast food trays. They went above and beyond to make the guests feel accommodated. The guy, who works there and unfortunately, whom I forgot his name, was amazing! Although the breakfast area was small and has very limited space, it didnt matter to the guests because of him.

We did not want to spend big bucks on a hotel room that we were literally only going to sleep in.  The beds here and bedding were actual very comfortable and the size of the rooms are typical NYC size.  However the AC that cuts on and off all night was super loud.  2 elevators serve the hotel and the longest we had to wait was probably 5ish minutes during prime time.  Toiletries are from Bath & Body works, not horrid, not the best.  I would recommend this hotel if you wanted to spend your money on shows, great food, and shopping.

The room size and beds are very small, however, I am aware this is typical of NY. The check in was relatively quick and we were given our room straight away. Our room and bathroom was very clean, we were given fresh towels every day and our rooms were tidied as well (sheets are not changed unless requested). The bathroom only had 3 small toiletries for a family of 4 which is a small amount but this didn't bother us as we had our own shower gel\/shampoo etc. We were on the 24th floor and didn\u2019t have much of a view (it was of another building). We had no issues sleeping being quite high up, nor did we have any noise from the elevator despite being next to it. We never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for an elevator during peak times.\nThe breakfast was filling, there was; bread, bagels, yogurt, cereal, eggs, pancakes and more. We often found a place in the breakfast area even during peak times (8.30 \u2013 9.30). We did see a lot of people taking food upstairs but this would have been quite a feat for us given we were high up. The breakfast staff were amazing and cheerful every single morning. We had to have an early breakfast one day before 6.30 and the male chef and another lady were so kind and helpful in giving us what we wanted to eat \u2013 thank you so much for this. \nThere is tea, coffee and water available throughout the day near the breakfast area and cold lemonade in the lobby which is wonderful after a tiring day!\nThe concierges were very helpful every morning, they would help us map out metro stops, which line to get, best walking routes and helped us book transport to airport ($88 to EWR!). \nTimes Square is a good 10 minutes away, sometimes longer due to pedestrian traffic. Otherwise, EST was walkable distance, along with Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal. We used a MetroCard for last few days so didn\u2019t do much walking. We usually ate pizza places or food carts where there are many around the area.\nI would stay here again if there was a bigger room size as this was my only issue, apart from that, everything was wonderful down to location, breakfast and staff.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The middle of Times Square is about a 5 min walk. This also on the edge of Hell's Kitchen area. The free breakfast was in a nice area about the size of a small cafeteria. Very well run breakfast.

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":1139717,"title":"Great place to stay in Manhattan","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-08-05","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This was our first trip to Manhattan from the Midwest, and the rooms at this hotel were reasonably priced for being in Manhattan.\n\nThe hotel is tall and thin, only 6 rooms on each floor.  The rooms are on the small side but everything in Manhattan was on the small side.  Our family of 4 managed well with 2 queen beds, and in any event the point of the trip is to be outside not inside.  Everything in the room worked and was very clean.  The only thing missing that would have been nice was the fridge\/microwave combo you sometimes see in hotel rooms since there tend to be opportunities for leftovers from Manhattan restaurants.  The elevators can take a few minutes to arrive when they're busy, but otherwise were pretty fast.\n\nManhattan is generally more crowded, expensive and fast paced than anywhere else we've been in the country.  Probably because of this, many of the people who work there seem to be on the grumpy side.  Not at this hotel though, everyone was very nice and that was a big plus.\n\nThere is no room service or restaurant, but that's not really necessary since there are a zillion places to eat within a few minutes walk, many of which are open very late.  The hotel is about a 2 minute walk from the subway, and about 10-20 minutes walk from Times Square (longer if it's more crowded).  If you want to go to the Museum of Natural History from this hotel, it's only about a 5 minute subway ride, and the entrance to the museum is right inside the subway station.\n\nThe hotel breakfast is typical and good with eggs, pancakes, etc.  It will be very very crowded if you get there during the 8:45 - 9:30 period, so getting there earlier would be better.\n\nThe WiFi worked fine once we figured out that for some Android devices, the Chrome browser doesn't work well to log on.  Use Firefox instead.\n\nWe drove to Manhattan.  Regarding parking: there is no driveway, roundabout or other location that belongs to the hotel in which you can park your car and unload.  It's either on the street curb in front of the hotel, or double parking next to another car that is along that curb.  Walking around Manhattan, it seemed like almost no hotels had their own parking garages, so this is the norm.  Double parking also does not seem to be frowned upon in Manhattan as long as it's for a short time and other cars can still get by on the street.  The hotel staff will park your car somewhere offsite, and you need to call up to 45 minutes before you need it (ours came back in about 25 minutes).  But everything seemed to work well with this system.\n\nIf you come in via the Lincoln Tunnel, a major benefit of this hotel is how close it is to the tunnel.  When leaving the hotel in the morning, we were back to the tunnel in about 3 minutes, with almost no need to drive through Manhattan traffic.  Here's a hint when entering Manhattan via the Lincoln Tunnel:  print your directions to the hotel on paper.  You will lose the GPS signal inside the tunnel, and once outside the tunnel you will need to know which way to turn before your GPS kicks in again, so having directions on paper is the way to go.\n\nWe would certainly stay here again.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Ho scelto questo hotel perch\u00e9 \u00e8 uno dei pochi dove questo non accade: wifi gratuito in camera, colazione a buffet compresa, niente tariffa resort.\n\nLa struttura \u00e8 un palazzo alto e stretto, pi\u00f9 di 30 piani ma solo 6 camere per piano. Si presenta bene, anche se non \u00e8 tenuto in modo perfetto. Gli ascensori sono due, ma spesso bisogna attendere parecchio o addirittura fare la coda, per esempio subito dopo colazione, quando tutti vogliono tornare in camera prima di partire alla scoperta della citt\u00e0. La prima mattina, dopo mezz'ora di attesa, ho deciso di salire a piedi fino alla mia stanza, al diciassettesimo piano (non troppo faticoso, visto che i soffitti sono molto bassi). I giorni successivi ci ho rinunciato a priori e sono uscito direttamente dopo la colazione.\n\nLa camera era abbastanza ampia, con un enorme letto king e scelta dei cuscini. Niente frigo bar, ma su alcuni piani ci sono distributori di snacks, acqua e ghiaccio. Macchinetta del caff\u00e8 a cialde in camera. Buon livello di pulizia generale. Bagno gradevole e pulito, con vasca.\n\nA parte la pulizia, il personale che si occupa della camera si \u00e8 rivelato distratto e poco preciso, con bicchieri che a volte c'erano e a volte no, asciugamani mancanti ecc.\n\nAnche il personale della reception e della sala colazione \u00e8 stato, in generale, poco cortese e poco attento. Il checkin \u00e8 alle 16, decisamente tardi e senza flessibilit\u00e0 alcuna. Non c'\u00e8 posto dove lasciare i bagagli.\n\nLa colazione a buffet \u00e8 compresa nel prezzo della camera. Il cibo, come praticamente tutti gli hotel USA, \u00e8 quello classico americano: pancake con sciroppo d'acero, ciambelle, burro d'arachidi, eggs and bacon, omelettes, cereali con latte, muffins, frutta. Il buffet \u00e8 davvero piccolo (e affollato!), cos\u00ec alcuni piatti sono a rotazione: un giorno omelettes, un giorno uova strapazzate. Insomma, niente di esaltante, ma almeno permette di risparmiare e di cominciare la giornata belli sazi.\n\nNel complesso non mi sono trovato male.

The weed smell in the hallway was better than the smelly odor in our room!\n\nThen we called for our car, called an hour later to see if it had arrived before we took all of our stuff and kids down to the lobby and was told it was waiting there for us.

We always feel it's a good value for our money. This hotel was no exception. Being in the middle of Manhattan close to Times Square, this hotel was pretty narrow with a small lobby. There were only 2 elevators to service 36 floors and over 200 rooms, so coming down during the day there are always multiple stops. Breakfast time is especially busy. The breakfast area is small and can get crowded so be prepared if you go during peak hours. It's complimentary hot breakfast (and it's good!) so what do you expect? Our room was a king bed with a city view. Our A\/C never seemed to get cold enough - but being from the South, we don't think there's a such thing as cold enough A\/C! Bed did not seem to be a true king size bed. Somewhere between a queen and a king maybe? Also wasn't the most comfortable I've ever slept in - but at the end of the day after walking 5 miles, it did the job! We left spare change out on the tv stand on 2 separate occasions, and both times the cleaning personnel took it! Hopefully this was the only thing they took. No way to know for sure, but this was surely odd and we've never encountered before. Somehow we had a Canadian coin, but they didn't take that one! We didn't alert the staff, with worries that our belongings might be tampered with as a result. Overall was a pleasant stay and would return - but will definitely leave my valuables\/spare change\/anything of value locked up and our suitcases too.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Check-in was easy other than a short delay when the front desk staff having to answer a phone call while checking me in. \nRoom on the 25th floor, very quiet and far from street noise, with a classic Manhattan view of a brick wall which we were not surprised with. Size is small but we still felt not cramped like in some other Manhattan hotels. Two elevators for 36 floors, they run super fast, I will say the only problem we had was on the day of check-out when the elevator had to skip many floors after it filled up - we were lucky to board on the 25th floor on the way down. Beds are adequately comfortable, not the best we've had but enough for a decent night's sleep. \nBathroom - the shower had terrible pressure even though temperature was fine. Toilet also had a weak flush so we had to use it a few times before getting used to it.\nBreakfast - goes until 9:30am weekdays and 10am weekends, we never got this because we slept in. However they keep coffee, juice, and water machines in the breakfast area all day which is nice. \nLaundry and gym facilities are in a neighboring hotel - we never used these.\n\nLocation - a block to PABT bus terminal. On the same block as the 42 st Times Square stop with easiest access to the ACE trains. It's a hike from the NQR or 1237 trains, but still accessible underground. Short walk to Times Square. About 6 blocks down is Penn Station. \n\nOverall I'd consider staying here again for a quick easy stay in Manhattan, if they offer the same price. The bathroom amenities leave much to be desired but the location really can't be beat given that we paid less than $200 a night tax included.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

A lot of development going on in the area including most chain hotels. Relatively new property, typical tight NYC layout, 6 rooms per floor, nicely appointed - K-cup brewer, safe, firm & soft pillows, reliable Wi-Fi. Fast elevators, professional staff, decent breakfast with pancakes, premade omelets, and usual fare. Couple of minor negatives: ice & vending machines are only on about every 6th floor and the soda that I purchased was warm; the TV reception was poor (could not access local channels) and when it could not tune to a channel, the TV would \"reboot\" and restart to its default channel at high volume. But who visits New York to watch TV?","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

The hotel is about 36 floors, I think, with six rooms per floor and two very small elevators.  Waiting for an elevator always took a while during check-in or check-out times or when the cleaning staff was holding one for their purposes.  We were on the 30th floor and found that it was generally easier to go up to 36 and ride back down than it was to get on an elevator already heading down.  Breakfast, too, was very cramped.  The food was the usual breakfast fare, but we ended up taking it back up to the 30th floor to eat.  The block where the hotel is located was a little sketchy compared to blocks on either side.  We changed our route coming back in the evening to avoid a group of men who were always hanging out and who got a bit close the first couple of times we passed them.    All staff were very helpful, though, and the location is within walking distance of most of the things we wanted to do.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Rooms were cleaned everyday, breakfast was fine (toast, turkey sausage, bagels, pancakes cereal, eggs and porridge available every day) but it is true that the dining area is small however they're fine with you taking your food to your room. The male chef is very friendly always saying hello to guests as they walk in in the morning which I thought was nice. \n\nThe free quick wi-fi access in every room is a great bonus! My room was fine, 32-inch flat-screen TV with tea making facilities, iron and board. The bathroom was perfectly fine. Apparently you can use the gym of the 'parent' hotel, the nearby 'Holiday Inn'. \n\nLocation-wise you can get to Times Square within a 15 minute walk. For shopping Macy's and other stores are nearby too. You can get to the Penn train station within 10 mins walk and from the station you can get the train to the (free) Staten Island Ferry. The concierge service is useful although we did get slightly incorrect advise on how to get to the aforementioned ferry as the 1 train which would normally take you straight there was not going to the ferry stop that day so we had to switch train and a take a shuttle bus to the stop (thank God for Google!). I do think the concierge should have had that knowledge of what was going on train-wise that day.\n\nNevertheless I'd happily come back again and hope to do so in the future.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Hotel is a good 'cheap' hotel if you're visiting New York and want to see the sights. Great location, welcoming staff and rooms well kept. Rooms are fine if you're sight seeing as you only really need it as a base to sleep\/ shower etc. The breakfast is average, but gets very busy and not always space to sit down. This is really the only fault of the hotel.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This hotel is in the Times Square area which makes it very conveniently located for the subway, to pick up taxis, restaurants and evening entertainment. It's very close to many of the main sights including the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center and Grand Central Terminal. When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who quickly looked up our booking on their computer and had us checked in within just a few minutes. Our room was on the 29th floor and had a great view of the Hudson River over to New Jersey and down to the World Trade Center and the new Freedom Tower. The room was a little small but this did not cause any problems and I understand it's to be expected from many central Manhattan hotels. There were two good sized, comfortable beds, a desk and a chair, wardrobe with hangers, ironing board and iron and a safe, chest of drawers, TV, mirrors and bedside cabinets. The bathroom was modern with a good shower and toiletries and towels were provided. The room was cleaned daily to a very high standard and they change your bedding upon request if you place the card on your bed to notify the cleaners. Breakfast started at 6.30am and was pretty standard - eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits, pancakes, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, muffins, pastries. Plenty to choose from. For the size of the hotel, though, the breakfast room is small. This didn't cause a problem for me because I got there soon after they started serving and always got a seat but some people were coming down, getting food and taking it back to their rooms. As mentioned, i didn't find this to be a negative, but if you want an easier breakfast time this may not be the hotel for you, but is the only thing I found that could potentially have caused a problem. If you want a hotel in a good location that's a little cheaper than others in the area, and you like clean, comfortable rooms, it's great. I'd return.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Front reception looks a little worn.  The room was small, but very comfortable, clean and modern.  We were on fourth floor so we didn't need to use the lift.  We were at the front of the hotel so we did have a bit of noise at night time, but being so busy during the days we were to tired to notice.  There is a decent iron, plus board, coffee maker, hair dryer, and the TV is a good size.  Breakfast is ok, plenty of tea, coffee, juices, toast, cereal, cheese omelette, sausage, cakes, fruit, and a pancake maker.  There is a pub next door and one across the road.  A lovely little deli to the right and another at the top of the street on the right.  If I go back to newyork I would be happy to stay here again.

What you expect from an HI Express, clean, functional and efficient.  Typical small New York room but as you don't tend to linger in your room was not a problem.  We booked a city view and OMG what a view, we got the room key and was told on the 36th top floor, from the side we could see the empire state building, and in front of us was the south skyline and even the statue of liberty in the distance.  The lights at night were incredible.   Bathroom spotless but the hoover could have been used along the wall edge in the bedroom a bit more !!!!!  Location is excellent 10 min walk and you have a main subway, also within a 20 min radius you have all the theatres and into Times Square, Rockefeller Centre is 20 mins, Empire State is 20 mins in the other direction.  We booked a City pass (excellent value) before we left and Pier 83 is 10 mins walk for most of the sightseeing cruises.  Next to that currently is The Intrepid which has a sea ship and space exhibition plus a submarine to walk through.  Would definitely recommend booking the NBC Studio Tour before going plus if you want to do the Crown on the statue of liberty.  The hotel has a concierge desk and they will help with bookings and advice, plus they have maps etc.  Very helpful in arranging the time for our pre booked airport transfer.  Computers and printer in reception to check in and print return flight details.  Breakfast is again what you expect,  juice, cereals, yoghurt, hot options, bagels, toast, bananas and apples.  Would definitely recommend going down early at 7am was quieter, there is not a lot of tables and saw some people use the cardboard trays, get a selection then go back to room, hotel seemed relaxed about that.  Lifts are a nightmare around 9am as only two.  We were always away from hotel before that until morning we checked out and was a bit of a wait with everyone cramming in but with timing no issues the rest of the stay.  Hot water urn always on in breakfast area, had a hot chocolate a couple of times on returning to hotel or a tea\/coffee.  NIce touch!  If you get a good priced package, would definitely recommend.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our room was very small, it had everything we needed for our stay and we weren't expecting a huge amount due to the price we paid. We were happy though! One thing to mention is the lifts particularly in the morning, it can take so long for the lift to get to you as there are only two for the whole hotel. We found it easier to walk down the stairs at times! The breakfast was a bit of a fight... only a couple of tables available. Reminded me slightly of a prison with paper trays etc It did the job though and filled us up so can't complain!","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}
