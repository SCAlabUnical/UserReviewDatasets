My mother requested connecting rooms. When they arrived at the hotel, my mom was told they now could not accomodate the connecting rooms request. This was incredibly disappointing and something we would have appreciated knowing in advance, as we were not at all comfortable with a fourteen-year-old girl in her own hotel room, away from her grandmother, for three nights in New York City. For me, back home, this created a great deal of unnecessary anxiety since now everyone at the front desk and within earshot of the conversation they were having with my mom knew a young teenage girl was staying in a hotel room alone.\n\nIn addition, despite the posted and promised 3pm check-in time, my mom's room was not ready until 8pm. Having woken up at 4am for her flight, this was just another crappy situation for her and my daughter at this hotel. It was otherwise fine--rooms were fine, location was fine. But for families needing two rooms, just be aware that connecting rooms are never guaranteed here apparently, that they won't tell you ahead of time that your minor child might end up in a separate room, and that you may have to wait five hours past check-in time to even get to your room. \n\nWe'll be using other hotels in the future.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This time, I had to choose the time of arrival and chose an upgrade (paid an extra 60 bucks plus taxes and fees) and was able to choose my room. I arrived at the time I said I'd arrive, the room I had chosen wasn't available. Why? it was available on the app. The desk claimed that they are not required to give you the room you choose (then why offer the option?) and can change it at will. Corporate said there must be something wrong with the APP, but the app does the same thing about 50% of the time (I travel for work 3 weeks a month) which is why I questioned it. I chose the room on the floor I wanted because it was larger than the other upgraded rooms on the same floor. Nope. Even when you tell them when you're arriving and choose a room that's available, it's not guaranteed. Fine. Ok. Exactly zero you can do about it. \n\nThe hotel hasn't had a renovation since opening 25 years ago. The area between the entry way tile and carpet has the carpet nails sticking through and the carpet is worn in the area from the tile to the bed. \n\nThe terrace furniture has holes and needs to be replaced (this is the reason for the increased cost). \n\nBut it's the elevators that are the most concerning at this hotel. There's three. Going up there's a line. Coming down is impossible. They're always full. Checking out today I waited 25 minutes on floor 2 to get on an elevator and only 4 doors opened in those 25 minutes.  I even tried going up but those were full. I finally carried my luggage down the stairs to the lobby (floor 2 is really floor three as the lobby is double height). Is there a solution? Yes. Add another elevator to the outside of the hotel. It's possible. Buildings have done it. A Kimpton hotel next to our house did it. \n\nI am done with this hotel ( I keep giving it second chances and always regret it).","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

The Applejack Diner around the corner on Broadway and 55th has a good breakfast and a savvy staff. The Ray's Pizza on 7th between 53rd and 54th actually serves good NY pizza.

The location is right off Broadway so it's close to the Theatres, Times Square and Central Park.  The lobby is nice and the service is friendly.  Restaurants everywhere, at all different prices (cheap to pricey).  I liked the fridge and microwave in the room, and the bed was comfortable.  Good Wifi and outlets.  I liked that I could open the window and get some fresh air. \n \nNow for the concerns.  The HVAC was very very noisy and didn't work well; I had to turn it on to get heat and then back off when it got too much -- the infrastructure seemed very old and I couldn't regulate it.  The bed linens had seen better days, with some pulled fabric and threadbare spots.  It took at least 8-10 minutes to get hot water in the shower, so I had to plan for that time.  The elevators also were very slow, and one time I waited over 5 minutes for one.  None of these concerns are deal-breakers but just show the age of the hotel and need for some TLC.  \n\nLastly, at the last two Hilton properties I have stayed at, there is a person in the lobby trying to aggressively sell you their \"vacation properties\" -- I *do not* like this; when I am staying in a hotel I want to relax and not be assaulted by a sales job.  This makes me want to choose other chains over Hilton.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

The location is wonderful and well located if you are in the city to catch a cruise--as we were.  The terminal is minutes away by Lyft or Uber, but getting into them is a bit of a problem because the traffic is heavy and there is no place for the driver to park--save in the middle of the very busy street.

The room was bit tight space. The bad experience comes from Lobby. That is the first\/and last point of contact with your guests where the front desk people can make you guests WOW or YUCK.\n\nEvery time I called, the call went to your central call center (I guess). It was very hard to reach front desk by phone. Prior to check out I tried to call front desk, to have my car in the front of the building (since I noticed earlier that the lobby was full of people checking in\/ and out. But you guys don't have enough employees to help the guests. \n\nAnyways, I called the lobby as usual the call went to some call center than they transferred my call to the lobby, and I was not able to reach the lobby by phone. \n\n When we all came down at the lobby and checked out and asked how long it'll take them to bring the car the lady said 20 minutes. I exclaimed why 20 minutes. She said, 'because it takes 20 minutes I don't want to say 10 minutes and if it takes longer you'll get mad'.\n\nAfter 30 minutes later I went to the front desk again and I asked why it's taking so long, I wanted to call from my hotel room so you could have brought the car by the time we are checked out, this time the lady name 'Angelique' was so rude the tune she was using as if she was talking to her subordinate.  and she asked me If I'd like to go myself and get the car, I was so surprised by her comment and attitude. She added, 'It's not far, it's down the street.\n\nI asked what's her name was?! She replied 'Why are you going to complain? then she pointed out to an African American lady (sorry I didn't get her name) who initially helped us check out. I went to speak to her, but she was with another guest, so I was waiting. In the meantime, after 38 minutes later the car pulled over by the front of the building, So I didn't care to speak to her and leave.

Was greeted by a member of staff who was in training at the time. He asked for a credit card for payment of $100 dollars per night. Totalling $500 for 5 nights. Never explained what it was really for. When I asked the other receptionist she gave me an abrupt answer & said it\u2019s a \u2018security deposit\u2019. We handed over the card & thought nothing of it. Got handed over the room cards. Got in the lift & couldn\u2019t work out how to get to our room. No-one advised you needed to scan the room key to get to the floor! Not what we needed after 12 hours of travelling! \nWhen we got in the room, my partner checked his bank account & found out the credit card payment from earlier was taken out of his bank account!! We were completely shocked-we thought the payment was going to be held on the credit card-not taken out completely! It\u2019s unheard of in the UK, & took out a massive chunk out of our spending money. When we asked again at reception-we were told it would be put back into the account when we checked out. We tried not to let it ruin our trip. \nWe booked a room with two queen beds. There was three of us sharing a room with three large suitcases. The room they gave us was two double beds & you barely manoeuvre around the room. It was tiny & not what we booked!! At this point I was too tired to go back to reception & ask for a different room. \nThe reason I didn\u2019t give this hotel a one star is the location. It is a 10 min walk away from Times Square & near the subway. \nThis was our first time in New York & we saved a year for this trip. I was really disappointed with this hotel; the attitude of the reception staff, the \u2018security deposit\u2019 payment & the room size was poor. There are much better hotels nearby\u2026we won\u2019t be staying here again.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I realize that some concessions must be made when you need a room quickly, so I took that into consideration. However, the idea that this hotel has the audacity to charge $600 a night for a room no better than an interstate highway hotel is laughable. The room is remarkably tiny and dated, and when we checked in, they were nice enough to \"upgrade\" us, so I have to wonder how small the original room was.  The staff was very nice, and check in was smooth, so I have absolutely no issue with people or service.  They were all welcoming and friendly.  I just want travelers to avoid spending what I believe is twice what the hotel is worth for the night. There is no room for people to walk next to each other, so we were constantly moving out of the way.  The only chair is the desk chair, which was  frankly in the way of the only area we could walk, and the \"closet\" was a narrow cabinet. I come to New York all the time and have stayed in places better and worse, and they were priced accordingly.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":5786212,"title":"Great location, great experience","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-06-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This trip was booked through a UK travel company, Virgin Holidays who arranged flights and accommodation for our trip 9th to 19th June 2023.\n\nWe chose this hotel because I spend on average 80 nights per year in Hilton chain hotels as I travel frequently with my job, and generally have good experiences with the Hilton Brand.\n\nSo, first the positives:\nGreeting and check in very good, no waiting time and we were allocated our room on 18th floor immediately.\nThe room was not huge, but was very clean and well appointed with a King size bed, desk, sofa, fridge, coffee machine, room-safe, iron and board along with adequate drawers and other space for storage of our luggage etc.\nThe bathroom was spotlessly clean, a great size and with a large walk-in shower.  \nThere was enough space to move about the room without feeling we were on top of each other and the City views from the picture windows were great.  The air-con unit was very effective and kept the room at ideal temperatures for us at all times.  It was occasionally quite loud but once accustomed to it, this was never intrusive and certainly didn't affect sleep or disturb us in any way.\n\nThere are 3 lifts in the hotel and signs advising guests to plan ahead at peak times (which are clearly shown) as there can be waiting times.  Throughout our 10 night stay, we never waited more than a minute or 2 and the lifts were fast moving between floors.  Having read some previous reviews we anticipated long waits but I can honestly say they caused us no issues at any time.\n\nI used the gym almost daily and it is well equipped, spacious, temperature controlled and provided everything I needed for my workouts.  It was never busy and often I had the room to myself.\nThe hotel location was ideal for us, close to Central Park, 5th Ave, Times Square, and only a 20 minute walk from Pier 83, where we boarded several fabulous river cruises.   \n\nStaff:  On the whole the hotel staff were excellent, friendly, approachable and very professional ( there were 2 exceptions to this and I'll mention them later).\nThere were also staff that were great ambassadors for the hotel, the Hilton Brand and for the City, and I would like to  mention to them:  Pierre - this Guy is amazing, a fountain of local knowledge (subway lines, routes to attractions, what to see in every area we planned to visit )....and all this with a nothing is too much trouble attitude and a genuinely welcoming personality. \nAlex, another exceptional member of staff, always willing to help, provide advice and tips.  He pointed us to the best place to go for New York bagels, showed genuine interest in everything we had seen and done, and when he realized that on our final day we would have to spend hours waiting around reception before our transit to JFK, he arranged a later check out time so we could enjoy our last hours in comfort.  He also introduced me to Douglas, another fabulous member of the team who made arrangements for a car to the airport,  explained the options, looked after our luggage and made this a seamless experience. \n\nThanks also to the many staff who gave a cheery 'Have a great Day' on leaving, and 'Welcome back', on returning each time to the hotel.  These are little things but can really make a holiday feel special and guests feel welcome.\n\nOkay, now the negatives, and fortunately this is a very short list:\n2 of the female reception staff ( I wont name them but they will probably know who I am referring to ), were not of a standard I would expect from any hotel.  They were abrupt, impatient and anything but friendly.  I get that it can be a stressful job, but if you are not enjoying it, and don't want to be friendly and polite.... find a job more suited to your skillset.\nRoom service: only happened once in our 10 night stay, and although bedding was replaced, we had to contact reception to ask for towels as these were not.  Ironically, on check out day we got a knock at the door 30 minutes before leaving, from a maid asking if we would like our room to be cleaned???\n\nSo, if you've read this far, then here is our overall verdict.  This hotel is great value, very well located, (mostly) very friendly and welcoming, and I would thoroughly recommend a stay here to anyone.  We had a fabulous holiday in NYC, and this hotel and its staff played a major part in that experience.\nI have given an excellent rating, as the few minor negatives were not significant enough to detract from the overall excellent time we spent here.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

So naturally I turned the AC on, what happened? a cockroache walked down the ventilation. By this it was around 10 pm. What did I do? I called Front Desk, explained the situation and 25 mins later Housekeeping came. Did the individual came with a spray or a screwdriver to open and fumigate the vent? No...he said that he needed to call maintenance, another 20 minutes went by and maintenance came. But by then I was already too tired to function. Next day I was offered to change the room and obtain that night for free. Ok, fair enough. \n\nGot into my new room. Was it still tiny? Yes, but a big less tinnier that the first one.\n\nProblem with this new room: lacks of proper ventilation and you can feel the humidity in the room, in the actual air of the room...I do believe that fungus in the ceiling is not good for your health....but I'm too tired to complain again, I don't want to spend my holidays hopping from one room to another. \n\nAlso, everytime a door shuts (a neighbors door from another room) not only you may hear it slam, but also it vibrates in the whole room. So it's not easy to fall asleep. \n\nElevators? They are just 3 or 4 for the whole Hotel. And when I mean whole Hotel is whole. Housekeeping, Concierge, Guests, Maintenance Crew, you name it. So...you may spend 10 minutes (or more) if you're lucky to get into the lift. \n\nStaff? Uncomfortable. Most people here speak Spanish, because I hear them they do, and I'm a native Spanish speaker. When I asked in Front Desk if they received packages (in Spanish) they suddenly only spoke English...it was a weird and uncomfortable situation.\n\nOh, I'm writing this at 4:30 pm in the mini hall of my floor waiting for Housekeeping to finish doing my room...\n\nMost likely I'll never stay in this Hotel or sub-product-brand oh Hilton ever again (and I'm a Diamond Member)...\n\nAvoid this property.\n ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This was definitely the best. The lobby was modest and crowded at times, but our room was nice. Our room was relatively spacious, spotlessly clean, with new looking furnishing, and it was generically but nicely  decorated. The free wifi was fine (they offered faster wifi for an extra fee). The bed was comfortable and there were places for two big suitcases off the floor. The room had a Keurig coffee maker, small fridge, hair dryer, and a microwave. The new looking comfortably-sized bathroom was sparkling with a large sink counter (the shower door didn\u2019t close all the way - Room 806) with full dispensers of bar soap, shampoo, conditioner and body wash, and plenty of towels. (They need a flow control valve on the shower head, for water conservation.) There were many drawers, shelves, a desk, and other storage spaces including a closet with an iron and board, and a safe. (The iron with holder and ironing board took up most of the hanging space of the closet - the iron needs to go somewhere else.) For New York, it was a very quiet room. I wouldn\u2019t recommend the laundry service unless you want to pay very high prices for each item (see photo). There was no \u201cresort fee\u201d (the tack on scam fee added by many hotels in New York). (I noticed that there were rooms with adjacent elevators on both sides. They are probably rooms to be avoided.) We had a nice city view from our 8th floor room (see photo). If you are tired of cramped worn-looking budget hotels (where you can\u2019t sit on the john and close the bathroom door at the same time), and you want a nice room near Central Park, in a safe neighborhood at a good price, look no further.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The bathroom had been updated and it was nice and bright with a shower instead of a tub, which was nice. The room was well insulated and there was very little street noise or noise from other rooms. My frustration with the hotel is that I accidentally left a shirt hanging in the closet. I called as soon as I got home and realized it, but of course they said they didn\u2019t have it. It was absolutely my fault for not seeing it in there (it was a dark shirt and the closet was dark), but I hate that it wasn\u2019t put in a lost and found of some sort. Oh well! I also went to meet with coworkers for breakfast. I have a food allergy, so I brought my own oatmeal packet and just told them I needed hot water and a banana. They charged me the full buffet price of something crazy, $30 or $40?! For a banana. I thought that was ridiculous for a banana and hot water, especially considering the other two people at my table did pay and used the buffet.

There are not enough of them to accommodate the number of rooms and height of the hotel. They post \"busy times\" for the elevators and tell you to avoid them but it's literally 6 hours a day you should not use them according to their signs. We were granted another room on the 2nd floor, which we chose because you can just take the stairs. The rooms have not been upgraded since inception either. Same carpet. Same beds (now lumpy and rough). New pump soaps and lotion in the bathrooms means you can't take them home  (who would). The front desk was combative. We avoided it after the issue at check in.

The lobby, elevators and hallways are dirty and dingy. The carpet in our room is just gross. The person who checked us in (who was very nice and the reason this isn't rated even lower) told us the room we chose during digital check in wouldn't be ready for awhile and he offered to change our room so we could check in right away (this was around 1pm). He said he found a room that had been cleaned and was waiting for inspection and when that was done, he would get us our keys. About 5 minutes later, we were all set. I had to laugh though because I'm not sure what they were inspecting....the dirtiest carpet?  Then check, you nailed it on the head. Beds and bathroom were decent so I'll give them a point there but the 2 biggest downsides other than the gross carpet...we can literally hear EVERYTHING in the room next door...every movement, every tinkle, every flush. I'd rather not have to listen to strangers' bathroom noises. And I don't think this room could possible get smaller. Again, I've stayed in plenty of hotels in NYC (chose this one for this stay due to proximity to an event we are here to attend) and it is just large enough for the furniture and 1 person - I'm here with my 2 teens and this room just isn't cutting it. I didn't bother requesting another room I'm sure they're all similar. If I was paying a reasonable rate, I might cut it some slack, but I'm paying $1,000 for 2 nights - I regret booking so early in advance because out of curiosity, I checked for a  reservation the night before we got here and I could have had the exact same room type for $200 less than my reservation, which was not able to be canceled or changed at that point. Oh- and the kicker, when we went out on night 1, we put the DND tag on the door (as I always do) and we came back that night and found a bag of (I hope) clean towels on the bed. We didn't request towels and the DND tag was on the door but they apparently came in and threw them on the bed. Even if we had requested them, they should have left them outside our door when they saw the DND tag. Glad we didn't have anything of value in the room. Really, really don't stay here. Hilton needs to do better and I'm questioning my Diamond loyalty at this point. ","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"NONE"}

The location was perfect, a few blocks walking to many of our destinations.  Very close to many excellent restaurants.  10 minute walk to Times Square, but away from the noise.  Taxis easy to hail from the avenues, or a quick walk to subway.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, especially our bell captain in arranging a car service to get us to the airport when we departed.  Both check-in and check-out were pleasant and seamless.  Our higher floor room was very clean and quiet, although cozy small.  Fine for 2 people, but would have been very crowded for a family.  Excellent hot water.  \n\nSecond - things to be aware of.  *Manhattan is expensive.*  And the hotel puts a hold on your credit card of about $100 per night, for \u00ab\u00a0incidentals\u00a0\u00bb plus bills all of your reserved nights when you check in.  If you don\u2019t spend any incidentals, it gets released when you check out.  There is no service elevator, so hotel staff (housekeeping) use one of the three smaller older passenger elevators along with the guests.  This adds to the high traffic times in the mornings and late afternoons when you will wait 5 to 15 minutes for the elevator.  Lots of signage advising this, not a problem if you plan accordingly.  But the lobby is tiny, especially when waiting for the elevator.  Housekeeping is only provided after the 4th night of your stay.  (This seemed a little cheap in a $400+ per night room).  A call to housekeeping for clean towels and an additional roll of toilet paper mid-way through our 4-night stay was quickly and graciously provided.  Shampoo, soap, body lotion are provided in pump containers affixed to the walls of the shower and mirror over the sink.  There is no written paper or binder within the room advising hotel policies, room service, check out times, etc.  only a QR code for your phone.  (It took us a few days to realize this !)  \n\nAll in all - this hotel is comfortable and extremely well located, and the staff is professional and pleasant.

Check in was smooth and the deposit for $700 per room was taken on our cards (total of $1400 as we had 2 rooms) which we thought was steep we've only ever paid $250 per room for 7nights at any other Manhattan hotel but we found out before we arrived so we were prepared. We had room 1704 and 1908. \n\nWhen we got into room 1704 it was clean as was 1908. The television in 1704 didn't have a signal and the safe wouldn't work so we went down to reception and someone came up and sorted the safe but said that a cable guy would need to come out to the television the next morning. So the next morning we went to reception and they said someone would come when we were out but on return this hadn't happened so we went back and they sent the guy from the night before who came up and took the TV off the wall and tightened the cables which gave us 6 obscure channels and he once again said we would need to get reception to get the cable guy to come up. We just put up with the 6 channels. The maintenance guy (didn't catch his name) was always very pleasant and as helpful as possible. \n\nThe elevators within the hotel are a pain and there are signs about busy times but everyday the middle lift wasn't working sometimes it was a 30minute wait just to get up to the rooms. \n\nUpon check out we went to reception and gave in our keys and we were told no charge and our deposits were released.

Devon then came and took our cases and organised a taxi back to the airport for us which was fantastic. \n\nNow my big issue is that upon landing back into the UK my husband's credit card now has a charge on it and while it is only \u00a32.69 it will incur a foreign transaction fee and the other issue is we have no idea what the charge is for as we used none of the hotel amenities that were chargeable. It also makes no sense as we were told at check out we had no outstanding bills. I have tried to contact the hotel via email but no reply. I have had a reply from the hotel on Facebook telling me to call, this would be fine if I wouldn't get charged at a higher rate for the call. This has left me disgruntled and made it so that I won't stay here again. \n","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I went to meetings unshaven. When I called to have it fixed, I was told that I had to wait 15 minutes with the water running and see if it gets hot (it didn't.) The person downstairs  was dismissive and picked up the phone saying simply \"Hello.\" Sounded annoyed (my perception). I tried to explain that the water in the sink was scolding hot, so it was not a hot water issue but the shower knob issue. The engineer came and reset something, saying it would help. I waited 10 minutes and it was still the same. I showered in lukewarm water but could not shave under the shower and was late. The next day I didn't even bother with them and showered in the same lukewarm water. Room 1501: the heater wasn't working in my friend's room (I booked it for her), same limited mobility room, someone came and fixed the heating but it again stopped working at 3-ish am. She said she didn't want to call and let someone into her room in the middle of the night. At checkout, I told the personnel about our experiences. They became defensive. Another female employee stepped in our conversation (unprompted and unnecessarily), but I continued talking to Angelique. I said I was a Hilton Gold member, that person said since I booked through booking.com, my gold status didn't transfer and I received no perks. I didn't want any perks, I said, just hot water and working heater. I didn't realize these perks were not for everyone. Now, the million dollar question is this, and I am asking Hilton: I was told to let the water run and wait for at least 15 minutes, and also was told this is \"standard\", in other words, this is their first line response to hot water issues. Do they realize how much water is being wasted if each guest follows this protocol? What kind of environmental impact does it cause and how can Hilton be comfortable with this as a corporation? I will not stay at that hotel, that goes without saying, but they really should review your NYC hotels. I understand it's a bustling city and you will never be without guests, I also realize NYC has a different culture. Still.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

On top of that, they will charge wild rates when they don't honor the confirmation.  To say I was treated rudely and with complete indifference would be an understatement.  I have been a  long time Hilton customer, but I will never stay at a Hilton again.  The local hotel apparently did not have the updated reservation (taking them at their word.  Honestly though, they could say or do this to anyone.)  And despite having a record of the confirmation, the corporate office will not stand by their reservations.  Why would anyone ever book a Hilton room when they can pull shenanigans like this.  Why did the add $1000 to my bill when they saw I was distressed?  These are good questions.

They are very quick to debit this from your card but are very reluctant to refund it making people wait up to 5 days.  They can't explain why they won't just keep a card number on file or why it takes so long to refund the money that they were so quick to take.  They also refused to, on my penultimate night of a 5 night stay, to refund the unused money from the previous 4 nights.  The person who claimed to be the manager on duty at the time (Veronica) was extremely rude and unhelpful.  She even claimed  that this happened in all hotels (as a busy international traveller, I assured her it didn't0 and said that \"she knew it did because she had allegedly worked in the industry for 24 years2.  Her rude and unhelpful attitude told me she had barely been in the customer service industry for 24 minutes, let alone 24 years.  She also rudely refused to help me with a number to contact my holiday provider and just vaguely pointed me to a phone and then walked away.  The other thing is that this hotel had randomly put some Amazon handling charges onto my bill for a package that I had certainly never ordered, let alone received.  I was eventually able to get hold of my holiday provider via whatsapp who contacted the hotel on my behalf and eventually was able to get them to drop the bogus Amazon charges and reassured me about the deposit money.  They also complained about Veronica's rudeness to me and apparently they were issued with an apology although Veronica didn't have the decency to apologise to me directly.  Veronica could certainly learn some customer care skills from my holiday companyI didn't eat in the hotel (for fear of them charging goodness knows what to my account) so can't comment on that.  Other staff that I bumped into in corridors etc were polite and the one person to single out was the Porter on the morning of my departure who kindly offered to look after my luggage for me for a while as my flight was after the time for departing the room.\nWhilst this hotel has a good location, there are others that, despite what Veronica claims, do trust their guests and will not take a $100 charge per night from your card.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

I can only give my overall opinion, based on my experience.\nMy wife and I arrived early afternoon and were greeted with warm reception from desk staff as you would expect. Check-in was efficient and we went to our room, on the twentieth floor. Room was clean and tidy so no issues there. Shower room clean, tick. Being at the rear of the hotel there wasn't a view to speak, wasn't expecting too much in such a high-rise city, no problem. I'd agree with one previous review in that the room could do with a refresh but it was okay. No street noise, even emergency vehicles being at the rear.\n\nOne thing that has been mentioned on a number of occasions, the lifts could, at times, be in high demand. This normally occurs at morning check-in, evening check-in\/out and when bulk laundry movements happen. Nothing you can do about that if you expect fresh towels and linen - the larger of three elevators is commandeered for this activity. Have a little patience.\n\nThroughout our stay, every member of the team, if not directly engaged with a customer, would wish you well as you left and welcome you upon return. very nice.\nThe location - as the first days played it became apparent we were in easy reach are Central Park, subway and bus stops for up and downtown travel and so many places to eat! Times Square, Fifth Ave., and many more are just a bit further, if you can walk with some comfort for periods at a time. It just felt an ideal spot.\n\nJust adding that as a guest of the hotel, a discount can be had at  the steak house next door. Remember to ask for the voucher from desk staff before going! Albert, the concierge, was kind enough to get one for us when he explained what should have happened. Whilst expensive, my wife commented that it was probably the best steak she'd ever had.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I was told all 3 elevators are functioning and I was placed on floor 6 room 602. Thank goodness for the 6th floor because the elevators were absolutely ridiculously slow and full by the time it came to your floor. There were more people walking up and down the stairwells carrying luggage because the elevators were that slow! One time I timed it and it took 18 minutes to get an elevator  during non rush hours! Absolutely ridiculous to wait that long! We ended up using the stairs the entire trip duration to include taking luggage. Upon checkout I complained about the elevators and was told \u201cSorry\u201d! I then called the hotel the following day to make a formal complaint and I was told the hotel was sending someone to service the elevators and that i would receive 5000 Hilton honors points for my inconvenience.

I was allowed to check-in around noon with no extra charges. Moreover, I got room (#704) fitting my major requests \u2013 a high floor, open space (no building right across my window) and a nice city view. My room was more than big enough, looked pretty basic but had good design and was perfectly clean. I really loved having a big window. My room had a lot of daylight, which I really loved. I also loved the little sofa lounger next to the window where it was possible to lay down and chill. The actual King Bed was super comfortable! The closet in the room was pretty big, also there were a lot of additional big cut out spaces within the furniture for stuff including a space for refrigerator, coffee machine and microwave. The bathroom in my room had fairly good spacing. I really liked the big shower stall. Unfortunately, the bathroom amenities were of an okay quality and smelled not that great. Wi-Fi was working very fast during my entire stay.\nThe last thing I want to mention is the rate I paid. The value per night was approximately $160 with all taxes included.

BUT, our card was charged with 300 USD extra for incidentals. We were supposed to get it refunded.\n\n-Our room was on 34th floor (3403). Tiny, but with decent view of the skyline. Very clean.\n\nNow the nightmare:\n-The reviews of this hotel warn about how busy and slow the elevators are. But our experience surpasses all of those. \nWe stayed here 3 nights and got stuck in the elevator THRICE. It\u2019s no fun getting stuck in the middle of two high floors and dreading the next malfunction. \n\n-ONCE the elevator had a free fall for about 3-4 floors. Enough to send my covid weakened heart into a tizzy. \n\n-Now the housekeeping nightmare. I understand that many hotels now follow the \u201con request\u201d policy. But what does one do when repeated requests are not honoured? Despite requesting on the second and the third day for fresh towels and bathroom cleanup, nothing happened. When we raised it at the reception, the receptionist apologised as she could see a request under our room number. \n\n-My husband flew out of New York the day we were supposed to checkout and I decided to leave the next day. However, the stuck-in-elevator situation made me check in to the neighbouring Wyndham property. \n\n-During checkout, the receptionist took USD 100 off the total bill to compensate for no housekeeping. Since the card had already been charged, we should have got incidentals refund + USD 100. I\u2019m still waiting for that money! \n\n-I got in touch with Pierre, the front desk manager, on phone after trying for many days. He was most kind and helpful and promised to get back to me at the earliest. I am still waiting for a response from Hilton. \n\n-Since I\u2019m back to India now, it\u2019s ridiculous to chase the management on international calls. And for my own money! I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s no email address for grievance redressal. \n\n-If Hilton properties are so quick at charging for potential bad behaviour of the guests, shouldn\u2019t the guests be extended the same courtesy if their experience has been\u2026well\u2026let\u2019s just say, less than ideal? \n\nIn India, my family stays at Hilton hotels quite often.

They had gave us 2 free days of breakfast, which was a nice gesture to cover the expectation which was not delivered. \n\nThe room was spacious , air con was brilliant no concerns there, worked fine ( above standard) the room for the price was a bit expensive however it is 1. New York , 2. The location was 5 mins away from Central Park. \n\nWe had put a sign on our door stating no room service for a couple of days out of the 5 nights we were there, however when we wanted it doing , we had a knock on the door at like 7am which we were still asleep at this point and I believe personally is too early. Anyway, as we got ready for the day I had informed the receptionist around 11am stating \u201c we are going out now, is it okay if the cleaner does service, we will be out for the day\u201d \u201c yea sure no problem \u201c \n\n12 hours later.. open the door , no room service, which was bad in my opinion as did expect them to atleast to ensure my request was a priority. As we were checking out however I did advise the receptionist of this whom in stated we can give you a free breakfast for the inconvenience, which I feel was great as they did acknowledge the issue and applied the gesture. \n\nBreakfast: believe it\u2019s 18$ ( \u00a316) , which is around standard price in Manchester UK however much wider variety and better quality. not much choice , box standard, wouldn\u2019t pay for it as price doesn\u2019t reflect onto the selection provided.  \n\nThere is I believe 4 lifts, however you can be waiting 10 minutes for one to arrive, as they are so slow. \n\nOverall: good hotel with regards to the location and big spacious room however \u00a3900 ( 1100$) for a 5 night period, in my opinion is ludicrous,  \nThe restaurant which is provided by the hotel, never saw anyone in it, the prices were so high and the menu looked bland. They offered 10% discount if we wanted to go however even with this it was still highly priced. Would I stay again? Yes but for a way cheaper price, good hotel but not up to scratch to be at a \u00a3900 price in my opinion.

West 54th Street is ideally placed for all the typical New York highlights and the hotel is a couple of minutes from the subway. Room itself was what you need: comfy bed, working shower and plenty of space for luggage. The other reviews are right about elevators but we were on the 6th floor and used the stairs most of the time.\n\nStaff weren't great for two reasons. First off, we reported a faulty safe on two occasions and it didn't get fixed during our stay. Who knows if it has been fixed yet? The second guy we reported it to had his phone hidden behind the computer monitor and was texting all the way through us reporting the issue. Needs to be more subtle next time or improve customer service! \n\nSecond issue was as we left; we asked for a taxi to the airport and they offered to phone for one. Manhattan to JFK has a flat rate of $52 plus a few dollars extra for tolls. The guy quoted us $100 for one and told us, once we asked about the flat fee talked about widely online, that we'd struggle to get a better deal and that a yellow cab driver would try and scam us. Felt like that was exploiting customers and trying to push an agency they work with for a few dollars their way. Got the subway instead and won't return. \n\nI expect some compromise with Midtown hotels but I don't expect such basic rudeness and to have someone try to exploit like that.

Our room was the size of a postage stamp.  If someone sat in the chair at the counter you could not get between them and the bed.  The bathroom door stuck so to close it you had to use your strength and push it or pull it while it dragged on the floor.  The shower door did not close all the way which made for water on the floor.   And the \"city view\" run I paid extra for was a joke.   The window actually looked directly at the building next to it unless you got between the cabinet with the fridge in it and a tiny chair and looked way off to the left to see a few buildings.  Plus I think it is utterly ridiculous how you have to request housekeeping now.   It should be done no matter what.   That is what I pay for to stay in a hotel.   Even frickin Disney does it without asking every 2 days. The \"store\" if you can call it that was never stocked.   Always out of everything so my $20 credit some days was useless.  Go to the Marriott next door.  The airline people stay there.  Much nicer.

Perfect,!\n\nCons: 1) We stayed 2 nights and service by room attendants only occurs when you request it . Cleaning or refreshing linens is not done daily. For us, that was fine; the 2 of us didn't have many needs .2) The business center, although there's a sign that says open 24\/7, was nonexistent..it's currently being used as a storage room and there is no signage on that floor to indicate a different location (apparently there isn't one). When we asked front desk where we can print documents, they pointed us in the direction of a sign that had some vague instructions which made no sense to us, and we gave up. 3) The lobby is almost always very crowded with people waiting for an elevator. With only 3 smallish, old, slow elevators, the wait can be very long, especially in peak hours. And usually they were packed tightly with people, not a good thing in the days of Covid.\n\nAll of that being said, the hotel was fine for our 2 night stay.

You park in the same place, the hotel does not have a parking facility.  The breakfast is over priced.  They added an automatic  20% gratuity for a self serve limited buffet breakfast for 3.  Total bill came to $96 they did reduce to $45 after I pointed out my status with their frequent stay program.  As for rooms extremely extremely small.  Did I say small.  We had a double room for 2 adults and a teenager.  You could not both walk around the bed at the same time.  I stay in a lot of hotels, I have never been such a cramped hotel room.

They arrived early and was told they can not check in early.  The hotel took their bags for safekeeping and told them to come back at 3pm for checkin.  My wife and sister-in-law arrived shortly after three to be told rather bluntly by the front desk that the hotel was full and there were no rooms ready for her.  She asked to speak to the manager, since the front desk was being rude and she was told there would be a room ready at 3pm.  The lady at the front desk left to get the manager all the while mumbling about how she \"hates this job\".  The manager arrived, and was able to assist my wife in getting into the room she booked three months prior.\n\nUpon reaching the room, she thought she would be able to soak in a bathtub to relax for a bit.  Nope.  No bathtub in the double queen rooms at this hotel, but that's not disclosed on the website.\n\nAs the account holder, I tried to reach the hotel to discuss my displeasure with the poor service and lack of amenities.   Each time I called the number listed on the website, it would ring give me a choice of extension, then ring the extension for 5 minutes before disconnecting.  It didn't matter which extension I chose, I got disconnected no less than 5 times.  \n\nThen I attempted to contact Hilton customer service through the \"Call Me\" feature.  I waited on hold for over 30 minutes before someone answered the call.  Explained the situation, and was told they couldn't help, I would need to speak to an escalated group.  Waited on hold for another 15 minutes before that line was answered, went through the process of verifying my identity and Diamond status, explained what had happened at the hotel, and eventually was told \"Sorry, but there's nothing we can do\".\n\nI'm a Hilton Diamond member, and this is how my guests were treated.

Unfortunately, I have to;\n- The location was ideal for us (room 1913 & 1914 this past weekend), with a decent view, and close enough to walk to Central Park, Times Square, and across the street from Stephen Colbert's theater\n- The room was fine. Some signs of age, and small footprint, but overall acceptable.\n- Lousy elevator situation. There are only three elevators in the hotel, and one was broken. Average time to get an elevator was 20 minutes, and once it took 30 minutes just to get to our room.\n- The most distasteful part is that they notate the standard Hilton Garden Inn \"Diamond member\" benefit of $10 per person daily as an offset against charges at their restaurant. As a number of reviews illustrate, they don't seem to honor that benefit, which is just unacceptable and dishonest. I could have just called (likely argued up the management chain) and pursued the matter, but this fraudulent activity has to stop.\nSo if you do go to this hotel, expect long delays, OK rooms, and check your bill before leaving.

When opening one of the draws in the room it fell off!  \nThe hotel was very dirty inside and outside of the rooms, the lobby was dirty and crowded.  Worse still in the middle of a pandemic staff were not enforcing the rule of 4 in a lift at all.  12 people were crammed into the lift we used one evening - we got out before our floor.  We had to do this 6 or 7 times during our stay.  One of the receptionist's was blowing gum whilst serving us.  None of them were wearing uniform.  Really unprofessional and lets the Hilton brand down severely.  \nBreakfast, not even part of the hotel.  We booked breakfast there and I couldn't eat there as the hotel did not pass on my dietary requirements.  The breakfast we did see looked horrible, dried bacon, and unhealthy cereal.

From entering the lobby you are greeted with a respectable lobby but far from higher end Hilton properties. We were greeted by Victoria and quickly checked in and thanked for our loyalty as a Hilton member. We were provided our room keys and sent off to the elevators to ride to the 14th floor where we found our room. \n\nThe elevators are old and could use a good cleaning. All three elevators rattle and feel a little unstable as you ride up or down. You have some doubts about the area you are in as you must scan your key card to make the elevator move and the evaluators are all video monitored (so keep it clean in there folks). \n\nUpon arriving to our floor we exited the elevator to a corridor that was well lit but just was in need of a good cleaning. The carpet had dirt around and the table outside the elevator appeared to have a small area where something spilled at some point. We entered the room through a heavy door and found a decent room that I considered large compared to some of the other New York hotels I have stayed in the past. This was a handicapped accessible room so that may have helped with this feeling larger. \n\nThe room had a small bathroom with shower, toilet and sink. The rest of the room had a long \u201cdesk\u201d, TV mounted to the wall, king sized bed, and a closet that housed the ironing board, Keurig brewer, mini-fridge and microwave. The TV has a dark band at the top of the screen that effected the viewing as well as the top drawer having an issue where someone pulled the face off and tried to stick it back on. In one of the drawers we found old shopping bags which really makes us feel that the room was not cleaned well. There is tape on the walls of the room as clues that there was a party at some point as well as fingerprints on the ceiling. The wall sockets are worn and plugs fall out if you are not careful. The bed is okay, but squeaks and is a little uncomfortable but not the worst. The sheets seem clean and were soft and comfortable. \n\nThe bathroom needs a good cleaning and there is damage to the ceiling and mold in areas. The small shelf where you place the bath products while you shower was dirty and caked with soap of past guests. \n\nThe building mechanical can be loud and at one point it seemed like a helicopter was overhead but it turned out to be something in the ceiling of the bathroom. At least this was during the day so it wasn\u2019t too annoying.\n\nThe food pantry downstairs is a sad excuse for a \u201cgrab and go\u201d store area. We opted to not use our loyalty credit there and will be asking for points instead as we check out.\n\nOverall, the hotel serves its purpose as a budget hotel, but I would strongly suggest the Courtyard or Residence Inn next door as a alternative choice (yes they are Marriott and this is a Hilton property, sorry Hilton).\n\nThanks Hilton but we are only staying the one night.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We requested this and all that happened were a bag of towels were thrown on the floor in our room. The room was not cleaned for the duration of our stay despite a request and nothing was replenished (tea\/coffee) etc. Covid is not an excuse to make guests stay in dirty rooms! They seem to be able to clean the rooms at other hotels we have stayed at in the last three years!\n\n2 - Rooms are Tired - The bathroom door and a drawer were broken in our room. Despite reporting this to the front desk nobody fixed either of these problems during our stay! As well as this the door had been painted but someone hadn't even bothered to paint it all the way to the edges.\n\n3 - Staff - The staff always make you feel like it is an effort to help you and are completely clueless.

I asked when our room would be cleaned and was told after our 5th night.  We requested the 3rd\/4th night and we were told that it had to be  5th night.  Stayed 6 nights and our room was NEVER cleaned!!! This is just not acceptable!. If the restaurants in NYC can staff, prepare food, and serve to the public, it does not make sense that hotel rooms can\u2019t be cleaned the way they used to be. When on vacation, we don\u2019t want to worry about hair on the floor, trash, dirty bedding and dirty toilets. We don\u2019t live this way at home and it totally ruins the vacation experience to have to deal with this while on vacation. In the morning and evenings, we tried to request towels, toiletries, coffee, trash takeout at the front desk. Sometimes we were not able to put in our request because the front desk was busy & we didn\u2019t have time to wait. On those days, we tried calling the front desk but NO ONE ever answered. Twice we had to call HHonors and they connected us to the front desk. Both times we were calling to get FRESH towels and trash service. The 1st time we requested towels, we returned our dirty towels but we didn\u2019t get a complete set of towels in return. One time we got 4 bath towels (no face, hand or bath mat). We had to use one of the bath towels as a face and hand towel and the other bath towel as a floor mat. The 2nd time it took 2 hours to get towels and even though we asked for a complete set of towels we only got 2 towels. But that is not the worst part, the towels we received were of poor quality, wrinkled, and crumpled in a plastic laundry bag! Due to the lack of basic services we spent a significant amount of time during our vacation communicating with the front desk about the lack of basic services.

While I was on the phone with him, I asked about the clearance of the garage, as we would be arriving with an SUV  with a roof mounted luggage carrier and needed about a 7'6\" clearance.  He told me he was texting with the garage attendant who confirmed for him that the clearance was 11 feet.    On a subsequent call (to ask about another matter), a different employee gave me a phone number for the garage that was disconnected.   \n\nWe checked in via the Hilton app the day before our arrival and noted an expected arrival time of 4 PM.  Due to traffic, we did not arrive until 6 PM. The line to check in was about 25 minutes long.  We then found out that our rooms were not ready.  While we waited, my husband drove the car to the garage (down the street) and was frustrated to learn the clearance was too low for our vehicle.  We were lucky to find an appropriate space at another garage.  Sometime after 7 PM, after repeat visits to the front desk, they moved us to rooms that were ready but were not the configuration that we had reserved.  These rooms had dirt on the floors.\n\nIn my three day stay, encountering at least a dozen staff, I found only one staff member who wore their mask over both nose and mouth.  The housekeeping staff used the guest elevators during prime hours (there are signs posted near the elevators alerting guests to times of day that the elevators are busiest) when I am certain there are elevators for staff only.    We stayed on the 6th floor so we ended up using the stairs most of the time.  \n\nI understand that some hotels are understaffed and that the stress level can be high.  But I found the staff to be unfriendly, rigid, disorganized, sometimes rude, and misinformed about their own hotel amenities.  We won't be staying there again.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Using the Hilton app, I was able to pick a room as far away from the elevators as possible and we did not have any noises at all - not from neighbors, hallways, street (we were on 10th floor), or elevator. The bathroom was clean and a good size. Two of the four towels were wet and smelled bad so we had to ask for more towels, which were delivered (a lot of them) and left at our door when we were out. \n\nWhen we tried to call the front desk from our room, we never got an answer, but when we stopped by the front desk, they were helpful. We asked for a pack and play, which was delivered 45 minutes later but without bedding. We made do with towels and what we had, but it wasn't ideal. When I told the front desk the next day, they sent up a bag of queen-sized sheets. If you're coming here and need a pnp, bring your own bedding. \n\nI didn't really mind that there is only cleaning service every 5 days - the only issue is that the garbage cans aren't really big enough to hold 5 days' worth of trash. The fridge doesn't have a freezer section, FYI. The microwave didn't actually heat up the food. The wi-fi is extremely slow - probably so you'll pay for an upgrade. \n\nThe location was great.

While it was fine to sleep for 1 day, I probably won\u2019t come back. Unfortunately my husband did not read the reviews before booking for that 1 night however upon reading the reviews, I understand what the people are talking about. For the pros: it is located in a prime location, you are a few blocks away from Central Park, time square and Rockefeller center. But for the price, this hotel could be better. The elevator is small, and you do have to wait. They do have a sign to be aware of peak times as the elevator can take a while. The \u201cbreakfast\u201d that they advertise is a frozen jimmy dean sandwich that you microwave. There is a small little room with a microwave and coffee maker for you to heat up your sandwich. The room was very small but being that it\u2019s NYC I expected it to be small and while it was OK for the one night I did find some random things on the floor. The carpet was filthy, with stains I did not take off my flip flops the entire time. The room had a random Bobby pin on the floor which tells me they didn\u2019t do a good job vacuuming. And there was dust all over the desk. The mini fridge in the room did not work. The bed was ok, pillows were uncomfortable. The bathroom was decent, I did find a hair in the shower but that was all. All in all for the hefty price of $350 a night this could\u2019ve been way better. As I said I did not stay here for more than 1 night, so I don\u2019t know anything about the housekeeping that everyone is talking about. However there is a sign in the bathroom that says the housekeeping only comes every 5 days. For me they should be coming everyday. Also the parking for the hotel is $55 a day, the parking garage across the street is cheaper, I\u2019d suggest to park there instead.

My one compliant with the room is the closet is small and crammed with essentials. There is a small Hilton shop to purchase snacks and necessities. There is an adjoining restaurant that we did not eat at it, but it had a nice atmosphere and we had a couple drinks at the bar. Depending upon occupancy the elevators can be a bit of a wait.

It was our first trip back to NYC since the pandemic. Immediately upon walking in I noticed both staff members had masks under their mouths - not on really at all. I was surprised to see this as I would expect more from a Hilton property. I was also surprised at how busy the elevator always was. We were on the 18th floor, and were not comfortable cramming in with so many other groups of people (including many students who appear to be living there this year, and additionally, multiple people who were not masked). In addition, the hand sanitizing stations in the lobby were empty while we were there,\n\nOur room had a Lysol clean sticker on it. Immediately upon walking in, we noticed the room was dirtier than all other hotels we've stayed in. There was visible dust on the night tables and dressers, and red wine stains that we had to remove. There was remnants of garbage under the bed. This room didn't appear clean, let alone above and beyond \"Lysol\" cleaned. We went out and bought our own cleaning wipes to wipe things down so we had a bit of peace of mind. \n\nThe room wasn't a bad size for NYC - and it had a microwave and fridge which was nice, especially when traveling with kids. \n\nWe never had housekeeping when we were there. We were out most of the day, but no one showed up. I don't know if they aren't doing that anymore, but it would have been nice to at least have been offered fresh towels or our garbage emptied during our 3 night visit. \n\nWe were also surprised at the amount of garbage in the hallways. When we arrived, there was a bag of garbage in the hallway along with some additional empty takeout containers. They stayed there for at least a full day. \n\nThe location of this property is good for families and travelers. It is very close to Columbus Circle, the subway line, and Times Square, but feels quiet. We parked in the garage across the street - $40 a day we paid (not through the hotel but just through the garage, I think it is more through the hotel). \n\nOverall, this hotel is not what we would expect from a HGI. We both came home and got Covid tests because of the amount of people we encountered multiple times a day in the lobby and the elevators, and because of the poor masking procedures of the staff and visitors.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Our follow up visit in room 205 was much quieter and for some reason felt a bit more spacious as well.\n\nBreakfast during this COVID period consisted of choosing 3 items\/pp (frozen breakfast sandwiches, muffins, OJ, coffee drinks, yogurt, etc) in their snack shop for Diamond members.\n\nWhere this hotel really shined for us were helpful front desk staff.   We accidently left something valuable in our room during our first stay and both Maggie (over the phone) and Mark were instrumental in helping us to retrieve it when we came back.  Additionally, I'd goofed on a reservation and made it for the wrong day and Mark was again able to save the day.   We were so appreciative and felt that they both needed a shout out.  \n\nThanks for making us feel welcome and our day less stressful!","travelDate":"2020-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I  had a bad experience today on the phone with MARK regarding my recent  5 night stay.\n I understand due to covid the rooms aren't changed over daily, but are to be sanitized after a guest departs.  Upon my arrival my room was full of dust around the bed area. The desk next to the bed , which the phone rests on, the headboard and the bed board  were  ALL FILTHY. I changed rooms and to my surprise , the same issue.   I was asked if I wanted housekeeping to clean it thoroughly to avoid changing rooms again. I then had to exit the room while they cleaned. \nAt that point , I just wanted to get settled in and rest.  \nWhile reviewing my card statement, I noticed different charges from the hotel. Now I know incidentals nightly should be 50$ . Mine were somehow $100 per night.. In addition to that, there was another charge that was there and I went to front desk to inquire about.  I spoke to Rob M  , who was the manager on duty about the miscellaneous charge, overages and about why I was being double charged for incidentals. He couldn't explain to me why these charges had occurred but assured me it was a \"SYSTEM\" error beyond his control and it would settle or \"fall off\" the account after my stay. Fast forward a week later, the incidentals did \" fall off\"  but I was overcharged for 2 of the nights. \nI called  the hotel and spoke to Rob again . He credited my account and assured me that it was corrected.  A week later , I checked my statement and still there was a credit  of only 1 night now.  I call once again and get Dora at front desk on the phone . She looks into the charges and says no credit was made to that night.  At this point , I request a manger on duty . She places me on a long hold and says they're not answering , can I call back in an hour . I ask her who the manager on duty is she says she doesn't know but call back in an hour , and ask for billing dept and they will be able to assist. So I ask her the name of the GM because now I'm getting the run around. Reluctantly, she says ask for Kevin. I ask her is he the GM or the manger on duty? Dora then replies he's someone that can assist but doesn't know who the GM is. At this point, I'm thinking this is all a game . How do you not know your GM name?\n \nI call back an hour later and speak to MARK. I explain to him that I was overcharged for 1 night . He now starts to explain that Robert had credited my account and showed me invoices justifying this and that I NEED TO MANAGE MY ACCOUNT ACCORDINGLY. As if I'm the one at fault . At this point , I tell him about my experience with the system overcharging me double  from CHECK IN and that it had nothing to do With ME mismanaging my account. He was curt, seemingly annoyed and rude. He replied that he didn't \"Need to hear All THAT\". Well if you don't care that you all are overcharging guests then that's an issue I have and will not be returning, if this is the nonsense I have to endure.\nMARK needs new training in customer service. His Diva  attitude Sucks.  Watch your charges if you decide to stay. ","travelDate":"2020-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

He, and an older gentleman that was a doorman, were the kindest employees at this hotel and were very helpful. \n\nIt was a family trip, but my daughter was staying at a nearby hotel with her school and I stayed at Hilton with my parents.

It has everything one would expect from an HGI. The hotel is in a very accessible area. The 54th Street Orange line subway stop was about a 3-minute walk away to the southeast. Central park was maybe (at best) an 8-minute walk north. The shops of Columbus Square where also about an 8-minute walk away depending on how fast you walk. It is close to Times Square if that is your thing, but it is not directly in TS which we thoroughly enjoyed. Basically, you can get anywhere in the city from this location. There's plenty to eat in the immediate vicinity from cheap eats to 5-star dining. I personally loved the Lenwich around the corner, they have the best blueberry muffins!  Both my husband and I tried the ribeye meals from Empire and they were nothing to write home about especially considering the cost. \n\nWe chose the Junior Terrace Suite which by NYC standards is huge at a little less than 400 sq ft. Shot out to Carl W from Madison, WI... here on TA as he highly recommended the room and he was dead on! There are only two Junior Terrace Suites and both are on the 20th floor each with a terrace that is bigger than the room. We were given room 2006 which I initially wasn\u2019t happy about as I wanted to face the east. 2006 faces the west, but I found that while both rooms are private 2006 was even more private because it didn\u2019t have the Marriott Residence Inn\/Courtyard where people could easily look down onto the terrace. \n\nOur only qualm with room 2006 was that there is an office bldg. that faces the patio door. The patio door does not have any type of covering (I recommended some type of curtain or blinds to management, let\u2019s see if they make any changes). The problem with this is that the patio door also faces the bathroom, so don\u2019t walk around naked near the door if you are concerned with privacy. I learned the hard way when I walked out from taking a shower with only my towel on and the office worker starring right in the room. The room was kept immaculately clean and stocked with the basics. I enjoyed that the bathroom had a vanity with seating where I could do my hair and a lighted makeup mirror. \n\nWe loved that this particular location offered paid laundry especially considering it's in the city. The laundry was expensive and cost $2.75 to wash and $2.75 to dry, but again it is available and if you want clean clothes like me, it\u2019s a life saver \u2013 overall well worth the cost with minimal effort. Bring your own detergent because it is really expensive to get it from the hotel. \n\nAll in all we recommend this hotel, based upon our stay in the Junior Terrace Suite. We can\u2019t speak to any other room type as we haven\u2019t stayed in those. However, the staff were friendly and would go above and beyond for you and the accommodations comfortable.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Said to us loudly \" I can't believe you didn't let me help you with all those bags \"\nI personally am not bothered by the fact he ignored us during our visit but his action on this occasion got under my skin as it was done to deceive his boss.

Having read reviews prior to booking we were a little skeptical as reviews ranged from awful to great. Let me tell you - there is nothing awful about it.\n\nWe got a great deal on the hotel, and knew we didn\u2019t want any fancy hotel with grand lobbies as we knew we wouldn\u2019t be in it much. This hotel has a cute and warm lobby for winter, with complimentary tea\/coffee and biscuits daily\u2019s, with home made flavoured water and newspapers. Check in was simple - although there was an additional $150 charge as a deposit for any damage which will be refunded that we weren\u2019t expecting. \n\nThe room was adequate size, many reviews complain about the size but it was more than ample for the 2 of us, large king size bed, desk with a chair, wardrobe, safe, TV, full length mirrors and a good size new bathroom with walk in shower. AC worked well when we needed a little warmth. I\u2019ve stayed in many hotels with much smaller rooms. This one was great.\n\nElevator wait was longest about 1 minute, it\u2019s a hotel of 30 floors and if I\u2019m honest most buildings in NYC will likely have a couple minute wait for elevators due to the sheer size of the buildings. We had zero complaints with this but again were from the UK so to us it seemed reasonable. \n\nLocation was perfect and in walking distance of many NYC attractions, we walked to Empire State which took approx 39 minutes and was a great way to sight see. There are a couple metro stations within a 1 minute walk too which is handy for airport transfers or if you head to lower manhattan. Plenty of food options around ranging from cheap to expensive (we fully recommend the 99cent pizza shop around the corner - ahhhhmazing! And 24 hours, thank me later).\n\nWe\u2019d definitely recommend and return here. Thank you Hilton Garden for being a perfect place for us to rest in between busy NYC days.

The lobby is not spacious. Many have complained about elevators and there\u2019s always waiting. Just two worked out of three when we were there. The elevators are also small. It is a tall 34 floor building and I assume plenty of floors and rooms. Elevator capacity just is not adequate. \n\nThe corridors are narrow and the room follows the suit. Small.\nThis wouldn\u2019t matter actually to me that much if everything was otherwise fine.\nUnfortunately that is not the case.\n\nSoundproofing was very poor. We had a family with small children next door. They made a lot of and constant noise. Part of it is understandable, that\u2019s what it is to travel with kids.\nHowever the soundproofing is so poor that it felt like the neighbors were inside our room. Every sound and speak can be heard. \n\nOtherwise room is basic Hilton. Bed only average. I have slept on much better beds in Hiltons.\n\nI booked city view room on top 34th floor. Well, the other buildings surrounding this hotel are even taller. Much taller. So, you can see walls as a city view. It is ok, but don\u2019t expect anything else.\n\nI got a complimentary breakfast based on my Hilton status. It was average quality and offering. The atmosphere was nervous and unfriendly. I had to yield few times waiters looking \u201cbusy\u201d and almost walking over me. No smiles, no attentiveness, no friendliness.\nI wouldn\u2019t pay for this breakfast.\n\nIn the morning the shower didn\u2019t work, no water at all. Eventually the tap stopped working too. Things happen, I understand. This was an unexpected incident. \nAnyway, we couldn\u2019t take a shower nor wash ourselves. Not a good start for a day. \nWhen I mentioned about it when checking out, the receptionist was nonchalant. Basically he didn\u2019t care. I politely suggested an idea of compensation as the receptionist didn\u2019t himself seem to act. He said, looking bored, that they could give me Hilton points on my account. I accepted that, though felt really disappointed. \nNow, several days later, I checked my account. No points added.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My wife and I booked this place a few months ago, and I didn't really read the reviews (I'll never do that again).  So we board our plane in Dallas at 6am, and I receive an email telling me my debit card has been declined, and we were about to have our reservation cancelled if I didn't \"back it up\" with another card.  I have a $1000 per day spending limit on this card and they were trying at 6am, almost 3.5 hours before I arrived to charge the entire \"authorization\" on it.....I had fully intended to using a regular credit card.  I have been a Hilton Honors member for close to 25 years and have never heard of a hotel charging or authorizing a card BEFORE you set foot on the property!  So I call the hotel, and as the door to the plane was closing and the flight attendant was repeatedly asking me to get off the phone, I gave them my credit card.  We arrive at the hotel at 11:30am, and we are told that the rooms aren't ready yet.  Okay, I get that, it's fairly early and they need to be cleaned.  So we leave all of our luggage with the front desk bellman, and I am ask for my name and phone number by one of the clerks, and am told that I will be called to texted when a room is ready.....sounds great.....so my wife and I head out to the city to eat and explore.  5pm....no call, no text......so we head back to the hotel, and I look at the same clerk and inquire why no call or text, he just stares at me.  No answer at all.  We are given a room on the 13th floor (weird, but ok).....we board the elevator (it actually happened to be working) and go to the room.....the room was situated between 2 elevator shafts.  You could hear the elevators on each side going up and going down.  I call the front desk to ask for another room, and the young lady precedes to argue with me telling me this was one of their most \"popular rooms\".....I cannot make this up.  So I implore her to PLEASE give me another room NOW!  About 10 minutes later, we are met at the elevators by the young lady, who gives us a key to a room on the 14th floor.  The rooms was nice, CLEAN and fairly quiet...really all I ask in a room.  The elevators.  The elevators for this property SUCK.  There are 3 separate elevators, and for the entire 5 day stay at least one of them was broken.  You can expect at times ro wait close to 10-15 minutes for an elevator.  Then there was the concierge.  She asked me one morning in the lobby of I was a Hilton Honors member.  I said I was and she asked my if I wanted to earn 60,000 Hilton Honors points.  I said sure, and was directed to make an appointment to the \"Hilton Club\" on 57th street.  My wife and I went, and spent the next 2 hours (which if they would have cut the schmoozing and the BS down should have taken 45 minutes) being \"sold\" on a timeshare.  We finally refused, and were told we needed to speak to a sales manager.  I am, and have been a sales associate, sales manager, and a national sales manager for a number of fortune 500 companies in my life, and i have NEVER, EVER been spoken to in a manner that this woman spoke to my wife and I.  We were told we were \"stupid\" for not signing up and we needed to this immediately before this opportunity went away.  We flatly refused and left.  I have yet to receive my 60,000 points and I am not confident I will ever see them.  I have read many of the other \"negative\" reviews, and while I can see and understand what a thank-less business it must be running a hotel, the same problems that the manager of this property keeps apologizing for on this site, continue to happen.  I would think long and hard about ever staying at this hotel agin or recommending it to friends or family.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

There was often one or two out of the 3 lifts out of service. On one occasion, the small lift cab was so packed and it took so long to get down to the lobby, that a gentleman collapsed and an ambulance had to be called when we got to the lobby-the lift stopped on every floor from 34 down to 1!!! A scary experience!!! Would recommend asking for a room closer to ground level so that you can use the stairs in the case of the lift not working\/ lift too busy (which seems to be a few times daily).. \n\nOur room was a good size for NYC standards and it was clean. We were on the top floor (34th) and there was a nice view of other tall buildings in Manhattan. \n\nI was taking a shower at 08:00 on my first morning here and all of a sudden there was no water.. which was very annoying!! The next evening, my partner was taking a shower and the water started violently spitting as if there was an issue with the pressure! Another time, I ran the tap and some brown water came out before it ran clear. Obviously a serious issue with the plumbing in this building!!!\n\nIf they could sort the lift and the plumbing, it is definitely a hotel I would recommend.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When I booked the room, I asked for a room that was away from the elevator because of the noise, and instead, got a room right next to the elevator. I also booked a room with \"snacks\" and I often had to remind the front desk about the snacks because they didn't restock them. Additionally, in the room, there was a constant blinking of the smoke detector light; it was almost like a strobe light, but less consistent.

Le stanze sono abbastanza pulite (mancano di fondamentali attenzioni, come le condizioni del copriletto e il ricambio delle saponette nel bagno) ma molto pi\u00f9 piccole di quanto sembri al momento della prenotazione. In coppia si fatica a sistemare i bagagli in modo conveniente e c'\u00e8 un unico, stretto armadio per sistemare i vestiti. Non basta per una persona sola, figuriamoci per due.

Al mattino l'hotel dispone di bevande calde per gli ospiti, al pomeriggio di biscotti e infuso freddo. Il personale \u00e8 cordiale ma poco premuroso negli inconvenienti in cui si incorre quotidianamente, come le lunghissime e snervanti attese per l'ascensore: un giorno fummo costretti a salire 27 piani a piedi, dopo mezz'ora di attesa davanti agli ascensori. Credo che l'hotel sia pi\u00f9 adatto a soggiorni lavorativi per una persona sola che a viaggi di piacere in coppia, in cui si rischia di stare stretti. La parte peggiore \u00e8 stata la navetta per l'aeroporto, costata pi\u00f9 di un taxi, che si \u00e8 rivelata un furgoncino sgangherato e sporco che ha attraversato Manhattan per fare altre fermate e andare a prendere ospiti da altri hotel.

Once I logged on, I saw that my three night stay was cancelled. I most certainly never cancelled my reservation.\n\nI immediately called the Hilton Garden inn and spoke with a male representative. He told me my stay was cancelled, however he kept me on hold for approximately 30 minutes. He never came back to the line and I was disconnected. I called back and spoke with a female representative, she also kept me on hold for approximately 20 minutes. She however told me that my stay was cancelled due to a discrepancy in the card that I provided. I was then  disconnected again!  I called back a third time, and spoke with the night manager Maria which confirmed that my reservation was cancelled.\n\nMaria stated Hilton sent me an email to let me know of the situation. I explained to her that I frequently check my emails constantly throughout the day, however, I did not receive an email from Hilton advising me of such matter. She continued to bypass what I was telling her and said they sent an email. She told me that she did not have my reservation anymore and no more spaces were left. She was very rude. I explained to her that I didn\u2019t receive a phone call, a voice mail, or a text message. I told her I would have resolved this issue if I had received a call, text, email, or voicemail. I asked Maria if they had my phone number on file and she said they did. I asked her why they didn\u2019t call or text me, however she didn\u2019t have an answer to that. She simply didn\u2019t care.\n\nShe unsuccessfully attempted to find a room for me and my family. We were left without a room in New York until I found something else later.\n\nI was also charged $158.93 dollars for taxes and was never refunded the money. I am very disappointed with Hilton. They acted very unprofessional. Hopefully someone will see this and understand how they didn\u2019t go above and beyond to try to contact me so that I could resolve this matter.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

First time at this HGI, and although I am semi-picky about hotels (and stay in one 100+ nights\/year), my greatest concern was about the elevators, based on other reviews.  So here it is:  for me, as someone coming and going 2-3x per day from an upper (30th) floor and at predictable hours, the elevators were slow, but not a deal breaker for me.  YMMV, and I think that is a fair assessment.\n\nFor the rest, I really enjoyed my stay here - the location is perfect, near Times sq, Broadway, Hell's Kitchen and Central Park, and the subway.  Tons of restaurants. Decent gym. The staff was super friendly and helpful (though the lobby is chaotic), and cabs\/uber easy to get.  The waiters at the restaurant (for breakfast) were very nice, though the buffet could use a few more 'fresh' options - the kiddies love the waffle maker, but some granola, a banana or berries would go a long way for me.  Overall, the room was on the small side, but clean, quiet and comfortable and everything worked.  King room perfect for a solo traveler, but would be tight for 2.  A 3 star hotel, but with the staff and location I gave it the extra.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":5786212,"title":"An incredible anniversary!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-05-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"My wife and I visited this property to celebrate our first wedding anniversary in NYC. Upon arrival our room was not quite ready as it was roughly 1pm, which is to be expected, however it was here that our experience with the staff began on an incredible note.\n\nThe agent we had the pleasure of being served by, Luis R., is an incredible asset to the property. His upbeat demeanor and can-do attitude deserve the highest accolades when it comes to the service of guests. Without our asking, he offered to have  our luggage stored as our particular room was still in the process of being cleaned, which he then contacted housekeeping to expedite, again of his own accord. However, he didn't stop there. Luis inquired if we'd had time to eat during our travels, and continued to provide us with a handful of great nearby restaurants to choose from (Chai Thai was exceptional, per this recommendation) while our room became available. We returned from lunch closer to 2pm, and were again informed that the room wasn't 100% ready, which was also expected due to check-in being 3pm. Yet, Luis went out of his way to provide us with a coupon to the Empire Steakhouse next door for us to grab a few drinks while we waited and told us he would send us a text when the keys were available at the desk. Not 30 minutes later, Luis didn't text us that the keys were ready, but instead personally walked them to us at the bar of the restaurant, to allow us to continue enjoying our time at the bar without interruption. Never have we been treated so kindly, and sincerely appreciate the efforts and courtesies extended to us by Luis. But wait, there's more!\n\nUpon arriving to our room, we found that we'd been upgraded to a beautiful Terrace King, in honor of our special occasion! Being that we'd only booked a standard king room, this was an unexpected yet deeply appreciated surprise. We thought that would be the icing on the proverbial cake, until a knock came at our door shortly after we'd arrived. Provided by the team was another unexpected amenity; two bottles of wine, chocolates, and a hand-written card from Raymi (our check-out agent who was equally superb!), and signed by the other front desk staff! We were blown away by everything the staff had done for us, just within hours of being in the city.\n\nTo the management:\nI can't thank you and your staff enough for the courtesies and level of hospitality that was provided to us throughout our stay with you. It sincerely made our celebration that much more special, and is an experience I will not forget. Being in the hospitality industry myself, I know what proper service looks like, and the entirety of your staff exceeds that expectation at every point. From everyone at the front desk, to the bellmen, lobby ambassadors, and housekeepers, there was not one instance in which we were not greeted, asked how our stay was or if we needed anything, and welcomed with a smile. It is apparent that the standard of service unremittingly exhibited by your staff goes well above and beyond the norm at all levels of the organization; of which you should be incredibly proud.\n\nIf ever you or your staff venture to my property here in Daytona Beach, I kindly insist that you or they reach out to me, so I may have the opportunity to repay the kindness I was shown as a guest at your establishment.\n\nMy sincerest thanks to you and your staff for making our stay better than we could have imagined, and I wish all of you the best!","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was clean and the bathroom was beautiful. The sliding shower door made showering a breeze with not a splash of water escaping onto the floor. Yes the towels could be \"more plush\" but they were fine. The bed was fine, not too firm and not too soft... but then came the sleep quality.  While we were so excited to not have neighbors on either ends (00 rooms are facing inside and not street side) with great views. However, you're nearest the elevators which go UP and DOWN alllllllll night. Even with a white noise machine, the clicking from the shaft could be heard. I'm pretty sure I woke up every hour on the hour because of the noise from the three elevators outside our room. It was really disappointing because we're usually woken up by inconsiderate neighbors slamming doors or street noise from down below, but this was equally annoying.

Staff needs additional training.\n\nFirst Impression - small cramped lobby. Six people standing in line waiting to check in. Two gentlemen assisting with check-in but Megan stands behind the counter not helping anyone for more than 10 minutes. Finally I get her attention and she beckons me to the counter. She finalizes the check-in process with no interaction, providing no details about meals, rooms nor upgrade status. Since I'm a Hilton Diamond member I inquire if it's possible to upgrade my room. Her answer is \"We're fully booked tonight, but I'll upgrade you tomorrow.\"\n\nSecond Impression - My room is situated \"Between\" the elevators - allowing me to hear them dinging every time the doors open on this level. My entryway is similar to a long bowling alley opening onto the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. Literally the amount of space between the foot of the bed and the \"desk\" ( really a 15 inch wide shelf) is an astonishingly small 21 inches. I'm not a claustrophobic person - but this room was small!\n\nThe desk lamp blinked on and off. I called for service and a man replaced the bulb - but did not fix the issue.\n\nThird Impression - The following day I waited to hear from the front desk on the upgrade until 3:00pm. I called to inquire. The front desk knew nothing of Megan's offer to upgrade my room for the second night of the stay. I requested an upgrade again, but was informed \"We're completely booked, we can't upgrade you.\" \n\nRoom Service - the hotel relies on the Empire Steak House adjoining to provide room service. They got my order wrong, but corrected it when I called them after delivery. BEWARE - they add on a \"Zone Charge\" on top of the instant Gratuity. Ask for the total before you finalize your order. To make things worse, when I compared my room service receipt with my checkout receipt the hotel charged me an additional $4.00!\n\nFourth Impression - upon checkout the young woman Esri asked how my stay was. I went over my issues above. She looked in the computer and saw that there were Junior and Senior Suites available the night before and could not provide an answer why I was not upgraded to them. She offered to give me a paltry 5000 Hilton Honors points for my poor experience. They was no manager available to discuss this with.\n\nI travel to NYC a lot on business and I am a dedicated Hilton customer.

The hotel is conveniently located just off Broadway, near Columbus Circle and many attractions.\n\nThe rooms are small, but efficient (it is New York).  Complaints about elevator wait times are not exaggerated, but it is a midtown Manhattan hotel, 30+ floors, with three elevators shared by guests and service staff.  It is what it is.  Plan your stay accordingly, plan arrival and departure times, plan your room floor and take all that into account.\n\nRooms are clean and quiet.  If street noise bothers you, ask for a room on the back side of the hotel.  These rooms are very quiet.  \n\nMy complaint about this stay revolves around management not honoring commitments made by front desk staff.\n\nI checked in on February 6, into room 707.  The room was not ready at check-in time at 3:00 p.m.  It was not ready at 4:00 p.m., either.  The front desk clerk was very apologetic.  She gave me a discount coupon for the restaurant and said that I could also have the two bottles of water in the room and she would make a note on my reservation that I would not be charged for them.  \n\nI drank one during my week-long stay.  I stopped at the front desk and told the same clerk, and asked her if the note was still on my reservation.  She checked and said it was.  I asked a different clerk the next day, she checked, and she said the note was there.\n\nWhen I checked out on February 13, I told the front desk clerk about it.  She checked and said there was a note there and she would not charge me for the water.  It was not on my receipt.\n\nA day later, a charge up $3.29 ($3 for the water and .29 tax) showed up on my credit card statement.  I promptly emailed Hilton guest services about it.  They undertook to investigate.  I provided them with the receipt number and other information they requested.\n\nYesterday, February 26, I received a communication from Hilton guest services that they understood the hotel had been in communication with me and the matter was resolved.  The hotel had not been in communication with me and when I checked, the charge was still on my credit card.  I replied that their understanding was incorrect - the hotel had not been in communication with me, the matter was not resolved, and the charge was still on my account.\n\nThis morning, February 27, I received a communication from Hilton guest services that the manager refused to remove the charge.  The water was consumed and the charge would stand.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t about $3.29.  This is about hotel management not backing up staff commitments.\n\nThere are a lot of hotels in NYC.  There are a lot of other Hiltons in NYC.  I cannot recommend this one.  If they will cheat on $3.29, what else will they cheat on?","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

Our room had a safe. Staff is hit or miss. Some (housecleaning, doorman, Ashley at front desk) are very friendly and eager to help. Others go out of their way to avoid talking to you. We saw one staffmember (a manager I presume) arguing with three guests in the lobby at one point.\n\nWe arrived before check-in time, left our bags and explored the city. Once we received the text that our room was ready, we returned, got our room keys, and then proceeded to wait 25 minutes for the staff to bring our bags to us from another floor. A minor inconvenience for us, but it was a big deal to another group of travelers who were also waiting for bags. They had a car waiting outside the whole time. Bottom line: make sure you have time to spare if you ask them to hold bags for you. Also, the lobby is small and the elevators are slow, though not as slow as others have said (we waited 5 mins. once, I think). Be prepared for a throng of people to be in your way at peak times.\n\nLocation is great if you want to explore Midtown. Right around the corner from Colbert and the Late Show. Blocks away from MoMA, Rockefeller Center, Times Square. Only a block or two to the 50 St subway station.  Calibrate your expectations appropriately and this is a good place to stay. But, don't expect to be \"wowed.\" We got a good deal because it was the offseason, so that gives it a value bump.\n\nIf you are a Hilton Honors member, make sure to talk to the concierge for tips and discounts to local restaurants.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had a great stay and the front desk was very kind. While I was actually at the hotel, everything was great. I stayed from January 26th to January 27th. \n\nA few hours after I checked out on January 27th, I realized that I left a dress of mine in the closet. I immediately called the hotel and was directed to the lost and found. I got a voicemail, which was fine, so I did as instructed and left my name, number, etc. and was told that I would receive a call back. Two days went by and I didn\u2019t receive a call so I called back myself. This time I was connected to someone in housekeeping and she said that she was just listening to the voicemails today and that she would call me back later that day to let me know whether or not she found my dress. I never received a call back so I called again a few days later and left another voicemail. This process repeated two more times. I spoke to someone on the phone again and they said the same thing that they were going through the lost and found items and would give me a call at the end of the day. Once again, I never received a call. Being frustrated at this point, I left another voicemail a few days later and was still not contacted. This was almost a month ago and I have heard absolutely nothing. \n\nI am absolutely disgusted by the way the hotel handled this. Even if they couldn\u2019t find the dress, the fact that I left three voicemails and never received a response and was told on the phone more than once that they were looking into it and would call back that day is inexcusable. Being a Hilton Honors member and supporting the chain for a long time, I\u2019m extremely disappointed with this location. I\u2019ve never received such terrible customer service at a Hilton before in my life. The entire thing was very shady and proves that honesty and integrity are not qualities that are important to the staff members of the hotel.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Central Park is only 10min walk Everything you need is nearby.\n\nOur room on the 27th floor was lovely, very clean & the bed\/pillows were so comfortable (I wanted to bring them home)! Housekeeping came in everyday, couldn't fault it. \nRoom has a hairdryer so no need to bring one, also has x2 USB ports on a bedside clock so if you forget your plug adaptor, No panic, you can still charge your phone! \n\nWe were a party of 7 for my partner's daughters 21st birthday & we all had rooms next to each other. The staff were all brilliant, friendly, very helpful & a pleasure to talk to! Thank you for making it a great stay for us! \n\nThe hotel provides free tea\/coffee in the lobby in the mornings & fruit infused water through the day. The room also had a great coffee\/tea pod maker :) ...Being English, we like our tea! \n\nThe only downside in my opinion is that there is no separate service lift for the maids\/staff so on occasions there was a wait for the lift. Although there are 3 lifts! It wasn't an issue for us, but maybe for impatient people!! \n\nThe Empire steakhouse & bar joined to the hotel is excellent & the staff are fantastic, don't forget to try the happy hour! Roberto made our stay absolutely fantastic. Thank you! \n\nAll in all a huge thumbs up & apart from the lifts, I can't think of anything else negative :) :)","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was clean.  The rooms small but nice.  The staff friendly. The location was great.  The only two issues is that the beds are horribly firm.  I think I might have done better to move my pillow to the floor.  And we were traveling with children and requested either connecting rooms or rooms near each other.  After booking we were told that morning on the drive there that not only do they not having connecting rooms but that one room was going to be on the 12th floor and one on the 34th floor!  This required us to now split up our family.  It made our stay very difficult and hard to meet up as we now had to fight the elevators and waits for them just to get things or see each other.  We made this reservation through the call reservation center.  If they don't know what a hotel offers they shouldn't tell us we will be able to get it and if they can't or wont honor a request so simple as put us near each other.......then they shouldn't say they can do that either. By the time we arrived there were no other rooms available and we were stuck.  Their compromise was to move us the following day which was really impossible.  1.  who wants to pack up and move again?  2. we weren't going to be in the hotel from 8am until bedtime so how were we going to move?  Cancel our plans to move luggage?  It was very disappointing.  If I had been told all this prior I honestly more than likely would have looked elsewhere.  They also charged for water that was not used.  We went to the store and bought our own vs paying for a $3\/4 bottle.  It was not on our receipt but it showed on the credit card bill.  We had to call about that too.  They did remove it but make sure you check your bills and credit card statements. Over all, if not booking multiple rooms or caring which floor you are on or room you are in isn't an issue, I would stay again.  The hotel over all was very nice.

This was our 11th trip. We've stayed in different hotels all over the City. This hotel is in best location of any we've stayed at. It's in the Theater district close to all the tourist attractions. Just blocks from Columbus circle , central park, times square, Rockefeller center, 5th ave. etc.etc.  The Hotel rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. I liked the walk in shower. The staff were friendly and  helpful. I'm not meaning to make this a negative review as I'll probably be booking this hotel for next year. The location out weighs a few flaws.  The rooms are typical  small New York Hotel rooms. I read reviews that people didn't like the sliding bathroom door. I didn't think much of it but I can see the negative now. The shower doors are clear and the sliding bathroom door doesn't lock so if Your traveling with a child they could easily just come in the bathroom and see more than you'd like them to. The  hot water takes a long time to get to the shower. We called the front desk thinking there was a problem. They told us to run the hot water in the sink 1st. They said that would help speed things up. It did but Who wants to do that every morning ? The lobby of the hotel is small. Not a big deal but could be if your waiting for a car service or something else. Not much room for sitting. The biggest issue are the elevators. 3 elevators just aren't enough for a 34 floor hotel. Their is a sign on the elevators giving peak times and telling you to make plans for delays. We were leaving at 6:15 PM one night for Radio City Music hall to see the Rocketttes.  This was outside the posted peak times. It took 25 minutes for the elevator to come.  We called the desk to make sure their wasn't a problem.We had to skip dinner because of the elevators issue.  I know it's for security but you have to swipe your room key in the elevator for it to work. It's a hassle when your carrying bags or luggage to get your room key out. Over all this hotel is probably better than I'm making it sound like. I wanted to let you know all the negatives. One tip is book early. I booked almost a full year out. In just a few weeks the price had gone up 2 1\/2 times.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay at a great location in Manhattan.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It does have the basic amenities of a coffee machine and microwave and coffee machine, but the terrace which comes as part of the suite was also disappointing. The \u201csuites\u201d are only located on the second floor, between high rise buildings, so you can imagine that the view isn\u2019t exactly spectacular.\n\nThe actual room was very basic, with a TV that didn\u2019t work and took 3 days and 5 phone calls to fix, and heating that packed up on the last day. There was maintenance in the room next door to us which started at 06:10 in the morning, although the hotel assured us the noise was coming from outside (the \u201cmaintenance\u201d tag on the door of the room gave it away though). \n\nThe reception is small and chaotic and all the staff we interacted with seem to consider guests to be an inconvenience. They\u2019re not interested in sorting out any issues, or how your stay is going.\n\nThe maintenance of the room was poor, with threadbare carpets. Space in the room (remember it was a \u201csuite\u201d) was also minimal, with about 18\u201d between the end of the bed and the fancy Herman Miller chair, that the hotel seem to make a feature of.\n\nThese issues were obviously raised with the hotel staff during the stay. their excuse for not being able to deal with them was that the room was booked via a third party, though in reality I suspect they just weren\u2019t interested.\n\nOn the whole, don\u2019t stay here.

The price was exactly as advertised. The hotel lobby has a therapeutic aroma. Not sure what they use but it smells amazing. Clean, Extremely nice and helpful people. Pleasant and polite. I want to emphasize how nice and helpful everyone is at the hotel. We asked if it was possible to have a lower level room that is as quiet as can be. The room the nice lady provided us was at the back of the building (still a view of a street) on the 6th floor and at first we thought it would be noisy due to the fact it is sandwiched in between two elevators. NOPE. we never heard a peep. No traffic noise, no people noise, no elevator noise. Silence. The bed and pillows were also therapeutic. We tried to find out how to buy the same pillows for home. The room is small for Las Vegas standards but normal for NYC. We had a TV, and Yes a REFRIGERATOR, coffee, storage, clean tub and shower. We had everything we needed. There are great delis and restaurants all around you. Subway station is a block away at 53 and 7. Central park is a short walk. Rent a bike and ride the park. For New York City the hotel pricing was better than competitive and the stay was very nice, clean and comfortable. My advice is to take advantage of the pricing here as it is worth it and just know While the lobby smells so very nice it is on the small side, yet cozy with coffee and newspapers available in the mornings and excellent people. The elevators can take some time at peak times but is not unbearable. If you are on a floor that has no ice machine simply take the stairs to the next level. It is very quick and the stairs are located at the end of a very short hall, you can't miss them. Plan ahead for peak elevator and lobby times and you will be just fine. We never felt crowded in the lobby and the elevator wait wasn't bad. There is also a restaurant connected to the lobby if you don't want to walk across the street to the cool spots there. New York City is truly the city that never sleeps. I've never seen anything like it. Hilton Garden Inn New York\/Central park South-Midtown West located on 54th St. between Broadway & 8th was an amazing part of the visit. Thank you to all at Hilton.

The desk did accommodate me with a late check out, which was really helpful because the train I needed was in the afternoon.

The hotel is situated on 54th between Broadway and 8th, perfect location for Mid Town and Central Park\n\nGeneral\n\nWe arrived around 5pm and we were checked in very quickly.  The hotel is very clean and cookies, coffee and fruit infused water are available in the day. \n\nThe hotel is tall and 'thin', with only 16 or so rooms per floor.  It's modern looking and well kept.\n\nRoom\n\nWe were allocated room 1613 and went straight out into New York.  When we arrived back around 10.30pm we realised the air conditioning did not work - it was about 25\/80 degrees outside and so the room had warmed up somewhat.  The maintenance person attended and advised a part was needed.  We were then told they didn't have it and they also didn't have a fan to bring up.  But they agreed to move us the next day which they did.  I'm an Honors member and on checking out they gave me points as an apology and for the inconvenience. \n\nWe were then moved to room 1813.  The room was exactly the same in terms of layout.  Two queen beds (5ft), drawers, wardrobe, tea and coffee and fridge.  The air conditioning worked in this room!\n\nBeds came with a light duvet in a satin cover, and a cotton sheet underneath.  There were three pillows per bed. \n\nBathroom\n\nSpacious and with a shower, no bath.  Sink area was big.  Neurogena shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion was provided.  Three towels and flannels (wash cloths) were provided.  Towels were small.  A separate floor towel was provided.  The shower was hot and good pressure. \n\nComfort\n\nAs we said above we had the air conditioning issue.  It was a bit warm that first night!  But the air conditioning is easyt to control - you can have on auto and set at a particular temperature and unlike other places there is not a lower limit on the temperature.\n\nStaff\n\nThere are loads of staff in the hotel, desk staff were very polite and helpful.  There is  concierge service including those who help with luggage.  Maintenance is on site until 11.30pm.  \n\nFacilities\n\nThere is an on site gym (considering our 10-15 miles a day we didn't use it!), two computers and water fountains.\n\nMost surprisingly, self managed laundry facilities at an absolute bargain price - $2.75 per wash and 25c per minute for the dryer - cheaper than local laundrettes.  They're open 24 hours and there are four dual machines. \n\nHilton Grand Vacations\n\nWe were staying due to the offer to attend the presentation.  This is held at 57th street and after the presentation, you're given elevated reward vouchers in multiples of $25 which can be used at a number of restaurants and retail outlets, mostly round Manhattan.  The presentation is a hard sell and they try to match you with a deal they think will suit.  It's a one on two (couple) presentation, not one delivered to a group which I had experienced before.  It's worth going to if you travel a lot as the outcome is to own a share in the Hilton and points each year to spend at hotel resorts.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I initially called to set up transportation from the airport.  The lady I talked with bad an accent so thick I could not understand her. I asked for someone else to talk to and it became an issue. I moved on.  We arrived at the hotel and noticed a large line of customers waiting by the elevator to go to their rooms.  With 34 floors the hotel only had three elevators. One of which was not working. I understand that not everything goes right and mishaps are to be expected when you are a world traveler.  The elevator worked only part of the time and was consistently out of service. A couple days into our trip we became exhausted and decided to eat dinner in our room.  DO NOT eat at the steak house down stairs.  I was treated to floppy fries, burnt baked potatoes left in a steam tray, and a dry hamburger that was medium rare.  How a dry medium rare hamburger was achieved is perplexing. We had to ask to have room service several times. After we had been out all day we would return to an unclean room.  Once again I understand that things don't always go the way you wish but this was unpleasant.   Finally, the last night of our visit had come.  It was Saturday night and the lobby was full of customers. The conscierge desk was quite busy.  I resigned myself to wait until the crowd had dispersed before I attempted to make arrangement for my travel to the airport. At 8:45 p.m. I went to the conscierge desk and asked for help procuring transportation to the airport.  I was asked at what time was my flight. I responded that I would like to leave by 730 a.m. and without a moment's hesitation I was rudely told that they were closed and I should just take a taxi in the morning. Ummmm...  why did you even ask what time my flight was then?  That is also why I know it was exactly 845 pm because the two stayed and chatted at the \"closed\" desk while I waited for the busted elevators for fifteen minutes.  Please improve the service.  There were a lot of good people on the staff.  Especially the porters and doormen. As always the bad service of a few overshadowed the rest.  ","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

See below for note to GM, awaiting response:\n\nHi Kevin,\n\nI understand you are the GM for the Hilton Garden Inn Central Park.  I'm writing to you regarding an experience we had at your hotel on 09.14.  See attached for documentation.  Unfortunately we were unable to resolve this issue with your front desk manager so we are escalating it with you.  \n\nAs a quick summary of events, we booked through Hotels Tonight.  We got room 902, dropped of our bags there around 5pm, and promptly left to attend a wedding rehearsal and dinner that we were running late for.  When we entered our room, we noticed a strange smell but figured it would clear out if we opened the windows and put the A\/C on, which is what we did.  Unfortunately, when we returned, the small was worse than ever.  This was around 11:30pm.  The smell was one of mold and dampness and was just absolutely horrendous.  Additionally, we believed it would be toxic to our health if we stayed in the room.  We called down to the front desk and asked to be moved, but were informed there were no more rooms available at the hotel was 100% sold out.  One member of your staff, Mister Salem, was sent up to inspect the room, and agreed that it smelled horrible and would let the front desk know.  With no other options, we were forced to evacuate our room and move to another hotel.\n\nThis is the sequence of events.  We were forced to pay for another hotel at a high price due to the lack of the Hilton Garden Inn's ability to provide us with a room where we could sleep, which is what we paid for.  Your staff agreed to refund the 2nd night of our book, and so we are seeking a refund for the additional $158.  As you can see I've been a Hilton Honors Member for some time.  We cannot believe that we would not get a full refund for this service given the sequence of events and that we could not even spend a night at the Hilton.\n\nPlease give me and my husband a response by email in the next 3 business days.  \n\nBest regards,\nJennifer","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}
