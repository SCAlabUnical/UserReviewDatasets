I almost started to doubt myself.\n\nI then woke up one night and caught an actual bedbug nymph, engorged with my blood (\ud83e\udd2e). I brought it to the hotel staff in the morning and stated that it was a baby bedbug. They sent the cleaning staff (after I had to ask a second time \ud83d\ude1e), and the lady insisted that there were no bedbugs. Even after I showed her photos of what an engorged nymph looks like, she was adamant that the bug did not look like that. When I asked whether she still had it so that we could show it to a pest control specialist, she told me that she *threw the bedbug away*.\n\nIt was at this point that they had zero interest in helping me and simply wanted to gaslight me and cover it up. I proceeded to replace my luggage, launder my clothing, and leave early. To be honest, this is the most vile and self-serving behavior I've ever encountered from hotel staff in my life. I shudder to imagine how widespread this problem might be if their policy is to pretend there's no issue.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

I wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to anyone, for sure this is not a place for families with young children like ours - families, please stay away. \nWe spot a mouse in our apartment (we could even film it!) and even if they were aware we had 2 children were left there with it for a night. The day after they said they would have given us a new apartment but then they changed their mind saying that - since they caught the mouse  (FALSE!) we could have stayed there. When we said that was not an option because of hygienic reasons (they have not even cleaned there) they said they wouldn\u2019t have given another apartment because my children stained the carpet and they could have done it again. We\u2019ve found ourselves with 2 young children without a clean place to spend the night in and we had to stay there another night with the mouse, the glue they put and what the animal left behind.  I felt discriminated because of the children and cheated several times. Also Wi-Fi connection in the room very poor in case you need to work from there. Personnel rude with the exception of 2 guys at the reception that have been kind with us (but with no power to make decisions). COVID Rules not respected, not even by their personnel. The cleaning lady laughed at me because I didn\u2019t want to share the elevator with other people to keep distances even if that was in line with hotel instructions. Lastly I came to pick up some boxes \/ mails that were delivered there when I left and found 1 box open and empty inside.

Most visitors to the city are from overseas and stay in NY on average for around a week. I think this hotel has now norrowed their target audience. I now have to start the mamouth task of finding another hotel suite of a similar standing. :(","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Being from South Carolina and having limited knowledge about NYC, we were very anxious about where to stay.  After much deliberation, we chose the Murray Hill East East Suites.  We could not have made a better choice!\n\nThe staff was wonderful, the room was great, and the location was perfect.  It is not a fancy mega hotel with loads of amenities.  It is very nice, but simple.  The staff keeps it very clean.  They are friendly and attentive to your needs.  They always greeted us with a smile and I got to know several of them by name.  We truly felt at home in NYC because of the staff at Murray Hill East.\n\nIn addition, the location is safe.  Easy walking distance from Grand Central where you can catch the subway to anywhere in NYC.  Walking distance from Times Square also, but away from the crowds of the touristy areas.  Lots of restaurants nearby.  A Shake Shack is within a block.  Also a grocery store and two pharmacies within two to three blocks.\n\nOur room was on the 10th floor on the courtyard side.  It was very large by NYC standards and very quiet!  We live in a rural area, and many nights our room in NYC was just as quiet as it is at home.  \n\nThe fitness center is a little small, but very nicely equipped.  The laundry room was clean and the machines were industrial quality - very fast.  The housekeeping staff was just as friendly as the front desk people.  The doormen were a delight!  Both were very personable and welcoming.\n\nThis is one trip we will remember forever.  The staff delivered everything promised - and more.  If you are going to NYC for an extended period of time, this is the place for you!","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Really like the residential neighborhood feel of this area - it seems to be quieter and not as hectic as other places we have stayed at in Manhattan.  We had a studio room which is very spacious for two people.  It actually was an apartment or condo once upon a time and has a kitchenette, dining area with table and chairs, sofa and chair in living room area as well as a bedroom\/bath area with two large closets.  The staff is friendly and helpful but one of them hinted that the hotel may be closing soon for \"renovations\".  While the place could certainly use a facelift I really hope that is really the reason they will be closing and not that they have been sold and will become something else.  There are many convenience stores nearby as well as many different types of restaurants.  Also  nearby are several bagel shops and coffee shops for a quick breakfast.  It is a quick 2-3 block walk to Grand Central Station where you can catch subways to wherever in Manhattan or the boroughs you care to go.  Just walking through the food areas of Grand Central on the way to or from the subways is eye candy and very tempting.  The Liberty Express bus runs every 15 minutes or so from near Grand Central to and from Newark Airport - I believe on 41st between Park and Lexington which is very handy for those arriving or departing from EWR.","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Although we requested a non-smoking room I could still smell smoke from other rooms. Now for the noisy: after reading other reviews, I knew to ask for a room at the back, not on street. I called several days in advance to make the request and was told it was fine. When we arrived, I was told there were only two rooms left and they were both on the street. But the woman at the front desk assured me that the street (39th st) was not noisy, it's rooms on 3rd that are noisy... Come to find out, there are ho rooms on 3rd street and 39th street is extremely noisy!

I was immediately concerned when I looked at the photos but after zipping through a few reviews on TA, I thought maybe it'll be OK.\n\nHere's the deal with this place. Very good location. Easy access to Grand Central & Times Square. It's in a good neighborhood. The rooms are huge with a kitchen. And there's a pretty decent gym in the basement -- 2 treadmills, elliptical, some free weights. No issues with the staff and I never felt unsafe.\n\nBut there's no way this place deserves to be 3 stars and that's clear the second you get an actual, physical key upon check in. I mean, what was the last decent hotel you stayed in that was still handing out keys? The linens are clean but they're like hospital linens -- they've been in use for awhile and taken a beating. Furniture hasn't been updated in 30+ years. And it doesn't take long to notice spots of mold & rust around the room.\n\nLike I said, this place is probably a great fit for some travelers.

We were given  a Junior Suite without asking for an upgrade.  Okay, the decor in the room was a little dated, as some of the reviews had said, but very spacious and comfortable with distinct lounge area and separate kitchenette.  However, we only stayed in that room one night as I had trouble with the noise from the street.  Probably wouldn't bother most but I don't sleep well at the best of times.\n\nThe following morning I spoke to Santa on Reception to see if she could move us to a quieter room at the back.  So helpful......she told us to leave our packed bags in the room and she'd arrange for us to be moved once a room became available later that day.  True to her word, we got back later to find we'd been given a Courtyard room at the back and all our luggage had been moved there.  Surprisingly on a lower floor but certainly very quiet.  Newly refurbished too.\n\nThe location of the hotel was ideal as very central to some of the main sights.  Only a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station and a couple more to the Empire State Building.  If you want glitzy, modern hotels maybe it's not the one for you.  However, if you want a clean, spacious and comfortable room in a hotel that has extremely friendly and helpful staff, that's also good value for money, then I'd recommend it without hesitation.  We'd certainly stay there again but would ask for a Courtyard room from the outset.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

El hotel es una establecimiento que se nota que tiene muchos a\u00f1os, necesitaria una modernizacion rapida. pero es sumamente comodo y bien ubicado. Si bien no necesitamos demasiada ayuda, el personal siempre esta dispuesto y hay varios empleados que hablan perfecto castellano. el unico tema es que si necesitan internet, solo se puede tener wifi gratis en el lobby , con lo cual a veces es tedioso cuando uno nevcesita hablar por skype , por ejemplo< hacerlo en el medio de un lobby repleto de gente, ya que la mayoria del tiempo , esta muy lleno de gente utiizando internet. nosotros quisimos tener internet paga en la habitacion y ademas de ser muy cara no fncionaba.\notro punto que deberian mejorar es la limpieza, si bien en la mayoria de los dias estuvo aceptable, un domingo nos encontramos con que no habian realizado la limpieza correctamente, ni siquiera habian sacado la basura de la cocina.\nes una opcion super comoda para quienes prefieren desayunar o cenar dentro del hotel ya que cuenta con cocina completa, y cafe gratis todos los dias en el cuarto.\npor la noche la zona es apta para caminar tranquilamente hasta cualquier hora ya que hay mucho movimiento en la zona.\nes una muy buena opcion para ir con ni\u00f1os ya que los cuartos son sumamente comodos y bien equipados. otra ventaja que tiene que no se encuentra en casi ningun hotel es el laundry en el subsuelo .\nlo recomiendo como una muy buena opcion en cuanto al precio, a la ubicacion y al servicio.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It is a great place to stay in New York City for a reasonable price.  My wife and I have tried similarly priced NYC hotels in the past and have been very disappointed with the service, upkeep, and cleanliness.  While the rooms at the Murray Hill East are dated, as you may read in other posts here, they are very large (\"junior suites\" with a kitchenette) for NYC standards and from what we have seen, very clean and well maintained.  The staff was friendly and accommodating, and we feel the location cannot be beat.  If accommodations and amenities need to be a large part of your NYC visit, you may want to look elsewhere.  The Murray Hill East Suites do not have many extras you might find at newer properties or resorts.  If you are going to see and do NYC, and are looking for an affordable, convenient, comfortable, and clean place to sleep, shower, and keep your stuff, the Murray Hill East Suites are perfect.  We will definitely stay again.  One constructive criticism is if the Murray Hill East were to upgrade, they should start with new mattresses.  That is where the \"dated\" is most apparent to me.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I'm a high maintenance traveler, having only stayed at the NYC Hilton before this trip, and had every doubt in the world. A cheap place to stay in the city? There had to be a catch. There wasn't one at ALL! When we arrived, we were given a free upgrade to a junior suite, and a coupon for a nearby parking deck for $25 a day (which if you aren't aware, is a HUGE discount for NYC parking). While we parked our car, they even took our bags up to our room for us. The building is equipped with a 24 hour doorman, which added to the security of the hotel.\nThe room was huge, with a queen size bed, living room, kitchen, and bathroom with a tub. It was bigger than most NYC apartments. The hotel does not use electronic keys, but we had no trouble getting the door open with a traditional key. The location is prime, within walking distance to almost everything and only about two blocks away from grand central station if you need a train to get you where you need to go. We walked to the empire state building, times square, and the flatiron district, never spending more than 30 minutes walking to any of the main tourist destinations we wanted to see. While the hotel doesn't offer breakfast, we were two blocks away from a Pret location, where we had delicious and cheap breakfast every morning.\nWe always came home to a clean room and a made up bed. We were on the second floor, so the street traffic did get a bit loud sometimes, but we were in such a secluded area this was a rare occasion. \nI would 100% stay here again.

But by the second week the air-conditioning magically started to work so I can only assume that during the cold weather that same system is used for heating.  When the weather heats up they must switch it to cold.  Our loo flooded the first night but this was promptly fixed.

When we checked in we were upgraded to a junior suite which is basically a one bedroom flat with a lounge cum dining area, a bedroom with queen bed and a kitchenette. The kitchenette comes with a fridge, microwave, electric stove and basic utensils. The decor may be dates but the room had everything that one needed, especially a large space.\nThe location is very convenient, on 39th East and Lex. Lexington is full of restaurants and shops that makes the lack of a restaurant in the hotel a non-event. There is a Starbucks a block away.\nOverall a very pleasant experience.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Very Happy!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2014-04-24","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I am going to be honest, I was led to this hotel via a last minute Hotwire reservation and was very nervous. As you can see there are mixed reviews all over the internet for this hotel. I am sort of a hotel snob and am very afraid of taking home little critters from hotels. I was skeptical of Murray Hill East, but boy was I wrong!! I really liked this hotel. It was clean, bug free and super convenient.\n\nWhen I arrived, the man at the front desk informed me that my room had been upgraded. I don't know why but I appreciated it! My room was on the third floor and was beautifully quaint. Dark carpets and furniture, but clean white sheets and blankets. I always check hotel beds for bugs before using it and there were no signs of life...what a relief! Seriously, I was ecstatic at the cleanliness of the room. It reminded me of staying in my grandmothers old apartment in NYC. I stayed by myself, but there was enough room for multiple people. I did not use the kitchen for anything but it also appeared clean although a little old.\n\nMy room did not look like many of the photos. I added some as it looked way more up to date than many of the pictures others added. Perhaps this is the difference between an upgrade and a regular renovation. I am thinking that they have updated some but not all of the rooms and I got lucky with the upgrade.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with my stay and very thankful to Murray Hill East Suites for making a last minute trip to NYC stress free for me. I would definitely recommend it and stay there again.\n\nThings to be mindful of:\n-It is NYC...it will be loud. I feel asleep with the (HD) Television on to try to drown out the sound.\n-The provide shampoo, lotion and soap but no conditioner!\n-The hair dryer is very outdated. It had about the same power as a public bathroom hair dryer. I had wet hair for the whole day.","travelDate":"2014-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

New York is NOT a cheap place for accommodation so, for us, it was an expensive three nights but it could have been miles worse.  The location was excellent being walking distance to Central Station,UN building, Tudor City, Public Library etc.  There was also a supermarket nearby plus many other places to buy takeaway food.  On arrival I had specifically requested a toaster so, instead of giving us one, they upgraded us to a suite with separate bedroom and separate kitchen which we made the most of.  It was lovely to be able to spread out a bit.  We did have a bit of trouble lighting the gas stove but maintenance eventually came and sorted it out - and we found our missing cutlery and plates clean in the dishwasher!  The laundromat was very efficient - good dryer.  There were several public computers for free in a business room which was locked for some hours at night.  I found the pillows too high for what I am used to so put some towells in a pillowcase and used that instead.  If we ever return to New York I would definitely like to stay here again.","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Quite large, with a sofa \/ chair \/ sitting area, a small dining table, and of course the kitchen, which was stocked for actual cooking (pots\/pans\/knives, even a colander).

I was booked at Murray Hill.  My room was upgraded, so I am uncertain how other rooms are, but mine was great.  There is a living room-dining room and a bedroom bigger than many hotel rooms in New York.  The galley kitchen is as big as many apartment kitchens and fully equipped.  I really liked the fact that the kitchen is separated by a door from the rest of the suite.  I find many suites where everything is in one room which I do not care for.\n\nThere is  flat screen television in the bedroom and the living room.  The suite is nicely furnished and extraordinarily comfortable.  \n\nThe hotel is just three blocks from Grand Central Station, but it is on a quieter street with residences as well as commercial establishments.  One reviewer complained of the lack of restaurants, but a short walk of just a few blocks provides ample spots for eating.  And this is New York--a subway or a cab will quickly take you to a lifetime of restaurants.\n\nPublic areas are small, and the age of the hotel is visible.  I actually was given a metal key rather than a card (more like Europe) which was fine.  Service was great.  The desk staff was helpful, as was Paul who stored my bags while I was in town on business.\n\nIn short, Murray Hill was a present surprise and I would happily return.","travelDate":"2013-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Our 4th story room looked out on East 39th Street, which was noisy during the weekdays because of buses and trucks as well as construction nearby, and quite noisy at night during the weekend. Loud revelers coming and going to and from the club\/lounge next door all night kept us from getting a good night's sleep. \n\nThe room was very clean, and the bed linens quite acceptable, but the mattress on the bed was old, creaky and saggy. Definitely not good for my back. Word to the management: it is high time to replace this mattress. The towels, while clean, were very thin and also in need of replacement. WiFi was an extra $9 per day in the room. The TV was nice and had cable with many channels.\n\nThe small kitchenette was very useful for cooking up some breakfast. Perhaps a sharp kitchen knife to cut up fruits or vegetables should be added to the utensils.\n\nThe staff was very nice and responsive. When I requested a fan (the AC alone could not handle the high heat and humidity when we were there), it was delivered within minutes. The elderly doorman was very friendly and helpful, as was the younger one, although the 20-something doorman could take some pointers on friendliness from the other two. A simple smile of acknowledgment makes a huge difference to guests.\n\nPros: very clean, friendly staff, good location\nCons: saggy old mattress, noisy room","travelDate":"2013-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This was my 'first time stay' at Murray Hills and I would perhaps stay at my other choice of accommodation but it wasn't possible this trip.  We love NYC - her first long time stay here and my 10th or more stay in this great city!  In looks, our apartment was \"conservative to verging on  looking quite tired\" in appearance.  There was a small kitchen with a fridge, dishwasher, cook top and oven and tableware and a small array of cooking necessities + a coffee maker.  Check in\/out was efficient.  There are 2 lifts servicing the 14 floors + penthouse.  Staff were friendly and obliging.  We had a Junior Suite (room 903 which was clean and apart from NYC's usual police\/ambulance\/street sweepers-rubbish collectors noises, it was relatively quiet and our room overlooked E39th Street and a dry cleaners)  Bathroom was a combined bath\/shower and toilet facility.  2 TV's (1 in the queen bed bedroom and 1 in the sitting\/dining area)  There was a small round table + 3 chairs for dining and a pull-out bed\/sofa (typical sofa bed comfort here!) In the basement, was a DIY laundry with washers\/dryers (you could buy detergents but we bought our own as it worked out to be a cheaper alternative.  We had 5 weeks away from our homeland.) Surrounding our accommodation was an array of eateries\/cafes and a great little bottle shop staffed by some wonderful people!  D'Agostinos  Market is closeby (bought cereals and milk etc for breakfasts but expensive !)  but check out other locations for your specific food etc needs. Best find for our eating needs  was the Every Day Caf\u00e9 - a deli where you could purchase takeaway pre-made lunch and dinner selections at $7.99\/lb and there was fruit\/coffee\/sandwich bar here too.  Or, try Delmarco Caf\u00e9 (at 3rd and 41st Streets) where you can purchase premade food selection takeaways for 50% off (=$4.25\/lb)between 4-7pm.  The Grand Central subway station was on Broadway and 42nd streets which was only a couple of blocks walk away from Murray Hills Suites - we bought a USD$30 7day unlimited subway pass - great value.  (Take the S train to Times Square station) For us, the subway is the choice of transportation to get around this mighty city!   Look out for street signs in brown colour - these indicate it is an historical area.  We enjoyed our Wednesday Harlem Gospel Tour.  They practise on a Wednesday - the main service is on a Sunday, of course.  We used a 3 day pass on the Grayline for our various sight seeing needs.  (Also included was a brief harbour cruise)  I enjoyed lots of the wonderful museums again and also the Museum of the City of New York.  So much to see and do in NYC - your choice of adventures - after years of visiting, I still haven't seen it all nor have I got tired of the experiences.  Apologies for this long winded review!!  :-)  Can't wait to get back to NYC!!!","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

To me this sheds significant light upon the range of reviews for this hotel, but of concern is the fact that despite resolving the issue to some satisfaction, the cause of the issue in the first place leaves me suspicious of fairly underhand behaviour by this establishment.\n\nWe booked with hotels.com (which I've only ever used a couple of times before) and paid over a year in advance.  We were staying for 6 nights and wanted space \/ comfort so opted for the one bedroom option promising a king bed or two queens + a sofa bed and well furnished kitchen etc.  On arrival we were later than expected, tired, hungry and had tickets for the empire state, so we left our bags and went straight out.  Initial impressions of the room were somewhat disappointing, but on returning late that evening this feeling grew.  We checked our booking documentation and were dismayed to find that several of the features were not as promised - one queen bed (not two or a king, kitchen had no microwave or dishwasher etc).  So we raised this with the front desk who, after a brief chat with \"the management\" told us there had been a mistake, that they'd move us the next day (no rooms available sooner) and refund us $40 per night for having stayed in an inferior room.  There was no apology, no sign of surprise or concern - all very matter of fact leaving me with the distinct impression that they tried it on, on the basis that there were only 3 of us in a room that sleeps 4-6 and we hopefully wouldn't notice that we hadn't been given the room we'd booked.  The difference between the two rooms was huge -not just in terms of size and amenities, the second was far cleaner, better carpet, furniture etc.\n\nAll in all lovely doormen (as mentioned widely elsewhere) and at least one very nice room.  But also at least one room is not at all pleasant, there are questions over their approach and we found all of the front desk staff to be, at best, robotic and cold and at worst rude and disdainful. Key tip - be aware of the variety in room quality, check you've got what you were promised. \nKey advantage = size of rooms and location.  Perfect place to stay as a tourist - close to Grand Central, lots of good places to eat on the same block as the hotel, business centre two doors away etc.\n\nNB We were on second and fourth floor at the front, noise was not a problem either time.\nNB 2 A\/c is ancient - would hate to stay in here in very hot weather.","travelDate":"2013-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was like coming home - to spacious comfort but noting that a renovation is sorely needed! I have stayed there various times on trips to the United Nations NYC as I travel too frequently to stay in pokey NYC hotel rooms. The spaciousness, comfort and basic amenities were all there. I booked a studio room as I had family visiting for a couple of nights and friends on the weekend- all of which meant i needed more than a hotel room. I paid 248 USD per night plus 8.95 per night for wireless. I will definitely stay there again as teh location is superb! far away from the regular tourist madness of 42nd street - but a straight bus up to teh Upper East side for meetings, 2 blocks away from Grand central station and close to several excellent restaurants including the Oyster bar at Grand central and the Nam Pang Vietnamese Sandwich shop on 41st street. For shoppers - several good stores nearby plus beauty salons and Duane Reade which i used extensively all within 2 blocks. The Pod hotel next door has an excellent rooftop bar and great lounge restaurant for tapas and drinks. The rooms show real signs of wear though and have not been renovated in over a decade. I stayed in 609 which has tow single beds and both mattresses were worn from use and I had a bit of a back ache after a couple of nights. The linen, utensils, etc all could do with replacement. I had to tussle to get the gas on every morning to heat water for my tea. Housekeeping run by two Polish women is efficient and good. All in all i would go back again for space and convenience but not expecting luxury surroundings.","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Our usual hotel (The EastGate Tower) had closed down and was under renovation as luxury Condos.\n\nThe MHES was a block up from the Eastgate Tower and we had passed it many times on previous visits.\n\nCheck in was quick and easy and the room (1107) was already prepared.\n As with the Eastgate Tower, if you are looking for plush decor and furniture, this place is not for you.\n\nBut like me, if you was a fan of the Eastgate Tower for it'slocation, cost and simplicity, then MHES is like home from home.\n\nThere were a few niggly things but I won't detract from the experience by mentioning them as if you look under enough stones, you will definitely find a worm.\n\nMy two adult children occupied the two beds in the bedroom while my wife and I ended up with the pull out sofa bed.\n\nThe mattress was really thin and was so uncomfortable that I prefered to sleep in an armchair with my feet up on a chair.\n\nThe only thing that annoyed me was the cost of the wireless in the bedroom, $7.99 a day and $60 a month, nothing in between.\nAs we were staying 7 days, the month tariff was a no brainer.\n\nWireless was free in the Lobby but charging for wireless anywhere is a sure way to lose potential clients.\n\nOn the day of leaving, we secured a late check out for 3pm but as it was raining really heavily and we had done most things already, we extended this to 7pm for a price.\n\nReally great place in a great location in a great City.\n\nPS\nIf you ask the hotel to arrange a taxi, town car or Limo to (or from) JKF, ensure that you confirm the cost including tolls before you get onboard. \n\nOur driver tried to rip us off on the return to JFK, fortunately we had checked on what we would expect to pay at the hotel.\n\nNYC taxis are a flat $52 + tolls and optional tip to  and from JFK. You can ask for a route avoiding the toll and the drivers are happy to do this (at particular times) if you hint that it will be more tip for them.\n\nTown cars are typically $65 including tolls.","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I booked a studio and although I was told I had been upgraded, it was hard to see how the room I was given was an improvement on the basic studio.  The decor was tired and the carpet was stained, giving an overall impression of lack of cleanliness.  The amount of space is great, especially for NYC, and the room was quiet.  However the airconditioning was noisy and there did not appear to be a way to vary the temperature (which was pretty warm).  The kitchenette was barely adequate with no sign of the advertised microwave and dishwasher.  Just a sink, a stove, an oven that set off the smoke alarm when turned on, a coffee machine and a few odds and sods of crockery and cutlery. 1 large saucepan and 1 small frying pan.  Not enough to cook with, or even to heat food up.\nThe suites are still good value for NYC, the staff are good and there is free wifi in the lobby.

The location is very convenient--3 blocks from Grand Central Station-walking distance to 5th Ave and 34th street  shopping and the Empire State Building, with Times Square a little bit further away but walkable.  The staff-the front desk-Bellmen and maids were freindly and accomodating. Our room was on the 8th floor facing the back of the building which was quite at night.  Our room had a king bed, two tables with chairs-two night stands, a large dresser with a mirror, a loveseat\/couch, a small kitchen and two ample sized closets.  The furnature and fixures were older but maintained and our room was clean.  We had a 40inch flat screen tv mounted on the wall that had good reception and plenty of cable TV channels.  The shower hot water was a bit inconsistent-the water started out hot-cooled off and then got hot again-but really not a big deal.  There was no micowave in our room as seen in some of the hotel pictures, but we did not need it anyways.  The coffee machine worked fine. There is no pool, no business center with a computer, or no restaurant in the hotel.  The elevator was slow and at times a bit of a wait. The gym was small but had enough equipment for a quick weight lifting and cadio workout.  There are pubs, delis, pizza parlors, small grocery stores, Starbucks, Duncan donuts, a Dagostinos grocery store (NYC Chain) and restaurants of various types within a 2 to 3 block radius of the hotel. There is a good bagel store on Lexington around the corner from the hotel.\nPersonally, I don't see the need to spend a lot on an expensive NYC hotel with all the bells and whistles, if you are out most of the day seeing and doing things in the City. We were mostly in our room at night to sleep and during the day for short rest stops-so we did not need extra amenities or frills.

Manhattan is expensive, regardless of where you stay.... well, not exactly.  From tons and tons of research I find the Murray Hill East Suites.  Two double beds, a small love seat for watching TV and (ready for this?) a kitchenette! All for the low price of $111 a night plus tax!  As a disclaimer I must add... This pricing may not be typical and your results may vary. I am not an actor nor do I play one on TV. See dealer for details, this offer void where prohibited. Kayak and Orbitz had virtually the same price when searching, we booked with Orbitz. Calling the hotel directly will get you a price match from any advertised site at a worse case scenario. \n\n...but I digress.  The Murray Hill East Suites is by no means the Ritz.  It is an older building with character, built back in the days when it was taboo to have a 13th floor.  As a side note, there is a 14th floor and a Penthouse.  It is a clean hotel, the staff is awesome with careful attention to detail and the location in Midtown was perfect for my needs. The fitness room had modern equipment and I found the area to be more than adequate.  The maid did an excellent job of cleaning our room and was very friendly.  The doorman always greeted you with a smile and was there to hold the door open up until at least midnight.  The staff was very knowledgeable about the surrounding area and guided me to the absolute BEST clam chowder I have ever eaten within an easy 2 minute walk. \n\nThere are nicer places to stay especially if you have a larger budget that I was working with.

The location is excellent (5' from Grand Central, grocery store at the corner, supermarket one block away, plenty of restaurants\/pharmacies nearby) and still the street is not too noisy or crowdy. Having both a spacious desk to work, plus a table to eat, plus three big wardrobes made it possible to have all our stuff organized as if we were at home and not living out of a suitcases as you usually feel in a standard hotel room.

Being budget-conscious we booked this hotel on an online 'sight unseen' website, so there is a bit of lack of control in selecting the hotel. We reconciled the cost (over $250CAD per night) with the convenience of being mid-town. However, we were pleasantly surprised, given some older reviews. \n\nWe arrived via the Airtransporter from La Guardia and were dropped off at Grand Central Terminal, about a five minute walk from the hotel. Our first impression of the staff was favourable and lasting - we found them polite and helpful. As we arrived mid-morning we stowed our bags and headed into the town. On our return later we found ourselves in suite #102 on the first (ground) floor, which featured an enclosed outdoor patio. The suite was a large living room (sofa, two armchairs, dining table and chairs, wall-mounted flat screen TV), large bedroom (king bed, plenty of closet space, wall-mounted flat screen TV), bathroom and small, equipped kitchen.\n\nFirst of all, it was clean and warm. Decor is not 'modern', but not worn out either; our suite was fine, certainly for a few days in the city. It is roomy, so I think it would be comfortable for a longer stay. The kitchen was adequate - four settings of plates, cutlery, etc - and a dishwasher, fridge, microwave and gas stove. We only needed breakfast at the hotel (we came to see NYC, not the hotel!). However, apart from a kettle and a broil tray, I think it would be hard to 'cook' anything on the stove.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable (certainly had two thumbs up from my wife) and clean. There is a safe in a closet, but it was missing a lock of any sort. Fortunately this was not a problem for us, but if you wanted to secure your passports, cash, jewelry, etc it is a concern. We did not follow up with front desk as we didn't need it.\n\nLocation? Not bad at all, but be prepared to walk to mid-town attractions, or cab it. We found walking to be easy and interesting. Grand Central (5 minutes), Times Square (15 minutes), Macy's (15 minutes). Subway - north\/south Lines 4,5 and 6 - go to either 33rd and Lexington (7 minutes) or Grand Central (42nd and Lexington - 5 minutes).

The reception staff I spoke to were very helpful as were the doormen.\n\nImprovements? The room was a bit 'tired', especially the kitchen but nothing that was really off-putting, it just needed a bit of a facelift.  \nOne odd thing that didn't work was the safe which was missing its lock.\nHowever the big negative factor was the attitude of one of the hotel staff with whom I dealt by phone and email.  I made the booking 8 months ahead of our trip specifically because the hotel offered suites with 2 double beds and a sofa bed so my 2 teenage sons and I could each have our own beds.  When I telephoned the hotel a month before our arrival to check everything was in order I was surprised to be told they couldn't guarantee the room type as it depended on what was available on the day. I was stunned. This was 7 months after I'd made the reservation. It was too late to book anywhere else for a reasonable price.  Two weeks before arrival I emailed to remind them of our booking type and repeated the day before.  Fortunately we got the room type when we arrived, but the next day I was amazed to receive an email form the person I spoke to basically telling me it was only a request not a booking.  The tone was so contrary to good customer service I hope the vperson doesn't do that to everyone.  If that is representative of the hotel's attitude they won't stay in business much longer.

We had been scammed by a rental apartment 'owner' upon arriving in NCY and needed accommodation in a hurry (yes, all the forums are accurate about the rent scams in NYC, the scammers even exist on Tripadvisor as we found out.  Our scammer didn't provide the accommodation but kept AU$2368, we're still trying to get our money back and may never see it again and the woman continues to advertise another property on Tripadvisor, this time In Phoenix Arizona, so be careful!).  We also stayed in a couple of othe hotels in NYC, the Murray Hill East Suites studio apartment (Junior suite room 301) we stayed in was excellent and not much more per night than the original apartment we were scammed out of.  Staff were helpful, room was clean with pleny of natural light and very spacious by NY standards.  We had a kitchenette (don't expect to cook gourmet meals in there, but ample for preparing breakfast and snacks).  Strangely the kitchenette has a full size stove and oven but no microwave, although to be fair it would be hard to find room for one.  There is a small fridge and a coffee maker with tea\/coffee, sugar and creamer supplied.  A toaster turned up on about day 3, thank you to the housemaid staff.  Bathroom was sparkling clean.  Plenty of wardrobe space so we didn't have to live out of our suitcases.  Only complaint about the room was the bed wasn't the most comfortable and our 10 year old son slept on the sofa-bed which he complained was uncomfortable, but he survived.  I don't think it would have been tolerable for an adult to sleep on it.  No ubiquitous NY bed bugs either, so that was a bonus.  Free wi-fi in the lobby only, with paid wi-fi in rooms.  Plenty of places to eat nearby, also a Bodega on the corner for supplies.  Nearest subway just a couple of blocks away at Grand Central Station so very easy to get around.  We would stay there again.","travelDate":"2012-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room itself was OK - it was straight out of the 80's in decor and the furniture was a bit worn around the edges, but it seemed clean.

She lives in Arizona and I live in Ireland so we decided to look online. We wanted to find studio suite-type accommodation where there would be a kitchen, thereby enabling us to save money by cooking someof our own meals, have breakfast each day etc. We spent a long time trying to find somewhere suitable that was available because a lotof accommodation was already booked up or way too expensive. Eventually my girlfriend found theMurray Hill East Suites on booking.com. The online booking process was straightforward. We both arrived into Newark and took a yellow taxi from the airport. The $88 fare was, we thought, very expensive mostly because the price is never the price in the US. Extras always seem to get added on (e.g. in this case for tolls, baggage etc). Then the driver expects a 10% tip on top. We discovered that it is much better to use the airport buses which are located at Park Avenue\/Grand Central Station (for JFK and La Guardia) and at 41st Street\/Lexington (for Newark). When we were leaving Manhattan, the bus only cost $16 per person in total. Anyway, on 12th April we arrived into the hotel and were happy enough with the reception\/checking in process. The lobby itself is quite spacious with some sofas and lounge chairs. Our room was on the 5th floor overlooking 39th Street. The accommodation consistedof one large-ish living\/dining\/bed room measuring about 24\u2019 x 16\u2019. There was a large double bed and a dining table, two chairs, two-seater sofa, flat screen TV, writing desk and chair and a chestof drawers. Overall, the decor in this room was very dated, dull and drab and we felt it seriously needed a make-over. Also, we did not really like the nylon bed sheets \u2013 cotton would have been so much more comfortable. One good thing was that the room didn\u2019t smellof stale smoke (which a lotof hotel rooms do). Also, the room got very hot and we were taken aback to discover that, although there was an AC unit in the room, the hotel do not switch the system on until May. While we were in Manhattan the temperature was high 70s and into the 80s so this was quite a problem. After a few days, we asked for a plug-in fan which was supplied with no problem.Off the main room there was a very small kitchen equipped with sink unit, cupboards, fridge and gas cooker. The facilities were adequate, although there was a shortageof pots and pans and no microwave. Also, there was no toaster but, again, one was supplied once we asked. Opposite the kitchen, there was a small bathroom which included a bath with shower and shower curtain. There was always an ample supplyof hot water in the bathroom and kitchen. The room was cleaned once a day and the maid (Wendy) was friendly, hard-working and obliging. The suite was kept clean and the bed linen and towels were replaced each day. Free Wi-Fi was available in the lobby or, for payment in the room, if preferred......we just used the lobby. The accommodation is very conveniently located in termsof the supermarket (D\u2019Agostino\u2019s) just round the corner and to Grand Central Station (for subway) which is only a five minute walk. There is also a very good Japanese Restaurant opposite the supermarket (Hiroshi Sushi) and an inexpensive (but lovely food) Cuban Restaurant called Sophie\u2019s at 369 Lexington Avenue, just a block or two away. There are also excellent shops in the adjacent Lexington and Park Avenues. During our stay, we found the staff friendly and helpful, especially the porters\/door-men who were always keen to exchange a few words. Overall, in summary, although we have no big complaints about theMurray Hill East Suites, we felt that the costof the accommodation (around $200 per night) was a little expensive for what it is but, unfortunately, it was the best we could find at the time.","travelDate":"2012-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I would heartily recommend Murray Hill East Suites to any visitor to New York.","travelDate":"2012-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My suite was spacious, with a full kitchen including stove, microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher, dishes, utensils, pots and pans and coffee maker.  There was a table and two chairs for eating, plus a sofa tucked in a corner.  The bathroom was well appointed and everything was in working order.  To my knowledge, there was no individual control over the room's temperature but it didn't present much of a problem as it was mostly a comfortable temperature.  The king sized bed and pillows were moderately comfortable. The internet service, which I ordered from my room, was dodgy and I didn't have time for a technician to come up to sort it out, so I never did get it.  The hotel is definitely older and could use a sprucing up, but it was clean.  I walked everywhere I went, the location was so convenient, so I saved money on transportation as well as eating breakfast and lunch in the suite.  I felt it was a bit pricey, however--for this money I could have stayed at the 4-star Carlton, or my usual favorite, the Affinia Shelburne, also in the area and more luxurious.  This might be a good choice for travel with children given the extra space and the ability to prepare meals.","travelDate":"2012-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

No, it's not a luxury residence, nor is it 'big on service'. It's functional and it's inexpensive, so for the purposes of acting as a 2-day base for shopping and dining out, it was absolutely ideal.\n\nI booked on Hotwire (3* Times Square Area). The location & descriptions were typically slightly embellished, but genuinely I think it met, rather than exceeded or missed my expectations. Costs to me as follows, bearing in mind it was for 31st December and 01 January:\n\nRate per night: $234.00 \/ Nights: 2 \/ Rooms: \t1 \/ Taxes: $45.96 \/ Occupancy tax: $32.44 \/ Fees: $15.88 \/ Subtotal: \t$562.27 \/ Trip total: $562.27\n\nI haven't posted photos because the ones published are all pretty accurate and if you remove the emotional descriptions (both good and bad), then the images pretty much speak for themselves. We didn't have peeling paint around the room, nor did we feel it was unclean inside. It was just very basic and outdated. As I say, for our purposes, that really didn't matter. Had we planned on staying in NYC for longer than 2 days, or intended using the room as anything more than somewhere to store our belongings and to sleep, then probably we'd have picked something more than a 3* anyway. Not everyone has the luxury of being able to do so (and yes, we know we're fortunate in that regard), so to try to remain objective about Murray Hill East I'd say it was absolutely fine. Not great, not terrible - 'fit for purpose', if your purpose is in line with ours.\n\nFor reference, we were given a street-facing room. Not ideal on NYE, especially because the only way to reduce the temperature was to open the window, but compared to the Waldorf Astoria 10 days later (reviewed separately if you're interested in that one), it was not something which bothered us unduly.\n\nFor any date other than NYE and NYD, I would be miffed at paying these prices for this level of accommodation, but we know NYC hotels well enough and neither the Hilton, Hyatt, W nor Waldorf would have merited the >$450\/night + taxes they were demanding (for our purposes on this occasion), at this time of the year.\n\nHope that helps?","travelDate":"2011-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Overall we were very comfortable and enjoyed the excellent location despite the feeling upon entering the hotel that we had just stepped into the 1970's.\n\nPros: The rooms were large, the staff was helpful, though not more than that.  We stayed on the 8th floor facing away from the street and didn't have any problems with noise.  The bed was comfortable and we didn't see any bedbugs -- sometimes a problem in New York City.  The room had ample closet space, a small safe, a plasma TV (though only a few channels), a phone, and a small kitchen with a sink, oven and stovetop, and refrigerator.  An iron and ironing board were also provided.  We used the free wireless internet in the lobby which worked OK rather than paying for internet in the room (about $8\/day).  The room had a table with a couple of chairs for meals and a small area with larger chairs in which we were able to receive guests.\n\nThe location is great!  About 7 minutes walk from Grand Central Station.  For those of you who don't know New York City, this means that it is easy to get to most attractions by subway.  The hotel within walking distance of the Empire State Building and of a string of Indian restaurants on Lexington avenue near 28th Street.  The kosher delicatessen 2nd Avenue Deli is only a few blocks away and very tasty.  Also, there are reasonably priced buses from Grand Central to La Guardia and JFK airports.\n\nCons: Except for the plasma TV, everything in the hotel seemed very old including the phone, the elevators and the decor.  Stylistic issues aside, this only presented us with minor problems twice:  At one point the elevators weren't working properly.  This only inconvenienced us for a few minutes.  Also, the lock on the safe (which is not big enough for a laptop computer) was mechanical rather than electronic.  We needed to go down to the front desk to request a lock and key to close the safe.  The hotel does not provide meals -- not even breakfast, though there are ample restaurants, supermarkets, and convenience stores withing close walking distance.\n\nTwo other problems -- as in many New York buildings, the room was too hot.  We had to leave the window open nearly all the time.  Also, the entrance is a few stairs down from street level with no ramp.  It was a bit hard managing our suitcases and I imagine anyone needing a wheelchair would find the hotel inconvenient.\n\nWe paid $130\/night before taxes (about $25\/night).  This included a $20 discount for being AAA members (American Automobile Association).  I called the hotel directly and got a slightly better rate than what I saw offered on line.\n\nOverall, this was certainly not a luxury hotel, but we were quite comfortable and would stay there again if we return to NYC.","travelDate":"2011-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93489,"title":"This is not an amazing hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2011-08-08","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Ok, there are some great things about this hotel.  The biggest one being location.\n\nThe hotel is a five minute walk to Grand Central Station.  For first time visitors - it's a great place to get shuttles to any airport and it's a central hub for NYC's subway.  It's a fifteen minute walk to 5th avenue, Time's Square and The Empire State Building.  As mentioned before there is a kitchen in the rooms and you can buy food at Grand Central's market and cook it - which we did - and at the convenience store by the hotel.\n\nThe other good thing about the hotel is the cleanliness - the staff are attentive and do an excellent and fast job of cleaning the rooms.  \n\nThe last good thing is the price.  Most Manhattan hotels are far more expensive than where we stayed.  It was good to have a \"suite\" in Manhattan for less than $200 per night.  The fact that a kitchen is in the room can be a major price saver as you can make your own meals instead of going to Manhattan's expensive restaurants.  \n\nThe worst is to come.  For a three star hotel everything in the room is dated.  The carpet, floor and wall tile, fixtures, kitchen equipment, washroom and everything else is very dated.  It's like a trip back in time.  It wouldn't be bad but it feels unclean in the back of your mind.  Also many other 3 stars I've been in had better more modern fixtures in the kitchens and bathrooms.  This was not the case in our room.\n\nAlso and I don't know if this is the case in most NYC hotels but here goes.  Again for a three star I expect a few more amenities.  This hotel had no pool, no washing machines, no vending \/ ice machines - they expect you to fill an ice tray in your own room's tiny fridge, no pay per view movie channels - NYC is fun but sometimes it's good to kick up your feet and watch a movie and relax, the best WIFI is in the hotel's lobby where I often saw many people on their laptops and no restaurant.  There's a flat screen tv in the room with numerous channels and a fitness room.  So most of the comforts of hotels are not at this hotel.  \n\nThe bathroom was the worst part for me.  The kitchen is bigger than the bathroom!  Forget about two people using the sink at the same time - if you can get two people to fit in that bathroom at the same time.  And watch your feet as you walk in.  For some strange reason the floor tile in the bathroom is higher than the carpet just at the outside of the bathroom.  \n\nI would stay again for the location but if I could find something else at a similar price and similar location but had some more hotel comforts - then I would choose there.  That would include paying a little extra.","travelDate":"2011-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We made it clear what kind of room we booked and made it perfectly clear what time we were checking-in (late) - and we arrived EXACTLY on time. We immediately requested they find us another room, and although they insisted they had no other available room, mysteriously moved us to another room that didn't smell (what happened to being fully booked and NO other rooms available??) The next day we were moved to a 3rd room that had 1 king bed instead of two smaller beds. We consider giving our reserved room to someone else and this deception about being fully booked to be totally unacceptable. This is not professional.\n\nI don't know what were the type of rooms we were moved to, but the first two were much larger than the final room where we stayed - the final room had the larger bed. With hindsight I wish we had kept the 2nd room as it had separate living room and bedroom, and was more comfortable (although there were 2 small beds instead of one large). The kitchenette in most (or all) rooms is a great feature, and even the smaller rooms are big-ish sized for NYC. However, the bathroom in the last room was small and VERY tight.\n\nReception staff are typical New Yorkers - curt and unfriendly - compared to say Australia or England. The FREE internet in the lobby was most welcome, and the in-room internet rates were reasonable. We stayed on the back side which was MUCH quieter, and we occasionally were able to connect to a nearby open wireless network, saving us a trip to the lobby for the free internet.\n\nI guess overall it was not bad and not great - just average.

We cannot find fault at all, the suite was extremly spacious, beds brilliant etc - we were on the 14th floor. The only thing I would say is if you dont smoke make sure you ask for a non smoking room ours did have a faint wiff of cigarette smoke.\n\nThe hotel is well situated for all the main attractions of New York. Times Square 15mins walk, Central park 30mins walk, Grand central station 10min walk.\n\nIf you have not arranged transport to your accomodation, dont worry, I would recommend you get on one of the airport shuttles. We landed at Newark and it was $17 each to Manhatten, you can get a return for around $27 each. It does take longer as there are other passengers ( the shuttle takes about 12 passengers). But its alot cheaper than a taxi. You also get to see a lot of New york depending upon where they are dropping off. Taxis - we were told - charge extra for lugage and tolls.\n\nBe prepared for the cost of eating out. It is not cheap experience,it is just as expensive to buy and cook yourself. However, I can recommend the following:\n\nSiniqual, 640 Third avenue (on the corner of41st and 3rd avenue) - its just around the corner from the hotel and decribes itself as comtemporary mexican  cusine\n.\nSea, 114 north 6 st Brooklyn, a thai resturant reasonably priced. the one we visited was where a scene from 'sex and the City' was filmed.

We were surpised when arriving that it does resemble a hotel with a 24 hour reception and concierge service. The accommodation was busy with travelers from a few different countries. It was the week of the New York marathon which might have been a factor but we got the impression that this was normal.\n\nIt is clear that this had previously been an apartment block and the accommodation comprised of a large lounge area with bed settee, bedroom with two queen sized beds, kitchen and bathroom. There was a problem with the heating in the room when we first arrived. We were told it  was in fact a problem in the whole building and could not be fixed till the following day. The reception provided a heater within a few minutes which we were able to keep for the duration of our stay.\n\nThe accommdation is clean and comfortable without being luxurious. It is a bit dated but this is something that we've found in New York in general on previous visits.\n\nThe building has a couple of good quality diners within a minutes walk (try Scotties for good value). There are some local bars in the area which are ok for a quick visit. \n\nIf you choose not to walk too far, Manhattan is best navigated by the Subway system. Grand Central is the nearest subway station (about a 5\/10 minute walk) with Times Square a further 10 minute walk. This isn't a huge problem but it can be a bit tiring after a day sightseeing or shopping.\n\nAt $235.00 a night (plus tax) it is in the same price range as some hotels but you do certainly get more for your money than just a simple room.\n\nI would certainly recommend the Murray Hill Suites especially to families or groups of people.","travelDate":"2010-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Essentially, it was larger than a typical studio apartment in NYC. The hotel or apartotel is located 3 blocks from Grand Central Station on a quiet street. However, there are places to eat on the main street Lexington, convenience store close by, and the W Hotel Bar is on the same street. There was nothing spectacular about the lobby since it is what you would expect for a high rise apartments. We didn't get any rude staff and was satisfied with their service. Beware regarding the elevator since it is small, but the room makes up for it in space.\n\nWhile the Milford Plaza takes you back to the 70's, the Murray Hill East Suites takes ou back to the 80's. At first glance it feels like a high rise retirement home with it's floral decor and convalescent furniture. However, there is much space in the room and was suprisingly clean. The room we stayed at had 2 full size bed and a sleeper sofa. The kitchen was added bonus, which included a full size fridge, cookware, and dishes. The whole motif is very 1980's, but made you feel like a part of a sitcom. If the owner of this building ever decide to go moderne\/minimal or just change the floral textiles, the hotel would have an amazing potential.

For non US citizens the next information is quiet important. When we arrived we had to immediately pay the room. All the debit cards that we had didn\u2019t work although we later used then to pay for things in supermarkets and stores without problems, as long as there was a system were one could introduce the pin of the card. So if you do not have a credit card (which was your case), take the money to pay for the hotel with you. We had to go down the street to withdraw money to pay for the hotel, and if we had known we would have brought it from home (because it is cheaper and there is a limit to the amount of money you can withdraw, at least in Portugal, and we could only pay for the whole thing in money because there were two of us with to different cards to withdraw money).\nWhen we got there we were told that our room had been upgrade. We had booked the cheapest room for two people and I\u2019m not really sure what we were given because the bed was only a double bed. The room was huge and with everything one might need. The kitchenette had cutlery, plates, cups, frying pan, a cutting board\u2026 basically everything you need to cook. The cleaning of the room in the morning included the washing of the dishes which was very nice. The room was fairly clean without any major thing to report. We stayed in the 8th floor and the room was very quiet and we almost couldn\u2019t hear any outside noise. The air conditioner seemed to work fine but we didn\u2019t turn it on because the room was always cool even thought it was extremely hot outside. \nFor me, the only problem in the room was the mattress. Incredibly soft and bumpy. Not very comfortable.\nThe location of the hotel was great. We were just 5-10 min away from the grand central station and from there we could take the subway to anywhere in the city. Near the hotel there is a supermarket with everything you need as well as some bars. To go out at night it was not the best place, but again the subway is just 10 min away.\nOverall, we were very happy with the hotel that we chose to stay in New York and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is going to this city on a low budget and that doesn\u2019t want\/need a fancy hotel.","travelDate":"2009-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Not bad for a 5 night stay.  The room was huge compared to rooms I've had before.  Stayed at the Renaissance and Hotel Sofitel in New York, where the rooms where have the size and double and triple the prices, respectively.  I wanted to go cheap so that I could spend on sight seeing, shopping, and eating.  There's a recession this year, and I don't want to further myself into debt!\n\nWhat I didn't like about the rooms were that the carpet, couches, and bedspread were very dated and dark.  The darker the better to hide the grime, I suppose.  However, with a one year old and returning to the hotel after all the walking, we were too tired to care about the cleanliness factor.  The great thing is that there is a kitchen, but no dish detergent.  I had brought my own dish scrubbing pads to wash my baby's bottles and spoons, but I was annoyed that there was no Palmolive in sight.  There was also no microwave.  We never used the stove to cook, but there are pots and pans.  I really needed the fridge for the baby's milk.  \n\nThe bathroom was kept clean.  However, my husband noticed that when he ripped open a sugar packet, that the maid did not throw it away, but rather put it back with the other sugar packets.  So she wasn't that attentive.  \n\nThe locale is great because it is 5 minutes from Grand Central station, where we hopped the Subway.  We even walked in the rain from Times Square to the hotel and from the hotel to MoMA, about 20-30 minutes because we were tired of using the Subway.  So a few spots are a comfortable distance to the hotel.  There was also a CVS that I would send my husband to for Bengay for my aching knees or diapers a couple of blocks away.  Great Cuban eatery close by at $20 for 2 people.  \n\nThe best thing about this hotel was the location.  It wasn't a romantic or glamorous spot, but good for families with children or singles with friends who need a cheap place in the middle of the city to stay.  Very good value for the price.","travelDate":"2009-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We couldn't believe it -- an oven, in our hotel room! We're budget travelers, and we were blown away by how huge and well-appointed it was. Even the door keys were real metal keys.

Housekeeping also kept our room nice and clean, with plenty of fresh towels.  We didn't get to use the free gym or laundry room, but they\u2019re there.\n\nThe Murray Hill neighborhood is delightful; low-key but cheerfully lively, with restaurants to fit every budget, and lots of fun shops.

Totally not a problem for us.\n\nOnly one thing wasn't perfect; the rooms don't have wifi. This wouldn't be a problem for many travelers, but geeks like us need our connectivity, as do most business travelers. Wifi in the lobby wasn't really a solution. We jerry-rigged wired laptop connectivity in our room through my partner's PDA, but not everybody is able to do that.

I'd booked the room through Hotwire, so I didn't know I would be staying here until I had actually committed to pay the rate they'd quoted. ($79 plus tax, which came to $104 total. They also require a $20 credit card deposit at check-in)\n\nI checked in around 9pm and was greeted by a very friendly staff member, who actually gave us a free upgrade to a 1-bedroom suite (room 807). The room had one bedroom with two double beds, a living room with a pull-out couch, a table big enough to eat dinner at, and a full kitchen. The room was clean and smelled fresh, the beds were comfortable, and everyone who worked there was incredibly friendly. I asked the front desk staff for a couple of favors (mainly holding things of mine behind the desk while I was out on the town) and they were always cheerful and accommodating (I just wish I caught their names so I could give them a shout-out here!) The elevators are indeed a bit dated\/slow, but they worked perfectly well while we were there. It's also true that the walls are rather thin, but in our case we were coming back to the hotel pretty late at night anyway so that wasn't an issue. \n\nAs for location, this one is pretty outstanding. It's three blocks (about a six-minute walk, depending on the crosswalk lights) to Grand Central Station, and is also very convenient to the Empire State Building, Macy's and Fifth Avenue. If you like exploring cities on foot, this is an ideal spot to start from. We spent the last part of our night down in the East Village (St. Mark's area) and it was about a $9 cab fare (tip included) to get back home at the end of the night.\n\nSo overall, I can't say enough good things about this place. I will definitely be staying here again the next time I am in New York.","travelDate":"2009-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We found the hotel to be clean and tidy and the staff helpful and friendly (maybe some reviewers on here don't get the New York way that a lot of people there have!!!). I asked for a room high up to avoid traffic noise and to get a bit of a view and the desk lady gave us room 810 which was the highest free room she had available. There were 2 lifts, both working, clean and with enough space for 4 people and bags to get up and down easily. Our room was huge, one big double bed, a kitchenette and a medium en suite with fresh towels and toiletries provided. We also had a sofa, table and chairs and a tv. Ok so the tv was an old style one like some reviewers have mentioned however there was nothing wrong with the reception. I think if you go to New York and end up watching loads of tv then you are very sad indeed as there is so much to see and do in the city. Also it's even worse than watching it in the UK because there are adverts every 5 minutes or less!!!! Our room was cleaned every day too with fresh towels. The location of the hotel was perfect, Grand Central Station is 3 blocks away and the Murray Hill area has lots of very good local amenities. We walked to most sites as the weather was great and if you are relatively fit you won't find it a struggle (just have a couple of blisters on my feet now though). We both think that if you get cabs or trains everywhere you will miss a lot of the sites and sounds of everyday New York life which is part of the whole experience. If you want a well priced hotel that is clean well located with friendly staff then you can't do any better than this one. I will try and add some photos when i get time.","travelDate":"2008-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We flipped each other for who would have to try to sleep on that thing.  The double beds in the bedroom were acceptable but not so great, either -- with saggy mattresses that definitely needed to be replaced.  The kitchenette hadn't been cleaned well; the microwave was dirty inside; we hadn't been given a full set of towels; the TV remotes didn't work and the TV was left unplugged (we had to hunt for the outlet to plug it back in).  Also, we were told the hotel had Wifi but they forgot to mention that the Wifi works only while you're in the lobby.  A few good things: the hotel is very centrally located, easy to walk to lots of places, it's relatively quiet, and we thought the staff seemed nice .... if a bit overworked.  But it's not a great bargain hotel when the beds are so old and saggy that no one can get a good night's sleep!

Our first time in New York staying for a week and we wanted to stay in a central location to all the sites. A family consisting of myself, my wife and two teen aged daughters who want their own space and do not want to share a room with their parents. As you may of discovered, New York is expensive if you want to stay in a hotel room but double it and it loses its appeal somewhat. The answer is Murray Hill East Suites. \nThey are not the finished item to be honest but they offer the kind of accommodation rarely found that is suitable for families. The rooms\/apartments are large and there was plenty of space for the 4 of us with the kids in their own room and my wife and I in the lounge sleeping on a very comfortable bed settee. Yes the room decor is dated but the rooms are very clean with maid service every day. The kitchen looked as if it was made by a school kid trying out his dads carpentry tools for the first time and needs renewing completely but it was functional with all the items you will need but you will probably not need them as the restaurants near by are ace.\nWe only had a few gripes with the place and that was when we arrived we were given a room on the ground floor overlooking the road and next to the lobby, this was the noisiest room I have stayed in and complained immediately but was told by the obnoxious youngish male receptionist that there was no other rooms available but to check the next day to see if one was. Luckily after another encounter with the receptionist the next day we were able to move to the 6th floor to a room facing the back of the hotel, this was perfect and the helpful doorman moved our bags for us as we were out on the town at the time. A word of warning if you are given a ground floor room only accept it if you like to hear every one entering the hotel and all the traffic on the street. \nLastly Murray Hill please do something about the doors to the rooms as they don't fit well and slam every time they are used. Very annoying when trying to sleep.\nOver all the hotel was a very good bolt hole and apart from the minor problems, I would recommend a stay at the Murray Hill Suites, they just need to train their staff in customer service a bit more!!","travelDate":"2008-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was going to New York for a workshop, and needed a centrally located hotel.  I am a woman traveling alone, and a room that was clean, comfortable, and in a safe location was of the utmost importance to me.  I booked the room through Hotwire, so I didn't know exactly which hotel I was staying at until I hit \"buy\".\nI have to say I was pleasantly suprised by the Murray Hill Suites.  Prices for hotels in NYC are outragous,  and Murray Hill Suites were a bargain for only $165 a night.\nThe room was huge for NYC standards.  It had a ton of closet space, and the little kitchenette was perfect for storing snacks and drinks in the fridge.  I did not use the stove, but I thought how nice that would be if I wanted to heat up water for tea or leftovers.\nThe room was so clean.  I looked for the dreaded hotel bedbugs, and found only pristine sheets. So it is not an uber trendy boutique hotel, with modern furnishings.  The bed was quite comfortable, and the air conditioning worked great.  I was met every evening with a clean, cool room.\nThe staff was quite friendly and knowledgable.  If you are looking for a decent room, in a good location, for a reasonable price in New York City, don't hesitate to book here.","travelDate":"2008-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Certainly the street the hotel is on is quiet., unlike the noise that hotel residents on Times Square face.\n\nAround the corner  to the hotel are some lovely delis, a small supermarket and  Murphys bar  which does delicious  meals.  Various restaurants and bars are within walking distance.\nThe hotel is also situated in a very good location for tourists.  It is in the residential district of Murray Hill but is within walking distance of Grand Central Station.  You could see the Empire State building from my room.  Also Times Square and Broadway are within walking distance, although those that are unable to walk far can easily get around by the extremely good bus system.  \n\nPick up the MTA Manhattan Bus Map.  I travelled alll over Manhattan by bus using a weekly MTA card costing $25 for unlimited use.  You can get these in any subway station.  It is a great way to see everything especially if time is short.   Taxis are also relatively cheap.   \n\nI would recommed a Circle Line boat trip to take in the Statue of Liberty and to see Manattan from the river, a helcopter trip and also going to the top of the Rockefellar Centre, which gives a great perspective of the whole of Manhattan.\n\nOne warning  - give the so called \"psychics\" a wide berth!!!!

It was a \"plus-minus\" experience. \n\nWe booked through Priceline, and paid $110 a night, which is a spectacular price for a Manhattan room. The room was very large for a Manhattan hotel booking, and it even had a small kitchen. The room was very dated (I hope you like faded green paisley, circa 1983), but we don't mind that much. Also, the TV situation was pretty funny -- it was a huge, clunky TV on a rolling stand that could be moved around the room. Once again, for $110 a night, what do you expect?\n\nThe hotel was definitely a no-frills experience. The largest problem is that the walls were extraordinarily thin, and we could hear every peep made in the rooms around us. Including the screaming and laughing of several rooms of young women who had come to New York to party, and would stay out until 4 or 5 a.m. each night. The last night I called the front desk to complain, and the man at the front desk was decidedly unhelpful. \n\nAlso, we noticed that they never changed our bed sheets -- they just made the bed. They did replace the towels every day.\n\nWe stayed on the second floor, which had its advantages and disadvantages. We had a lot of street noise (typical of New York -- I lived there for several years and it's just something you have to get used to) and there were neon lights in the windows across the street which gave our room an electric pink glow when the shades were open. When the shades were closed, the light was not a problem.\n\nThe benefit to the second floor, however, is this hotel does not have internet access, except wireless in the lobby. Since we were directly above the lobby, we did have a strong wireless signal in our room.\n\nFinally, my husband used the gym and said it was nice -- comparable with a 3 or 4 star hotel mini-gym.

We were staying in NYC the same weekend as the NYC marathon, so hotel rooms were at a premium.  This hotel offered a comfortable, extremely spacious room with lots of storage, and kitchenette for much less than others.  I couldn't get over the size of the studio room.  It was twice the size and half the cost of what we would have paid closer to Times Square.  \n\nBeing so close to Grand Central Station was a bonus, as it was an easy 5-minute walk away.  We walked to the Empire State Building (about 10-15 minutes) as well as to the theater district for shows (about 20-30 minutes, depending on location in district).  If we didn't feel like walking, it was about a $10 cab ride or $2 per person subway ride to anywhere.  \n\nThe neighborhood was very residential, and we had breakfast one morning at Bloom's Deli (corner of E 40th & Lexington), which had enormous, flavorful portions in a mom & pop setting.  Be sure to grab a slice of cheesecake at Junior's (originally in Brooklyn, they now have a storefront in Grand Central Station as well as a diner on Shubert Alley in the Theater District) too.\n\nThe only drawback was that you could hear traffic at all hours, but it kind of added to the experience of being in New York City.  Our room overlooked the street, so I wonder if being in a room that overlooked the alley would have been quieter.  The room decor is a bit 1990's, but it's spotless and in good condition.

This hotel was a 1950s\/1960s apartment building that has been converted, and I'm not sure it's ever really upgraded.  My room was on the 14th floor, and was quite big...a one-bedroom apartment.

I'm a business traveler and it is a key element for me.  The hotel's laissez-faire attitude clearly said that I'm not a target customer for them (\"when will you have it?\" \"oh, maybe in a year or so.\").  The signals that others have reported receiving, even in the lobby, were simply not available for me, nor were they available for two other laptop users in the lobby at the same time.  Now, the nearest WiFi-enabled Starbucks was a block away, so I made do.

I and my 20-year-old son stayed here for a weekend. First, it is quiet, a rare attribute in New York. No traffic, no loud bars near-by, no dumpsters emptied at 4 a.m. Area is relatively quiet but only three blocks from Grand Central Station so subways to anywhere are only 10 minutes away. The hotel is a half-block from 3rd Avenue where cabs are plentiful. The theater district is a 10-minute walk to Grand Central and 10 minutes on the subway shuttle. The rooms are fairly large for New York with a small refrierator, sink and stove which we never used. Maid service was excellent and the front desk was helpful. One small piece of advice; do not ask them to call a cab for you for an airport trip the night before you need to leave. Hotels cannot call cabs so they called a car service for us. The fee was $50 to LaGuardia instead of the $24 cab ride. Not really a big deal. This is not a resort hotel so if you have five little kids looking for a pool and a game room, this is not for you.

For those unfamiliar with Priceline you choose the area in which you would like to stay with its star rating (I chose 2 star, but got a 3 star so you can luck out that way), and they tell you pretty much right away whether your offer is accepted.  The hotel name stays anonymous until you put in an offer and it is accepted.\n\nI managed to get a whole one bedroom suite (looks like renovated condo) that came with a living room, large one bedroom with king size bed, a small bathroom, and a kitchen.  I got all this for an extremely reasonable rate (it would have cost the same for a hostel in downtown manhatten!).  \n\nI was travelling with my fiancee and we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel near all the attractions of NYC since it was our first time.  This hotel is on 39th street, and Grand Central station is ony 42nd so it's pretty close, but not as close as some of the reviews made it sound.  It is about a 5-6 minute walk, and it can be a long one in the 30 degree celcius heat.  Nevertheless it's not a bad location.\n\nThe kitchen was small so we didn't end up using it except for the full size freezer\/fridge (great for keeping your drinks\/leftovers cold).  The only suggestion have for ths hotel is to put in microwaves.  \n\nI was impressed by how clean our suite was, and by how large the bedroom and living room were.  The tv (although tiny) was good at the end of the day of walking and walking, and there were many channels to choose from.\n\nThe bed was huge, and the airconditioning in both the living room and bedroom was nice.  The maid did an amazing job with housekeeping every day, making sure the bathroom linens were well supplied and the such.\n\nThe concierge downstairs was neither rude nor over hospitable--so if you needed anything it was there but they don't bother you much.  \n\nThe hotel did not seem at full capacity which means it was really quiet.  The hallways did smell like rancid smoke at times, but our suite was fine.  The elevators are old, but I think most buildings would be old like that in manhatten, unless you plan on shelling the bucks for something fancier and much more expensive.\n\nOverall I would say choose this hotel if you are budget minded, and need\/want a lot of room, and a place to stay close to everything.  We took the subway everywhere, and you can even walk to the Empire State building from the hotel.  It's not fancy, but it's good value for your dollar.  \n\nMy total trip (hotel & air from Vancouver) was $1000 CAD and that is a real bargain for such an expensive city.\n\nTips:\n1) Buy the new york pass.  You can buy it there (planet hollywood in times square) or online at newyorkpass.com.  Well worth the money and helps you plan your itinerary.  You get $10 credit each day of the pass at Planet Hollywood which I used for souvenirs.\nThe New York pass also allows you to skip ticket lines, like at the busy Empire State Building.\n\n2) Buy an unlimited metropass--it's indispensable and way cheaper than taking a cab in this traffic congested city.  You can buy these at the machines there.\n\n3) Credit cards are accepted everywhere! I hardly ever had to fork out cash. Very convenient.\n\n4) Some must see things (all free w\/ the New York pass):\nRadio Music City Hall Tour\nMadisson Square Gardens Tour\nDO NOT DO THE ROCKEFELLER TOUR unless you want to just look at the art on the buildings for an hour \nNBC Studio tour (go early to reserve your spot--this fills up fast, we had to go the next day)\nCircle Line Boat Cruise (we upgraded to the 3 hour for $4 more--nice on a hot day and good to do in the beginning for a good overview of the city).\n\n5) To get to the hotel from JFK airport we opted for the subway instead of a $45+ cab ride (flat rate plus tips\/tolls).   It is $5 for the airport airtrain to the subway and $2 for the subway (or you can buy the weeklong unlimited pass for $24\/week).  There are also shuttles you can take like airlink and supershuttle.  We used airlink ($20 USD) one way to JFK from the hotel and had a HORRIBLE experience.  They billed our credit card, and the driver asked us to pay again in cash!  After a LONG discussion we finally got our cash back and was not a nice way to end our trip.\n\nYou can prebook Supershuttle online at their website and they give you a discount.\n\nIf you found this review helpful please let me know!

I've previously stayed at the Eastgate Tower, across the street and a block east of here, and had a pretty good idea what to expect from this converted apartment building. In fact, the Murray Hill East Suites was nearly identical physically to the Eastgate Tower -- my room was a mirror image of the one I had at the Eastgate Tower a few months before. My general perception was that the furniture\/drapes\/carpets at the Murray Hill East seemed every so slightly newer\/cleaner than at the Eastgate Tower, but the furniture itself was identical, and there wasn't much difference overall except for the bathroom; the bathroom in the Murray Hill East appeared to have been remodeled with completely new fixtures, tile, etc. sometime in the last year or so.\n\nThe room itself was large and comfortable, with a dining table and chairs, sofa, end tables, arm chair, coffee table, TV stand, and dresser, along with a double bed and one nightstand, arranged in an L-shaped room with the dining table at the top of the L near the door, the couch along one wall, the TV near the angle of the L, and the bed\/nightstand in the base of the L.  The small kitchen is in a separate room near the entrance door, with a half-sized fridge, full four-burner (albeit small) range, coffeemaker, sink, etc.\n\nThe bed itself was nothing much -- at the low end of acceptable -- and the pillows were barely there -- I had to scavenge the two extra pillows from the closet to make up a decent place to put my head, and the first time I looked in the closet for extra pillows I mistook the two pillows for folded sheets -- they were that thin and flimsy.\n\nI ended up not using the high-speed internet access -- I couldn't find any indication of a hotel-provided wireless signal, and there was no wired connection of any kind in the room. Since I didn't start looking until late in my only night there, I decided I could live without it until morning and didn't pursue it. \n\nNeither here nor there, but this was the first hotel I've been to in the US in fifteen years or so where I was given an actual, honest-to-god metal key for the room, instead of a magnetic card key(another vestige of the building's days as an apartment building). If you're particularly concerned about security and the possibility of someone duplicating the key, I suppose that might give you pause.\n\nService, in the limited interactions I had with the staff, was courteous and professional, if not effusively friendly.\n\nAll in all, this seems like an excellent option in this part of Manhattan, particularly for the price. If I were to return to this customer's location for several days, I'd definitely consider it. Having room to spread out and a kitchen where I could store and prepare meals would be welcome.\n","travelDate":"2007-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We had requested a no-smoking room, but when we opened the door the smell of tobacco permeated the room.  We had a suite for three people that had a king bed and a convertible sofa in the living room.  When we opened the convertible at night and took the sheets and blanket from the closet, the blanket had a horrible stench to it.  Since it was almost midnight, we called the front desk to complain, but since nobody else was on duty except for the front desk person, I had to put my clothes on again to go downstairs to get a replacement blanket.  Then we discovered that the bedroom window kept opening if a strong wind blew.  This occurred during the night with the NY temperature in the range of the high 30's and low 40's.  We tried all kinds of methods to keep it closed, but with no success.  We finally got a bellhop to come upstairs to fix it with some difficulty.  Housekeeping, too, was disappointing, as one can guess from our experience with the blanket.  The cleaning job each day was haphazard, and on the last night of our stay they didn't even make our bed.  Very disappointing.\n","travelDate":"2007-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel is very conveniently located 5 minutes from Grand Central Station.  It has all you need close by: supermarket, internet access (next door), several diners, bars, restaurants all within a couple of minutes.  Very handy also for the subway.\n\nThe suite was extremely spacious and the bedrooms both had 2 double beds.  The lounge \/dining area was large and great for a late afternoon\/early evening chill in between all the sight-seeing and eating out!  There were two bathrooms, both with showers and masses and masses of storage.\n\nThe only problems we encountered were one of the showers had no pressure and a heater was blowing cold.  Both of these were rectified immediately we reported them and we could not have asked for more.  The staff without exception, were very friendly and helpful.  There is a little traffic noise but to be honest where in NY isn't there traffic noise?  You quickly get used to it and it certainly didn't effect our sleep.\n\nThe decor was a little dated, but we weren't there to carry out a critique of US tastes in wallpaper!  We all agreed that any further visits to New York would include a stay here, it's tremendous value for money (each couple paid around $1450 inc taxes for 5 nights).  I can highly recommend the Murray Hill East Hotel to anyone wanting a short stay bolt hole for a great price.\n\nAlso, try a visit to the Russian Tea Rooms adjacent to Carnegie Hall for a special night out, but you must book.  A bottle of wine from their world class wine list range from \u00a330-\u00a33000! The Boathouse on Central Park Lake is also a great venue, very very romantic! .  Closer at hand, try Sams, a little Italian opposite the hotel.\n\nAnother first for us on this trip was a visit to the observatory at the top of the Rockefeller Centre.  Massive queues at the Empire State (2hours), hardly any at the RC and I think the experience is better.  More centrally located so better views, especially of Central Park. No irritating grating to look through just clear glass panels, and something you could never get from the ESB..... a fantastic view of the ESB from 70 stories up!!\n\nA fantastic trip which was enhanced by the accommodation, and of course by the concert which was 3 and a half hours of amazing music.

Grand Central is nearby which is where we would walk to most days if we were taking the Subway anywhere.\n\nOne weird thing, when we got into our room the 1st tme the pillows on the bed were all messed up , either they had just been thrown on my the cleaner or  (my paranoia here) someone had been using the bed.  Then the next daythe doorman randomly walked into our room without knocking and seeming suprised to see us in there he asked us if we had requested to move rooms. From then on though it was all normal and there is a roomsafe if you are concerned about valuables.\n\nWe had a room overlooking the street and the bed was right near the window, so the traffic outside did sound as the we had left all the windows open but it wasn't too distracting. I was not aware of the doggy day care near by so this was not a factor for us. \n\nI think the Suites offer value for money as manhattan accomodation is not cheap and is especially ideal if you are after a place where you can make breakfast\/snacks, store drinks etc to save some money. For 6 nights we paid gross $1400 or $1900AUD.\n","travelDate":"2006-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Lots of reasonable restaurants nearby.  Even a market around the corner which is handy with a small kitchenette in the room.\n\nThe room was good sized junior suite.  There was a table and chairs - small kitchen area, sofa and bed nook - small bathroom - but modern with good water pressure etc. Good closet space with a small in room safe (not suitable for a laptop).\n\nThe hotel also provided basic toiletries.\n\nIf you are looking for a central location with some good space and the downsides below don't bother you - this could be the place for you.  Otherwise I would suggest you find some other location.\n\nDOWNSIDES\n------------------\nThe walls were paper thin - so if you are not used to city noise, you may find it a challenge getting to sleep.  Be sure to ask for even number rooms which face a courtyard (not 39th) which can be quite noisy.  I was able to hear verbatim conversations that people were having in the hallway.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for high speed connect, wifi in the rooms etc so that you can work in your room - forget it.  They told me they have modem - but the only phone in the room is next to the bed with a small cord - so I guess you are working in bed with an awful connection.\n\nBasically for the modern business traveller - this is not the place for you.  Also, if you are expecting to order room service while you work - forget it - no room service offered.  You will need to go around the corner and get take out.\n\nThe hotel was clean - but quite old looking, they actually have keys in slots and most of their recordkeeping seems to be done manually.  The first clerk I had was not too friendly and kept me waiting while he put papers in the slots.  The second clerk however was very friendly and professional.\n\nJust as a comment - I actually left this hotel before my intended departure.  I had to have my travel agent put me somewhere more in line with a business class hotel.\n\nFINAL COMMENTS\n-------------------------\nIt was an okay hotel - but not for the \"wired\" traveller. \nI must note that I was able to get a room for less that had the amenities I was looking for.\n","travelDate":"2006-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The suites are also very attractively decorated.  \n\nI had the impression, however, that once the conversion was completed, the hotel is operating on automatic pilot.  The people at the desk were pleasant but not very professional (to be fair, one person was new in the job and didn\u2019t know much about the computer system).   Internet access consisted of dial-up service in the rooms (which only means that you can use the telephone\u2014does anyone do that anymore?) and wireless in the lobby (which meant \u201csee if you can connect to someone in the neighborhood\u201d since the hotel didn\u2019t provide anything itself.)

All in all, it is a very good place to stay if you are just regular folks who don't require a lot of special attention and want a clean hotel room that is conveniently located in New York City.  Our room was on the 9th floor, and was equipped with a small kitchen with a refrigerator which allowed us to buy some groceries to eat in the room.  The room was clean.  The air conditioner worked fine, although I'm not sure if it would suffice in 100 degree weather (it was in the mid 70's and lower 80's during our stay). The curtains cover the air conditioner, which is a bit strange, but you can just shut the blinds and leave the curtains open, giving you the full air conditioning benefit which you will probably need, as New York is quite humid at times. The bathroom towels were a little worn, but everything was clean and maid service did a good job every day in washing our dishes, replacing our towels, etc.  All of the hotel employees were courteous. The exercise room, although small, was nice, and overall it was just a fine place to stay. The rooms were quiet until the last night when the \"Loud Family\" moved next door to us.  They had a kid who hollered at the top of his\/her voice and they acted as if they were the only ones on the floor.  But when these outbursts happened, they were quelled fairly quickly (I don't know if there were complaints from other patrons or what, but one minute all hell would break loose, then 2 minutes later , all was dead quiet, and stayed that way, until the next outburst which could come hours later.)  You could also hear conversation quite clearly from another room through the air grate in the bathroom at times, but since we weren't spending a lot of time in our room, instead preferring to explore NYC, it was not a major problem.  My wife gets a discount from her job at American Airlines, so the price was $119 a night + tax, which is great for New York City.

We couldn't have asked for a hotel better suited to our needs.  I can't imagine anyone not being thrilled with MHES, but I suppose it depends on what you want.\n\nIf you are looking for the classic hotel experience (lots of fawning staff, big heavily-decorated lobby, glass-enclosed elevators, a hotel bar and \"what usually turns out to be\" a mediocre and overpriced restaurant), MHES (which was once an apartment builing) is probably not your place.  If, on the other hand, you don't mind not having a chocolate mint on your pillow every evening, like staff who are friendly (but not over-the-top), like plenty of space, a reasonable price and want to be near, but not in the middle of, Times Square, you can't do better than MHES.\n\nOur suite had a more than adequately-sized living room\/dining area, complete with a sofa sleeper, love seat, desk and dining room table.  The kitchenette was more than adequate with a full size gas range, refrigerator, dishes and coffee-maker.  We also requested a frying pan and microwave from room service, both of which were promptly delivered.  The separate bedroom had two full-size beds with very comfortable mattresses (recognizing that tastes vary widely).  The bedroom alone was about the size of what one would expect in a typical suburban hotel.  The bathroom was small, but very clean.  Overall, the worst you could say is that the decor and room, which is kept spotless by the crack cleaning staff (they'll even do your dirty dishes if you don't get to them first), is somewhat dated (but not at all worn).  Did I mention quiet?  We were next to the elevators and I never heard them.\n\nThe location was perfect for us as well.  The Murray Hill area is more residential than most midtown Manhattan neighborhoods, but from MHES it was an easy walk (less than a mile) to the UN, Chrysler building (actually about 4 blocks), Grand Central Station (about 5 blocks and the location of the nearest subway), Empire State Building and Times Square. There's a D'Agostino grocery store about 1 block away and a Duane Reed Pharmacy about 2 blocks.  Eateries in the neighborhood are too numerous to mention, but our favorite was the Dining Concourse at Grand Central Station, which provides lots of not-so-typical options.\n\nProbably the biggest endorsement came from our kids (ages 10 and 13), who would easily have given up one more docent-led tour at a museum for a more downtime in the hotel.  \n\nLastly, from what we could tell, the neighborhood is safe. Returning to our hotel from a Broadway show at 11:00 pm seemed as safe as it is in Madison, WI, our hometown.\n\nIn short, Murray Hill East Suites provided a near perfect match between room quality & service and our needs.  When and if we return to New York, this is the first place we'll look for accommodations.\n","travelDate":"2006-03","tripType":"NONE"}

A doorman was there to welcome us and take our luggage and I was given a key to Room 407, a 1 Br Suite on the 4th floor facing 39th St. This really was a suite-a living room, dining area with table, a separate full kitchen with utensils, dishes, coffeemaker and full size frig. Decent size bath with plenty of towels, good toiletries and hair dryer. The bedroom alone was the size of the typical NYC hotel bedroom so having all this space was great. Lot's of closet space with iron and ironing board and a family of 4-6 could have easily stayed in this room. The price? Our travel person bought our plane tickets in a package deal with rooms through Orbitz, so for each person, with airfare and 3 nights, it was $602 per person. By my calculation, after you take out airfare it was about $100 a night-couldn't believe it, especially since we were at the Benjamin on 50th and Lex, 3 weeks prior at 5 times the price! \n\nI use this site a lot for travel recommendations as I travel for business and I had read the reviews here, before we stayed here. Some in previous reviews  complained about the supposedly outdated decor I say c'mon. The furnishings were nice traditional, very well kept-more like something you'd see at your well-to-do great aunt's house. Sure they weren't Room and Board, but they were just fine. As for the noise, there is some but not like Times Square-this is a quiet residential area with access to lots of restaurants, grocery stores, Starbucks (2 within 1 block- we used them for WI-Fi access). A favorite eating place for all of us was Sarge's Deli at 37th and 3rd-3 blocks down 3rd (this hotel is on 39th in the middle of the block between 3rd and Lexington)-a lot like Carnegie Deli-but without the hype. Great menu and they've been there about 70 years. Grand Central Station was only 3 short blocks north-we had to take the train to New Haven one day for a day meeting-it was easy.\n\nSo to sum up here is the good and bad:\n\nGood\n\nVery Clean, Safe and Comfortable\nExcellent location\nAttentive Staff\nFitness Center\nLaundry Room on site- a dry cleaner is 3 doors down\n2 TV's in Suite\nCoffee Maker + Coffee\nDishes, Microwave (had to request)\nIron and Full Ironing Board\nSafe for valuables in the Room\nLot's of drawer and closet space & plenty of hangers\nCopies of Menus for local restaurants in room and the Doorman has more and good suggestions too\nPrice\n\nBad\n\nNo Broadband Service- I picked up a weak signal, but ultimately took my laptop to Starbucks\n\nStreet Noise- if you are a light sleeper, but no more than other NYC hotels\n\nChecking in-39th is a one-way going west, so if you are driving in, parking-even to check in, is a challenge-may have to go around the block a couple of times. This is what folks told us who drove in. They told us the parking garage is couple blocks away, and about $30 bucks a night. We arrived via Taxi and had no problems.\n\nI have to close by saying if you want pure luxury, this won't fit the bill, but for a well-kept, clean safe alternative, you can't beat this place. Other guests who we saw in the hotel were well-dressed and ranged from 20 something couples to business people to families. It is at the top of the 3 star range and a great place for business travelers. I will definitely return (unless my company foots the bill at the Four Seasons) and this is a great place for families too!\n","travelDate":"2006-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Sooooo much room--you definitely don't feel like you are in New York.  I think I got the room on priceline--can't remember.  Anyway the first room smelled terribly of enamel paint.  I have asthma so asked for a different room.  Somebody was complaining that their room smelled like smoke and I switched.  I didn't think it smelled like smoke.  So altho it seeme3d like various people have small complaints once my room was switched I was completely and totally pleased.  The kitchen was really cute in a room by itself about the size of a bathroom.  So much closet space my goodness!  I think we were on the 10th or 11th floor.  We kept the windows open and listened to the taxis honking every morning.  Enjoyed getting pizza delivered there too!  Seemed like a much better room that you would get in a boutique hotel on the east side or near NYU.  Interesting bakery\/catering place across the street, a diner a 1\/2 block away, and a couple of Italian restaurants and a small convenience store within 1 block. Took a cab to Zabars which has Feline's Basement across the street and a bagel shop in the same block.\n","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}

I gave it an excellent because for a 3 star hotel, it was way better then I had expected. We booked the one bedroom apartment thru apartments2book and everything went smoothly. We stayed there 6 days including the Sunday of marathon weekend so prices were high all over the city, but this was less $$ then nearly every hotel and we had room for 6. Even though they were very busy, we did not experience any problems. Check-in\/check-out only took about 5 minutes and they gave us an extended check-out due to our later flight departure. The rooms were spacious and very clean.\nThe housekeeping staff was polite and unobtrusive. Having a kitchen helped us save money by reheating leftovers. Daniels Bagels is only a couple blocks away and Patsy's Pizzaria is a bit of a walk but well worth it. We tend to use hotels merely as sleeping quarters as we like to explore, but this place was so comfortable we spent a couple evenings inside reading, planning our next day, etc. We're pretty low maintenance and don't require a lot of help so didn't have a lot of interaction with the staff, but when we did, they were courteous. The only negative I can think of is that our 8th floor apartment was above a doggie day care which had a play area on the roof. We had a couple morning wake up calls from the excited dogs on their morning romp. Since I have dogs myself, it really wasn't a big deal to me, but it may annoy some people.

Also, our room had a leaking sink that went all over the bathroom floor.  The best was definitely the absolute lack of soundproofing; we all woke up in a panic one night thinking someone was getting killed down the hallway when, in reality, it was just someone laughing.  What hotel in any city hasn't figured out the concept of cutting down on noise traveling so as not to irritate hotel guests??  So I guess the only impressive thing, really, was the price.

Much better than the place I have been staying in previously, which I will not name but which I will never go back to again now that I have found the Murray Hill!!\n\nWe had a one bedroom suite - huge, this place obviously used to be an apartment building and I sure wouldn't mind living in an apartment like this! I love the bathroom (it's bigger than the one in my home)and has nifty art deco lights. The bathroom was white and green and the green theme continued throughout the apartment. Dark green carpet and the bed linens were also in the green hue. \n\nIf you are looking for shiny new modern, then this is not the place for you. BUT if you are looking for large, comfortable, CLEAN, convenient accommodations, you can't beat this place.\n\nThe kitchen has a dishwasher, some very basic pots and pans (not new but clean and they did the job). No toaster or microwave. The coffee pot is small and since we were there for a week and my husband drinks a lot of coffee we bought a larger coffee pot and 2 large mugs. No big deal to us. We had brought our own coffee and coffee pot filters.\n\nWe never had any reason to call the front desk for anything and checking in and out was a breeze.

Finally found the Murray Hill Suites using Apartments2Book and got a suite with one big bedroom (with two double beds) and then a sleeper sofa in the living room.\n\nPrice seemed good at $209.\n\nThe suite was quite big by NYC standards.  Galley kitchen was decent sized by NYC standards. Bathroom was a little tight. Closets galore. Two tvs (one in bedroom, one in living room). Squeaky clean. Towels on the thin side.\n\nMy biggest disappointment was that the location was nothing special. We felt safe, and we could see the top of the Empire State Building from the living room window--that was very cool--but otherwise the hotel was on a nondescript street and the immediate neighborhood is not particularly vibrant or overly prosperous looking. I have stayed before in Times Square and that was much more fun. And, as we rode through the city on the bus and walked we saw other neighborhoods that were more prosperous-looking, and I was a wee bit jealous of folks staying in those neighborhoods. Will try for those neighborhoods next time.\n\nEach morning we walked two blocks to an excellent bagel place--Daniel's Bagels on 3rd avenue--and there were plenty of drug stores, grocery stores nearby. We were told about good restaurants in the neighborhood, but ate lunch and dinner in other neighborhoods where we happened to be at the time.\n\nBeing in between Lexington and 3rd gave us great access to north and south buses, but a longish (about four blocks) walk to the subway -- I'm spoiled having stayed much closer to subways in the past. Good that the closest subway is Grand Central; we had no problems getting anywhere from there.\n\nStreet would probably be considered quiet by NYC standards. \n\nDefinitely an apartment building in a prior life. Has a real apartment building feel, not a hotel feel. Exterior is dated--1950s?\n\nThe wait on check-in was painfully long with only one desk clerk on duty. We never saw more than one person at the front desk so it's probably a common problem.  I was #3 in line when I walked in, but the clerk was so slow that the line grew to at least ten people while I was waiting.\n\nHad a snafu on check-in.  I was given the key to 307, I unpacked, then fell asleep on the sofa as I waited for my other two travel companions to arrive. Was awoken by two Kiwi women opening my door as they had been given the same room. Called front desk and the clerk told me I was supposed to be in 208. When I said I had a key to 307 and had already unpacked, would he please put these women in 208, he relented and said he would \"fix\" it in the computer. However, when my traveling companions arrived, they were given a key to 208 and they walked in on the Kiwi folks. The Kiwis figured it out, told them to try 307, and again the front desk said he would fix it in the computer. When we checked out the clerk gave us the bill for #208. Not a huge deal, but I didn't understand why the mix-up was so difficult to cure.\n\nWe had no problems getting adequate linens for the sofa bed.\n","travelDate":"2005-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We purchased an air\/hotel package via Priceline and, when we arrived at the hotel, a quick hop, skip and jump on a Sunday afternoon from LaGuardia Airport, our two reserved rooms were not quite right. The kids' room had only one bed, not an option for teenaged brother and sister. The hotel's solution to our problem was an upgrade, not only up seven floors to the more-quiet and less-populated 12th floor, but to a huge, two-bedroom, two-bath suite with a balcony - a room worth twice what we paid for both of the original rooms. Each of the bathrooms had a vanity table with a chair and lighted magnifying mirror. Plenty of closet space, extra pillows, sufficient kitchen utensils and wares. (I don't hold it against them that there was no potholder or cookie sheet in the kitchenette!) There wasn't a single significant thing wrong with the hotel. Yes, the elevators are old and slow and the dishwasher didn't clean anything in the top rack, the tub in the master bedroom drained too slowly and the view from the balcony was laughable, but every surface in our suite was scrupulously clean and that's the most important thing as far as I'm concerned. I didn't see a single bug the entire time. The staff were friendly and helpful, the service was responsive and the location of the hotel is almost ideal - three short blocks to the subway and less than that to a grocery store, a drug store, a liquor store and seemingly infinite places to eat and, yes, even dine. The area doesn't have exactly the ambiance I expected - it's more commercial and tourist-heavy than I expected - but for this I blame my own ignorance of NYC. The other guests at the hotel seemed classy and content, no sleaze, no trouble, just the quiet comings and goings of business types and other vacationers. For a two or two-and-a-half star hotel, this place was way above average and we'd stay there again without hesitation.\n","travelDate":"2005-08","tripType":"NONE"}

By Manhattan standards, this place is huge!  Our NY friends' jaws dropped when they saw it. The neighborhood was great, too.  Less than 3 short blocks to grand Central Station, you can get uptown or downtown easily or even catch a one-minute shuttle to Times Square. Or, it's a nice 10-15-minute walk to Times Square and the theatre district.  We (5 females) felt very safe walking around the neighborhood at night.  There was plenty of grocery\/deli stores within 3 blocks as well as late night pub food available.\n\nThe apartment is clean, the hotel lobby is adequate and has a clean restroom which came in handy because we had 5 females in a one bathroom apt!  :) The laundry room and small gym are great if stayimg for awhile.  The staff was very helpful and professional.\n\nThe apartment is huge and clean.  We found that the rooms had been kept up well-- no rusty, leaky sinks or tubs-- or grout.  The carpet was very clean for a hotel room.  The kitchen had basic cooking utensils and pots and pans, a dishwasher, toaster, and regular-sized fridge.  The living\/dining area was plenty big and could easily accomodate a rollaway if needed.  We had all kinds of room to stash packages in corners or behind chairs.  The sofa pulls out into a double bad.  There was a table with 4 chairs, too.  There was a nice big closet. The bedroom was certainly big enough, with plenty more closet space and dressers.  The two double beds were very comfortable, with a nice spread.\n\nWe found it very quiet at night, yet passed a party next door onthe way in to our room for the night.  It sounded loud from the hallway but we heard absolutely nothing in our room.\n\nI really needed to have Internet connectivity each morning before everyone woke up, but the building is not broadband enabled.  I could walk to the corner to a Starbucks or walk a few blocks to beautiful Bryant Park to do an hour of work while New York woke up. Next to the library, it has free broadband for everyone.  I never missed a day because it was such a pleasure.\n\nOh, did I mention, the price was much better than most crackerbox hotels?  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anyone and will stay there again myself.\n","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}

The location is absolutely first rate...three blocks from Grand Central Station which can lead you anywhere in NY City, and there are dozens of places to eat, especially a gorgeous deli about a block and a half away.  The massive problem we faced concerned our toilet!  It wouldn't flush without overflowing.  When we asked to have it fixed, the front desk sent the doorman in with a plunger. We were told that there was no maintenence person on duty to fix it!  We realized that the toilet was not clogged, but that it must have a more serious problem.  Each day we asked the management to have the toilet fixed, and each day, it wasn't.  On the third day, we were told, that there was \"nothing we can do for you\"!  We were forced to use the lobby bathroom the entire four days we were in New York!  No one ever offered to find us a room with working plumbing, and we were given no compensation for putting up with their disineterested staff.  Only the doorman was pleasant, and he was the one who kept being sent in with a plunger!  I think that the staff at this hotel - with the exception of the doormen - kills the otherwise excellent experience at this hotel.

The room was totally trashed from the previous users, dirty dishes, unmade bed, trash, bad smell.  When I went back down to the lobby the desk clerk said \"I told you the room wasn't ready\".  Very deadpan, unpleasant individual, I ended up in an argument with him, bad way to start a 5 night stay.  Thankfully we did not see him except that one time.\nThe rooms we saw on the website were large, with separate bed and living quarters, and a kitchen.  We got a large room with a couch and eating table in it, and a small kitchen.  When we asked for a separate bedroom, because my daughter went to bed a lot earlier than me, but it was made clear that we were priceline customers, and could not upgrade.  Our rate was 120.00 per night.  The bathroom was small but nicely updated. The doormen were very nice, the maidservice was good.  Elevators are small but adequate, the gym is nice, and the laundry room came in handy, 1.50 to wash and 1.50 to dry.  The dryers get really hot so be carefull with your delicates!

Priceline put me in the Murray Hill East Suites, for about $50 a night, with taxes.  Normal rate for this hotel is around $180 a night. \n\nThe hotel is in Murray Hill, which is a great little neighborhood very close to the U.N. (If you're familiar with Manhattan, it's on 39th street, between Lexington and 3rd Ave.) The neighborhood is very quiet, and there are plenty of delis, restaurants, grocery stores, bars, etc... within just a few blocks. \n\nYou are also very close to all of the sights. The hotel is just down the street from the Chrysler Building. The U.N. is about a 10 minute walk away. Rockefeller Center, Times Square, the Empire State Building, and other sites are all within a 15 minute to half hour walk. You can also walk 4 blocks down to Grand Central Station and hop the subway to anywhere in town. (There is a subway shuttle between Grand Central and TImes Square, if you don't want to walk.) \n\nThe hotel is small, but very clean. The building almost reminds you of an apartment building. There is a small lobby with places to sit. Check in was a breeze, and everyone I dealt with at the front desk was pleasant and professional. The hotel still uses keys for the rooms, instead of keycards. (How Quaint!) The front desk is small, and there is no concierge service. The hotel does have a small fitness center, and also has a self-service laundromat. \n\nThe rooms are very basic, but HUGE by Manhattan standards.It was bigger than a studio apartment that I once lived in. There is a tiny kitchen with a sink, refrigerator, and a small stove\/oven, and cups, plates, and utensils. A microwave does not come in the room, but you can ask for one. There is a small dining area with table, and a very comfortable couch on which an extra person can sleep if need be. The TV was only a 20 inch or so, and the remote could be used to turn the TV on or off, change the volume, or go up or down on the channels. It didn't have a number pad on it. The bed was a king size, and I had *no* problems sleeping. The bathroom is your average sized hotel bathroom with a sink and a tub. \n\nThe only problem I had was that when I first got into the room, there was a slight smell to it. It took me a while to realize that they had cleaned the carpet, and there was still a lingering smell of the carpet cleaning material. The smell faded within a day or so. \n\nOverall, I was *VERY* happy with the hotel. I would not stay there for the full price, but for what I paid, I got an EXCELLENT bargain. I was very satisfied with my stay here. \n\nI have included 3 photos of the room. You can see them here: \n----\n\n","travelDate":"2005-01","tripType":"NONE"}

You can get a room here for around $200, more or less. I payed $144 including taxes and fees from Hotwire.com. For this price range, you get good spacious rooms that are homey and comfortable. You also get a mini kitchen with a refridgerator, stove, pots and pans and utensills.  In addition, it's in a great Manhattan location, which is the mid town east side. I prefer this location because it is relatively quieter and conveniently closer to the major points in the city. It's the perfect hotel for tourists and I strongly recommend it. If you are a business traveler and need special services and ammenities, this may not be the place for you and you may want to book a room in a  fancier hotel with all the bells and whistles and personal special treatment services.  However, the great thing about this hotel is that it is spacious, clean and comfortable. Something that you would need after a long tiring day of sight seeing. Personally, I do feel that the spaciousness is important after a long day in New York  because it helps me to unwind and stretch out better without feeling caved in like in many of the typical tiny rooms in New York. You normally pay around $200 or more anyway in Manhattan for a room that is small, so for this price range you will get more space and space is a luxury in New York as you will see when you stay at this hotel. The spaciousness did make it feel a bit more luxurious, considering that space is precious in this town. I give it a thumbs up.\n","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}

The rooms can't be beat for the price, and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. They only time I am disappointed in the hotel is when they are full and I need a room!

The good and bad.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2004-03-27","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"I am currently staying at this hotel. Here's the run down. DO NOT stay here if the following is important to you: 1. Internet - None and the phone line pulls a 21.1 connection 2. Unlimited phone calls\/talk or dial up - .15 a minute... period 3. Modern furnishings - I think the decor is from the early 80's ... \nit's almost back in style, modern retro, loads of chrome, good enough shape, though. \n4. Concierge services STAY HERE if the following is important to you: 1. Room, plenty of it, too! We have a full 1 bedroom apt with a large patio overlooking 38th St. \n2. If you like to feel like you are staying in a residential building. \n3. Need a decent clean place in Midtown for very little $$ 4. Are fed up with being nickled and dimed with tips at other hotels (but be sure to tip the cute Polish doorman when you arrive and leave) 5. Like NO snobbery... zippo, none\n\nI am used to 4 and 5 star hotels. I just could not pass up the deal here, less than 100.00 for a business trip that was hard to justify without it! I will not stay here again for business. I need better business services. But it is perfectly fine for those on vacation trying to save $$$","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}

Our most recent visit in January, 2004 was one of the best ever. The rate was excellent and while the room we requested was not available, we were given a better one bedroom suite. The staff is very pleasant. The location is not touristy. One feels as though NYC is \"home\" with the local dry cleaner, hairdresser, 24 hour grocery and bar (at the Kitano Hotel - highly recommended). Even though the people we visit in the area are moving to Brooklyn, we will continue to make the Murray Hill our headquarters when we are in New York.","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}

The room I had was very spacious and decently clean. However, I wouldn't stay here if I was looking for a nice or special weekend away. It's obvious the couch and chair are outdated. I wouldn't use the bedspead, but then again, there are few places that I would. While there was a doorman, service wasn't particularly noteworthy. At check-in, I wasn't even asked if I needed help with my bags. I didn't mind too much since I wasn't expecting first class service. Nevertheless, the suites definitely exceeded my expectations for a 2 star hotel. I Pricelined this room and got it for $90 a night from 10\/28-10\/31.","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}

Spacious living room with dining table, pull out sofa bed, cable tv and plenty of sitting area. The bedroom is a seperate, large room. The bath was very clean and modern, except you might bring your own hairdryer. The kitchen is fully equipped and has a fullsize refrigerator. The elevators ran slow but that never was a real problem for us. It is walking distance to the Empire State Bldg and there was never a problem hailing a cab from this location. The staff was courteous. New York is not for the faint of heart so don't expect southern hospitality. Soak up the sights but be prepared for crowds and standing in line. The hotel is a cab ride to Theatre District and Times Sq\/Central Park. But none of our taxis were more than $7.00. Good first trip to NYC. Will go back and probably stay at the same hotel with senior class trip.....","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}

I must say that Murray Hill East Suites was the best choice I have made in recent years. The price was fantastic, I had a full kitchen, spacious bedroom and a lovely livingroom\/diningroom.(Hint: microwave available means you need to ask for one. Wish I'd known that).The staff was courteous and very helpful. The doorman rarely left his post. I was able to walk to the fireworks on the east river in less than 5 minutes.For the first time in years I spent time on the east side. There are a lot of interesting places that I usually overlook. I never stayed so close to the river before because of the mistaken notion that I'd be 'too far' from the hubbub'. I enjoyed my stay this year and saved a lot of money compared with other years. I would highly recommend this hotel","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}
{"helpfulVotes":7,"locationId":93489,"title":"Delightful Neighborhood!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2003-06-08","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Booked this hotel through Priceline for May 26-31, 2003 for $85 dollars per night. Pleasantly surprised at historic quaint neighborhood it is located in. Just 4 blocks from Grand Central Station. Lots of small restaurants and grocery, convenience, etc. in the area. The hotel: nice lobby complete with doorman. Check in took too long. The suite was an oversized hotel room with a miniscule kitchen (small refrig and smaller oven and a coffeemaker with a sink) and the smallest hotel bathroom I have ever been in. The bathroom had a very nice bathtub and good hot water but the sink was a simple vanity and there was nowhere to put any toiletries or a place to lay out clothes, towels, etc. There was also a slight step up into the bathroom which took some getting used to. The beds and linens were of medium quality; not the Marriott but Doubletree like. The AC was non-existent. If you are thinking of booking this in the summer FORGET IT. We had three large windows which we kept open at all times and it was very nice but - temps were in the 55-74 degree range. During the summer you would fry in this room. In the winter there is no heat either so consider that. Housekeeping was very good and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I would stay again in the spring or fall, it was the perfect location for touring NYC. Kim","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}
