I usually stay more in Midtown vs Times Square but decided to try the Edition. Once you were out the front door, you were definitely in the throngs of people at Times Square. However, the entrance to the addition is just off of 7th Avenue and it is possible to avoid the crowds by going the other direction. It\u2019s a central location to shopping, to Central Park, Times Square, Madison Square Garden, and all that Midtown has to offer. The rooms were very small, but most are in Manhattan, so I can\u2019t really fault the Edition for that. The hotel bar was great and we enjoyed the outdoor patio that a lot of places in NYC do not have.  Not sure I would stay here for business travel but for a more relaxing vacation it was a good central spot.  One plus was that Ubers were basically waiting at the front door whenever you had to go somewhere that was too far to walk.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The sharp, flaking pieces of the tub could have easily caused physical injury, a risk unacceptable in any accommodation, let alone one costing $2,600 for two nights. However, the response to our complaint was far from satisfactory. Despite the high price, the hotel was fully booked and Joseph offered no apology or suitable alternative, merely stating the tub was usable. He said \" the tub was functional, but cosmetically unappealing\"Joseph's impatience and dismissiveness during our discussion over the phone were profoundly disrespectful. He even questioned our calculation and communication abilities and insisted we visit the front desk for an explanation.\n\nJoseph's handling of the situation was not only inadequate but also suggestive of racial discrimination. Despite my status as a Platinum Elite member, Joseph's attitude and decisions implied a discriminatory stance, especially given his refusal to acknowledge our concerns adequately and his insinuation that we were being unreasonable.When we highlighted the tub's condition, Joseph's offers of $250 in food and beverage credits or 3,500 reward points felt both insufficient and irrelevant. He denied us access to another Suite, despite availability shown on the Marriott app, claiming it was reserved for VIP guests. This discriminatory treatment was deeply unsettling.\n\nAfter complaining to Marriott headquarters, he seemed forced to come to apologize. However there is no sincerity in his apology, when asking if he understands why we felt being mistreated, he refuted every points we mentioned before and insist that every decisions he made were entirely right. This behavior was especially upsetting to my girlfriend, who was reduced to tears by his insensitivity.\n\nMost concerning was Joseph's implication that our presence posed a physical threat to him. This baseless accusation is not only deeply offensive but also a severe allegation that escalates the situation far beyond a customer service failure. His refusal to inspect the room, citing fear of our presence, was both unjustified and indicative of a prejudiced mindset.\n\nThis entire experience has left us feeling not only disregarded as customers but also discriminated against. It is unacceptable for guests, particularly those paying a high price for what should be a luxury experience, to be subjected to potential safety hazards and such levels of disrespect.\n\nMoreover, it became evident that the hotel had knowingly assigned us a room with a damaged bathtub. This revelation, coupled with Joseph's dismissive and confrontational approach, severely impacted our experience.\nNot only was the bathtub in the room damaged, but the mirror and one standing lamp were also broken, and there were cracks in the sink. The bathrobe even had hair from the previous guest on it. It's hard to imagine this is a hotel worth $1,300 a night. \n\nThis encounter not only reflects poorly on the Marriott brand but also raises serious concerns about racial bias and customer disregard, particularly given the high price we paid for what was expected to be a luxury experience. We expect Marriott's corporate team to address these issues urgently to ensure that such discriminatory and disrespectful treatment is not repeated with other guests.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We stayed in a standard room and the gap between the bed and the desk is not wide enough. On our first morning, as I walked around the bed, I caught my foot in the bedding, causing me to fall to the ground and as the room is small, I also hit my head off the door. 5 days later and my elbow is still in pain. My woolly hat seems to have mostly protected my head! Luckily I'm in my twenties but I'd be worried what a fall like that would do to an older person. \nAlthough the room is small, it was stylish and clean, with a fairly clever use of space. I particularly liked the lighting in the room which meant being able to use the bathroom without disturbing my partner. More hooks would be helpful, as there was only one in the whole room. Four by the shower to hang a bath towel and a robe each (to free up hangers in the wardrobe), two next to the sink to hang a hand towel each, and a few by the door to hang coats, scarves, hats etc. would be helpful. More storage space in the wardrobe is needed too. A drawer is used for the safe, a large section of it is for the coffee station and the other available space it too high to reach, and as already mentioned, two hangers are used for the robes as there's nowhere else to hang them. The standard rooms are really designed for one person. However, I have to add, that the toiletries and fragrance used throughout the hotel is really nice.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":13451795,"title":"Great Hotel, For Theatre Going","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"The primary reason for my visit to NYC was to see several plays. I stayed at this hotel 6 nights, specifically so I would be near the 5 theatres I would be attending. Having lived in the NYC metro area for over 30 years, and now living on the other coast, I knew more than to think anything near Times Square would be my cup of tea. However, for the ease of getting to and from the plays via a short walk, hands down, there was nothing better. Thankfully my room was at the far end of the hall, on the 30th floor, far enough from the hubbub (to put it mildly) below, but still able to see the TKTS red stairs and all the crowds. I could hear the occasional sirens and loud music, but nothing after 10 pm. I sleep with white noise, so if there was any street noise, it was not noticed by me. Now, the good things-I had a king bedded room, which for one person was fine. If there were two people sharing this room, it might be tight. I took room service for several meals, and the only place to dine was the long, narrow ledge-desk area beneath the wall mounted television. There was just one chair beneath it, which when pushed underneath, gave one just enough room to walk in front of it and the foot of the bed. The white leather armchair and ottoman were comfortable for reading beside the full length window with a standing lamp. Should you be sharing the room with another, there was a full length, blackout style drapery that could be drawn across the width of the room, dividing the bed area from the entry\/bathroom. One could turn on separate lights (the nightlight, although a nice touch, is way too bright to act as such...a fault I have been experiencing in hotels of late) and shower or get ready for the day. A non-lit, tilting makeup mirror was a welcome addition (the lit mirror over the sink giving ample light), as was a hand-held steamer, which I used several times. So much more efficient and easier to use than an iron! The one-size-fits-all robe was much more plush than any hotel offering I have had in a long time. And also useful, a little mini refrigerator that one could temporarily move a few items to the upper shelf of the closet to make way for a few locally made purchases. The toilet and shower areas are made of heavily frosted glass (thankfully, fully and heavily frosted, to the point no shadows are visible) and consist of a shared center panel between them. Again, thank you for the complete sense of privacy, should one be sharing the room with another. The shower comes with a rain head fixture, but I made most use of the very sleekly designed hand held shower. Thanks to the designer from all us women who use shower caps. I loved the high-medium-low light setting for all the built in lighting in the room, which added a nice ambience. There was just enough room for my hanging clothes, and those I placed in the 2 drawers in the closet (a third was given up to a locking safe, which I also used). But given the shelving in the closet, more items could be stored if the room was shared. Now, what I wished was in the room-towel bars! I seems having a sleek design means forfeiting such a practical item, but I did not want to use a new towel each day. I find it unnecessary. I had a robe knob (not a hook) which, if one desired, one could place a damp towel. However, the towel folds and does not get adequately dried...I would rather have folded my towel over a bar and used it several days, which is also more environmentally friendly. Nowhere to hang a hand towel, either, nor facecloth. Or my wet raincoat (the frosted walls of the shower\/toilet stalls were too tall to reach). I am a Marriott Bonvoy member, but don't know if this was the reason I received a text a few days prior to my stay, asking if there was anything I would need in my room. What a nice touch. My request was answered promptly. I checked out and stopped at the concierge desk to offer my compliments, stating that the room service staff were incredibly well trained and pleasant. Really-above and beyond, genuine and very upbeat, all of them. I was pleasantly greeted by a gentleman as I was waiting for the elevator, and asked if he was part of management? Yes, he was...so he received my accolades on how I enjoyed my stay. Then, as I entered the elevator, two women nicely greeted me, and seeing their ID tag lanyards, I asked if they were part of management? They acknowledged in the affirmative, so I gave them the same message of how pleased I had been with my stay. So, I covered all the bases. ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":13451795,"title":"Best Times Square NYC Hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-09-08","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I am normally loyal to another hotel brand, especially in NYC.  However, I had been wanting to try this hotel since before covid.  So, I jumped at a chance to use my points to book this for my upcoming work trip.  To be fair, I tend to avoid Times Square, as most New Yorkers\/former New Yorkers do.  But, I was willing to break this rule to try this hotel!  For starters, it is smack dab in the midst of all the crazy.  We are talking about the noise and crowds, etc.  But, I did not hear anything in my room.  The first-floor entrance was barren.  All you see there is the valet stand and a sculpture.  I am not sure if this was meant to showcase an aura of exclusivity.  It was not impressive.  The signature hotel scent is reminiscent of smoke embers and man cologne.  I was not a fan, and you can smell it as soon as you enter the door.  The lobby is on the 10th floor, which was a little odd.  It\u2019s not an inviting lobby at all.  There is literally one chair to sit on and someone was always sitting in it because there was always a line.  There were seats in the bar area and a sitting room to the side.  But, it was not as convenient to sit in there if you needed to stand in the line.  The theme I assume with this hotel is minimal.  The lobby evoked this.  I was apparently upgraded to a larger king room.  But, I would not have thought that had the room service attendant not told me.  If this was a \u201cbigger\u201d room, I shudder to know what was smaller.  It was VERY clean.  The d\u00e9cor was again, basic and minimal.  It literally looks like the Public Hotel downtown, but a little nicer.  You can tell they are both Ian Schrager-designed hotels.  They could be the same hotel.  Everything was white and wood.  My room had a low to floor frame king bed, tiny nightstands, a window seat and a wall ledge used as a table with chair.  It was almost too much for the space.  You would not have noticed it was a tight fit until you attempted to walk around the bed.  Unfortunately, my shin found out as the frame of the bed juts out past the edge of the mattress.  You will bang it.  It will hurt.  The \u201cbathroom\u201d was the no wall type that many modern hotels use nowadays.  There was an open sink area with open shelves underneath.  I did not love this as I had to keep bending down to look for things I needed.  The toilet and shower were housed behind frosted glass doors.  Make sure to shut these if your window curtain is open lest you give someone in the Renaissance Hotel a peep show.  There is a nice Nespresso machine.  Snacks and alcohol are provided (for a price).  Room service was delicious (cobb salad) and very quick.  My attendant Habeeb was lovely and very friendly.  I had a breakfast meeting at the Terrace and Outdoor Gardens the next morning.  Mauro and Brohan were very attentive and kind to all our needs.  The food was amazing.  I had no issue with the price because it was all worth it (mushroom omelette, duck hash, cappuccinos, fresh OJ).  The view from the terrace was just the right juxtaposition of cityscape with a garden setting.  I also got the loveliest amenity of US Open macarons sent to my room due to my status.  They were delicious as well.   When I checked out, I showed my bruised purple shin, and Andrew, the acting manager, was kind enough to assist me in a resolution.  I wish I had gone to the gym.  I heard it was nice.  But, I only stayed one night.  I think the atmosphere of minimalistic and cool works for some, but not for others.  It was fine with me.  I have stayed at more \u201cluxurious\u201d hotels, but the service here was quite impressive.  The service is the reason I would stay here again.  That, and the proximity to the subway station were the biggest wins.  If you want to have a cool NYC experience with a boutique hotel vibe (albeit not in size), stay here.  The service is second to none!       ","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The one bedroom suite, as described on the Booking.com site, was not what we were provided.  Instead, what they called a suite was simply a larger bedroom with a sofa in addition to the bed.  I addressed the problem immediately with management.  Their contention was that it was Booking.com's error.  They claimed once I reached out to Booking about the matter and received their \"blessing\" they would adjust our bill for the \"inconvenience\". \n\nI did immediately contact Booking.com, apprised them of the situation, and they willing agreed to authorize the Times Square Edition to compensate us.  In contrast to what I was told by the hotel, a total of two different Booking.com, representatives, categorically stated that the hotel is solely responsible for the content they provide to Booking.com when listing their property.  Who should I believe?\n\nThe Times Square Edition did adjust our hotel bill by $450 (for a $6,300 room charge).  Although this seemed inadequate given the inconvience the misrepresentation caused us, I was prepared to table the entire incident until I checked back on the Booking.com page and found the same, incorrect description of the Times Square Edition remained on their site.  I sent a online complaint through Marriott Customer \nService.  Their response was to refer me back to the hotel.  The front desk manager emailed me with the offer of a 60,000 credit to my Marriott Bonvoy account, which I subsequently discovered could not actually be applied to  since the reservation was booked through a third party.  \n\nI then spoke directly with Marriot Customer Service and they showed little concern about the misleading practices employed by a member of their Marriott chain.\n\nIt is a shame, because so many other aspects of our stay were wonderful.

The restaurant and bar served amazing food and drinks and the housekeeping staff were some of the best I've ever come across.\n\nIf you do choose to stay at the Times Square Edition you may well have a great experience, but  if you have any specific requirements or needs that are \"advertised\"  I would suggest questioning them closely, if lack of these amenties would seriously impact on your stay.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Everyone was so warm and friendly - the doormen, front desk, housekeeping and every single person I simply shared an elevator with or walked past. I was truly blown away as most guests seemed to be staying for business and were dressed very formally, whereas I was there for pride\/concerts and always dressed comfortably yet I was always treated with respect. I was super impressed by Nicole who was extremely kind and helpful and did an amazing job at explaining all the services and amenities when checking me in. \n\nLocation: This hotel is located in the heart of Time Square, minutes away from many tourist attractions. I was very lucky to be moved to a room overlooking Times Square and there are also great views from the gym and Terrace. \n\nRoom: The hotel and rooms are stunning with minimal wear and tear. The rooms with a view of Times Square do not have bathrooms but this wasn\u2019t an issue as I was staying alone and there is a curtain if needed. There is Showtime, complimentary water and amazing daily turndown service. My belongings had been tidied up whenever I returned and I never had any issues with theft so it was a relief to not have to worry about locking away designer or expensive items every time I left the room. I often didn\u2019t leave early enough for housekeeping but I was still able to request soap etc through the app and it was always delivered immediately. \n\nValue: The room was extremely great value for money because of the incredible customer service and perhaps the best location in NYC. I would definitely stay here again. However, I was disappointed to have to pay an extra $475 because of the destination fee. I was aware of the fee before checking in but unfortunately I didn\u2019t enjoy the food so eventually stopped redeeming the food and beverage credit. I also did not use the MoMA tickets, Soul Cycle or TMPL passes, although I wish I did. If you redeem all of these things and like the food then the destination fee is worth it.\n\nRestaurant and lobby bar: The restaurant and bar is beautiful and I loved that they had special cocktails and souffl\u00e9 for pride! I personally thought the food was bland so I barely ate any of whatever I ordered but I think other people may love it.\n\nThis is an LGBTQ friendly hotel with diverse staff that treats all people with kindness and respect and does not discriminate.

I figured it\u2019d stop but thirty minutes later, I realized it was not. I called the front desk and messaged them on the bonvoy app. I asked them to intervene because I worried about getting into a confrontation with a guy who was screaming that loudly, and for that long.

The man did not appear to hear my knocking so I retreated and called the front desk who promised they send security up. Around 4:30, he finally stopped speaking so loudly (he appeared to be shouting words to someone on the phone or maybe he was talking to himself). Either way, I did not enjoy having to beg the hotel to handle him and I\u2019m exhausted today. We moved to a new hotel today.

The reasons are all related to service. You are paying for a five-star \"destination\" hotel, but you would be getting two-star services.\n\nFirst, there is no express check out. I had an early morning departure flight, and asked to settle my accounts at around 10pm the night before. I was told that this could not be done because the hotel's system only close out expenses for each day at mid-night and not before. In 30 years of global business travel, I have never encountered this at a hotel in this class.\n\nSecond, beware there is something shady going on with the bell service and transportation arrangements. The bell service team has its own arrangement with a driver: they told me that it would be much more expensive if I were to make transportation arrangements with the reception. Then two different bell men quoted me two different prices for the ride to Newark Airport: $120, or $100 with a 10% surcharge for credit card. On the morning of departure, a third bell man asked me \"What price were you told?\" Again, this is not the kind of experience I have ever had at this class of hotel.\n\nThird, the front desk service was inconsistent. I had booked the room from Saturday to ensure that I would be able to check in when I arrived early on Sunday morning (I noted my estimated arrival date and time in the Marriott booking). When reviewing my bill the night before my departure, I noticed that on Saturday my room charge was shown as \"No Show.\" I asked whether this could be corrected so it wouldn't cause confusion for reimbursement, the person promised he would take care of the issue. The next morning, of course it was not fixed, and I was in a rush to get to the airport. Fortunately, the early morning reception agent was much more responsible than his colleague the night before, and did ultimately email me a corrected invoice. \n\nFinally, I experienced incompetent and rude guest services. I was ordering room service and asked for the \"Edition Lovebird Lager\" that was on the menu. The woman named Claudia taking my order said it was out. So I said any beer would do. She said: \"No. There is no beer.\" Incredulous, I asked \"There is on beer in the hotel?\" She said: \"No.\" I asked \"Even in the lobby bar?\" She said: \"No. And you are not allowed to yell at me.\" I wished there was recording to demonstrate that asking incredulous questions was not the same as yelling. I went downstairs and spoke with the manager. He did apologize but also stated that the specific beer was not available, but I could get another beer at the lobby bar. I went to the lobby bar and asked the bartender to recommend a beer. Guess what he gave me? The Edition Lovebird Lager.\n\nIn addition, there was the minor issue that I had requested foam pillows and got feathered ones. \n\nI chose this hotel for two reasons: its proximity to my business meetings, and its newness. The hotel did not really feel new: it actually was already kind of worn. And if you didn't need to be in this location, I would recommend staying away from Time Square: it is loud and touristy.\n\nI will not likely choose to stay here again, even if it is close to where I need to be.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I thought it was a big ask of the hotel manager Andrew, until we arrived at the front desk at the Edition and Vlad, who checked us in told us that we could do an early check-in to our upgraded suite and he also mentioned that the staff was aware that we were celebrating a birthday.  He also said that we could enjoy a 2pm check out. The suite was spectacular! It was a corner room on the 31st floor with a super comfortable king bed, beautiful lighting design, living room area with huge TV with free access to Netflix, Pandora, HBO and more. The suite also featured a huge balcony overlooking Times Square--gorgeous, ultimate NYC views.  The bathroom included a huge soaking tub that I wish we'd had time to use.  Plenty of storage, fluffy robes and Le Labo products. The staff of the hotel, from the doormen to the front desk and housekeepers were all super friendly and provided excellent service.  A first for us, upon check-out, once out of our room, our daughter realized that she left her NYC pickles in the room fridge.  The bellman who was helping us with our bags (I am so sorry that I forgot his name but he was a real gem!) said that he would happily retrieve the pickle for her so that she would have it when we finally left the city later (we stored our gear with the bellman for the afternoon).  When we got back to the hotel to get our stuff, the bellman handed us our daughter's prized pickle in an ice-packed bag! How very kind--what a sweet gesture!

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":13451795,"title":"Overall beautiful hotel and lovely stay with a few hiccups","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-02-03","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"The first thing I will mention is that the hotel is 5 star and is expectedly, very expensive, being in the heart of Times Square. I took this into account when writing my review. If I am paying that much, my expectations would be higher than normal.\n\nI stayed for 12 nights over the Christmas and NY period so I obtained a very comprehensive view of the hotel and everything about it.\n\nOverall it was a very comfortable stay and the staff were always there to attend to any requests and issues.\n\nThe moment I got out of my transfer car, there was a lovely young gentleman waiting to get all my bags and transport me upstairs to the reception. The check-in was reasonably flawless but there was a bit of confusion around the payment because of resort fees the hotel charges daily. I prepaid my booking and there was confusion over whether it included or excluded the resort fee.\n\nThe reception area is immaculately presented and the bar and restaurant are both located here. I intended to use the gym during my stay, but didn't have time to even take a peek. Nor did I visit the bar or restaurant. There's way too many options outside to do that.\n\nThe very polite and courteous young gentleman then took me up to my room. He showed me everything and away he went.\n\nI got a bit of a room upgrade which I highly appreciated and had a beautiful view of Times Square. I was on the 2nd highest floor, floor 39.\n\nThe room is not big. It was adequate for one person but nothing more. I don't think I would be able to stay here if I was with another person. It would be too uncomfortable and I had to find space for my 2 suitcases and carry-on. \n\nThe bathroom is open plan, with a door for the shower and toilet. A big problem I had in my room was that if it was windy you will hear a loud whistle coming through the bottom of the front door. It really annoyed me. I had to take the cover off the bed and make a snake shape to block the gap underneath the door to stop the noise. Even a bath towel didn't work. They need to fix this.\n\nThe hotel is very new and the rooms are very beautifully equipped, presented and maintained. I was pleased to see that most of the things I requested before I arrived (some extra bath mats, bath towels, hand towels, face towels, mini fridge, bathroom scale) were mostly there upon arrival. I quantified the number of towels I needed as I was not getting any housekeeping during my 12 night stay but I did not get the quantity requested. I expected a bit more attention to detail for a 5 star hotel.\n\nBefore I arrived I was asked if I was celebrating a special occasion and Guest Services pushed up my expectations as I was celebrating a special occassion and they said something nice, I assume maybe a cake or some alcohol would be waiting for me in the room. When I arrived there was nothing. And there was never going to be anything throughout my stay. \n\nI didn't mind and only remembered towards the end of the stay. When I enquired via email I was met with silence. They addressed the rest of my email but didn't want to address that. Cheeky. And not really 5 star behaviour.\n\nThe bed was lovely and I had a great night's sleep every night. Very comfortable and quiet room. I enjoyed coming back to my room every night after a very cold day and opening my curtains to see the world go by downstairs. \n\nBefore I arrived I asked if it was OK to get some parcels sent to the hotel. I wasn't told about fees or anything or the sort and was invited to send them to the hotel. When I arrived they asked security to bring the parcels up to my room. They did that swiftly and politely and all security staff are helpful and friendly .\n\nThe issue here was that I was being told I would be charged a $10 fee per parcel and was confronted with a few sheets of paper asking me to sign the charge. I was pressured to sign the papers and off they went. I was very concerned as I had quite a number of parcels which would have amounted to over a $100 charge.\n\nI abruptly called the Guest Services line and spoke to a very nice lady by the name of Nephi. She was brilliant throughout my stay. She helped clarify that there would be a cost going forward from 2023 but they would waive the charge for me. This was not a good experience but Nephi made sure she sorted it out for me and I wasn't charged. \n\nIn the lead up to New Year's Eve, I had a party in Times Square and I was well aware that anyone staying in the vicinity of Times Square would require security passes of some sort to get through the police barricades. There was no letter or information right up to the night before NYE despite me asking several times via the Guest Services Line, reception and various people around the hotel. \n\nThe night before when I called the Guest Services line, I was told that they had just despatched all the letters to the room but I didn't get one and they missed me. They then swiftly organised to get both the letter and pass sent to me my room. Again not a good experience. Most guests who stay at the hotel on the 31st December are likely going to go somewhere and need to be able to get into and out of the hotel. You need to let people know about this several days beforehand so people know what is going on, rather than have to circle around helplessly to find the information. This was not a good experience.\n\nBear in mind it is incredibly busy over the holiday season so getting into and out of the hotel is not easy for those that don't like excessive crowds. I stayed here because I have never stayed in the middle of Times Square and I needed to be next to my NYE party venue so I could return to the hotel easily. \n\nWould I stay again? For NYE yes but otherwise I would prefer a quieter location with a larger room for normal trips, and yes it cost me a fortune to stay here so would prefer something more modestly priced for a long stay. Perhaps if there weren't so many glitches I would stay here again.\n\nSo the one star taken off was for the glitches mentioned above. Otherwise it is a very nice hotel.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

We had two large suitcases and two carry ons and they fit in the room fine we were able to keep one large suitcase open at all times and the two carry ons open at all times and put the other away. The room has a closet and drawers for storage. We were told by the booking agent (who was really helpful) there would be no time square view because the doubles do not face that way. The guest experience manager emailed before the stay and we asked for the best view and were THRILLED with the view! Furthermore people complain about the housekeeping, literally no idea why the room was spotless and had been cleaned every time we came back also with turn down service and replacing the free waters. You have to pay a destination fee at most luxury hotels well here you can use that fee ($35.00) towards room service, a spin class, the bar\/restaurant or MOMA tickets. Had a lovely time at MOMA and ordered hot tea to the room almost every night, chicken fingers meal one night, and a cheese board and tea another.

I accompanied my sister on a business trip, otherwise would not have chosen to stay in such a hectic Times Square-ish location.  The hotel entrance is on 47th St., and the moment you step off the sidewalk, it was much, much quieter.  The staff is terrific all around, starting with the super helpful and nice doormen. The spaces are serene and comfortable  (not spacious by any means, but you won't hit your knees on the wall when getting out of bed either, unlike some NYC hotel rooms I've seen).\nOur room had a proper bathroom door, but I think this was because we had two beds, as some other reviews I read mention that bathroom privacy is an issue if you have a one-bed room).\n Everything was super clean and comfortable, with nice Le Labo amenities.\nTheir is a great hand-held steamer in place of an iron, but no where to hang your clothes while using the steamer as there is no outlet in the closet.\nOverall, the Marriott brands have a real lack of hooks, places to hang towels, etc that  is non-sensical and annoying (for example , at The Edition, there is exactly on peg on the wall in the bathroom, zero towel racks, and the shower glass is floor to ceiling, so no hanging anything on top of the shower either).\nThe wifi was reliable, the gym was excellent.\nI went to The Terrace restaurant one morning for breakfast. Beautiful space! The food was good, and the service was spotty (example, we ordered an Americano, and after 25 minutes of being told it would be a few minutes, we gave up and left). Two other parties were overhead complaining about the service during that breakfast. The server himself was very nice, and I don't know if they are understaffed or just don't really have it together.\nThe other restaurant looks gorgeous, but it seems to have been closed since the beginning of Covid.\nOverall, I'd stay here again if I needed to stay in that area, but given a choice, that ultra-hectic spectacle of a  neighborhood is not my scene.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The Times Square EDITION introduces the next generation of modern luxury\".    Upon entering the property the low lighted reception desk inspired me to assumed I had found a new favorite hotel brand away from the fast passing times of the W Hotel brands that many have not been updated in the past 20 years. I was hoping to find a new modern luxury oasis for my travels and the Edition seemed to be my new haven. Entering my deluxe city view room over looking Times Square the room appeared to meet my expectations. After dropping off my luggage I arrived at the 9th floor restaurant and while the ambience was fantastic the menu offerings did not meet my desires and therefore I decided to return to the lobby bar due to it being much more social atmosphere and having a better small bite selection. As I sat at the bar enjoying a well made Manhattan I noticed the bar had small chips in the stone and it had also been mended from pieces instead of being one solid slab of stone. This caused my luxury radar to be heightened a bit as I began to take a closer look at the Edition Luxury standard. My next encounter of a sub par luxury offer by the Edition Hotel brand came when I hopped in the bed for a nights  sleep consider I needed to rise at 5am for my morning workout. I assumed it might have been the long day of traveling that was making the bes so uncomfortable but the more I tossed and turned I realized the bed was just hard as stone and a far cry away from the plush beds I was use to from the W Hotel. I could not believe this was what the Edition Hotel was calling \"the next generation of modern luxury\". If this was what modern luxury bedding felt like I would happily stay in the past luxury setting I had grown accustom. All a great looking hotel with excellent service but for the price of new modern luxury I would expect more luxury in the things that matter the most, beds, shower, towels ect. If you cant offer a wonderful night stay its no way no matter what the hotel looks like it cant be classified as a luxury brand, no matter how many people with money frequent the brand.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Traveling is my passion and as a Marriott Ambassador elite member, I have very keen awareness of what an exceptional hotel is. The Times Square Edition checked all the boxes for me. From the moment we arrived, the guys from downstairs immediately made us feel so very welcome! At first, I felt weird because where the Uber dropped us off looked like a creepy alley but the The Times Square Edition Staff waiting for guests there proved me wrong and made me feel at ease immediately. Shout out to Jerome Canseco for going above and beyond in welcoming us, being greeted and taking care of our luggage and collaborating with our check in, including some tips and recommendations that are totally very much out of his scope of work! Checking in on the 7th floor I believe, we were welcomed by very friendly and attentive guys. I want to specially thank Mr. Angelo Esteban for going above and beyond in accommodating our requests and being so very knowledgeable and responsive for everything that we needed to make our stay not only comfortable but definitely extraordinary! As a California traveler and a self proclaimed foodie from Los Angeles, I really wanted to make my stay here in New York very memorable. We have enlisted the help of Mr. John Sieber, the concierge to recommend and create amazing experiences for us. Mr. Sieber did not disappoint and definitely made our stay here in New York absolutely memorable not only in terms of experiences, but also his willingness to make all things perfectly planned and done. We wanted to watch Hugh Jackman\u2019s The Music Man and MJ the musical, both of which were sold out, but he did his best to make things happen for us! His dining reservations and recommendations were totally at par for us, including our not usually our \u201ctaste\u201d of club but glad we experienced it at the Paradise Club. Dinner at the Ardor for sure was superb and our table was excellent!\nThis location will remain on my top 5 locations to stay while I\u2019m in NYC. Convenient location yet secluded from the bustle of the city once you enter. Our room was on a corner top floor of 29th with the view of Times Square and it was just amazing to wake up to in the morning and at night, the bright city lights make a very unique experience as well. Comfy beds and chic minimalist interior design as expected. \nThe Times Square Edition by far is one of the most special hotels I will keep wanting to go back to, and will definitely send  all my friends and family to stay there.

I actually got it confused with the Edison Hotel - don't make that mistake -fortunately, they are only about 100 yards apart.  The entrance is a bit odd -you walk down a corridor to some elevators and go up to the 10th floor to get into the lobby.  The attendants at the entrance were always friendly and helpful.  After you are on the 10th floor, you have to walk across the lobby to another elevator bank to take another elevator to your room floor.  So, if you get caught in the morning or evening crowd, you will be waiting a bit to actually get in and out of the building (especially if there are business groups that adjourn and hit the elevator\/lobby all at the same time).  The location is literally a few strides from Times Square.  So, if you want to hang out with the tourist crowd and eat at the tourist food joints, this is the place.  You can easily walk around or go a few blocks to get something to eat.  I would typically leave the hotel to eat or grab takeout from somewhere and bring it back.  One oddity I found was that the room did not have an iron\/ironing board.  The staff was real good about bringing one up and I kept it for the time I was there.

Fine, I wish he had been down below and done the actual work to earn the tip, but whatever. For the record, I firmly believe this to be a bald-faced lie, because if the hotel were actually worried about liability they wouldn\u2019t leave the carts alone on the ground floor. Plus, all the other Marriott properties that DO let you use the carts? So stupid.\n* Then, when we finished checking in, he was nowhere to be found and our bags were still sitting on the cart, so we said screw it and carried our bags up ourselves, without the cart. We had multiple delays getting to the hotel and didn\u2019t want to wait anymore.\n* Also, during the check-in, despite having reserved the room with my Bonvoy Amex, which was on-file, but not on my person, and having used this method to pay for MANY rooms over the years and having just used the physical card for incidentals, Edition refused to do this and said the full charge would go on my physical card, which deprived me of a fair number of points.\n* The room was tiny, despite my Titanium status upgrade capability, and even had a sub-par, squeaky inner-spring mattress. It didn\u2019t keep the street noise out, either. It could use some serious upgrades and soundproofing to deserve 5-star status. Finally, despite it only getting up to 80 degrees outside that day, the AC couldn\u2019t cool the room down to 70.\n* On the plus side the Le Labo toiletries are fantastic and if you\u2019re looking for a centrally located, downtown hotel, the location (and view from a high floor) can\u2019t be beat.

We were going to see Tina the Musical and decided to stay at this location in Times Square.  What a huge mistake!!!!!!  The only good thing was we were on the 36th floor and had a great view.  I realize NYC hotel rooms are small, this was beyond small.  Our master bedroom closet is bigger than this room was.  There was no space to put luggage, the \"bathroom\" was a joke.  It was a glass partition with a shower on one side and the commode on the other side, it was awful. If one of was sitting at the desk and we wanted to get by, the person at the desk would have to move or someone would have to walk on the bed to get by. There was no space on the vanity to put anything making it nearly impossible to get ready.  They don't have ice machines, you have to call guest services and they bring ice up to you.  So you have to tip them every time, which is ridiculous!!!\n\nWe went to the bar on the 10th floor just to have a beer and an appetizer.  The menu had a VERY limited selection.  We ordered the cheese plate for $16.  It was like no cheese plate I have ever seen.  Had maybe 10 grapes and extremely small pieces of like 3 cheeses certainly not worth $16.\n\nWe checked out on Sunday the 22nd.  They charge $200 a night for incidentals.  They charged our card $400 and said the charges would be refunded in 3 to 5 business days.  It is now Sunday the 29th and not only have the charges not been refunded,  they have charged the card another $400  as of yesterday.  They are saying that the credit card company has to release the charges, the credit card company says the hotel has not notified them of anything.\n\nWe used points for the stay and I told the manager I felt like the entire stay should be refunded.  He \"generously\" refunded 20,000 points which makes up for NOTHING. Of course those points have not showed up in our account.  We absolutely positively will not stay at this hotel ever again.  This was our first trip back to NYC since Covid and we were really looking forward to this trip The Times Square Edition did NOTHING to make us feel special at all.  The whole mess with the credit card has made it even worse and they apparently doing nothing to fix the problem.  The Edition is a great chain and we have always had great experiences in other locations, but this one does not live up to the customer service we are used to!!!!  There are plenty of other great hotels in Times Square, do not waste your money at this property.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

I wasn\u2019t crazy about staying in Times Square (I hate TS), but it ended up being fine. I had read many reviews on this hotel prior to staying, so was kind of prepared for the experience. The doormen on the ground level entrance were friendly and always with a greeting and a smile. Once you enter the hotel the scent that so many have talked about subtly hits you. I loved it. Check in was fast and super friendly and I was offered bottled water. I went early expecting to store my bag, but I was allowed an early check-in which is always appreciated. I can\u2019t say enough about the sleek, modern design of the hotel. I truly loved it. It has a sexy, youthful Miami Beach vibe that was wonderful. Elevators are always available and whisk you up to your room. I booked through a third party and was hopeful for a small upgrade, but prepared for just an entry level room. I try to book through the Marriott app when I can, but the price difference through the third party was about half of what the Marriott rate was, so third party it was. I was given a king room on the 15th floor with a very nice view of Times Square. The room was spotless and, again, very sleek with a minimalist approach to design. Extras that you expect in 5 star properties were there: robes, mini-bar, steamer, and bottled water. I loved the Le Labo toiletries, also with the hotel\u2019s signature scent. The bed was incredibly comfortable with very nice linens. The bathroom was partially connected to the room with just a curtain from the wash basin area. The toilet and shower are in stalls with frosted glass doors. It was actually one of the larger hotel rooms that I\u2019ve had in Manhattan. Not large, by any means compared to hotel rooms in other cities, but for NYC quite allright. No turndown service was ever offered, but I never requested it either. Housekeeping was invisible and very efficient. Once, while waiting on an elevator on the 10th floor lobby, I was asked by a gentleman how my stay was going. I thought he was just another guest being friendly, but it turns out he was the GM of the hotel. I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant every morning of my 3 night stay. The restaurant is truly beautiful, service good and the food I would describe as good, not great, but overall fine. My stay was perfect until the last night of my stay, which was a Saturday night. Around 11:30 pm I noticed that there was a lot of noise below the room. At first I thought it was just the revelry from Times Square on a Saturday night, but once I tried to go to sleep I realized it was coming from inside the hotel. The hotel nightclub was evidently below my room and the noise level was obnoxious. Thumping bass, a DJ on a PA system and shrieking party goers made it absolutely impossible to sleep. I finally realized that falling asleep was not going to happen and called the front desk. The receptionist was genuinely apologetic and offered to send up earplugs or allow me to move to a different room for sleeping. I tried the earplugs, which did nothing, and finally at 2:30 am I asked for keys to another room. They were promptly sent up and I walked up to the new room and finally was able to get some sleep. The next morning I called and spoke with a manager and voiced my complaint of why on earth they would have someone occupy that room on a Saturday night. He was apologetic, but the damage was done. I asked for 60k Marriott points (which I thought was very reasonable) which is the equivalent to one nights stay in the hotel. He granted this without hesitation. I checked out later that morning and went to the Ritz Carlton Central Park. Luckily, I wasn\u2019t dragging from little sleep, so I was still able to still enjoy my vacation the next day. I would definitely return to this hotel, but would be very wary of room assignment, especially if you\u2019re staying on a Saturday night. The unfortunate incident still didn\u2019t effect my overall impression of the hotel too much, as the rest of the stay was perfect. A stunning hotel with fantastic service, just get a higher floor (there are 39) if staying over on a Saturday night. I\u2019ll be back.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

And God help you if there are two or more of you per room. There is no bathroom really, just an open plan counter top with a sink and two glass cupboards - one with a toilet, the other with a shower. But this is Midtown New York and it is a brand new hotel. I didn\u2019t really expect much else. \n\nStaff were variable. Some appeared flustered and impatient when asked to do something (note to Marriott: this is marketed as a luxury tier property, I don\u2019t care how trendy it is). Others were sweet and thoughtful, like the one who gave me a 39th floor room to celebrate my 39th birthday. \n\nThe B&O speaker is a nice luxury touch - rather than the cheap Bluetooth speakers you normally get in hotels.

The Le Labo toiletries are decent. The bedding is good. \n\nThe bar and restaurant were pretty dead, which is surprising for a new place in New York. Didn\u2019t eat or drink there but perhaps better in warmer weather. \n\nThe gym is decent, well stocked and has a great view - which is a genuinely rare and luxury touch.

We had a 17th floor corner balcony suite.  The view was great-- looking directly down 47th Avenue to the river.  The rooms are meticulously designed with every detail considered.  Our suite had a large soaker tub, separate shower, and heated floors in the bathroom.  Beds were very comfortable.  The automatic drapes were a nice touch. Staff was very responsive, especially housekeeping.  Breakfast at the Terrace was very special the first day as we were sat on the terrace, but the second day in the dining room, the service declined.  The food quality was consistently good.  It would have been nice to have a few kid-friendly options on the breakfast menu....a waffle, some cereal perhaps?  There were no room service menus to be found, not on the app, not on the website, not on the TV...so we never ordered.  Too many options right outside. We found it odd that there was no coffee in the lobby in the morning.  The in-room Nespresso machines are convenient, but not the same as a hot cup of joe.  The rooms are noisy.  No question about it.  And ours had a huge digital billboard right outside, so even with the blackout drapes there was plenty of light to read with all the lights turned off.  I would suggest the hotel include a sleep mask and earplugs in the welcome kit.  We bought our own at Duane Reed.  This hotel is a great location for seeing everything in midtown.  We will definitely stay again, but may sacrifice the view for a bit better sleep quality.  ","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I flew solo into town on a whim to see Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett at Radio City. I had two main criteria when I was booking my hotel: that I could easily (and safely!) walk to Radio City and that there was at least one in-house source of food. It's crazy how many hotels in the city still haven't reopened their restaurants and I wanted to be able to get a meal without leaving my hotel if I had to. \n\nWhen I discovered the Edition, I was immediately drawn to the photos I saw of The Terrace bar\/restaurant. It was stunning! It was just as beautiful in person, and I really enjoyed the dinner and drinks I had there!  The service was great and everyone was very attentive. I also had drinks in the lobby bar a couple of times and enjoyed that space as well. There is an outdoor option for drinks and food at the Terrace as well as a small outdoor space for drinks off of the lobby bar. Especially from a COVID perspective, it was great to have the option to enjoy a meal or a beverage outside.\n\nThe rooms are very small, but as a solo traveler, I didn't mind! They are very comfortable and welcoming. I loved the artfully draped throw blanket- it makes it seem so cozy! The rooms are designed to maximize the space you do have and the storage solutions in the room are creative and get the job done. \n\nThe location of the hotel can't be beaten! I booked a high floor superior room with a view of Times Square and ended up on the 30th floor. It was very quiet up there and I could also see out to the Hudson River, which was lovely! It was a quick walk to Radio City and I felt very safe, which was so important as a solo female traveler!\n\nI got room service breakfast the morning I was flying home and it was insanely good. I STILL think about the pancake I had, that's how delicious it was!\n\nThis hotel is a gem and I can't wait to return! I'm actually heading back in a couple of months and bringing my daughter along for a fun mother\/daughter trip. I looked at a few other hotels with slightly bigger rooms for that trip, but I quickly came to realize that the location, convenience, and service of this one are unparalleled anywhere in the city.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

I found this hotel and I was soooo happy the moment I walked into my room on the 21st floor overlooking Times Square.  We stayed Friday to Monday, so there was plenty of action the entire time.  Some noise at night which quickly faded.  The housekeeping did an amazing job cleaning our room... not even a droplet of water would be left in the shower, replacing all the toiletries and wiping the entire room bathroom sink clean.  The whole hotel has this lovely scent, which I believe is their signature scent that is also in their toiletries.  I could smell it from down the block when I walked towards the hotel.  The staff is friendly, courteous and helpful... walking down the block to hail us a taxi whenever we needed one.  Always greeted us with a smile.\n\nRooms are small as you expect NYC but it was so efficiently designed with clean lines and great storage solutions.  If you love modern and minimalistic designs you will love it here.  The entire place is immaculate.\n\nWe had room service and ate at the hotel restaurant, and it was all amazing.  It's gourmet food, freshly prepared and plated up so elegantly.  Even the coffee there was 5 star and I am a coffee connaisseur.  I only drink dark roasted, ground coffee and I was pleasantly surprised.  The food quality is superb here.  Most hotel food tastes like it came out of a box, but that is not the case here.  It is a tad expensive, 18% gratuity automatically added for room service.  They come right back and get your tray when you are done eating, which keeps the place clean in the rooms and hallways free of bugs like I see in other hotels when food hangs around too long.\n\nEven though the hotel starts on 10th floor, the elevators were super quick going up and down.  Can't beat this location either 47th & 7th, walk out to everything - food, starbucks, Disney Store, Friedman's, Big Bus Tour pickup at the corner, street entertainment.  EVERYTHING.  \n\nFoot police presence made me feel very secure as a tourist.

At least these are new and well thought out, although they could lose some of the furniture that takes up valuable space.

I am a former NYC resident so this is generally an area I avoid. Circumstances on this trip required that I be in the Time Square area. This place seemed nice and offered a \"2 Bedroom\" apartment. The room wasn't really a two-bedroom. Rather, it was just two separate hotel rooms that then had a third door you had to enter before you could enter either hotel room. Odd but fine. The rooms are nice and I particularly like the showers. These aren't that ridiculous but popular European style so common in hotels across NYC in which water goes all over the bathroom floor because only half the shower is covered. These showers have full coverage so kudos to the designer. Beds are comfortable and both rooms had good views into Time Square. The service is lackluster. One day our rooms weren't cleaned at all and when I arrived home at 6:00PM, I had to have call down for house keeping. When then left for dinner and when we arrived back all house keeping had done was sloppily throw the covers back on the bed and rearrange a few things. For multiple days, staff kept leaving garbage\/dirty glassware\/2 day old room service. Even once I would call down, they would still come up and leave the room unfinished...still leaving dirty glassware or not replacing used items, such as shampoo. On another occasion, staff left a cleaning rack of some sort in the room and in the other room left dirty black cleaning gloves. I've attached pictures of what the room would look like once staff was called to come clean the rooms again...\n\nDrinks at the bar were excellent, though the food we tried was terrible. The chicken bites at the bar had so much inedible gristle in them, we didn't eat very many...After those, we went elsewhere for food.","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"NONE"}

If you book a suite or get upgraded to a suite it sounds like you will have a great experience.  \n\nThe check in process wasn't bad.  You basically enter on the street in a dark nothing room and are taken via elevator to a swanky Miami feel check in desk.   It was incredibly crowded with people everywhere.  Just sitting around.  It was after normal check in but felt like a hotel where everyone was waiting for their rooms.  I found out later the rooms are so ridiculously small people just hang out in the lobby.   \n\nI was told at check in that all of the suites had already been sold.  In fact you could purchase one online.  I am Ambassador with Marriott but was told they would not upgrade me for the 1 night.   I found out later they had already upgraded \"their allotment\" and they would rather a room be vacant than upgrade me.   It was infuriating.\n\nI figured that the room however would be nice as I was given a \"Time Square View\" and this was an Edition Luxury hotel at a pretty hefty price.  I was insanely wrong.   The room was hysterically small even for NYC.   There was no bathroom, there was a tiny glass box with a toilet and one with a shower.   A sink was in front of those two rooms with a curtain around it.   The closets were insanely tiny.   I am a small guy but you still had to kind of scoot around the room.  This room was designed for only 1 person.  The view as nice....  BUT the noise was unbearable.   Horns, sirens, people screaming all night long.  \n\nWhen I went to the lobby to have a drink it was over-run with people trying to get out of their rooms like me.  I was told of the great outdoor space at the restaurant lounge area yet that was closed off with the blinds pulled tight.  I was told it was because of falling ice.  \n\nThe only saving grace of the property is the proximity to the theater district and Time Square entertainment. \n\nI would never stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The room, while small, was very nice and comfortable.\n\nThe reason for the lower rating is because I got sick from eating the pork belly at the bar (one level below the lobby).  My tummy did not react well to it and i started getting sick about 4-5 hours after eating it and that night was painful.  I let the duty manager next day know, who was very nice and professional about it.  The only other time my tummy has reacted so violently to food was once in India.\n\nThe location at Times Square can be a positive or negative based on your perspective.  Factor in some extra time when leaving for the airport as the street is one-way (west bound) leading into Times Square and so you to get through that mess before you can start heading away from it.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My husband and I stayed here one night, this past Saturday.  I rarely write reviews and this might be my first hotel review ever.  My husband has worked for Marriott for close to 20 years and we've stayed in their hotels all around the world.  From the moment we arrived to our departure, it was nice people helping us with the door, elevators, checking in and out, and making reservations at their Terrace restaurant.  Every. single. person. was  so lovely.  \n\nThe room was bright and modern.  I will say, the rooms are on the small side, but that isn't surprising for midtown Manhattan.  The bathroom is a bit more of an open concept than we typically enjoy, but it was fine.  Everything was clean.  The toiletries they offer are quite floral in scent.  I enjoyed them but I did think this are not particularly neutral, so I'm not sure how universal they would be to all that would use them.  I generally think that men tend to use the provided toiletries more than women and I think the scent might be off-putting to many.  By no means a deal breaker, just a note.  \n\nThe hotel has a \"destination fee\" of 35 dollars a night, which you can use towards food and drink at one of their restaurants.  During an intermission at the UCB Theater show, I called to see if we could get a reservation for one hour from then, 9pm, so we could enjoy the chocolate souffle at the Terrace Restaurant.  The host I spoke to on the phone was so helpful and cheery when we met at the restaurant shortly thereafter- I wish I remembered his name!  They were able to accommodate us in their lush and green room which was a lovely end to our night.

It certainly plunges one into the heart of lively Manhattan and from our room window we could see some of the flashing neon signs if we chose.  While the hotel literature describes this as \"explosive\", trying to get to the hotel and into it around 9 on a Saturday night was a headache. The hotel has a very popular nightclub with lines out the door but the doormen were there to help guide us through the throngs and run interference for us to the elevators.  Crossing Times Ssquare at that hour is also difficult but it certainly gives one the flavor of New York City at its most tourist-y frenetic.  The interior of the hotel is plain and serene (when one gets to the lobby floor, the 10th, and out of the line for the nightclub.  The king room we had was small, as most New York hotels are because of the value of real estate, but very attractive and spare.  The bed and pillows were wonderfully comfortable; bath towels were plentiful and thick and nicely absorbent.  The shower is dual, one waterfall from the ceiling and another a hand held that was a sleek looking but at times awkward to manage wand.  Closet space is very small, with 20% of the space taken up by two lovely bathrobes (couldn't they have put those on a shelf to give us more room for our clothes?).  If two people occupying the room had hung up all of their clothes and their winter coats they would not have fit in the small closet.  There are two drawers total with none at the bedside, part, no doubt, of the desire for spare design.  But that meant we had to put items on the nightstand ledge and also on the ledge along one wall that doubles as a desk--that means more clutter, not less, as part of the overall ambiance.  There are charging ports and plugs in abundance (hooray) in keeping with the target demographic I am guessing.  Only on our third day when we read the small print in the hotel brochure inside the folder did we learn that some of the waste bins were for recycling and others were for waste.  (Why not discreetly label them?).  And while we were urged to re-use our towels by hanging them back up there was only ONE SMALL hook in the whole room and no towel bars.  Hanging up two bath towels, two wash cloths and two hand towels on one small hook is laughable.\nThere is a lovely Nespresso coffee pot but it is so jammed in to the mini bar that it was difficult to operate\/hard to get the water container in and out without dripping a bit on the bottles and items in the mini bar. My conclusion is that design (and perhaps economy) trumped comfort for customers when the hotel was created.\n\nOn the other hand I cannot say enough about how nice, helpful, friendly and pleasant the staff were from the reception staff to the housekeepers to the doormen.  The staff made the stay.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I also witnessed him handle a very needy client in the most kind professional manner! Our room was amazing with amazing views, the restaurants and the club that were right there in the hotel were  the best I had ever been to, especially in time square. The club the hottest club to get into which of course we had no problem because we were staying there. When we went out to the street we saw people in line to get in. There were performers along with great Security, I felt totally safe! The staff could not  do enough for us! There  was the beautiful hand written note that came with our amenity that was more than just a short sentiment from Andren. There was the housekeeper Tenzin Rabgyal that I had to get coffee from that just was the most professional, courteous and kind housekeeper I\u2019ve ever met. Then there was our check out which we were blessed to Vladimir again who took care of a small issue for us immediately. Finally on our way out in the middle of a sleet storm there was Aaron  who negotiated a reasonable price and put us in a suburban safely to the airport all while he walked us to the car with an umbrella. I can go on and on but this truly was the best stay for me, from the property to the staff who went above and beyond, to the amenities.

Doormen were rarely available to open the ridiculously heavy doors (often chatting with each other or flirting with guests.

One of our rooms had a disgusting odor which I'm guessing was the body odor of the previous guest.  We spoke to someone in housekeeping who quickly sent someone up - the solution was to mask the smell temporarily with a putrid spray and then open our window in the middle of winter!!! (Window had to stay open all 3 days as the smell never lessened)\n3.The staff in the lobby bar and amongst the rudest and low-quality\/trained I've ever dealt with.  We waited 25 minutes and asked 3 separate times for our order to be taken.  Finally a nasty waitress came over and said, \"So what's up?\" What's up? We want drinks!  She made no apologies and was very direct in letting us know she could care less how long we waited.  NICE!!! \n4. I spoke to the manager who seemed shocked and offered to buy us a round of drinks- by that time we were so disgusted with the entire scene we decided to just go up to our stinky room and call it a night. (Also infuriating was that the night manager told me the general manager would be calling me on Saturday to discuss what had happened in the bar that night- BIG SURPRISE- NO CALL)\n5. I wanted to surprise my friends with chilled Champagne waiting in the room.  However, the concierge, who was French, sent up ice buckets and champagne glasses but NEVER PUT THE CHAMPAGNE ON ICE!!! So when we got to the room we had 2 warm bottles of Champagne and lots of ice.  Did I mention she was French?\n6.One of my friends just MOVED a candy bar in the mini-bar and we were charged $10.  To clarify- the candy was not eaten, just moved slightly!\n7. Rooms are tiny.  We normally stay at the Westin or W- and will do so in the future.

The staff was impeccably trained, customer service was world class, and the property was outstanding. There are not any negatives I can give. (Some people have complained about the size of the rooms in other reviews, and I did have a corner suite, but this IS New York City and small rooms are the norm.)\n\nThe location is ideal, with my room overlooking Times Square with ceiling to floor windows. Noise early in the evening was a problem, but was never a problem at night. The beds were very comfortable, housekeeping was incredible, and the bathroom and shower was wonderful. \n\nWe did eat at the terrace restaurant, and it was great. In full disclosure, there is $35\/day location fee, but you get this back in food and beverage credit (including room service) so we got our money's worth.\n\nOverall, I have stayed at the best in NYC, and this is as fine as any property I have stayed at, and has the best location of the bunch. Highly recommend, and I am a very seasoned traveler with 30-50 stays per year for work and business.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Ask for a room not overlooking Times Square unless you want neon lights flashing through your curtains.\n2. Use the laundry and food \/ beverage $50 and $35 daily credit from the day you arrive - they are not applicable on the day of departure- that way you get value out of the destination fee .\n3. Always access the hotel when walking from 6th Avenue - that way you avoid the zoo on 7th Avenue \/Times Square.\nBut the very best recommendation of them all , my wife , who can be fussy , would like to stay there again if the opportunity arose .","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I\u2019m loyal to Marriott as Platinum Elite.  This is my first stay at the Edition.  Here\u2019s my ranking of the 4 hotels nearby I\u2019ve stayed at recently.  I try to stay at <$300\/night.  \n\nWestin Times Square\nTimes Square Edition \nW Times Square\nSheraton Times Square \n\nLocation:  44th and 7th Ave.  It\u2019s one block off Times Square, which amazingly cuts down on the noise level a lot.  \n\nLobby\/Common Area:  Like many NYC hotels, lobby is not at the street level.  The lobby bar and common area is open and very serene.  There is also an outdoor garden.  It felt like an oasis in the middle of Times Square. \n\nResort fee:  Hotel charges a $35 amenities fee, which you get as a credit for food and beverage at the Restaurant or lobby bar. \n\nRoom:  Platinum upgrade was to a \u201cTimes Square\u201d view room.  Because it\u2019s on 7th, you can see the lights but surprisingly quiet.  Room is average in size for NYC, but very well appointed and Lux feeling.  King size bed with faux fur throw,  club chair, desk and open sink.  Separate stalls for toilet and shower.  Awesome Le Labo bath amenities.  Robe and slippers.   The room was very comfortable for one person, might feel a little cramped for 2 people. \n\nRestaurant:  the main restaurant is one floor below lobby level and was very quiet during breakfast.  \n\nOverall,  a very good stay and will be back.  This feels more like a boutique hotel and more exclusive.  The Westin rooms and bathrooms are larger and includes full breakfast at the restaurant for Platinum Elite.  I will likely flip between these two hotels based on price. \n","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I principali punti di forza sono rappresentati dalla posizione strategica e il design della struttura e delle camere. La nostra camera era una Premier Room situata ai piani pi\u00f9 alti dell\u2019hotel con vista su Times Square: la stanza era ben arredata, molto pulita, silenziosa e con un letto king-size davvero comodo e un bagno con doccia. L\u2019armadio era abbastanza spazioso anche se, a mio parere, sarebbe necessario prevederne un secondo. Il servizio di Couverture \u00e8 eseguito ogni sera e prevede, tra le altre cose, anche la fornitura di bottiglie di acqua per la notte. Molto gentili e disponibili i portieri all\u2019ingresso dell\u2019hotel e il personale del Guest Experience Team (in particolare la Sig.ra Suki che ringraziamo nuovamente per il benvenuto a noi riservato); molto meno cordiale il personale addetto al check-in \/ Concierge e il personale di servizio al Lobby Bar e al ristorante The Terrace. \nColazione e cena presso The Terrace buone ma al di sotto delle nostre aspettative, considerando l'elevato prezzo pagato.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":13451795,"title":"Nice But Not Worth the Price","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-10-31","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We spent a recent weekend at the new Edition, and the biggest pluses are a great location a block from the trains and the chaos of Times Square and some nice public areas with garden-like greenery and views over Times Square. Negatives include sky-high prices for cubicle-like rooms. We booked the highest-priced room below the ones with private balconies, and the extra big bucks gave us a partial view over Times Square, a bed that we discovered to our dismay had a quilt bearing a huge stain from a prior guest (the hotel replaced it at our request, but it's hard to unsee something like that), and a tiny bathroom featuring a toilet divided from the shower and the rest of the bathroom by a barely opaque and think barrier that seemed to be the same material used for a hard floor mat. Neither coffee nor bathroom amenities were replaced the second day. Elevators are burdensome--to access our room, we usually had to wait in a queue at the hotel's entrance, often with significant waits for an elevator with space, to first go five floors to the lobby. Then, we had to do the same thing to take a different set of elevators to our room. It may not seem like much, but once you have to do that several times over the course of the day, you feel like your in gridlock instead of cruising along. I really hate the \"Destination Fees\" that hotels love to charge these days--here, it's $35.00 per day. The friendly receptionist informed us that we could use that towards food or beverages at the hotel, with the exception of one of the \"hot\" nightlife spots on the property. What she did not mention was that the $35.00 credit was only good for the first and second day of the stay, not our final day, and if the day's $35.00 was not used on it's issuance day, it could not be carried over. Our first day's $35.00 was thus useless since we checked in at midnight. And we were unpleasantly surprised that our $70.00 breakfast on our day of departure was billed to us (the hotel later agreed to remove the charge but only after lecturiing me about rules I should know on future visits). Another point in favor of the hotel is that our requested late checkout (based on Bonvoy Platinum status) was honored, and that's a huge benefit for travelers with late flights. We do a lot of weekends or longer stays in New York, and many other upper-end properties, including in and around Times Square, offer greater value and comfort.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Food is excellent and rooms well equipped albeit small even by NY standards. What doesn\u2019t work is the ridiculous lift system - to get to breakfast you have to take two different lifts. Also incredibly, if your room overlooks Times Square, there are no blackout curtains so it is like being in a flashing neon light show all night. Also due to the construction projects on both sides of 47th St, the traffic is snarled up. Finally, Marriott need to get a grip of their environmental standards - laundry is returned in more plastic than currently resides in the world\u2019s oceans.

For this reason alone, I would not stay here again.  A NYC Hotel should always have a doorman and security.  Perhaps the doorman we\u2019re away getting a taxi,  but no luxury hotel should be without security EVER in this city, especially in Times Square. \n\nSee the photo of the bathroom.  In the increasing competitiveness of NYC luxury hotels, bathrooms are large and extravagant.  Not here.  The bathroom is more than tiny and a curtain separates the room from the bathroom.  So if you want to sleep while another is using the bathroom, you will be awaken.\n\nSee the size of the room!  For this price, this is just not acceptable.  As a frequent guest as luxury hotels, I have never been in a room smaller for the money.\n\nOn balance, if you want Times Square and a well designed  HOTEL, the Edition is attractive.  But just understand the limitations of the design,where the bathroom allows little privacy, and the size of the room is tiny.\n\nP.S. I notified management of the lack of security.

The standard room is beautiful (all white) but pretty small and the bathroom is not a separate room so there is little privacy.  Some nice features include wonderful slippers and robes, a clothes steamer, good lighting, lots of outlets, and nice hair dryer.  Room service was excellent and speedy.  Everyone I encountered was extremely gracious and service oriented.  The fine dining restaurant was also a lovely destination with excellent ambiance (great date spot), very good food and service.

I am happy to report that it was one of the best service experiences, hotel or otherwise, that I\u2019ve had in a long time. The entire team - from the front desk, to the restaurant staff, to housekeeping - was welcoming, accommodating, and made us feel special at every turn. Suki and the rest of the guest experience team went above and beyond - although, while we felt like we were treated as if we were the only ones in the hotel, I got the sense that every guest is treated with this kind of personal focus, and that it is just the way they operate. Special call out to Brian at the front desk who warmly welcomed us - he set the tone, which the rest of the staff kept going. \n\nI have traveled a decent amount so have a pretty extensive sample of hotel experiences - I would put this in the top tier. To top it off, I realized two days after checking out that I left my brand new Apple Ear Pods I\u2019m the room. The room decor is a clean white - a beautiful and soothing retreat from the intensity  of Times Square, but also serves as camouflage for Apple white!  The hotel team found the ear pods and put them aside in lost and found - one would hope this would always be the case, but rarely have I left something in a hotel room and been able to retrieve it. Just another example of the exceptional service level at this hotel, across the entire experience. Thanks Suki and team!!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our experience was absolutely fabulous and exceeded all expectation for sure. Firstly, I would like to thank personally Suki Scott, Director Guest Experiences, for utmost personal touch and generous treats on my daughter's birthday, for personal time and attention prior and throughout our stay, I want to thank the whole staff starting from the reception and to the room service (Zonnie especially) who were readily available in no time matter to our slightest questions and requests, to waiters at the multiple dining lounges and restaurants available to the utmost convenience right at the hotel (beautiful outdoor terraces are not to be missed since they are true oasis right at the very heart of Manhattan). The only thing I wish for , would be for more time to stay and continue our EDITION adventure. Definitely outstanding hotel (I know you might read in other reviews that the rooms are small...well...bare in mind you are in NYC and right at Times Square  and if you spend too much time in the room , it is probably mostly in bed, and they are fabulous! PS so are showers and toiletries btw,) Also I found amazing that we had plenty of complimentary water and of course loved our twice a day room service (second being -getting ready your bed for the nighttime). All in all...As many times as we have stayed in NYC  previously, never ever had we have such a perfect in each and every way, stay and having this experience for such a special celebration will definitely be the main reason for us from now on to come back here again and again. (I have to tell you that the soundproof window system in rooms is amazing and we could not hear a thing of city noise with windows closed). So once again , thank you, everybody at EDITION for a very memorable amazing stay!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

My family of four had a heckuva UBER from the airport and as soon as we pulled up the Crew of Aaron and other great doormen carefully grabbed our bags and welcomed us inside. This would be normal at any hotel I suppose, however, I noticed our doorman checking the UBER seats front and back to make sure we didn't forget anything. As soon as we entered the main entrance we had the best feeling of relaxation. 100 degrees out with added humidity, noise of Times Square was instantly gone. Replaced was a pleasant smell and refreshing temp.\n We were early for check in and was greeted not as an early burden for staff, but as them thankful for us being there. As soon as I approached the desk the staff asked if we could use some cold water. (I must have looked sticky) He put a call out to the maid service and said he'd call within 20 min. Our bags secured at the desk, left us to wander around the very modern public areas and found a spot on the balcony near the bar. Incredible view!10 min later we were headed up to our room with our doorman still in tow with bags who placed our bags where we'd like in the room. The rooms are New York size, but the use of space is great. Bathrooms are the perfect size and gave plenty of space for us. The lighting is unlike any place I've stayed. Very creative controls that let you control the several lighting arrangements. Comfortable beds and linens and extremely quiet. We never heard another door shut or another guest. We saw them in the halls but never heard a peep. \nOur coming and leaving the hotel was a pleasure visiting briefly with staff who remembered our names and always ended every interaction with can I help you or can I get you somewhere? Riley and his team at the front desk were all so great. \nUpon checking out we said aloud that we will miss the hotel fragrance. Boom,we were given some take home swag. \nFrom the greeting to the checkout our stay was fantastic and Aaron the doorman even hooked us up with a great ride back to the airport in a luxury SUV for the price of an UBER. Well done everyone, we will be back.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel is a few blocks from my office, so it was convenient to be able to walk in to the office.\n\nThe room is small (though that in itself is normal for NYC). The toiletries are Le Labo, so that is great. I wasn't a huge fan of the room design itself. There was only one hook in the entire room. There is basically no desk--it is just a long table that has a chair. This made working from the room inconvenient. I also wasn't a fan of the split toilet\/shower design.\n\nI was a little irritated with the front desk. I asked for late check out and was not given it. A colleague, however, asked 15 minutes later and received it (and he has no Marriott status while I do).

She made my milestone birthday something out of my wildest dreams.  Everyone is extremely friendly and accommodating at this brand new hotel.  The food is delicious. The hotel is spotless and downright gleams!  So many outdoor spaces.  Such elegance without ever being pretentious.  The room we had (corner balcony Times Square view) was exceptional.

Again, we have been very lucky to have had so many great hotel experiences over the past 20 years together, some local and some in more remote locales and even in other countries.  But, something about this staycation definitely warranted a review and I am here to say that we LOVE the Times Square Edition and plan to keep returning whenever we can to experience an oasis of luxury and serenity high above the hustle and bustle of Times Square!

My kids were told every day that it was only available on different counters  who then said not it was a different counter ... not sure why a high end hotel would embarrass it clients in this way and should just increase the hotel rate. Just assume you will be paying $37 extra a night and if you manage to use the credit that\u2019s only a bonus so you don\u2019t spoil your trip by focussing too much on this charge. \n\nOther than that and size of room nice hotel with good staff and so if I was watching a lot of shows or intending to spend a lot of time at Times Square it\u2019s a good base. \n\n(Also note there is no parking - it\u2019s all kerbside drop off and collect )","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

A newly-minted Edition property, this Time Square property possessed all the characteristics that make Edition hotels great. The architecture - perfect. The lobby, super-cool complete with succulent wall, cocktail lounge, and outside terrace.  Inside, for cold days, the perfect fireplace lounge invites one to sit down and sip cognac, which is exactly what we did one cold day in April. The rooms, while small, offer all amenities in a thoughtfully- and intelligently-designed layout.  No space wasted, the queen room I occupied offered quite a few tips and tricks for New Yorkers to espouse in their apartments.  The mini-bar, espresso maker, snack station combined intelligent placement with tasty and space-efficient choices. The closet, rather than containing a cumbersome ironing board and iron held a hand steamer instead.  A full-wall desk also doubled as vanity and table.  We did not eat there, but did enjoy the cocktail fireside lounge, and I am sure the food must be good.  We had great service, and I recognized the doorman from the mid-town Ritz property, taking on a new challenge in the excitement of Times Square.

Upon checking in, (I originally booked the best of their King Room), I was absolutely shocked how TINY the room was, the bell boy was very nice offered where to leave the luggage... my response was \u201cWhere can you possibly leave your suitcases?\u201d (I have 2 Rimowa, and there is literally NO space to even open them!) In USA, everything was in square feet, and I had no idea... its just a 20sqm room with bathroom all built in... you cannot literally do anything in that room, I couldn\u2019t breathe. I then requested a upgrade (which I paid additional) at US$1200 per night plus taxes and destination fees, upgraded to the suite, which was really just an oversized King Room by hotels in Asia standard... there is nothing special to it, but the place is so noisy, it is so loud that you hear everything, traffic, fire trucks and loud noises all day long and all night long (till about 3am)... they only give you one small bottle of water complimentary and you have to buy all the bottled waters at $8 each. The hotel manager charged my card with the pre-auth amount, subsequently they took a further $12000 out of my card on 6 separate authorisations, (total almost $30k they locked away), this was done without my authorisation, and without any notice to me... the bank blocked the card as they considered it was a suspicious transaction... I tried to speak to the hotel manager, many calls over 4 days, they did not call back, nor reply, NOT EVEN ONCE!  My door was left open after daily clean TWICE during my stay with my valuables still inside... luckily i didnt lose anything (that i m aware of)... I asked for a late check out... they were kind enough to offer me just HALF HOUR while my hotel bill was AUD$19,000! Upon check out, I asked the manager about all the problems, he did not seem to understand, didnt seem to care, and clearly didnt know what service meant.. there was no apology... but just arrogance. UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS HOTEL. \n\nSo if you dont mind bad service, baby size rooms, and all day long noise.. then go for it... \n\nI cannot believe a hotel could get away with the size of room like that and still call themselves 5 star!

However unless you are in a suite the rooms are extremely tiny. In the suites while they are unbelievably visually pleasing, they were not remotely planned properly. There is hardly any storage space and you will have to live out of your suitcases. There is exactly one small drawer and one small cabinet. The staff is super friendly but if you have a problem no one knows what to do. This property is newly opened and hopefully they will fix that issue. There is also A major nightclub on property and on the weekends you will have to deal with that. The crowd for the night club also overtakes the lobby bar so as a guest you will not be able to enjoy it. Also the new structure is not properly soundproofed and you should expect to be woken up with noise at approximately 6 AM. If you truly want a luxury experience and expect one this is not the hotel for you. I agree with the other negative reviews I recently read.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Has a few decks with great views of it. Very comfortable room with lots of nice amenities like robes, slippers, free water, free shoe shine, etc. Most of the rooms are small, but don\u2019t really feel that way. The rooms have open bathrooms which means the shower, sink and toilet all open out to the room. A bit awkward if you like privacy while showering and using the toilet. There is a curtain you can pull that blocks the bed from the bathroom and door. Still a bit strange. The rainforest shower was great and most of the staff we meet were nice with some exceptions. The fitness room was good but they advertise a great outside stretching deck that was closed every time I went. Very disappointing. \n\n#1 reason for the terrible rating is the Destination Fee and poor service at the end of the trip. The hotel charges you $35 plus $5.17 in taxes per night for Destination Fees. Something Marriott Int likes to do now at it\u2019s full service NYC hotels to make more money off you. The credits you get for food, laundry and a few other things (see picture of the card they give you) expire at midnight each day, not the next morning at checkout. So if you arrive late that first day (10:30pm for us) the $35 just goes into their pocket. The SoulCycle class is not near the hotel and only for 1 person so not very useful. I used the $50 in laundry credit on one of the days since it was offered. Worked fine except they never replaced the rooms laundry bag or order sheet. Seems the didn\u2019t want me to take advantage of that again. NYC has so many great restaurants that we enjoy, forcing us to eat at the hotel each day was disappointing and also impossible to have one good meal for $35. If they let you accumulate the credit so you can just eat one meal there would be ideal. The food options are not great. Ate at the lobby bar and the waitstaff seemed annoyed to help you. Wanted to remove an item from one of the sandwiches and was told we couldn\u2019t cause everything is \u201cpre-made and just heated up\u201d. Tasted like that too. On our last night we tried to eat at the main restaurant but found out the entire place was closed for a private event with no notice, really screwing up our night. You talk to the managers and they just don\u2019t seem to care.  The Destination Fees are just a money grab and a major pain for the guests. \n\nI will do my best to never stay at a Marriott Int hotel that charges these insane fees again. Shame on Edition and Marriott Int for treating your guests so poorly.  Make these \u201cadded values\u201d optional if they are so great. Or easier to use, they end up leaving you with a bitter taste about the hotel and company. \n\n ","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I liked the vibe, the commitment to the guest experience, and the high-end, modern fit and finish. The Times Square Edition is a different story. Perhaps this should be expected, but the vibe at the Times Square Edition is not serene and chill as was the case in NoMad. This Edition is aiming to be a nightclub, and it seems to achieve its goal. The elevator situation is a mess--at one point, of the three elevators to the lobby from the ground floor, two were roped off--yes, actually roped off--and reserved for guests headed to the nightclub below the lobby. This left me--a guest of the hotel--waiting over 5 minutes for the one elevator that was, at least allegedly, reserved for people headed the lobby (when I got in, the elevator stopped at the nightclub and picked up a load of drunk 20-somethings headed for the lobby, so I guess the elevator wasn't really reserved as I was told). The elevator situation wasn't an isolated incident. Everyone working at the hotel seemed more interested in the fact that is an entertainment venue than a hotel.

I would like to give kudos to Fernando, Jerome, and Joey, all of whom had excellent customer service. I only hope other hotels in the city take note of the Editions' exemplary customer service and hire individuals such as these men, who go the extra mile. I enjoyed my breakfast at the Terrace restaurant on the 9th floor. The restaurant is stunning, you truly feel transported from Times Square (kind of reminiscent in my mind of Miami Beach\/French Riviera). I am only sorry that I was too tired at night to have cocktails on their beautiful outdoor porch. I will be back, and will make a point to utilize this space next time. Also, as others have noted this hotel smells beautiful. I would buy that scent if they sold it and spray around my house and office. So to summarize, I highly recommend this new gem in Times Square.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel had only been open a few days when my partner and I booked a long weekend away to explore the city. Shortly after we booked, we were contacted by a representative of the hotel to gather details to enhance our stay. We mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary, and arrived to a chef-prepared treat and free champagne. \n\nThe room was small but beautiful with a fabulously comfortable bed. The hotel\u2019s bar has delicious items to gnosh on. I highly recommend breakfast. Their kouign-amann is made in house, and delightful.

Each night when we made it back to the room, there was turndown service and a lovely note. \nAesthetically, this hotel was beautiful. The decor was sleek and exquisite without looking fussy and overdone. \nThe saying, \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d held true here. We relaxed with a friend in the cozy dining area and had great wine. We also spent some time just relaxing by the fire. \nWe will be back to the hotel because it became such a wonderful part of the trip to NY. They knew it was my birthday celebration and first trip to the city and they left a nice note and dessert in the room during turndown service. \nOh- and the towels. They were like plush clouds. The bed was comfortable and the view of Times Square at night was amazing. We could see the performers on times Squaree from the window. \nWe were in town to see Hamilton and it\u2019s a quick easy walk from the hotel.

OK...WOW. Beautiful place, staff is over the top friendly. Lots of places to eat and drink. Lobby is on the 10th floor and the restaurants seem to be scattered around. One you figure it out, it's great. Rooms are small, but its New York. It's new construction so the place is perfect. I was in a Ritz in LA last weekend and the age of the place showed, no matter how hard they worked. (Location made up for it) This place has both. Yes times Square on Saturday night is a zoo.The Times Square location seems to have their act more together than the Flatiron location. A quick breakfast and \nsome drinks were very nice. Yes it's expensive, but they don't advertise as a budget place do they? Value? The new smell in NY alone makes it worth while.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was their 9th day open when we arrived. The location is in the center of Times Square which was convenient as there is always something to do (or eat), we were quickly greeted at the front door by an amazing gentleman named Fernando, Fernando would take us up to the front desk and made us feel welcomed the entire weekend we were there. The front desk staff were eager to help us, all three of the front desk folks were attentive and knowledgeable, the hotel lobby was beautiful, it smelled amazing and was a nice blend of sophistication with modern fun, quite elegant really. We went up to our room that overlooked Times Square, the decor was lovely, the bedding comfortable and if we had one minor complaint about the hotel as whole it would be the layout of the bathroom sink\/toilet\/shower that we weren't crazy about but were comfortable with. \nWe walked Times Square a bit and were surprised to find a small bottle of champagne and some chocolate from the Guest Experience Manager Ana, congratulating us on our anniversary. Later that evening we went for another walk and came back to our room to hot chocolate compliments of Fernando who had noticed we had left for a few (attention to detail). It was an amazing experience. \n\nFinally, we ended up in the lobby bar for some drinks and snacks. All of the staff at the lobby bar (I wish I had remembered names) congratulated us on our anniversary and shared their experiences whether it be in the hotel industry or The Edition specifically, there was no shortage of attention on us which is often the case with New York City hotels. \n\nWe had a wonderful anniversary weekend, the hotel was beautiful and the staff was the best i've ever seen, which I suppose says something given the amount of time I stay in hotels for work\/pleasure (platinum member). We will definitely be back.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I stayed with promotional rates from Marriott with quite a few benefits (including room service & laundry credits). Relative to nearby properties on Times Square this one is probably the best as of writing. Overall it was a fantastic experience.\n\nPro:\nNew hotel: super clean (like only so many people have slept in the bed, think about it).\n\nExcellent design aesthetic: It\u2019s about simplicity. Back and white contrasting colors. You either like it or hate it (over time I can see the white walls and furniture get increasingly dirty, also not sure if they thought about room acoustics - the echo is kinda annoying...)\n\nTechnology enabled: mobile keys, smart TV, conveniently located USB ports, one of the best room lighting control I\u2019ve seen.\n\nStaff on-point: they went above and beyond to fulfill all your requests (only complaint is that a few times nobody handled the front door, which is very heavy).\n\nService: Turn down included, very professional. Made it feel like home.\n\nCon:\n\nThe desk is virtually unusable except for putting stuff on there.\n\nAs with any NY property, room size is miniature.\n\n","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The retreat continues with down comforters and feather pillows.\n\nI spent one night at the hotel and hosted several guests for meetings in the restaurant and lobby.

The lighting in the rooms and the detailing is perfection. The balconies are large and views of Times Square are just grand.  Room service was delicious and The lobby bar is great. I received excellent drinks made by Julia and then dinner in the Terrace was just what we expected.  The service was unbelievably excellent and the food and beverage was so so good. All the decor in the building is spanking brand new. This is the place to be. It is so modern, and clean and it smells great. Top notch skin care products are in the bathrooms as well.  Again though what makes a place is the staff and this staff takes pleasure and they are very proud to show off this new hotel. Special thanks to everyone, thanks for the amazing upgrade gift of delicious wine and cheese. We were surprised.  First class. Special thanks to Fernando on ground level for the great welcome and when you just arrive and special thanks to Jerome, bell hop. He really provided so much info on this structure. All the staff at the front desk and all the men who delivered are food are so helpful and knowledgeable.   Ty again. See you again.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}
