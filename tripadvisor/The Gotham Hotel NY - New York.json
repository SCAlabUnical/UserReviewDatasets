Times Square, Summit one, Central Park, rockafella centre, broadway to name a few that are right on your doorstep! \nThe staff are so friendly too! Had a problem with the safe and within a couple of mins a guy was up to fix, that is what you want!\nRoom itself was very spacious, very comfy bed and pillows were really really good!\nShower was the best I have ever experienced in a hotel bar none! \nHad a small wardrobe with only 5 hangers but I\u2019m sure the hotel would have provided more if required.\nTiny balcony but enough to see times square in the distance!\nImportantly there is no \u2018resort fee\u2019 which apparently is a thing here in nyc, where you can get stung once arriving! We paid a deposit of 100 dollars on arrival to be returned once the room is checked..\nGym not on site but a five minute walk to New York sports club where you can work out for free as a guest of Gotham.\nAnother nice little extra was you get a room credit of 40 dollars for the drinks and snacks left in your room\/fridge for you to enjoy, anything over 40 dollars you eat\/drink you are charged for..\nCleanliness was great and house keeping was spot on!\nRestaurant\/bar downstairs I cannot review as we didn\u2019t use this.\nSome small negatives, no main light in the room meaning it was a little dark( had lots of lamps in room instead) plug sockets were flimsy and phone charger kept popping out whilst charging which was annoying, also bedside sockets are inside the cabinet making it hard to get too which was a little strange, these need moving, the heater isn\u2019t great, and there are no instructions on how to use this in the room, it looks straightforward and I had it on max heat it was just about warm enough although it should have been roasting on 88f, first couple of nights it was really cold!\nUnfortunately it was quite noisy outside which is beyond the hotels control, first night roadworks all the way up to around 4am! There was also for the first 3 nights another loud noise outside which we couldn\u2019t figure out what it was which went on all night, even with windows closed was fairly loud, however as you do a lot of walking in nyc once your head hits the pillow you kind of don\u2019t notice because you are tired! \noverall would totally recommend this place to stay and would definitely come back if I was to visit again, thanks guys and girls great job!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Schr\u00e4nke sind ausreichend vorhanden. Im Zimmer gibt es eine Minibar mit moderaten Preisen (f\u00fcr Manhattan), zudem sind 30 Dollar schon inkludiert! Auch eine Kaffeemaschine (Kapseln) ist vorhanden, der Verbrauch der Kaffee-Kapseln wurde uns nicht berechnet.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1963673,"title":"Very nice boutique hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-05","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Husband and I stayed in a Balcony King room on here for a week, and we really liked the hotel.  It is an interesting configuration - the building is narrow, so the first (ground) floor has reception and the restaurant, and then the remaining floors have just a few rooms per floor. As I recall, floors 2 through 7 are smaller rooms with 4 rooms per floor, floors 8 through 23 have only 2 larger rooms small suites, and then the top floor has just the single Penthouse Suite. This is great, as the small number of rooms on each floor makes it very quiet. Our room was on the 23rd floor, so it was especially quiet being so far from the street noise. We could occasionally hear sirens, but that was about it.\n\nOur room was quite spacious (especially by Manhattan NYC standards) and nicely decorated, with an extremely comfortable bed. There is a relatively large undercounter mini-bar fridge with available space to store personal beverage\/food items as well as the hotel mini-bar beverages that are available at a cost (though we didn't need to do that), and there are wine glasses, a corkscrew, and, at least in the larger rooms and suites, a Nespresso coffee machine. The balcony wasn't huge but had enough room to comfortably hold two chairs with a small table between them. The view isn't great (the balcony is on the back of the building with a view of the back of another building), but it is nice have private outdoor space. On the higher floors, there is also a larger shared balcony on each floor, with a better view as it was on the front of the building. Sadly, it rained for most of our stay, so we didn't use either balcony as much as we'd have liked. Our room's balcony was covered, but with heavy rain and wind, it wasn't really practical to use during the storms. \n\nAll of the staff at the Gotham Hotel was very welcoming, helpful and friendly. The front desk staff and doorman greeted us every time we left the hotel and returned to the hotel, they lent us large umbrellas during the storms, and overall were terrific. While we didn't interact with the housekeeping staff, the room was always cleaned promptly and to a high standard whenever we left the room with the \"Refresh\" sign on the door. We tended to go in and out of the room several times a day, but we never came back to find the room hadn't been cleaned yet, whether we were gone an hour or 5 hours.\n\nWe only ate at the hotel's restaurant, the Reading Room, once, for dinner on the night we arrived, but we enjoyed the food and the cocktails.\n\nI only have a couple of suggestions for the Gotham Hotel. First is that the hotel have a blow dryer in each room. I am so used to every nice hotel having blow dryers in rooms that it has become an expectation and so I don't pack a blow dryer. It may be that there are blow dryers in the room and I just didn't see it on our room, or that I could have gotten one if I requested it from the front desk. But I didn't ask the front desk about it as, due to the rain, most of the time I wouldn't have bothered blow drying my hair anyway.\n\nThe second suggestion is related to the Nespresso machine. First, they only leave 2 Nespresso pods. So, for a couple, each person could only have a single cup of coffee. I need more coffee than that to get myself together in the morning! It would be nice if they included four pods. Worse, though, is that though there is a good number of individual containers of \"creamer,\" they are all CoffeeMate, which I cannot use due to the high sugar content. I know that some people love this type of creamer, but others like me do not. It would be nice is if they included individual containers of both real half and half AND CoffeeMate, so there is something for everyone. Anyway, as a result, we didn't even use the Nespresso machine, and every morning I had to throw on my yoga pants and hoodie and walk a couple of blocks to Starbucks to get a Venti Latte to wake me up :). Again, if I had asked the front desk, they might have been able to get me some half and half or milk from the restaurant or something, but to be honest, I just never bothered to ask.\n\nAll in all, we highly enjoyed staying at the Gotham Hotel, and we would certainly stay there again if we are in the city again (we are from California, so whether or not we will ever get back to NYC is questionable).","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

In boutique hotels like this, I expect the spaces to be nice (they were) so the employees and location tend to make or break the experience. \n\nThe Gotham could have had a horrid location (it does not) because the employees are impeccably trained and amazingly kind. All of them were lovely and helpful, but Ena and Besnik were particularly wonderful and were there both when we checked in and out.  They were kind, efficient, and anticipated our needs virtually before we asked.  \n\nThe Gotham is perfectly located.  And I do mean perfectly located; you are steps from 5th avenue, three blocks from Grand Central Station, five blocks from the New York Public Library and Bryant Park, 15 walking minutes from Times Square and from a corner entrance to Central Park, two blocks from Rockefeller Center and St. Patricks Cathedral.  Excellent foods from a variety of cultures are easily within a four block walk.  Other than hearing the sound of an ambulance once, we heard no street sounds at all.  \n\nThe rooms have an understated elegance (loved the woods floors in ours) and include lovely ammenities.  Given the downpour we experienced twice while here, the umbrella was an appreciated touch.  There were slippers,  and Nespresso in additional the hotel standard refrigerator, hair dryer, and extra blankets.  I loved the art in the room and the touch of stacks of books on the nightstand.  This boutique hotel is a remodeled bookstore. \n\nWe never ate in the physcial restaurant (it looked beautiful) but treated ourselves to room service and the food was stellar.  They had the wonderful hanger steak chimichurri and a ricotta gnocchi that rivals clouds for pillowy softness.  All of the food was perfectly seasoned. \n\nI recommend booking through their website.  They offer a 20% discount if you book at least 7 days in advance regardless of length of stay.  \n\nKind, thoughtful, friendly employees (Ena and Besnik were particularly wonderful), a stellar location, elegant rooms, stunning service, and a lovely restaurant.  \n\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

But I would put 1.5 if I could. One seemed too harsh. \n\nIt was challenging to pick a rating because one star is poor and three stars is good. Our stay was definitely not good, but I'm not sure it was poor either.\n\nBasic facts: we paid about $380 for the room and I believe a $27 resort fee so overall a little over $400 for a one night stay. We stayed the Saturday after thanksgiving. \n\nLet's start with the good. Staff was incredibly friendly. We arrived at the hotel around 12 pm on Saturday and planned to just leave our luggage since check in isn't until 4. Luckily they let us check in early so that was a great start. Location was perfect. Right off fifth so you could easily walk to stores, food places, and Central Park. Our room had a patio which is great for air. No view but the patio was still nice. Because it was a one night stay they also gave us a $10 credit for their mini bar\/snacks. \n\nThe not so great. The room was very dusty. We ended up wearing our shoes in the room because our feet were black from the dust if we went barefoot. This honestly didn't bother us that much since they have wood floors and we understand dust is normal. The room itself was okay. Nothing fancy, nothing great. There were a little things here and there, for example, the shower wasn't the cleanest, but we were fine, not worth a complaint. When we came back around 10:30 pm the doorman and concierge were watching a game, we're guessing basketball, so they didn't greet us. Again not bad and we're sports fanatics so we get it but since I'm writing this review I thought I'd point it out.  \n\nThe REALLY BAD was when we got into bed and there was dried blood stains on our comforter and yellow stains (If I can attach photos I will). So dust is not bad, yellow stains are gross but not that bad, but blood stains is unsanitary and calls for a potential health inspection. Diseases can be transferred through blood so this obviously freaked us out. We called the front desk, told them, and asked for a new comforter. They did apologize and came up quickly, but they came with a thin grey blanket. It's end of November so it's pretty chilly and we thought this was odd. The room has heat so we just turned the heat up but the blanket was also stained. Again if I can post photos I will. It was stained in the sense that maybe bleach was previously used and changed the grey fabric to yellow. Also, they did not take the blood blanket and just left it in our room. \n\nI tried to find someone on their website to contact about this but the only thing they have is their front desk email which didn't seem appropriate. We previously also emailed their front desk and they didn't timely respond, we had to email them twice to finally get a response. \n\nThey were obviously aware that we had blood on our bed sheets and still nothing was done to apologize to us for the blood issues and it just seemed like a lot of issues for $400\/night. \n\nWe fly to New York multiple times a year to visit family and we like to try hotels to find favorites in different areas. We won't be back to the Gotham. New York is filled with hotels, so if you can stay elsewhere, I'd recommend doing just that.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We communicated with the front desk.  It was \"fixed\".  When we came back that night, no cold water.  We were moved to another room 2 floors down, but right below the original room.  This room had a shower wand that didn't work, a clock that didn't work, and a telephone headset that didn't work.  We informed the front desk.  They offered to move us again (down another floor, but still right below the original room).  We declined due to the hour.  Next morning, no cold water again, so no shower again (didn't want to be scalded).  The problem was someone immediately above us who was turning the shower off wrong, and the hot water was flowing into the cold water pipes for any room under that one (which was our original room, our second room as well as the other room we were offered).\nIn terms of compensation due to the problems with the rooms, we were told by the manager to enjoy the minibar for free.  Guess what....we were charged for it.  The manager also offered to \"take care of us\" next time we were in town.  Yea - given this experience - not happening.

Of course the photos are taken with a professional camera and lighting but note that it looks more upscale than it really is. The wood on the furniture was worn and scratched and scuffed. The floors seriously need to be redone. The balcony views are nice but the glass ledge is very low and flimsy, it hardly feels safe being on the 25th floor. This suite is on the roof and is the only room on that floor, but when we checked into our room there were construction workers upstairs most of the day. They were up there earlier than 9am working and making noise, which sucks because check out is noon and we were hoping to sleep in.

It says they have room service from the restaurant downstairs, the waitstaff acted like they had never even heard of it but I could order to go if I wanted? \nThe past 3 days housekeeping has failed to give us towels and washcloths and when I call front desk we have had to wait anywhere from 30 mins to one hour. And penthouse? This 500 square foot room with a cute apple picture and a balcony to fit 3 people looks straight into brick wall - sounds like the views of their \u201cregular\u201d rooms are better.

The pictures online not only showed a bigger balcony\/terrace with more furniture than we had, but also a couch in the room. When we got there, the balcony was smaller than it seemed online and there was no couch in the room with just one bed. After I asked to speak to the general manager to see if we can get a bigger room with a couch and perhaps a bigger balcony as we booked. After I spoke with the general manager and she said that she couldn\u2019t do anything except book me in a different room with a worse view and still no couch. I told her the pictures were misleading and her response was that not every room online will have the same pictures of the room booked. Then she began question the website that I saw the pictures on with doubt, only to prove to her that the pictures were from the official Gotham hotel website .... Once I asked her if there was anything she can do to reimburse me at all, she said there\u2019s nothing that she could do and everything was fixed. I felt like I was treated unfairly and that the general manager should\u2019ve gave me a little bit more respect. The front and workers were great and very polite and much more helpful than the general manager was. She was very rude and extremely condescending. I almost couldn\u2019t believe she was the GM. I stay at a hotel almost once a month, and for this being one of my most expensive bookings, I\u2019m so shocked how unprofessional she was and disrespectful. Fire her ... you guys can do much better. And update your website\u2019s room pictures, it is almost 2020 and probably 99% of bookings are done online ! ","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Makes for easy access to all of the city.  The lobby is fairly small, stark and discreet.  Reception was very nice, and it was quick to check in.  There are two elevators.  entering the room, the door is right in the middle of the room.  There is no corridor.  The room, exclusive of the bathroom, was a perfect rectangle, about 30x11 with the bed to the right and a narrow desk on the wall to the left, with a desk chair and a couch set back about 6ft from the TV on that same wall.  The wall opposite from the entry was all glass.    The bathroom was small but adequate.  \n\nThe glass wall was nice, but in mid-town, you were just looking right into another building.  Also, the glass was not soundproof, so at night, you would hear a lot of street noise.  The bed was pretty comfortable.  The room itself was very stark, with no real interest at all.  The couch was old, and saggy.  Not particularly comfortable.  A few times during the stay, housekeeping did not finish the entire room, or just did not come to the room at all.   The thermostat in the room seemed to adjust itself.  If I adjusted it to a position, during the night, it would automatically self-adjust to a different setting.  that was odd, could have been something i misunderstood.  \n\nOverall, It was just ok.  Mainly, it was lacking any type of style or interest in the room.  It was basically 4-white walls and an attached bathroom.  Nothing in the room was comfortable, luxurious or thoughtful.  For the price paid, that was not adequate.  ","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was still stunning!\nStandouts:\n-Space to move around\n-Comfortable King Size Bed\n-Blackout Shades were clutch if you like a dark room to sleep in\n-Clean\n-Heavenly Shower with rainfall head and detachable wand\n-You\u2019re able to use the terraces on any floor 19th-roof. We bought stuff to make a charcuterie board and just watched a glimpse of the lights from Times Square on our last night. It was perfect and magical!\n-Wolfgang\u2019s Steakhouse in the Lobby was phenomenal! The Ribeye can be split between two and was so tender and delicious!\n-The hotel is close to a coffee shop- The Gregory and lots of good food\/restaurants.\n\nMinor issues:\n-Balcony Door kept popping open, but later found you have to lift the handle up in order to lock it properly\n-None if the tv channels work- including the local free ones. But let\u2019s be honest, you\u2019re not in NYC to watch TV!\n-We weren\u2019t as close to subway stops, but Grand Central was a 7-10 minute walk away\n\nOverall, we loved our experience at the Gotham! We will definitely stay here again!!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I (my company) paid well over $600 for the night I spent there.  Certainly not worth that.  The room was nice, functional, but not overly comfortable or well-kept.  The bath towels, for example, were rough and ragged -  they should have been donated to an animal shelter.  I had no hot water in the sink and it did not drain well. The clock radio displayed the wrong time and I couldn't figure out how to adjust it.  The AC was LOUD!\n\nOn the plus side, the balcony was a cool feature, although I did not use it.  The bed was comfortable and the TV worked fine. The desk was nice and the desk chair was very good. The shower was pretty excellent and the overall look is sleek and modern. \n\nThe good news for me was that my co-worker stayed at the Lotte Palace for the same price but was subjected to luggage searches, Secret Service presence, and general inability to move freely in the hotel because of the UN meetings.  No such issue at The Gotham!  \n\nThis hotel is very convenient to my company's NYC office (two blocks away), so I may very well stay here again as long as the price is right.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Nespresso coffee machine did not function properly so we were unable to make coffee.  Reported these issues, but as far as we could tell nothing was done to fix the problems.  1st morning we left room and arrived back at 3pm. Room was not cleaned. Went to front desk and asked that the room be serviced as we needed towels.  Said she would have this done.  2-1\/2 hours later we returned to the hotel and the room still was not cleaned.  Once again went down to front desk and asked that it be cleaned. Was told that they had until 8pm to clean the rooms.  Said ok, but we had asked 2-1\/2 hours ago to please have this done.  Waited additional 1\/2 hour in lobby for them to go to service room.  Upon returning to room we found we had no cold water.  Tried to shower and scalding hot water streamed through the shower head.  Called the front desk on my cell and she told me someone would be right up.  Waited 45 minutes and no one came to room.  Once again called front desk and was told that the engineer left at 8pm and he said to continue to run the water and that may work.  He did  not know what was wrong.  No one was coming to address this problem.  I asked if we could be moved to another room and was told that no rooms were available and there was nothing she could do.

I went to Hotels.com and found the Gotham Hotel, they advertise in room couples massages, and a room with a balcony and a view of NYC. The pictures are MISLEADING to say the least. Within the hour we checked in, we were on the phone with Hotels.com trying to check out. Our view was a brick wall, the walls are so thin you can hear the people next door taking out the trash, wall fixings and furniture are dirty and falling apart, and the customer service is AWFUL!! Nevermind, the in room couples massages are at some random apartment in the city not even the hotel.

We were also handed a voucher for free parking up too 24 hours by the Gotham Hotel. We got to SP Plus parking garage by 2pm and HAD TO PAY 40 DOLLARS.My girlfriend and I were utterly baffled by the fact we had to pay for parking after being told we had free parking. This changed the whole course of our trip.. I am now out about 240 for the hotel, 22 for the resort fees we didn\u2019t use, and 40 for the parking totaling to a whopping 302 DOLLAR TOTAL.

The bed was turned down everyday and the room cleaned.\nWe wouldnt hesitate in returning to the Gotham - Also, like a lot of NYC hotels, you dont get breakfast, but next door is Gregorys Coffee who do the most amazing Banana Poundcake!, next door again is a small deli selling the most amazing serve yourself breakfasts as well - but agsin, Its NYC - you'll never go hungry!","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"NONE"}

The location was excellent, right off of 5th ave with all of the stores we wanted to visit within walking distance. There are several subway stations within a ten minute walk. The hotel room was nice, larger than I was expecting for NYC. The bathroom was also large but just had a stand-in shower, no bathtub. There was a little balcony but no view so we did not spend any time on it. Overall we were happy with what we saw when we showed up. \n\nThat being said, the room service was very poor, one of the worst of any hotel I have visited. Our bed was never made, even after asking twice in one day they still never did it. And on once occasion a dirty washcloth was left on the bed. \n\nThere were lots of snacks and drinks in the room, all for an enormous price, even the coffee which is usually complimentary was an additional charge. \n\nAlso, we paid for the room in full when it was booked, and when we checked out the receptionist didn't mention anything about additional charges, but when we looked at our credit card there was an additional $200 charge which we are still trying to get in touch with the hotel to determine what it was for since we didn't order any room services etc. If you visit the hotel make sure to ask about additional charges upon checkout. \n\nSo, overall happy with our stay because of the location and the size of the room, but disappointed with the room service.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was good size by New York standards and nicely furnished with everything I needed: King-sized comfortable bed, large flat-screen TV with hundreds of channels, sleek bathroom, bright with windows on two sides as it was a corner (I think all of the rooms are like this. There is a large shared balcony with a table and chairs and a view over 46th street below. There was only one other guestroom on my floor and I never saw anyone else, so it was like having a large balcony to myself in addition to the small private balcony in the room (This one faced the dark inner courtyard of other towers behind so there wasn't much to look at, but it was nice to have it). It was very quiet in terms of other guests, but the large fans from the buildings behind are quite noisy and midtown rumbles as you would expect from dawn to dusk. \n\nThe location is awesome, possibly too much in the heart of midtown. A half block from 5th ave and a couple of blocks from Grand Central station it is a great spot if you want to be in the heart of the action. Times Square is a short 5 minute walk away. Some staff were indifferent, others friendly, but they were helpful when needed. The only real cons were that it might not be a good place for younger kids because of the easily accessible balconies. With light chairs that could easily be pushed and climbed on, there is a 20 or whatever storey drop and the door to the outside could be opened by a small child. Otherwise it was a clean, and secure hotel. Its is not 5 star and you will notice little things like the toilet does not flush right away (you have to hold the handle for 5 seconds), they didn't have those little complementary extras like bottled water, and the temp control on the water was finicky, but overall I was very happy with my visit. Also, there is a fantastic deli\/lunch\/breakfast bar right next door.  \n\nI would stay again.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Some positives: the front desk staff was helpful, and friendly. The location is perfect, close enough that we walked the theater, a jazz club and the next morning to Grand Central Station and towards the East River\/ UN. Also, parking w validation was $40, which is fair for 24 hours in Midtown. The shower was very nice, with excellent pressure and temperature. The Nespresso machine made excellent coffee. The room was super quiet, but also we faced a very dark interior courtyard, as is the case in many Manhattan buildings. We booked on Hotwire and were assigned a room. If it's important to you, you could book directly with the hotel to ensure a streetside room. The bed was only average, which includes the mattress and bedding. There was no decoration (ie art) on the wall, which left the room looking a bit stark. We didn't eat in the restaurant (not affiliated with the hotel), but would have tried it if they had an informal option at the bar, or a happy hour.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Most places have something for tourists to read and refer to throughout there stay.\nThe room is a reasonable size (always look bigger in the pictures) the balcony is tiny but a nice space.  I suspect it would be more relaxing if there wasn't a building site right opposite, so you get noise and workmen (again perhaps to be expected in New York, but a bit of advance notice would have been nice). However it is nice to have an outside space, just watch out for the puddle from the air conditioning unit which drains onto the balcony floor.\nThere is a coffee machine but you are restricted to one coffee pod, per person per day only, the rest you have to buy.  In my opinion they would be better just supplying a kettle and tea and coffee sachets.  There is nothing posh or upmarket about having a coffee machine and restricting the amount guests can use it.\nThe air conditioning unit was very noisy though it didn't affect us as we hardly used it.\nThe room in general could do with some refurbishment the dark wood and plain walls just seems rather outdated as do the curtains, it's a pretty uninspiring room.  They have a huge mirror but no light any where near it for putting on make up or getting ready and no plug socket any where near it for doing hair.  I know these sound like silly things but you do have to wonder who plans these rooms.  The room safe is nice but it isn't secured to the floor so if someone wanted they could just lift the entire safe and it's contents.\nThe bed was very big and very comfortable and the hotel was quiet at night, though as with anywhere in new York you do hear outside noise and this is to be expected.  I think the building site across the road adds to the noise.  The bathroom was very big and the wet room was nice though there were some holes in the ceiling where I presume there had been a leak from upstairs .\nThe rooms were clean and the maid service was good.\nThere is no separate bar in the hotel, though if you wanted I believe you could sit for a drink at the Bar in Wolfgangs steak restaurant which is located within the hotel.  We ate there once $180 dollars for 2 steaks 2 sides and chips to share, a wine and couple of beers!!!! Though to be fair we were prepared for the price and the food was lovely.\nThe staff are very friendly and helpful, Tina Alex and Kenny all chatted away with us and helped us when we needed it.\nThe location of the hotel is FANTASTIC it is within walking distance to many of the attractions and is a great location for subways to the other destinations in New York, grand central, empire state, times square, macys and rockefeller to name a few are all within walking distance.  There is a coffee shop next door for when you have used up your coffee pod allowance! and  are in abundance!!!\nThe hotel is fine but with a bit of effort it could be fantastic especially given the location, a boutique hotel....... it is nearly there.  I wouldn't class the rooms as stylish perhaps a bit out dated dark wood, plain walls, plain bedding, but it is a small central hotel with great staff, who are extremely helpful and pleasant.\nThis review might seem very negative, but I have tried to be informative and these are the facts!\nI would stay again if the price was represented in the design and style of the rooms.\nOnce again the staff were fantastic and it is a very central hotel in a bust central area right of 5th avenue. We had a great time in New York","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Had I not chased this I think it would have been a lot later.   Overall, the front desk staff were moody and just generally disinterested in their job and the hotel guests.  The door staff stood around chatting and messing around and it felt like as a guest I was an inconvenience.  The room was a good size with a lovely front balcony looking down to Times Square. The room was not as clean as I would have expected with the shower broken and a number of the blinds not working. The location of the hotel was great, near enough to get to things but not in the middle of it all. Would I stay again, probably not.

The email exchanges I had before our trip were actually very good and quick. I was told that we would be put on the same floor as one of the communal balconies which meant that we would get a great view of the city albeit not from our room which was fine.\n\nWhen we arrived check in was great and as promised we were on the same floor as one of the communal balconies I think it was the 23rd or 24th floor. You could see Times Square from the balcony but with it being December we didn\u2019t stay out there for long! \n\nThe room itself was huge much bigger than I have stayed in in New York before. The big negative for me, however, was that at the back of the hotel right beside our room was a huge generator which was sooooo loud! After travelling from the UK I was really looking forward to a good nights kip and unfortunately this wasn\u2019t to be! I struggled to sleep for most of the six nights we were there. It may have been better in a different part of the hotel but I would avoid the back at all costs! \n\nAnother really annoying issue was that our key card was constantly deactivating. We would get up to the 23rd floor to find it had gone to have to go back down then back up. This happened at least twice a day and although the staff tried to suggest it might be our mobiles causing it, I kept the card in my pocket well away from my phone. This was a real pain! \n\nWe also had to ask a lot for supplies like coffee pods, toilet rolls etc which again shouldn\u2019t need to be done. \n\nThis hotel isn\u2019t a luxury hotel by any means and if you are after the NYC experience of a huge hotel with a huge lobby this just isn\u2019t the hotel for you.

With 90+ degrees in the city, we turned AC on when leaving the room only to find that staff turned it off when we got back end of day soaking wet from humidity.\n3) We had hotel call us a cab. I know flat fares are 60$ to JFK and asked prior if this is a \"flat fares\" too. They said yes and called us a Suburban shuttle with flat fare $120. I went back inside asking why and was told \"yellow cabs we just hail for you\" and flat fare suburban should be $80. Well, it's not and also not what we asked for in the first place! \n4) Prices per night were kind of expensive which we didn't mind expecting a nice hotel. Next time, stay at your preferred chain \/ business hotel which is cheaper and has functioning WiFi.\n\nInfo: I've stayed in NYC 20+ times for business and leisure and never did I stay in such an unwelcoming place where literally nothing works and staff did nothing to improve the situation.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Having read reviews I was aware it is not clearly from street view so look for Wolfgangs. Room was larger than I expected for what I was paying. Bed was super comfortable , coffee in room was very good ( you can buy more pods for $5 which to me is a great deal) The shower was great in that it had a wand to simply have a rinse . Yes the balcony faced a wall but I spent my time on the 19th floor balcony having my dinner there many a night. Fluffy dressing gowns, slippers I felt rather spoiled. The staff were so helpful , i felt for the few days I was there it was home. I cannot say enough positive things about them. From printing off directions, directing me to some of the most terrific places to eat or simply having a chat, they made my stay memorable. Tina , Tina would always welcome me with a chat , some skitting ( in our side of the pond that is like \" we are friends\" ) . If there was an issue it was amended , if there was a want , it was looked after. I saw many people come to the hotel when other hotels let them down in some way. All were delighted with their move and I can see why. I know I have not included the door staff names, the cleaners names, the maintenance guys names but they  all made for a memorable stay. I found the hotel very well situated. It is a short walk to Times Square, cheap eats nearby as well as a discount shop to purchase the likes of coffee, snacks if like me you are on a budget. Grand central is about 2 city blocks away . Fantastic eatery near there with various vendors and a selection that should please anyone in your party. Dunking Doughnuts is two doors away, what more could you want really ? I am so glad I took the chance and will be returning to stay again.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was attracted by the private balconies and honestly, did not realize it was 46th St E, not 46th St W so I thought it was closer to Times Square - yes I realize it is right at 5th Ave so not far from 46th W.  Although the crowds are a bit much in Times Square, hotels there are close to the action, especially waking up in the morning and wanting breakfast.  It\u2019s just more convenient. So the hotel\u2019s location is not the fault of the hotel but rather mine for not booking in Times Square.  I enjoy boutique hotels but this one had some issues.  Checkin was a breeze and the staff was very friendly.  The room was large and the bathroom was nice.  The shower had both a wand and a rainfall shower head.  It took a bit for the water to get hot, but that happens sometimes.  There were a few drawbacks.  The Wifi kept going in and out and after I notified the front desk, it did stay on but only at 1\/2 strength.  It was unusable.   It has been very hot in New England and this weekend was no exception.  The room air did not work well.  When we checked in, the temp did not get lower than 72.  We notified the front desk, went out to a show.  When we arrived several hours later we were told the air had been fixed.  We got to the room and the temp was 69 and did not get any better all night.  It was difficult to sleep with the noisy air conditioner blowing and us sweating into the sheets.  The touted private balconies were a strip of metal outside the window that was approximately 2 ft wide.  Certainly too small to enjoy, even if it wasn\u2019t 95 degrees outside.  The room had iffy satellite TV too.  The amenities included an in room fridge with space to put things into, an iron, ironing board and umbrellas.  The room was clean and we had a view of the street.  We booked a king bed and were told we had a king room but the bed was an oversized full - not quite queen sized.

I e-mailed reception to advise of the situation and a friendly, prompt, reply alleviated any concerns about being too late to check in.\n\nWalking from Grand Central to the hotel at around 11.30pm I quickly realised the area was safe, I saw plenty of people walking around on their own.\n\nCheck in was efficient and friendly.\n\nMy room was a Skyline Jr. Suite with Terrace on the 14th floor at the front of the hotel. \n\nThe suite had a wonderful feeling of space, with the layout making it feel like you had separate sleeping, sofa, bathroom and terrace areas. It was clean, but I did feel that the decor was a little tired, with finishes in some areas being a little sloppy (e.g. some paint marks on the curtains). This didn't negatively impact my stay but did leave an impression. There's always hustle and bustle in a big city, so of course there was noise from the street overnight but it didn't affect my sleep.\n\nI made good use of the terrace, the weather was particularly hot and after long days walking around the city it was nice to kick back on the terrace and immerse myself in the sounds of New York. The view was pleasant, with Times Square in the distance to the left, and skyscrapers all around you.\n\nLocation wise, it was fantastic. I could walk everywhere and was very well placed for many of the tourist attractions. Times Square was very close by, I did the walk to the Circle Line boat tour and Intrepid in 25 mins, and the Rockefeller Centre and Central Park were in easy reach too.\n\nI didn't try any of the food from Wolfgang's Steakhouse, but did find the nearby Uncle Paul's Pizza which I would recommend if you like Italian food, they delivered to the hotel for free, but pick up is just as easy as it's round the corner. There are so many options for food nearby that you are bound to find something to your taste.\n\nAll the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

I found the doorman and the front desk staff (especially the afternoon\/evening staff) to be incredibly helpful and friendly. They gave us clear directions on how to get to the parking garage and took our luggage up to our room while we parked the car. The parking garage is within walking distance of the hotel. It is expensive ($150 for the 3 nights) and there are no in-out privileges, but you really don't want to be driving around the city anyway! We stayed in room 183 and were pleasantly surprised by how spacious it was. We were also incredibly happy that it was quiet. We did not hear anyone in the hall and rarely heard any sound from outside either. The location of this hotel was perfect! It was within walking distance of Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, and Broadway. We purchased a hop-on, hop-off bus tour and used this as our means of transportation to other, further attractions. The balcony was small and the view wasn't great but we didn't spend much time in the room anyway so we didn't mind. Upon our arrival, I pulled the whole bed apart to search for bedbugs and I am happy to report that I did NOT find any. The mattress did have some stains though and I would suggest that the hotel invest in removable\/washable mattress covers to prevent this. The bed was decently comfortable but the pillows were very thin. The only major complaints that we have are that the room was quite dark and the air conditioner was very loud. Although there were windows, the room needs more lights to make it more functional, especially over the mini bar\/coffee area. I had to use the flashlight on my phone to see\/operate the coffee maker. The air conditioner was very loud and made many strange noises in the middle of the night that woke us up. It also had a strange smell that came and went throughout our stay. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay here and very impressed with the staff!","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was a long flight from Melbourne to New York with a stopover, and a delay via LAX. I am terrible sleeping on flights and so by the time I arrived at the Gotham Hotel, it was 27 hours in between sleep. I arrived about 1800 hrs to a warm welcome at Reception, which was efficiently staffed and was quickly provided with my room on the 3rd Floor.\nThe Gotham is a boutique hotel and getting out of the lift, I was amazed how the decor was...pretty amazing.\nThe room Itself was a roomy, great size and there was a welcome gift of water and nuts. \nI had a quick shower, and a coffee, which refreshed me and found the tiredness dissipating.\nRather than I should have, gone straight to bed, I was too excited after not being in NY for 15 years and decided to explore the surroundings.\nThe hotel is 2 blocks and a short 10 min walk to Times Square. Walked around in delight of the buzz of NY. I walked back towards the hotel but rather than 46th Street, ventured down 44th, and found myself in the gorgeous Grand Central Station.\nI decided on a pizza from the amazing markets on the Ground Floor. Wow!\nThe hotel is central to all the places I had planned to visit, and the public transport was close by. It is walking distant as well to Central Park.\nWhile there was a balcony attached to the room, there was a better balcony on the 19th Floor which I used quite a bit during the stay as it was a quiet relaxing space. The balconies on the 20th to 23 rd floor were smaller so preferred the 19th Floor.\nThe Concierge boys were all very friendly, and were a source of information, from which subway and train to take, to their recommended food trucks. \nHad breakfast at the restaurant the next morning, and there was a good breakfast choice, plus a great cappucino.\nThere were just three points that on reflection, was an inconvenience. The first was that the room allocated on the third floor was somewhat dark, and there was no sunlight. It was fine as I was out most days but if I had preferred a bit of a nap \/ rest and Vitamin D, it was just a wee bit dark even with the balcony door opened.\nThe second issue was the air conditioning that was very noisy and as it got quite muggy summer nights, I want able to get it to cool down to a preferred temperature i.e about 20C\nThe last issue wasnt so much a hotel issue but one of plumbing and design. There was a lovely jungle shower but the taps were located close by the wall rather than by the shower door, so one had to quickly turn the tap on, and jump out the way,wet, until the water temperature was tepidly warm. But thats a design that seems in hotels worldwide.\nAll i all, a great stay, great location and highly recommend.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1963673,"title":"WARNING: Choose another hotel (unless... caveats contained within)","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-05-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"This is why we chose the hotel: We (2) like to think of ourselves as budget-conscious travelers who occasionally spend a bit more to enjoy a nice trip. We looked at a number of hotels in Midtown Manhattan, and thought The Gotham seemed like a very good option amongst the plethora of fancy establishments. The location appealed to us as it was central to many attractions. The hotel also advertised balconies for all of its rooms, which sounded idyllic for taking in the sights and sounds of NYC. So, despite the hefty price tag ($275 a night with taxes\/fees, definitely out of our normal price range), we thought a 2-night splurge would be a nice way to spend a weekend in Manhattan. The location was as advertised. Everything else\u2026 read below: \n\nFirst of all the lobby is tiny. A rough estimate of the size would place it at around 250 square feet. This is mostly a non-issue if you are checking in and out at the appropriate hours (3PM and 12PM, respectively). However, if you are arriving early (or leaving late) and had planned to spend the extra time in the hotel lobby, this might be a problem. There is a nice little coffee shop immediately adjacent to the hotel (Gregory's), however, in case you need a place to camp out for a little bit. This doesn't factor into the negative review whatsoever; this is purely FYI. \n\nAs any reasonably well-traveled individual might expect, hotels have a spectrum of \u201cstandard rooms\u201d. There are ones on higher floors with gorgeous views, and there are ones on lower floors where\u2026 you are on display to the public. Given the price we paid for our stay, I was really anticipating something at least reasonable. Boy was I mistaken. My guess is that the room we got was probably one of the \u201cworst\u201d rooms in the hotel. The word \u201cworst\u201d is in parentheses because\u2026 #firstworldproblems. \n\nLet's break it down into the individual complaints:\n\n1. It had absolutely no natural lighting. Being that it was on such a low floor, with high-rise buildings all around, absolutely no sunlight came into this room. I mean, it truthfully felt like night regardless of the time of day. While we didn\u2019t anticipate spending much time in the hotel room during the daytime hours (our NYC itinerary was packed!), we also didn\u2019t want to suffer from seasonal affective disorder in the height of spring. \n\n2. It had no balcony. Part of the reason for choosing this hotel was because the rooms were advertised as having balconies. The thought of sipping some coffee while taking in the sights and sounds of NYC was definitely part of the appeal. Perhaps I was reading too much into the word \"balcony\", but I was really expecting it to be\u2026 elevated. However, our room actually opened up onto a cement courtyard. So our \"balcony\" was actually a flat patch of cement that... connected to more cement. I think \u201cporch\u201d would be the appropriate term here. The hotel should amend their ads to say that all rooms come with a balcony (or a porch). \n\n3. Our \u201cbalcony\u201d was flooded. Because our room was situated on the lowest floor that had guest rooms, this (very excitingly) meant that condensation from the AC units above ours fell down onto our porch. So not only did we not have a balcony, but the patch of cement that we were supposed to \"lounge\" on was basically filled with a pool of condensation from the AC units above (and our own!). This meant that we got to listen to the dripping of AC droplets 24\/7. \n\n4. Our room didn\u2019t have heat. NYC sure does have some wacky weather! The first night we stayed at the hotel, the temperature was in the high 80s, it was humid, and we had the AC on blast (we were just adding to the collection of condensation that was already collecting on our porch). The second night, though, it was in the 50s! It had rained all day, it was quite windy, and we were shivering through our poorly planned lack of layers. So, on the way back to the hotel, we were super excited to get that heat cranked up! A warm hotel room after a cold rainy day... what could be better?! I'll tell you what... a cold hotel room! Why? Because our heater didn't work. I think it was the hotel's way of telling us to toughen up, stop whining, ask for a second comforter, and gather around a wastebasket fire for warmth. NOTE: Please do not light any wastebasket fires. \n\nSo, in summary, I would recommend that you avoid this hotel if you don't want to be relegated to one of the \u201cspecial\u201d rooms that I described above. However, the title of my review mentioned caveats! So... TL;DR version: \n\n1. If you dislike garlic and holy crosses, produce no reflection in mirrors, come from Transylvania, then the room above would be perfect. Expect no natural light. \n\n2. If you are extremely averse to heights, and the concept of a balcony scares you (but you love porches!), then the room above would be perfect. Your balcony is a slab of concrete on the ground floor. It\u2019s a porch. I\u2019ve now typed the word porch so much that it has lost all meaning to me. Porch. \n\n3. If you can't sleep unless you hear the incessant and inconsistent pitter-patter of water (on your ground floor \u201cbalcony\u201d) then the room above would be perfect. The sound of AC condensation from the rooms above you will lull you into quiet slumber. \n\n4. If you like the thought of paying a lot of money to have certain luxuries (IE: electricity, running water, a fantastic Midtown Manhattan location) but not others (IE: a functional heating system), then by definition you enjoy glamping. And if that\u2019s the case, then this hotel room is the perfect fit for you. No fires please. \n\nEnd diatribe.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We asked for a suite with a quiet terrace on the upper floors, a month before, also with a note at the hotel as we arrived on the night of April 27th. The management assigned us  the first suite, the lowest and the noisiest, exploiting our late check-in. The big surprise was that in W 46th Street, right in front of the hotel, a big building is in complete repair and the work lasts day and  night, including those with the jackhammers, as well as the delivery of the equipment by huge trucks with trailer. Hotels.com should be honest and treat its guests by informing them (not hiding the flaws), while it seems that the only purpose of this reservation system is to collect the commission. In addition, this hotel is by no means a 4-stars hotel for the following reasons:\n The hotel does not have a lobby (just 2 little benches in front of the desk). No maintenance of the rooms (handle of the broken terrace during all the stay, heating broken down for 4 days) The refuelling (toilet paper, coffee, soap) is not done (it is always necessary to ask).

Horrific. Every type of complaint that I made has already been made by someone else on this site.\n\nTo begin, The Toilet. It was faulty and couldn't even handle a test flush without any prior use. Frequently had to leave hotel to search for public toilets. On one occasion after peeing in the toilet and depositing a few sheets of paper in it, the toilet brought back up other people's feces and belched them over the floor and my property. On another occasion I sat on the bed while listening to someone pumping out bile and sloshing it into a garbage bag they'd brought up.\n\nSecond, The Freezing Showers. The shower system seemed faulty. Warm water was available on the first day and then never again, despite using the exact same settings. \n\nThird, The Dirty State. After a housekeeping session, it was normal for rubbish to be left uncollected, for replenishment of room items (like toilet paper) to be forgotten (despite repeated reminders) and for parts of the room to be ignored (like the shower, which was never cleaned despite how long we stayed). \n\nAnd finally, the crescendo that was The Unimaginably Rude Staff. I politely reported all issues from the second day that we were there but nobody followed up to see if our experience was improving.

I know this isn't the hotels fault but its just what it is. The walls in the room were dirty, they were painted white and had a lot of black stuff and hand marks on them. They were very obvious and the room really needed a good cleaning. The bathroom was a nice with a spacious rain shower, and the bath soaps were all top notch. \n\nWolfgang's Steakhouse is downstairs and although it is very pricey they have a great selection of food and booze.

How'd that happen you might ask? Please read on:\n\nThrough a booking snafu with an online booking site (company's name withheld, but it rhymes with shmeaptickets.com), I got my wife and I stuck with a booking reservation at The Gotham Hotel that we weren't happy with. I called the booking company to try to have it changed, but they said they couldn't get authorization from The Gotham Hotel to do anything about it. After over 3.5 hours of going in circles on the phone with the booking site, it left me extremely dissatisfied and annoyed. During that time, I had also contacted the hotel but couldn't get a definitive resolution either way. The hotel gave me the email contact of their sales coordinator, Maggie Moriarty, which I (now regretfully) ended up venting all of my frustrations towards with a couple of angry emails. A couple of hours later, Maggie responded to my emails, and was extremely cordial with me, apologizing profusely for not being able to respond sooner; this is in spite of the unwarranted lack of manners I showed. She genuinely seemed sympathetic to my concerns and she took the time to figure out the situation and rectify the issue. The cause of the issue ended up being a miscommunication because the booking site didn't communicate all details to the hotel. I felt like a jerk considering, she was the one apologizing to me. I told her as much, but Maggie continued to follow up with emails and offered to help compensate for all of the trouble I experienced. This goes above and beyond good customer service. Considering the trouble I caused myself booking through a hotel booking site, I will certainly look to book with The Gotham hotel directly anytime I visit Manhattan. Aside from this, the location is great, central to most things, and the prices of their rooms are some of the best around for what is offered. Each room has a balcony which is a nice bonus.

The Gotham clearly has no interest in doing so. \n\nI called a few days prior requesting an early check-in and didn\u2019t receive one. You\u2019re never guaranteed an early check-in, so that\u2019s no big deal. But I was told there were no other rooms available in the hotel (I was willing to pay for an upgrade) - but I ended up finding out that the hotel was, in fact, not sold out like I was told by the front desk agent. Why they felt the need to lie to me when I was willing to pay more is beyond me. \n\nThe rooms are okay. Mattresses and pillows are comfortable. Room is clean, but very dusty.  Had problems with the TV throughout my entire stay. Reception would come in and out, receiver would be out of range for the remote control, TV randomly would turn on and off. Very bizarre. Room had a great heating system, so it kept me warm in the 20 degrees temperature (this Miami boy really needed it!). Rooms are also pretty big, according to NYC standards. \n\nI was not told that there was construction on the street where the hotel was. 46th Ave was completely blocked off and had to walk in from 5th Ave. No big deal ... until I tried to nap. My room was facing the construction and it was incredibly noisy. A heads up would\u2019ve been nice. \n\nI asked the front desk agent and the doorman, both of which were inattentive and disinterested in being there (almost as if they were bothered by my questions), about restaurant suggestions. I was suggested a nearby diner, \u201ca Portuguese restaurant, two Italian restaurants and a Brazilian restaurant\u201d ... how about some names for these places?? NYC is a world-class city for food - I was shocked to see that the hotel couldn\u2019t provide a solid list of good nearby restaurants. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s no secondary lock on the room door, nor is there a do not disturb sign. So privacy and security is limited here. \n\nOn several occasions, I\u2019d get off the elevator and would see trash bags in the hallway. Not cute. \n\nOverall, I wouldn\u2019t stay here again. There wasn\u2019t really anything to make me want to come back. If you\u2019re looking for a no-frills place to sleep, you should be fine. I travel often, so I enjoy properties that offer friendly service and amenities. The only thing keeping me from rating this stay \u201cterrible\u201d was the fact that I got a good night sleep, hence my \u201cpoor\u201d rating.

I put in 2:45 since I thought we would arrive by 3 (normal check in) and thought it might ensure our room was ready. (SPOILER ALERT: IT DIDN'T). It also stated that I would receive an email verification that my room was ready- it was never completed. \n\nWhen we arrived, I was informed that the room wasn't ready as it was a full house the night before. Things get busy, I get it. The receptionist stated that it would be 15 minutes and they would call when it was ready, but we were welcome to wait in the lobby. We stayed and waited, since it was very cold outside. \n\n40 minutes later, I approached the desk as I had received neither phone call nor email. Lo and behold, our room was ready! Nice of them to tell us that as we sat there....\n\nThe room itself was very nice. Our one gripe was that the toilet appeared to be a \"low flow\" and you had to hold the flusher down in order for it to actually complete a flush. We had a king sized bed and balcony. There were plenty of lights, and a nespresso coffee machine. Even though there were two of us, there were only 1 of certain things, like the robe and slippers, but it didn't matter since we didn't plan to use them. There were also plenty of cream and sugar for the coffee, but no stirrers!\n\nWhen the room was serviced on the first morning, they left a weather report and chocolates, but neglected to refill the coffee pods. This was not a big deal, as we aren't big fans of the single pod coffees and there is both a coffee shop and dunkin donuts in the same block. The room was very clean and check out was a breeze.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a sweet welcome of some Popcorn in our room which was lovely, and the staff were available to cater to all our needs.....\nMustafa I recognised at Check-in as I had read so many good reports on trip advisor, and Eldis was very hands-on helping us with luggage, welcoming us each time we returned and updating on how our adventures had been, which was so lovely to have someone show interest in your trip and what you have been doing.... This was an especially nice added touch - He really cared :-)  He even took time to wish us a happy anniversary and offered to arrange some beers (were not wine drinkers) as a treat.\nThe room was very clean, the bed was extremely comfy and we were informed of the building works across the road when we arrived, the only problem I had with this was we had to keep our curtains closed but in all honest, you would only be looking at an office block anyways!  \nThe road was blocked off due to the UN Sumit meetings, so when leaving the hotel had arranged us a town car for JFK, so Eldis helped us with all our luggage out to 5th Ave to get our ride... Definately going that extra mile.\nA very enjoyable stay, very welcoming, warm and we will definitely be recommending your Hotel and we will most certainly be returning too \nThank you gents for looking after us xx\n\nAgain having issues loading pictures, will add when possible","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Not very fancy or nice. \n\nIt's comfortable enough if you are in a budget, but not where you want to stay if you want something good quality. The \"balconies\" are tiny and you can't really go out there and the terrace is not a place you can easily hang out in.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}
{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1963673,"title":"Decent","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-08-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We stayed here for the weekend. \n\nGood Stuff\nThe hotel is really conveniently located. Central Park, Times Square, and various Train stations. So if you value time, this is the place to be. There is a pizza place nearby on Vanderbilt called Uncle Paul's, try to visit this location. Definitely worth it. There was dude name Mustafa who was at concierge, he was very helpful. I dont know what other rooms are like, but our room was good. \n\nNot So Good Stuff\nThis hotel lost points for silly stuff. I asked for ice one night, and i never received it. I understand the staff at the hotel might be busy, why not put a ice machine on one of the floors for people to go to. The main issue we had was the air conditioning- it was so loud. We didnt sleep well for the nights we stayed at the Gotham. For the amount of money spent every night, it is not much to check the noise level. Finally, i feel like the staff can be a little nicer. I m not saying they are bad, i understand NY means people speak differently. I m saying, understand your guests come from all walks of life and to be a little more polite. The last thing i want is attitude after 8 hours travelling. \n\nAnyways, I gave this place 4 stars because of location and quality of the rooms (they had nespresso coffee!). Compared to other hotels in the area with the amount you have to pay per night, this place isnt that bad. They can definitly work on a few things to make the experience amazing.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have only ever done two reviews on TripAdvisor before and they were extremely positive reviews of two hotels we had stayed in. I wish I could say the same about The Gotham.\nWe arrived in NYC looking forward to the hotel we had booked and paid for because it had a balcony - not common in city hotels. \nWe went up to our room on the second floor to find there was no balcony. This was extremely disappointing as it was the reason we had chosen this hotel. We did not let this dampen our spirits however as we didn't want to ruin our limited time in NYC.\nUnfortunately, we then discovered the bathroom door would not close, the toilet seat would not stay up (difficult for men) and the sink was missing the lever which allowed it to drain. The curtains were also cut around an air conditioning unit and had no sheers. This meant that when you opened the curtains for some light (in the very dark room) you were eyeballing the construction workers across the road or the people walking in the street.\nOn alerting the desk to these issues we were told they were sorry but the hotel was full so no other room was available. When we mentioned that the hotel advertised that ALL rooms have balconies we were told - \"Yes, there are 67 rooms and only 2 don't have balconies\". \nAdmittedly, we were also told that PERHAPS there may be a different room available if we checked the next morning. As we were only staying 2 nights the PERHAPS was not really practical as it involved packing, unpacking and coming back at 3.00pm to get a new key on our one full day in the city.\nThat next day I asked if anything could be done as we didn't feel we should be paying full price for a substandard room. I was told that only the manager could say and they weren't in until 11.00am and would be gone by 5.00pm. I gave my number and asked to be contacted while we were out and about. This did not happen.\nI was told we could get a discount on our next stay.\nOn checkout, I again mentioned that I didn't feel they should book this room out at full price and was told our next stay would be discounted. Although we hope to be back in NYC I kept reminding them that as we come from Australia it is unlikely to be for a very long time. It is also had to imagine why they thought we would want to stay here again.\nSuch a shame!","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I worked in the customer service industry for over 15 years and know how people can blow up in reviews over even the smallest and most ridiculous things.  With that said, I am writing this review because of how bad the situation was and how bad it was handled afterwards.\n\nMy wife and I were very excited for our trip to New York City!  We had booked this trip almost 6 months ago and were ready to get to NYC and have fun.  We already had some flight issues getting to NY and that did cause us to be very late arriving.  My wife worked in the hotel industry for over 3 years and knows how things work.  We made sure to call The Gotham in the early afternoon the day of and let them know we would be arriving late.  We called again when we were at our connecting airport and said we would get there eventually tonight and wanted to make sure we had a room whenever we arrived.  We had been told in the afternoon not to worry and the lady in the evening said we could arrive whenever and our room would be ready.\n\nSo we finally get to NYC and arrive at The Gotham only to find out our room had been given away!!!  We arrived at 1:00am and now have no where to spend the night.  The night desk guy tried his best to call other hotels and find us a room, but literally every hotel in Manhattan was sold out.  After almost of hour of calling my wife found a room at a hotel in a part of the city we would never stay at.  We only went just so we had a place to crash for a few hours hopefully.\n\nWe arrived back at The Gotham in the morning to ensure we had a room for the remainder of our stay.  While the staff was very apologetic and helpful in ensuring we had a room for the rest of our trip, the general manager, Adisa, was less than polite.\n\nThe general manager\u2019s initial offer to us to make up for the trouble was pay for the city hotel we stayed at and offer us the crappy mini-bar they have in their rooms.  What a ridiculous offer and shows her lack of respect and appreciation for the customers that are staying at the hotel than enables her to even have a job.  The hotel finally offered to comp our first night, where any other hotel would have comped the entire trip.\nThe general manager cares so little about her customers that she never came to apologize to us and make sure we were ok.  She also never replied to our follow up emails about this.  I wanted to speak to Adisa\u2019s manager and never heard from anyone.  So here we are now, instead of finding a compromise I am writing a very rare review.\n\nI have one thing to say to anyone who is considering staying here.  TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!  There are over 200 4-star hotels in Manhattan and you will find a better one that respects you as a customer.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

That was such an amazing gesture and we appreciated it. They also suggested places to eat and do things while we were here.

You could not sit and relax on the balcony, or have a conversation whilst they were working. \nOur fridge door didn't shut properly and the ice melted and soaked the carpet. The maintenance man moved a bottle in the fridge and declared it fixed. The door was actually broken and not fixed at all! The air conditioning unit on the floor also leaked and the carpet there was also soaked. This was unable to be fixed straight away. \nWe had booked Bed and Breakfast a year ago, however new management refused to acknowledge this and we were denied any breakfast. \nwe were offered a downgraded room to move to as this was all that was available. Very poor accommodation for a 4* hotel. We contacted our travel agent who we had booked through and they changed our Hotel after the first night. This led to further problems. The travel agent had paid in advance, but we were also charged and it was taken off our card without authorisation. The travel agent contacted them again and decided to pay again there and then so that we could have a refund straight away. The receptionist refused to acknowledge the payment had been made. Horrendous experience. After waiting in reception for 2 hours whilst reception and our travel agents tried to sort it out I eventually demanded to see the manager. This finally gave us our refund. The hotel at one point had been paid 3 times for the same room for the same night. Disgusting situation and extremely poor communication.

The staff here are totally the opposite and we couldn't have found a more helpful set of staff from the bell boys to the reception staff and cleaners. Room was great, plenty of space, bathroom was spotless with a large walk in shower, it had the most comfortable of beds ever that was so huge it could fit 5 in it ! Even had a mini bar which we didn't have to use but it is there if you want it and the prices are comparable to others nearby if not a little cheaper. We have just got back and the temperatures were in the 90's so the cold blast of cold air was a welcome relief from the aircon.

The only problems we had involved the electronics - the coffee pot was complicated and only seemed to make expresso, the shower is ultra-modern and hard to figure out, and our key didn't work one night, so we had to get a duplicate.

Allein die Lage und die angenehme Zimmergr\u00f6\u00dfe haben den zweiten Stern gerettet. Leider gab es auf dem Buchungsportal keinen Hinweis auf die der Zimmerfront gegen\u00fcberliegende Gro\u00dfbaustelle, auf der ab 5:00 morgens bis sp\u00e4t abends sehr laut gearbeitet wurde. Da die Fenster praktisch keinen Schallschutz haben, waren die N\u00e4chte recht kurz. Allein vor diesem Hintergrund sind die aufgerufenen Preise trotz der guten Lage ma\u00dflos \u00fcberzogen. Hinzu kam, dass es keine Tagesgardinen gibt - lediglich die Befestigungsr\u00f6llchen sind noch in der Schiene, so dass man tags\u00fcber den Raum mit den Verdunkelungsgardinen komplett abschirmen und mit Kunstlicht auskommen muss, wenn man nicht auf dem Pr\u00e4sentierteller wohnen m\u00f6chte. Der in der Zimmerbeschreibung erw\u00e4hnte Balkon entpuppte sich als lediglich ca. 50 cm tiefer Austritt \u2013 also komplett unbrauchbar. Im Zimmer war ein Stuhl kaputt und die Toilettensp\u00fclung defekt. Nach Reklamation wurden diese M\u00e4ngel behoben. An zwei Tagen hintereinander funktionierte die elektronische Zimmerkarte bei unserer R\u00fcckkehr nicht. Bis das geregelt war und wir unser Zimmer wieder benutzen konnten, mussten wir jeweils \u00fcber 30 Minuten in der ungem\u00fctlichen Kleinstlobby (jedes Arztwartezimmer ist gr\u00f6\u00dfer) warten. Zun\u00e4chst wurde allerdings der Fehler \u2013 auch beim zweiten Mal - beim Gast gesucht, der mehrmals rauf und runter geschickt wurde und selbst andere Karten ausprobieren musste. Immerhin hat sich hier sp\u00e4ter ein anderer Mitarbeiter sehr freundlich engagiert. Dass der Safe nicht im Schrank verschraubt ist und somit problemlos samt Inhalt herausgetragen werden kann, wurde hier schon mehrfach angemerkt und bleibt unverst\u00e4ndlich. Die angenehme \u00dcberraschung, eine Nespresso-Maschine vorzufinden, w\u00e4hrte nur einen Tag, danach wurden weder Kaffee noch neue Becher bereitgestellt. Nachl\u00e4ssigkeit, Desinteresse, Methode, Sparma\u00dfnahme? Die Freundlichkeit des Personals war sehr unterschiedlich ausgepr\u00e4gt, man f\u00fchlte sich nicht bei allen Mitarbeitern als Gast willkommen. Bereits der Empfang war unterk\u00fchlt. Entgegen der Buchungsbest\u00e4tigung war das Zimmer auch nicht um 15:00 bezugsfertig, sondern erst nach 16:00. An einem Tag wurden Zimmer und Bad gar nicht geputzt, an anderen erst sp\u00e4tnachmittags. Der Teppich im Zimmer war wellig, wirkte schmuddelig und sah wenig vertrauenerweckend aus, die Fenster waren schmierig und streifig und wohl schon lange nicht mehr richtig gereinigt worden.

Imagine a building 25 feet wide and 25 stories high with interesting architecture. If you weren't paying attention, you'd walk right by it. We arrived at the hotel in the evening and Mustafa checked us in. He was friendly and efficient, explaining how our credit cards would be used. The next morning, Jeinina on the front desk efficiently corrected a billing issue. \n  The location of the hotel (East 46th between Fifth and Madison Avenues) is amazing and was an easy walk to the theater district, the shops on Fifth Avenue, Times Square and many other places. A Dunkun Donuts a couple doors down supplied morning coffee and an afternoon snack.\n   Room 192 was very spacious and contemporary in design. The bathroom was equally stylish and well appointed. Since it is the location of the Gotham Book Store, there were books in the room one could read. I enjoyed looking thru one on southern cooking. The linen on the bed and in the bath were of the best quality. A feature that I liked was a small terrace off the bedroom, and a large terrace off elevator lobby on our floor. Since there was only one other room on that floor, we felt we had the space to ourselves The terrace had a large table with four chairs, a sofa and chair. With electrical outlets, one could relax there with ones laptop and work, enjoying the view.\n  Eldis was very pleasant, eager to be of service. He told us of places to eat in the neighborhood.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room was a good size and well kept and more than met our needs (the bed was huge and really comfortable - one of us is now trying to work out how we can lever such a large bed into our home bedroom) - the only thing it could have done with was a second chair to sit on (however, since we didn't spend too much time in our room this wasn't really a problem for us).

As well as the fact the hotel is in a brilliant location to see all the main sights. \n\nHowever my boyfriend and I booked here for a 5 night stay in a Skyline Junior Suite (supposed to be on the highest floors of the hotel, I requested this before arrival, yet we were put on floor 12 out of 24) and upon arrival our room was not ready at 3pm. When we finally got to our room the door handles to the balcony were not sufficiently working, the shower tap wasn't working and we had to fix this ourselves in order to shower. The plug socket in the bathroom wasn't working so I could do my hair in a mirror. Other than these issues we just carried on...\n\nThat was until our last night in the hotel when we came back to our room from a busy day out to find laminate flooring in our hallway. It stunk of sawdust and the noise from the builders was outrageous. Baring in mind this was 7pm!! We wouldn't have minded if it was during the day or we had been informed of this happening! We rang reception for them to tell us that this would be carrying on for another hour (8pm!). The noise and smell was so bad we had to leave our hotel room and go for a walk around instead of being able to relax. To be fair to staff they apologised and asked housekeeping to go into our room to clear the smell. Although we felt this work shouldn't of been happening in the first place!\n\nAll in all this hotel has great potential, it's a great location, it's just a shame the upkeep and informing of customers is extremely poor. I wouldn't recommending staying here as the pictures you see aren't exactly what you get. The amazing views that are shown of the balconies don't also feature the construction sight across the road, which is basically all you can see...","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We took advantage of everything this hotel has to offer including the restaurant which was awesome. My daughter is 10 months old which can be challenging in a big city but the hotel staff was extremely accommodating. \n\nWe checked out and left the day of the St.Patrick's day parade, streets were closed and traffic was a nightmare. I could not get my vehicle anywhere near the hotel so one of the hotel staff actually helped my wife carry our luggage several blocks away to meet me which saved the day for us. Had we not been leaving that day, it would have been an excellent location to check out the parade! \n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful and every detail is well thought out. The rooms are not only incredibly stylish (beautiful shower, amazing hardwood floors, etc.) but extremely comfortable. I travel a lot for work and stay in hotels up to 100 nights per year and this place is by far my favourite in any city I've been.

I called before arrival asking about parking options. Boom! 100% perfect instructions and the process went perfectly. When we arrived at the hotel, a young man welcomed us to the Gotham, held the door for us while we dragged our tired bodies over the threshold to the front desk. Immediately, Mustafa was on it - ensuring the best room he had available in our range was ready for us. He gave great sights-to-see advice when we asked. Whipped out a map and started circling must-sees.\n\nWhen we got to the room, we were pleasantly surprised by how bit it was! The hotel we stayed at the night before was half its size. Spacious, comfortable and clean! The bathroom was gorgeous! \n\nWhen we left for dinner, we asked Mustafa for a couple extra large towels and pillows to be delivered. Yep, they were! When we got back from dinner, we complained about the price of bottled water and soda at the neighborhood Walgreens (captive audience I supposed, near Times Square). Boom, comped! He gifted us a Coke and the large bottle of water! What a nice guy!\n\nThe next morning, when we were getting ready to check out, I was bummed that we wouldn't see him. I wanted to give him a tip for taking such good care of us. That's what we travelers are supposed to do, right? Well, much to my surprise, he was at the front desk! I reached out my hand with money in it, and he put up his in resistance. He put one on his heart and said he was honored to have had the opportunity (or at least that's how I remember it). I was grateful to know there were still decent people out there being kind because it was the right thing to do, and not just for the all mighty dollar. \n\nThank you Mustafa!

Il nostro arrivo \u00e8 stato deludente: stanza al sesto piano e non al piano alto come da nostra richiesta. Fosse solo questo. La camera era fredda ma, soprattutto, aveva una moquette sporchissima, e la cassetta di sicurezza che non funzionava. A nostra richiesta ci hanno spostato: ci \u00e8 stata assegnata una King a fianco anzich\u00e8 una Queen, ma la moquette aveva gli stessi problemi. Macchiati, in modo irrimediabile, anche i ripiani dei mobili. La vista: vogliamo parlarne? E' sulla 46ma, di fronte al cantiere di un palazzo in costruzione. La camera \u00e8 dotata soltanto di tende oscuranti, dunque per non avere in stanza gli sguardi indiscreti degli operai bisognava stare al buio tutto il giorno. L'illuminazione della camera era decisamente insufficiente.  Solo abatjour, una lampada vicino alla tv e un paio di deboli faretti all'ingresso. Le porte hanno maniglie molto dure, dunque la sensazione al nostro primo rientro in stanza \u00e8 stata quella di essere rimasti chiusi fuori. In realt\u00e0 bisognava essere pi\u00f9 decisi e sforzare. Passiamo al frigobar. Bottiglie, ma nessun cavatappi. Per una sera, la prima, e solo per quella, abbiamo preso una piccola bottiglietta di acqua minerale e nient'altro: ci hanno addebitato 18 dollari sulla carta di credito. A proposito: il soggiorno di nove giorni era gi\u00e0 stato pagato tramite Expedia, ma al nostro arrivo ci sono stati addebitati 900 dollari (cento al giorno) di cauzione, poi restituiti. Un'enormit\u00e0 per la categoria dell'Hotel. Gli addetti alla pulizia della stanza sono, inoltre, decisamente disattenti ed \u00e8 il motivo per cui non abbiamo mai lasciato la mancia: pigiami spostati in modo disordinato in giro per la stanza, asciugamani a volte non sostituiti, cuffia della doccia idem. Il giorno della nostra partenza abbiamo visto arrivare un camion, gli operai e tantissimi listoni di parquet. Evidentemente stanno rimettendo a posto ci\u00f2 che si sono resi conto che non va. Poi il front office manager, incontrato nella hall alla nostra partenza (purtroppo non prima), si \u00e8 scusato sia per i 900 dollari, sia per la moquette. Ha riconosciuto tutte le pecche di cui ci siamo lamentati e ci ha detto che ci far\u00e0 avere un parziale rimborso tramite Expedia (mi auguro accada davvero). Tra gli aspetti positivi del soggiorno, abbiamo apprezzato la posizione, ma solo parzialmente: vero che l'hotel \u00e8 in piena Midtown, e praticamente a ridosso della Fifth Avenue, ma rispetto ad altri alberghi la metropolitana non \u00e8 poi cos\u00ec vicina. Il bagno \u00e8 ristrutturato, con una grande doccia. Pochi, tuttavia, i prodotti a disposizione (uno per qualit\u00e0 e non uno a testa). Alcuni giovani della reception sono davvero gentili (non tutti) e disponibili: ci \u00e8 stata fornita un'ottima indicazione per il diner pi\u00f9 vicino. L'hotel \u00e8, inoltre, a ridosso di un Gregory's, caffetteria molto diffusa a Nyc, in cui fare ( se lo so desidera) una colazione italiana, con croissant e cappuccio. E' un albergo in cui potremmo decidere di tornare solo se risistemato.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I also had access to a terrace out the front of the hotel (shared only with one other room on my floor) though it was too cold to take advantage of it unfortunately. \n\ni then started noticing a few niggles: i had to ring down for a \"do not disturb\" sign and the room service menu (turns out the room service was from an adjoining steakhouse which was very expensive - the least expensive meal would have set me back about $70! - but i made do with Grubhub and of course all the restaurants around); the door into the small wardrobe scraped on the floor so i couldn't open\/shut it properly, the safety deposit box didn't work and one day, having left my room at 8.30am and returned at 3.30pm, my room still hadn't been serviced.  All these though i can forgive as they were relatively small points. The toiletries were lovely, there was a lovely walk-in shower, and the staff were without exception absolutely delightful. \n\nThe one thing i find it harder to forgive, however, was the awful wifi. Not only could i not FaceTime home (important to me) without it constantly freezing and failing, but even downloading and sending emails (essential when on business!) was very hit and miss and at times impossible. I did mention it once and they said it was unusual and it should improve, but it didn't. \n\nIt is, however, in a great location with lots of restaurants around and overall a great hotel (the room size being a big plus), and if wifi isn't important to you then i really do recommend this place.

I'm not going to shop around for another hotel on my next trip to NYC, this'll be the one that I (we) will use on our next trip here.\n\nThe Gotham is a hidden gem. Tucked away on 46th street you could (as we did) walk right on by it. If you're after glitz and glamour then it isn't the hotel for you, there's no grand entrance hall or 20ft chandeliers, but what it doesn't have it that department it has everywhere else. \n\n1-It's incredibly well placed being only a 5 minute walk in a straight line to either Times Square or the Rockafella building and its positioned perfectly for shopping along 5th avenue and surrounding areas and only a 10minute taxi ride down to Soho for the less tourist-y shops.\n\n2-The rooms are fantastic. Although not the cheapest of rooms, ones of a similar size would've cost a lot more even at worse hotels in the city.\n2.1-The beds in the room are the single best hotel bed I've slept in, and I've stayed in a few flashy places back on our side of the Atlantic. Although not a conventional construction the mattress\/topper combo works perfectly to create a place in which you don't want to leave. Ontop of that the physical side of the bed is way and beyond what we were expecting, being from England the biggest size on offer there isn't anywhere near the size of these.\n2.2-There is more space in this room than anyone could need, to give you an idea there is more than enough room for another super king sized bed and another single to use up the floor space, which in midtown manhatten is in itself a treat.\n2.3-The t.v\/cable service is upwards of what we were expecting, rather than a limited hotel service as we have been accustomed to it was a full cable package.\n2.4-lighting controls by the bed are a nice touch and the bedside lamps are nice.\n2.5-Bathroom was near perfect. Spacious, again more than enough room. Shower was spot on with two heads, one fixed rain style and one movable head, with the option to run them both simultaneously. Again it was incredibly spacious with enough room for 5 people let alone one.\n2.6-Decor was nice and up to date, a fresh feeling compared to some hotels in the area that still have the same trim and fitting they had in the 70's ( not the good type of vintage)\n\n3-The hotel is very very good, but it's the staff that make it what it is. \n3.1-Eldis, the Bellman has been helpful to no end and always went the extra mile in his manners, this was reinforced by the offering to help us with anything and everything from alternatives to cancelled trips to bars and places to eat. Unlike other places in the city he didn't seem like a robot just there to earn his money, he was engaging and chatty showing genuine consideration. He definitely brings something to this hotel.\n3.2- Andrew on the front desk was also incredibly and made check in and any other of our requirements super easy, and again was incredibly well mannered.\n3.3- all of the other staff whose names I don't know, everyone at the Gotham was very polite and I believe this reflects the business as a whole, they are all a solid representation of what the hotel and name is.\n\nNow there are only two bad points that I can make about the Gotham and they are;\n1- exterior noise from the balcony side. Some form of A\/C \/ exhaust\/ generator on the ground floor in the middle of all of the buildings on the block was off putting-ly loud. As it's cold out we didn't use the balcony, but when I did go out on it the noise level is beyond that of comfort. From inside the room (on the 23rdfloor) you can hear it. From the room it sounds like a heavy duty computer tower fan system or a fishtanks water pump is in the room.\n2- Although the light in the room is adequate, it isn't perfect, and if I'm being picky I'd say there needs to be another bulb in the middle off the room rather than the two above each pillow and the one above the door.\n\nTo conclude, I'm definitely stopping at The Gotham again without considering any others.\nThis is down to the fact that it ticked every box, and the staff turned it from a nice hotel to one I (we) have fallen in love with.\n\n-Alan & Shantelle","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was nice and spacious with the basic needs covered, there was no real wow factor aside from the bed which was the most comfortable bed i slept in during our 4 week trip. House keeping could use a little more attention to detail in stocking the mini bar and coffee machine. There were a few minor things that could have used some maintenance attention but nothing major.

Relatively clean and complimentary bottled water and some snacks, too! Generally quiet, if you don't need to use the noisy HVAC unit by window. Good black-out curtains.\n\nNot So Good: \nHard mattress, not notepad and pen by phone, only one chair on balcony (??), 3 coat hangers (for two people!!!) but no wall hooks for coats, etc., furniture was shabby with surface damage. No tea or coffee kettle (and no mention of complimentary room delivery, as some hotels do instead) Yes, there are coffee shops int he same block but we'd rather relax and read the news & mail sipping something warm upon waking instead of having to get dressed to go out and get something. (It is vacation, after all.) Electric outlets by bed BUT you have to plug in below and feed cable up through hole. Really bad design. Other places get this right. Balcony door didn't lock. (Is that intentional so guests don't lock themselves out there?) No robes in room. Thought website listed them?\n\nI'd say the hotel was upper middle price range so we had hoped to like it a bit more.

I really wanted to like The Gotham due to the great location but our stay was very disappointing. \n\nThe Pros: Great location esp for the holidays. Mustafa and other staff members were kind and helpful. Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are close by for morning coffee. Ask for a higher floor, which helps with traffic noise (if not on construction side of hotel). Decent size room for NYC. Mini fridge in rooms. Nice amenity to have a balcony but should have 2 chairs. The balcony is a nice touch for early Spring\/Summer.\n\nThe Cons: We did not start our trip out very well. We were told at check in the amount due on our reservation plus a $100 deposit. Long story short, the hotel tried to authorize 3 times multiple amounts which added up to almost $2000 more then our entire stay. Due to the multiple authorizations, the bank thought it was fraudulent activity and shut the card off. We were were told by the FD clerk in front of other staff members and guests in the lobby that our credit card was declined. He made no mention of the multiple authorizations and advised us to call the bank. We were very embarrassed and called the bank. That is when we found out about the multiple authorizations. When I asked the FD clerk about this, he at first tried to brush over it but I was pretty persistent with my questions. He finally stated that he did process multiple authorizations but for why the amount was more than double for our entire stay, he claimed that it was \"a system glitch\" that added the wrong amount.\n\nRoom- overlooked construction which had the lights on 24\/7 and they started working very early in the AM. The lights were not blocked by the fitted curtains and gaps in the room. If you are a sensitive sleeper or light sensitive, ask before booking if construction is still ongoing.\n\nHousekeeping- Our third night, our room was skipped and we had the Service please sign on the door since 10:30am. Only the last night, we asked for no service. No amenities\/towels\/toilet paper were replaced the first two nights so we had to request more. We had the same lint on the floor our entire stay so the room was never vacuumed. We also had a large grease stain on the table that we finally cleaned ourselves the last night. Only 4 hangers in the room and we had to call 2X and wait 4 hours for them to bring more. The toilet kept on running but a kind gentleman came quickly to fix. The phone only worked on speaker phone.\n\nNo coffee maker in the room which should be standard at all hotels. Also, the lobby had no holiday decorations and it was early Dec which made the resort feel a bit cold and stark.\n\nWe did notify the desk of our complaints the last night of our stay. The lady who was working apologized but by that point we were already disappointed. She was very nice but when you have many hotel options in NYC, there did not seem a desire to make us want to come back.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Unfortunately I don't remember all their names but thank you to all for making my stay so wonderful. the location of the hotel is fabulous, given the easy walks to Central Park, Broadway theaters, Times Square and Rockefeller Centre, minutes away from the Macy's Day Parade, Grand Central Station and so much more.

We faithfully stay at another great nearby hotel on each stay to NYC, but were too late to book this time and it was sold out.  We were excited to give another property a try. Unfortunately, it didn't quite meet the expectations based on the hotel's reviews and website. If 2.5 was a rating, I'd give it only because of the few staff members that were a great help, but feel honesty is the best policy for anyone on the fence about staying here...\n\nUpon arrival, we were immediately greeted by door staff with a quick check in. We were on the 11th floor in a King Room. Upon walking off the elevator, there was a mattress right in front of the elevator\/our room door in the small hallway. Upon entry, I immediately noticed how dirty the room was. Since we had just spent the day traveling with plans that evening, I didn't get around to much more of an inspection. The beds were OK, but the sheets themselves were a bit itchy, which didn't help my opinion of an unclean room. \n\nMy opinion became fact when I woke up the next morning, when all the lights went on and we were getting ready for the day, the room was much dirtier, and unkept than I had realized. The desk countertops were filthy, carpet a disaster, bathroom totally gross--not only unclean but literally falling apart. I had planned to make a note on the way out for the day, but upon getting out of the shower, I stepped on a sharp metal object when coming out of the shower. I immediately went downstairs to request a room change, which they were very apologetic about. I must note that the mattress was STILL in the hallway...\n\nWe moved rooms, and while the next room on the 16th floor was cleaner than the first, it wasn't all the way clean or kept up. The rest of the stay was uneventful. There were familiar faces up front who were quite friendly, and a few who were kind of complacent, but for the most part the staff was helpful. \n\nOverall, I think that there's potential with the hotel if the rooms were kept up and kept clean. I will say I loved the shared balcony on the 19th floor and the location. I don't know if we'll be staying again, but wouldn't completely write it off for future travelers.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The only disappointment we faced at the Gotham was Housekeeping. They serviced our room by pulling up the bedspread and putting away the hair dryer (and my hair straightener- which I luckily found before leaving), but they didn't remove a dirty glass, replace toiletries, or wipe down bathroom surfaces. In fact, if the tip I left hadn't been picked up, I would have doubted they had serviced the room at all.

I wanted to open the shades to let more light in but then I'd have to deal with the construction workers staring into my room!\nThen, I was met with another unpleasant surprise that the road that the hotel is on was being blocked off for the entire weekend.

Not as good as last time. Booked Superior Room like last time but as per Hotels.com photos, got a Deluxe room which had a little balcony and not a terrace, facing back of buildings (aka no view) . Called reception to discuss and they said it was basically pot luck if you get a front or rear view room and the photo of the terrace on Hotels.com is the communal area one, not for a room so very misleading! Will be complaining to them. Was asked to be made aware if any front rooms became available, they said they would in two days, never did. No plug sockets near the bed, shelf in bed side cabinet fell off when I put something on it, safe was locked by previous occupant (had to chase reception twice to send someone to sort it), wifi is slow and erratic and bed frame has very sharp corners (learnt the hard way, twice!) also their hotels.com listing says they provide shuttle to\/from JFK but got told before we arrived by email this service has stopped. TV satellite signal also plays up frequently. Water pressure is poor especially in the sink. \n\nGreat base for exploring Manhattan. Loads of decent eateries nearby. Only a few blocks from Times Square. King bed was massive and super comfy though not crazy on the pillows (too soft). Air con works effectively but is pretty noisy. The housekeeping staff do an amazing job every day to make the rooms up lovely and super clean. You get some toiletries and the hairdryer was powerful (don't bother bringing one from the UK, unlikely to work regardless). We didn't pay a city tax on departure this time but I'm positive we had to two years ago. A taxi from JFK mid afternoon was about $65 yet $80 there back in peak hour. \n\nEnjoyed my stay in the end and would've liked it more if I hadn't have stayed before to compare but I felt I got the wrong room, a cheaper one than what I booked and this stay was not cheap.

I had booked a skyline suite specifically to take advanatge of a larger room and to have access to a terrace which ended up being a complete waste of money.\n\nWhilst the room was large by New York standards, and modern with nice finishes, there were 3 main areas of complaint:\n\n1. Wifi connection was terrible and only accessible in certain areas of the room (even in these areas the connection was still not strong enough to make skype calls without constant loss of connectivity which was frustrating when trying to make business calls).\n\n2. There was only one cable channel available and when assistane was sought the hotel staff said that there was nothing that could be done to improve the reception.\n\n3. Due to the construction site opposite, the terrace was virtually unsuable as it was too loud to sit out there or even have the door to the terrace open. I was aware of the construction site at the time of booking and from other reviews but was not aware that it was a 24 hour site and so I was under the impression that the terrace could be used in the evenings without the constant drone of jackhammers. On a positive note, when the doors and windows were closed the construction was barely audible and so there was no interruption to sleep. \n\nI understand that this is only a boutique hotel however the rates for the suites are comparable to normal rooms at established hotels such as the Hilton. To be honest, seeing as though the terrace didnt end up being usable, I might as well have stayed at an ordinary room in the Hilton and had the advantage of major hotel infrastructure such as good wifi, cable, breakfast included etc. \n\nThe one positive was that the staff were excellent, friendly and did try to make our stay enjoyable as possible. I cannot fault the hotel management itself, just that the hotel itself could do with some improvements or a reduction in the rates which just simply did not translate to value.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Local to the area are a few coffee shops and eateries so there isn\u2019t much need to opt for the paid breakfast although the Wolfgang restaurant within the hotel is very high end and attractive.\n\nUnfortunately on arrival we were disappointed by the service \u2013 ( we were given no guidance as to the area or offered any helpful tips \u2013 it felt like the reservations guy was keen to get rid of us ) and the room (although relatively spacious for NYC) was also disappointing.  Although well equipped with a flat screen tv, sofa and fridge and balcony the frustrating thing was that the balcony to room 1212 overlooked construction works \u2013 very noisy construction works I might add. This meant that our view was awful and we feared opening the window due to the dust from the construction works. Had these works been mentioned when we booked we would have opted to stay elsewhere. \n\nFurthermore, the bathroom, although designed to be space saving wasn\u2019t overly practical for 2 guests.  The shower has no screen or divide from the toilet or sink meaning the water flies everywhere and steams up easily leaving you floating in puddles of water whenever you opt to use the bathroom. \n\nSo overall, although this hotel has potential and was clean and tidy l it didn\u2019t fully meet expectations based on the cost and as such I would be hesitant to recommend it to family\/friends other than for the location alone.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I decided on a \u20182\u2019 simply as thanks to Dwayne and the staff at the door \u2013 they were all great.  I unfortunately can\u2019t say the same about the rest of our stay, or others on staff.  It started when we were assigned the wrong room.  When I book a \u201cKing Skyline Suite\u201d with a \u201cLiving Area with Sofa and Coffee Table\u201d and a \u201c45 square foot bathroom\u201d, I don\u2019t expect to get a room with a queen bed, no seating area and a bathroom so small that I could barely turn around.  And when I go to the front desk to request a change of room, I don\u2019t expect to be told that I was assigned the right room, as per my booking.  Even after Sasha looked up our reservation and realized that we were given the wrong room type, I was still told that the room we\u2019d received was \u2018really the same room\u2019 as what we\u2019d booked, and was same price.  We were not moved the first night, but fortunately did get another room \u2013 a King Skyline Suite - for the remaining 5 nights of our stay.  \n\nThe second room was very nice but still was not as described in the booking.  The bathroom was small \u2013 definitely not a 45 square foot bathroom \u2013 and contained the only mirror in the whole unit; there was no \u2018floor to ceiling mirror\u2019.  That made it awkward for two people to get dressed and ready at the same time, particularly since the main room was so poorly lit.  As for the amenities, the \u2018generous supply of towels\u2019, the \u2018400-thread count linens\u2019\u2026 well, they were nice when we got them.  We arrived back late one afternoon to find that while our room had been cleaned, nothing had been left for us.  Not a single towel, no amenities, no coffee, no coffee cups, nothing.  (And thank you \u2013 NOT! - to the day manager who told us, upon reviewing the problems encountered during our stay, that we had in fact received everything but had called down to get more).  Another day we arrived back around mid-afternoon to find that our room simply hadn\u2019t been cleaned and serviced at all.  Then there was the day when our room appeared to be reasonably well serviced, but the bed was missing a sheet.  Some days were better than others but there was not a single day when everything was there and the room had been fully restocked.  restocked.\n \nSeparate from having a cleaning staff who clearly haven\u2019t been properly trained, or who simply don\u2019t care, it seems that they have the same problems with the maintenance staff.  No back-up batteries in the bedside clocks (in either of the two rooms we stayed in), ceiling lights burned out, and that nasty little ceiling smoke alarm that went off with an ear piercing screech at about 5:20 a.m. on our first night at the hotel  \u2013 and could not be stopped until we had maintenance come to the room to change the battery. (Oh, and the front desk phone wasn\u2019t working so I had to get dressed to go down to the lobby to request that maintenance come up.) By that time getting any more sleep was obviously out of the question.  (And thank you again \u2013 NOT \u2013 to the day manager who told us that the alarm batteries are routinely changed twice a year.  I don\u2019t think so.)\n\nI won\u2019t get into the issues of the 24-hour construction noise coming from the building across the street; after all, that\u2019s not The Gotham\u2019s fault, and if they were considerate enough to warn customers in advance, they might lose business. \n \nHere\u2019s what it comes down to.  Problems happens.  But when a customer has a problem in a particular area, a good hotel will ensure that this same problem doesn\u2019t repeat during the customer\u2019s stay.  Yet we had issues with room service every single day.  And when a customer is assigned the wrong room and endures all the problems that we encountered, it should be a given that compensation will be offered.  Not so at The Gotham Hotel.  Had I not insisted that our rate for the first night be reduced, we would never have received any compensation.  And while we were compensated (but not enough), it came with the all the explanations and excuses from the day manager, which frankly was rude and insulting.  Thankfully Dwayne stepped in and tried to smooth things over. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed in many of the other reviews that people have fairly significant complaints about the rooms not being as described when they booked, or about noise or service\/cleaning (or lack of same), etc..  However in many of the reviews, it\u2019s the great work of the staff in addressing these concerns that bumps the review up to a 4 or even a 5. That\u2019s great, but the staff at a hotel should not have to spend all their time apologizing to customers and working to fix problems.  That said, in the end I did give the staff credit, by rating The Gotham a \u20182\u2019 instead of the \u20181\u2019 that they probably deserve.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had actually stayed here two years ago on a previous trip and quite enjoyed it,  so we opted to stay there again.  We were not disappointed.\n\nThe location alone makes this hotel great.  They're just a few blocks from Times Square,  so it's convenient to virtually anywhere one would want to go in the city,  but far enough removed from the giant jumbo-trons so that you're not trying to sleep while illuminated by a giant, fluorescent commercial outside your window.  \n\nOur first night,  we were on the second floor,  and to be completely honest,  the building across the street (unaffiliated with the hotel) was undergoing some major construction,  including overnight.  It was like something out of a movie.  Quite literally jackhammering at 3:00 in the morning.  That,  combined with the traffic noise made for some tough sleeping.  Also,  there were some minor issues with the room.  The thermostat didn't work,  the bathroom door didn't close,  and the one and only lamp in the room would only stay on (had to be unplugged from underneath to turn it off).\n\nThe second morning on our way out,  we mentioned this to a fabulous concierge named Mustafa.  First off,  he immediately heard all of our complaints, and assured us that they would be addressed by that afternoon.  Upon returning later that evening,  sure enough,  the issues had been addressed with the exception of the bathroom door, which was going to have to be removed so that it could be fixed properly.  However,  Mustafa had worked with the rest of the hotel staff to arrange for us to be moved to another room.  \n\nThe next room was on the 14th floor and was fabulous.  Spacious,  quiet,  comfortable,  just perfect.  We really appreciated the extra effort of Mustafa and the staff in making sure we were accommodated.  \n\nAnd,  I must mention that in addition to giving us great service,  Mustafa was a fabulously great person.  He's got a great sense of humor,  and always had excellent recommendations on places to eat,  roof top bars,  and other attractions.  It was a really nice addition to an already wonderful trip to have such a warm,  affable person at the hotel.  He's the best,  so if you stay here,  he's your guy.  The rest of the staff is excellent,  but he's definitely our favorite.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Room facilities were good.\n\nI feel disappointed having to write this but unfortunately I was bitten quite badly (37 bites in total!) a couple nights into our 6 night stay. The bites occurred while in bed one night. I did go to reception the following morning to discuss and although the member of staff was friendly and quickly changed our room, I felt that I was 'hushed' so other guests wouldn't overhear. This member of staff also blamed the bites on a mosquito being in our room. This was before having even inspected it?! \n\nLet me assure you, there was no mosquito. Our window had not been open once, there had been no occurrences of insects in our room and there definitely was no mosquito under the bed covers (yes I made us get up at 3am after the bites inspecting the sheets!) \n\nSadly the bites somewhat hampered our trip. I was in so much pain and discomfort wearing shoes (bites mostly on my feet). We got back to the uk a few days ago and the bites are so itchy even a week on, I have now had to seek advice from a health professional with further planned treatment at the end of the week if the bites don't let up :( \n\nI did not get any kind of apology or refund for this. \n\nOther points to note, we found the wifi very hit and miss in both rooms we stayed in. We struggled to keep a connection most of the time, whether using iPad, laptop or our phones. \n\nAlso, for those who are interested, we had chosen this hotel both for location and also for gym access. However the gym they use only opens week days and shuts at 5.30.

We tried to contact the hotel by email, but never got any response. When I called and said this they said that they got so many emails that they had no time to answer them. That is really not good service. \nWe booket the \"penthouse\" room, which is marketed as \"A new height of luxury. Sprawling and sleek across the entire 25th floor, the Gotham Penthouse Suite offers nearly 740 square-feet of total space and the ultimate urban luxury experience.\", and really looked forward to the stay. Our first impression was disappointing, the room was not as big as marketed, and I think they have counted in both a balcony on the opposite site (available from the elevators) and other. I would estimate the room to be around 400 - 500 square feet. The bath marketed as \"mammoth en-suite bathroom\" was not big as expected but very small, and you did not feel like beeing in a penthouse at all. A strange thing was that only one of the elevators could get to the upper floor, if you got the wrong one you had to go the stairs from the florr below. That is no big deal, but annoying, especially since the stairs was rather dirty and filled with chairs and garbage. One time the door was stuck, and I had to press hard to open it, to my surprice there was a man in the staircase, sleeping on some of the stairs! What are you doing he said! Well, it was probably one employee trying to find some sleep, but doing it in the stairs is not a good idea. The worst problem was the AC, two large, old units were making a lot of noise, so much that we were not able to sleep. After a night we complained, and - to their credit - the staff handled the complaint very professional. We got another room on 12th floor at lower price, and even though the AC was noise also there (it was only one unit), we accepted to try another night. But after two nights we checked out and found another hotel. It was positive that the hotel reception manager dropped the 24 hours cancellation fee. All in all this is a hotel with nicely designed rooms and a great location (but a lot of building activity is going an at the oposite side of the road). If they updated the AC system and cleaned up the stairs area it can be a very good hotel alternative, but considering the price (which is on the luxury level) I rate it below average. The first thing this hotel should do is to change the description of the penthouse room and \"mammoth\" bath, the description is overrated and not according to facts, and guests don't like to be disappointed in such matters.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The air conditioning which was needed due to be it being quite warm during my stay was very noisy and i couldn't have it on in my sleep but then it would get very warm during the night, there was construction across the road which was unfortunate and also disrupted sleep. During my stay the door handle to the outside was broken 99 percent of the time and we had the technician out twice and it still broke, leaving it unable to properly close the door from the noise. Anytime we asked for cups or tea or even a shower cap they took forever to come, if they did ever come. it is also the first hotel i've ever stayed at to pre-auth $600 and take out $100 each night for incidentals. Overall the location was perfect but the place was basically falling apart it definitely needs some renovation and the extra charges were really annoying but id love to give a special mention to eldus who was wonderful and the front reception were also lovely and very forgiving. I also left my charger there and was coming back in a week so i think it was really good of them to keep it for me until i returned.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The best kept secret in Manhattan.\n\nUpon our arrival from western Canada to NYC we had a couple \"snags\" with our room.\nThen the most amazing things happened. The hotel staff jumped into action.\nThey were all warm, wonderful, and professional. They moved us to a beautiful King Suite. The room was spacious, well decorated, and comfortable. The bathroom was large and modern. The terrace had an incredible view. It was unique to have a large terrace where we could relax at the end of the evening.\nDuring our 9 day stay the staff genuinely made sure that we were comfortable and content. Any request we had was addressed promptly and professionally. Dwayne, Mike, Eldis, Adina, Andrew, and Sasha were all incredibly helpful and caring.\n\nMake sure you pay the \"upcharge\" to have breakfast included as part of your stay. Wolfgang's restaurant is first class dining and the breakfast is gourmet food. Breakfast is served on white linen tables with professional waitresses\/waiters. The restaurant staff are personable and knowledgeable. Ilir, Maria, Irene and Agron treated us like family and we looked forward to our morning sojourns with them.\n.\nThe hotel is a 6 minute walk to Grand Central Station. You can easily connect to any subway. The hotel is within walking distance to Times Square and the Theatre District. It is a great central location to almost everything in Manhattan.\n\nThe hotel has free WiFi. \n\nI would happily recommend The Gotham Hotel to my friends and family.\nWe have just returned home and we are both missing \"The Gotham Hotel\".","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a good amount of things to bring so valet would have been nice but honestly it's on the same street as the hotel, 3 minute walk. And this place is walking distance to 5th ave and Times Square. Awesome. We checked in with Dwayne. He's the man. Very professional and accommaditing. More people should be like him. Penthouse was beautiful, mini bar, refrigerator room for food, big wine cooler. Balcony was very nice, waterfall shower was amazing. Wish the bathroom was a little bigger though. We had dinner downstairs at the Wolfgang steakhouse, its very small inside BUT the staff is really friendly, the food was well worth the money. I had filet and my wife had 3lb lobster, both perfect and were snobs. Big wine menu but small on hard stuff.. Either way it's so convienient.\n\nHere's what bothered me, If you stay in the penthouse you have to use the left elevator. The left elevator sucks. It took up to 5 minutes to come on several occasions, floor level and room level. When we said something to a bell boy he went to see what the problem was, he came back to tell us to just take it to 24 and walk up to 25. Yeah I know it's 1 flight of stairs but I'm paying good money to stay here and this happened after dinner too. We were bombed, who wants to walk a flight of stairs... Come Morning the construction across the street woke me up, that was terrible but we're heavy sleepers so it wasn't a problem falling back asleep luckily","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Super convenient location for 5th Ave, Times Sq, Central Park, Midtown, Grand Central Station and Rockefeller Center. I was considering Airbnb but got a good deal on hotels.com as NYC is usually very expensive for hotels. Most hotel rooms are usually small and\/or old in New York (especially compared to Asia where I come from) but I would say the room was larger than average. The design of the room was modern and functional. The wifi was reliable and good. There was a modern tv with good range of cable channels, There was mini bar with an ok selection which I did'nt use. What is it with air con in New York hotels? It was noisy and the air con control did'nt seem to work. There was a small balcony but since I was on a low floor facing the back, I did'nt use it. The bathroom could have had more space to put things, and the shower hose had a leak thus I could only use the overhead rain shower. The design of the wardrobe door was poor since it was spring loaded thus awkward to keep open whilst trying to use the safe. Other gripes - nice if they provided bottled water and toothpaste, elevators were a bit on the slow side.

The staff is friendly enough, but there were enough annoyances that we probably won't stay here again.  The doorman was rarely at the front door, and we had to struggle with packages to get in the heavy front door time and time again.  This is a small hotel, and the rooms are quite small as well.  There are no ice machines, and the ice must be requested and brought up by the doorman.  Maybe that's why he's rarely at the front door.  We had requested ice and, another day, a sewing kit, which was urgently needed.  It was not brought up by the time we had to leave, which was an hour later.  I had asked the housekeeper for clean towels, and she said she had to call the manager to get approval to replace my dirty towels with clean ones.  I have never heard of that in a hotel before.  This was during her regular housekeeping visit to the room.  There is not much of a lobby here, just the small space in front of the check-in desk.  There is a restaurant in the back, which we did not visit.  Because the restaurant is open to the public, there appears to be no security here.  Anyone can just come in the front door, head towards the restaurant, get on the elevators and get off on any floor.  You don't need a room key to operate the elevator.  All in all, I probably would not stay here again.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The first time it happened, I came back to my room at 11 pm in the evening so I asked front desk to clean my room the next day.  On the next day, I came back to my room at 4 pm and it still wasn't cleaned.  So after requesting for the room to be cleaned again, it finally did get cleaned on the 3rd evening of my stay.  Some other minor things.....The mini bar did not get restocked with water.  The deadbolt on my door was broken and had to be fixed.  The toilet did not flush properly.  And finally, the ironing board they gave me did not prop up.  \n\nAs I was checking out, I let the front desk know about the list of issues and she said a  manager would call me.  It's been 5 days and have not heard from a manager yet.\n\nI work in HR for a very major international company and I often arrange for candidates who are interviewing to stay at this hotel.

Great for those visiting and wanting to see all of the midtown attractions.\n\nWe had booked a bed & breakfast rate, but were advised at the point of check-in that the hotel were no longer working with the restaurant, so they would not honour that arrangement. We were given our room, but no offer of reimbursement or credit for the restaurant (even though I asked).\n\nRoom was on the 9th floor and pretty small, but we only planned on using it for sleeping so were not fussed. It was clean, although slightly run down. The wallpaper was discoloured and coming away from the wall (looked like water damage).\n\nThere was a small balcony which looked out into another building, literally into a dentist's chair. \n\nIf you are looking for somewhere to rest your head when visiting NYC, this hotel would be a good fit. It is just a shame that with a little effort, the hotel could be modern and great. \n\nWe maybe had high expectations (comparing it to others in the area and the price we paid), and we weren't unhappy with our stay (except for the breakfast issue), but it isn't somewhere we would choose to book into again.","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was clean, comfortable, spacious by NYC standards, and quiet. I have several minor quibbles, and because some things are more important to other travelers I will list them in the interest of being helpful:\n\n* The room is dark. There are two lamps on either side of the bed and two small recessed lights in the ceiling, also at the head of the bed. The bathroom and entry way are well lit but anywhere other than the bed is shadowy.\n\n* The pillowtop mattress is actually a regular mattress with some kind of separate, pillowy addition. This makes the mattress very thick so a flat sheet (instead of a fitted sheet) is used and tucked in between the box spring. Sleep vigorously and you'll wake up tangled in sheet. \n\n* The room does not come with an iron. Fortunately I managed without one, and I don't know if one could've been obtained by calling the front desk. I stopped traveling with a travel iron years ago because I haven't stayed in a room where one wasn't provided. I found this a curious amenity to lack.\n\n* There is no lobby to speak of. There is an entry with the reception desk to the left and a tiny area with seating for approximately 6-8 people. Hard, uncomfortable seating. I took a red eye and arrived early in the morning, so it would've been nice to relax comfortably for a bit before heading out to explore until check in time.\n\nThat's it for minor inconveniences.  I booked my room at a discount on another site so I got a good deal. The bed was extremely comfortable, and as I said earlier, the room was quiet. I was on the 6th floor in the back of the hotel. If you can't get one of the high floors I recommend a room in the back. The view from the front is nothing but scaffolding on the building directly across the street, and being in back cut out all street traffic and construction noise.\n\nThe other standout about The Gotham is the location. During my stay I walked to:\n\n5th Avenue\nMadison Avenue\nRockefeller Center\/Plaza\nRadio City Music Hall\nThe New York Library\nBryant Park\nThe Empire State Building\nThe Queensboro Bridge\nTimes Square\nCentral Park\nA couple of historic churches whose names escape me\n\nIn short, I recommend this hotel. I was alone and felt very safe: there were only 4 rooms total on my floor. Wolfgang's, the on-site restaurant has a lovely bar and a great Merlot. The staff were professional and courteous. The room is a great size, the balcony was a lovely treat, and the location - for what I paid - cannot be beat. \n","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

They even wished my daughter Happy Birthday!   As we arrived a couple of hours before check-in, we were directed to the rest rooms to change our clothes as it was much warmer than in London, our details taken for check-in and then our bags stored for us.  They also took our credit card details as they pre-charge $100\/room\/night to cover room service, mini-bar etc.  This is deposited back onto your card on departure minus expenses.    Luckily, I had read about this in another review, as I might have been taken aback had I not known.\n\nWhen we returned later and went up to our rooms, we were really pleasantly surprised as they were modern, clean and spacious.  Our road-facing room had a mini balcony you could stand on, while our daughter\u2019s inward facing room had a proper balcony with tables and chairs.\n\nThe hotel is in a great location for sightseeing \u2013 bang in the middle, so nowhere was too far and it is just round the corner from Grand Central Station \u2013 so transport was never a problem, although we did walk a great deal as well.   On our final day, the reception crew advised us not to travel back to airport by the metro as it was rush-hour and they said that we\u2019d never fit our cases on the trains.  They were also concerned that we hadn\u2019t pre-booked a cab and thought we\u2019d never be able to flag one down on the street.  So two of them spent some time calling cab companies until they found one who was free \u2013 great customer service.\n\nNo comment on the restaurant, as we didn\u2019t eat there, but there are plenty of places to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner close by.\n\nWould I stay there again?

You are only a minutes walk to 5th Avenue. Right next door you have a deli and also a great coffee shop with lovely pastries (Gregory's Coffee). You are far enough away to get a peaceful nights sleep but close enough to easily walk to everything aswell. \n\nAs for the hotel - I would say it was modern, clean and spacious...the rooms were great, fairly big for NYC and the beds were comfortable with a memory foam mattress - also no noise whatsoever (only three other rooms on our landing). The bathroom was modern with a rain fall shower and nice toiletries. Two minor problems - the air con was noisy and the shower's temperature could be tempermental (had to leave it running a couple of minutes sometimes.)

Rude staff and uncaring management","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-08-17","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon and I've got to say its the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The location is pretty good however the service and accommodation is shocking for the price that we paid. When we arrived at the hotel, as excited newly-weds we told the receptionists that we had travelled from England as we had just got married. Both receptionist struggled to grimace a smile but said nothing. But what else did we expect because when booking the accommodation, my husband emailed the hotel and explain it was our honeymoon but they didn't have the decency to respond. \n\nAs this was our honeymoon we paid more than we could really afford for a terraced room and looking at the pictures on their website we were really excited about this. The terrace was ridiculous and could not be used as it was too noisy from the surrounding air conditioning units (that dripped water), the noise from the road works that were ongoing throughout our two week stay and the fact that we were surrounded by office building with working staff - I understand that nothing can be done about the road works or office buildings however a warning would have been nice and there is nothing mentioned on their website about this. To me this is unacceptable and there shouldn't be an extra charge for this!!!!! We did speak to the receptionist about the room and how we felt it was not worth the money we paid and said we could either down grade our room (with no refund) or upgrade and pay extra which there was no way we could afford. The receptionist was rude, abrupt and uncaring about our stay. \n\nOn arrival to our room we started to unpack and found a pair of used underpants and socks from a previous guest in the wardrobe. We went straight down to report this to the receptionist who offered no real apology and she could not really understand us when we spoke due to her heavy eastern European accent. In truth she seemed like she couldn't be bothered to speak to us. Eventually a handyman came up to our room to remove the underwear however did not clean anything. The fact that the underwear was even there demonstrates the level of cleanliness in the hotel. Again there was no apology and the typical rude personality from staff that seems typical of this hotel. \n\nThe room overall was pretty nice. Our room was cleaned on most mornings however we did have a take away pizza one night and the box was there for over two days. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Through the stay I kept getting bitten, I found this really strange as I always put insect repellent on each time we went out. The only time I didn't put cream on was in the room....I truly believe that I was being bitten by bed-bugs however there was no evidence of this. Other guests from the hotel said the same thing. \n\nFrom getting back I emailed the hotel the above information, they emailed back to ask us when we stayed and the name of the booking and said they would look into it. I emailed them this information but they did not respond again. I emailed three weeks ago asking if they had found anything out but they have not responded. I explained in the email that I would be putting this review online but again there is no response. Please see our photos!","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We don't normally spend a lot on accommodation when we travel abroad however given this was our honeymoon we splashed out far more than we usually would (or could really afford!). We paid extra beforehand to upgrade to a room with a terrace and king size bed as we thought it would be nice to have a terrace to look out into the city. Looking at the hotels website the terrace views looked fairly good hence the reason we paid the extra. Upon arrival we checked in and mentioned it was our honeymoon and we'd travelled all day from England to get there (this was barely even acknowledged by the staff - a simple congratulations shouldn't be too hard to muster!!). We checked in and headed up to our room on the 15th floor. Upon looking into the room it seemed nice enough - nothing spectacular but not too bad. We decided to check out the 'balcony' we had paid extra for to be greeted by a wall of noise when opening the terrace doors (see photos below and video on my profile). The tiny terrace looked out onto the back of other buildings and was directly above the air conditioning unit hence rendering it entirely unusable due to the immense noise - we couldn't open the doors for the whole 2 weeks due to this noise. I proceeded to put some of my clothes away in the wardrobe only to find a pair of dirty socks and underwear had been left in there from the previous guests. We went down to complain to the reception about both the ridiculous terrace we had paid extra money for and the dirty linen in our room. The receptionist was very difficult to understand due to speaking quietly with a strong accent however the only offer we were given despite the dirty linen in our room was a downgrade to a front facing room with no money back!!! If we wanted a better terrace we would have to pay $30 more per night.....something we simply couldn't afford. A handyman did come and remove the dirty linen whilst we were in the room (slightly awkward and uncomfortable to say the least) however he didn't even wipe down the area he took them from.\n\nOnly thing this hotel really has going for it is a decent location - wouldn't stay there and would certainly advise not to pay for a terrace room if you do!!\n\nThis hotel was the only sour point on an otherwise perfect honeymoon so thanks for that Gotham Hotel!!!","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Right in the heart of Midtown. Times Square, Rockafellar Centre, Grand Central all within two blocks!! There is a great breakfast restaurant next door called FoodWorld with tonnes of selection and very inexpensive, only open for breakfast and lunch. But very convenient for breaky.\nWe would definitely stay here again. Truth of the matter is we were never in our room anyways. But when we were, we were very comfortable, AC, comfy bed! Clean!!!!!\n","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I'll write down my experience in details to give the other travelers an idea what to expect if ever they'd choose this hotel.\n\n1) Arrival- The doorman greeted us nicely which is good but the receptionist didn't even have the charm to offer the water that we saw on the sides upon getting in.  She was haggard-looking, stressed at such early time(we arrived around lunch) and was just as less energetic with accommodating our luggages(not a good \"welcome personnel\").  What's frustrating here is that 10 mins before 2pm, our room was still NOT ready! (we drove for more than 10 hours to get here). A minute after two people came in, that finally pushed her to say that they're preparing our rooms already..yep not so smooth getting in.\n\n2) The Room- It's big enough and also comfortable. Bed is very comfortable(queen size) with good pillows too. Bathroom is clean, complete with basic stuff you'll need (vanity set, soap, etc). There's 1 complimentary bottled water in the room. TV and cable channels are superb.  Unfortunately, our aircon was not working--it took almost an hour for us to get transferred to another one with good AC.\n\n3) The Lobby-  It's a nice, small place that's good enough to serve its purpose to receive guests. There's no restroom here so you'd either have to go back to your room or go to the basement(Shared with employees) for any emergency.\n4) The Location- Perfect location to walk around NY--very accessible to all(as in right in the heart of 5th avenue, Times Square, etc). \n5) The Bar- We were never tempted to try it.\n\nAfter our stay, we(3 of us) decided that we'll just drink some water in the reception area prior to the drive back home--unfortunately glasses were not available. Worst part is we asked more than three times(!) to request for glasses so that we can quench our thirst--nobody came and not even one exerted an effort to try harder(apparently they are out of glasses even in the bar!).  That receptionist was the worst in customer service ! We left the hotel (after almost an hour of waiting) still without the glasses--really frustrating for us as we're really thirsty.  We ended up just buying bottled water outside.\n\nOverall, the hotel is nice enough-- location is awesome! But the management needs to train their staff more when it comes to customer service--this factor after all, really sets one good hotel apart from the rest.\n\n","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1963673,"title":"Perfect Location - OK Stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-06-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Lots of good things, a few more bad things than we would've liked.\n\nFirstly, let me start off by saying the staff were lovely. There were a couple of new recruits who were learning the ropes so we thought perhaps they have a fairly high turnover of staff. Or we'd just booked when a few people had left out of coincidence. The staff did everything they could to help us when necessary.\n\nTeething problems such as no glass of wine on arrival as promised on booking. The bar inside is not affiliated with the hotel which we found very strange, so this request was met with some confusion. However, they do make a mean Negroni, even if the bar staff look very stressed out and ready to go home. I felt a bit like they were putting on a front for customers and didn't realise we could see their frustration and stress. I know the feeling back in the real world!\n\nI had contacted the hotel a couple of times before to get confirmation on some things, namely that we requested a high room (as high as our price bracket would allow). It was difficult to get in touch - they never responded to emails apart from an exchange of emails I had with someone about booking a car to collect and drop off at JFK (very expensive, I wouldn't recommend), but twice before then my emails had been ignored (or lost in the fray). I had to phone them twice to confirm things but eventually got told we were booked on the 10th floor in a front-facing room. Great! We were very happy with this until we turned up and were told we were actually booked on a 4th floor room because they had 'upgraded' us to a better room and ergo, a better bed. That wasn't really the point of my request: to have a better bed. The point was to be higher up. I've been to NYC a few times before so, like a lot of people, I know what to look for in a hotel room, especially in Midtown. Height is important to me in NYC as I love to watch the city go by and light up, so we were disappointed with this change. They'd obviously bumped us 'down' for another guest because an 'upgrade' was the only explanation they could offer as to why we have moved from floor 10 to floor 4 and they didn't have any rooms to change us to that evening. We didn't want to cause too much of a fuss as the staff were being as nice as possible about it so we took the room on the proviso that we could change before 12pm the next day. We decided to stay, the room was very large for NYC and the building across the street (the glass building in the photos) was shrouded in a black gauze as it was being worked on so there was hardly much of a view anyway - apart from if you looked up at the other buildings. Oh well, we thought. Until we heard the construction noise at 7am. Not much we could do about it, though! \n\nI slept with earplugs... \n\nThere were a few problems with noise - lots of slamming doors and at one point the lift doors were making a horrible screeching sound on our floor but they did fix it within 24 hours. There was a little bit of construction work on the last day we were there which was incredibly loud in reception when we were trying to settle up. I understand these things are circumstantial but it was one of a few noise issues that disappointed us.\n\nIn general, the room was gorgeous. We had a huge TV, huge bedroom, huge bed, huge shower (you can see a theme here, right?). The balcony was tiny but we didn't care, just having an outside space was nice and quite frankly if you want to sit out on the balcony you're going to have to pay a little more than we did! That's fine, just not something we could afford this time around.\n\nThe location was perfect, situated a 5 minute walk to Times Square - we did so much walking around Midtown and the park which is also not far at all. We only got cabs or the subway far downtown when we needed to. \n\nOverall, I would stay here again once they've finished construction on the building opposite and when we could afford a higher room with a wider balcony, but I think they're working out some kinks right now (or we just went at an awkward time). However, the staff were really the standout point for us as they were incredibly helpful in often quite difficult situations and always made sure to do what they said they were going to do. Thanks for the stay, guys! And hopefully when we've stayed again I will write a more glowing review! :D","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":1963673,"title":"Wish it had been slightly different","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-06-29","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"So this is a hard one for me. I really really really wanted to like this place. Hard facts:  I stayed from June 26-28, 2015 in the Skyline King room on the 10th floor (room 101).\n\nThe pros: LOCATION is perfect, room was HUGE, nice terrace with tables and chairs, agents all very friendly and clearly work hard to please their guests. Also, they are very patient with guests who are upset (ahem, yours truly) and do not hold a grudge or treat you badly after the issue you lost your cool about is resolved. \n\nThat all said there are a few reasons I won't return to The Gotham Hotel and they are as follows:\n\n1. Something is wrong with their check in process \/ computer system (this is the issue I lost my cool about). They ran a charge the morning of my stay before I arrived as they should for the first night. When I arrived they ran a 'hold' on the card I gave them to check in - 10am ET. I was told my room wasn't ready, but they showed me where I could sit and work - great! I finished my business, room was still not ready so I went for a walk. Came back thinking they would just give me my room key (it was well after 4pm) and I could go get ready to meet my friends. But...\n\nThe desk agent said she needed my credit card again. I asked why because I gave it to them this morning. She said she needs to put the hold for the second night and it isn't in my folio. Ummm, ok, why didn't they say that in the morning when I checked in? I reluctantly handed her my card and the charge came back declined. I called my credit card company and they tell me the hotel had already been approved for two separate holds and they've tried to charge my card a total of FOUR times! OMG, WHAT?!? So, I'm standing there not knowing who I should be angry with - credit card company or hotel. On the hotel's side, they honestly could not see that the charge for the second portion of my stay had been approved - I saw the log myself - when they kept running the hold the multiple runs kicked off the fraud protection on my card (duh) LOL. Needless to say I got a little \"yelly\" but the staff was great, they stayed calm and talked to my credit card agent, the agent cleared the last three charges and ran the second charge again without incident. Whew, got my room, I'm good. Thanks. This was a headache for me and the staff at the hotel. Whatever is wrong with their system needs to be fixed. Also, next time they get a decline in the am at check in they should tell the guest right then, not wait until the guest returns after check-in time and surprise them with that nonsense. AND I have to wait a bit to make sure the charges are correct - wish me luck!\n\n2. Shower was great on day 1 and day 2, but for some reason when I got back to the hotel my second night and wanted to shower, the hot water didn't work as well. I didn't complain thinking maybe a lot of people were using hot water at that time. But the morning I checked out the water was also cold in the shower, but not from the sink - what the?\n\n3. Terrace flooded because of the rain - I told the front desk and they fixed it immediately, but honestly, it was a big pain in the butt for me and I just think that at the rate I paid I shouldn't have had to deal with multiple problems each day.\n\n4. No coffee in room, charged $4.50 for a very small cup of not so great coffee from the bar. This is just stupid. They don't have that many rooms and could easily put a coffeemaker in each one for guests to use.\n\nOverall, 4 headaches = not worth the price. I won't return. Again, very sad because the staff works so hard and really wants to be accommodating, in many ways they are just set up to fail. Not cool.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

The hotel's internet listed room service as one of it's amenties - unfortunately we learned they did not offer it - so after a long day of sightseeing, we went out for dinner.  When we returned to the hotel our room keycard would not work and we could not get back in our room.  After several trips to the front desk and new keycards made we could still not get into our room.  Next came the maintenance people at the hotel - after several trys - they still were unable to unlock the door.  We were told that the head maintenance person was being called in and would be there in about 30 minutes - 1 1\/2 hours later he arrived. Still no luck opening the door - one of the maintenance people told us the last time that happened he had to go through the room next door and climb over the balcony to unlock the door.  So they decided to try the same approach - which I was very nervous about - since our room was on the 7th floor - and a wall separated the two balconies.  One more try with the keycard and the door opened.   After 2+ hours sitting in a hot hall floor we finally gained access to our room, around midnight.  Only one little problem - no one could get the keycard to work again - which meant that either my wife or I had to stay in the room so we would not get locked out - talk about inconvenience.  And what did we receive for this inconvenience after bringing it to the attention of the Manager?  $50 off our room - totally unacceptable.

I picked up a nice rate on one of the travel websites which made for an even better experience.  The hotel is a small, boutique hotel - in which they are remodeling their restaurant (Wolfgang's Steakhouse) so no food there.  We stayed on the second floor - which I read other's reviews to upgrade to go higher - but with the terraces - it seemed no matter which floor you are on - you'd still be facing a brick wall to the back of the hotel.  Maybe for the front of the hotel it would help - but you're still facing 46th street with not too much to see.  The room itself was great for NYC - fairly large, comfortable bed and the best part was the bathroom - the shower was a tiled, large walk in - with a rain head shower and wand.  The part that made it even better is that I'm 6'7\" so usually I'm cramped or need to bend down -not this shower! - I could actually raise my hands and still not hit the shower head!  So if you are 6 foot +, this is a great stay!  They also have some items in the room (drinks, chips) - but they are at the usual very high prices so I would suggest bringing in your own.  There is a nice wine\/liquor store across the street which is great if you're up for a drink in the room.  My only complaint would be - around 10:15 pm and again at 2:15 am - the staff made a huge disturbance in the hallway - with what I believe was bringing down bins of linens or maybe trash?  But it went on for about 10 minutes and sounded like they were banging the carts into the walls or pushed them down the stairs?  So overall - great stay if you get a good price.  We found the staff to be very polite and helpful.","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

A few new staff at the front desk, floors are being renovated and the resturant is now Wolfgang's Steakhouse (closed for breakfast during our stay) Stayed over the Memorial weekend in the Skyline Room. First off if you are staying during the week, be prepared for some early morning and ongoing noise as the building across the street is going through a complete reno, it's currently just a shell.  Door staff need to pick up their game with regards to taking of luggage and interaction with hotel guests.   I actually held the door open for one of them and they actually walked though first.  Doesn't bother me at all but not really the way you should dealing with your guests.   They were late with the room and sent up a bottle which was very nice, we don't drink, so they replaced it with a few bottles of Fiji water.  Room was clean although missing toiletries, bed was very comfortable and love the terrace facing the street.  It was great sitting out there at night with a coffee. Would I stay there again?   I would, as long as I got a great deal.  If the rate is the same as say the Bryant Park Hotel no.   Like my title says, I have hope for them.

I think they need more staff to clean the rooms if they can\u2019t be ready for the 3:00 PM check in time. \n\nI had a queen room, modern, clean and not a bad size for New York. As for decor, there isn't one painting or photograph adorning the walls in the room, unusual for a hotel, but fine. It's too cold to enjoy the balcony, but it is too noisy to have the door open anyway. The building across the street is being renovated and the exterior is completely shrouded in protective netting. I asked at the front desk and it's been going on for about 6 months, so I expect it to continue for a while. After the rush hour finishes the night crew start working on disposing of the debris, the noise from the heavy trucks and the crashing rubble goes on until after midnight. If you are a light sleeper bring earplugs, as it\u2019s not just the construction outside the window, but inconsiderate guests outside your door at 4:00 AM having a chin wag that\u2019ll wake you up.\n\nThe first day it took a long time for the hot water in the shower, turn it on and run it for a minute, it only began to get hot when I was finished my shower, but it was better the next day. The robes are great and a welcome warm snuggle after your shower.\n\nThe hotel is located very close to Grand Central station and a half an hour walk from Penn Station. \n\nThey have a restaurant, check out my review of Ten Penny for their dinner menu. I did try the breakfast buffet one day as I was in a hurry; it\u2019s nothing special, scrambled eggs and bacon in a steamer, fresh fruit and super market croissants. The buffet is half price for hotel guests at $15, but if you have the time to go out, you should, as the food at breakfast is a little lack luster.\n\nOverall, I liked the hotel for its location, cleanliness and free Wi-Fi. I will definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Upon arrival we was greeted straight from our taxi by a lovely man that helped us with our cases held doors for us and just treated us with upmost care. The receptionist that checked us in again was so happy and friendly and couldn't be more welcoming. We had requested that we have a low floor as I didn't like  hights and we was placed on floor 2 which filled me with confidence that there service was going to be very good. We were offered help to our room but we declined as we could do it ourselves as there was a lift. I was very surprised with our room as I was expecting a small room but it was a fair size with everything we needed in it. The bed was very comfy and made\/changed daily. The room was cleaned daily also and towels changed to. After reading lots of negative reviews about noise we soon found this is not under the control of the hotel. The noise you hear is the rubbish being collected nightly as every road is biusy during the day. I'm a light sleeper and these noises were there yes but did not effect my sleep in any way. It is expected that a city that never sleeps will have noise every minute of the day. The hotel is situated in a prime location away from big attractions but within walking distance of them all get your walking boots on we walked every were so we didn't miss any sights.

I can confirm it has nothing to do with Batman. It is, however, a lovely little boutiquey hotel located in Midtown within easy walking distance of most Midtown attractions, and only 12 or so blocks from Central Park.\n\nIt has 24 floors and we were located on floor 23. It's my understand there are only 2 rooms on each floor as it's a narrow building, and this was quite quaint. Our room was reasonably large with a queen size bed and a balcony which did for the majority of the view face a building, but there was a bit of a view down the road.\n\nThe room was clean and tidy and no issues there. The bathroom and walk in shower were great, no problems there. \n\nThe hotel offers free WiFi and that was a real plus.\n\nThe restaurant downstairs is a bar\/restaurant which is obviously open to the public as well as guests. We had dinner there and the portions were large (as we should have expected) and the staff attentive, friendly and helpful, from reception to the waiting staff.\n\nThe only downside to the hotel was the breakfast - very disappointing. Breakfast is $29.99 to outsiders or $15 each for hotel residents. I thought we had missed breakfast based on what was on display; a couple of cereals, a little bit of fruit, scrambled egg and bacon only etc. I thought it was going to be better, had we'd known we would have gone out and not bothered (which we did every other day but we thought we'd give it a go on one day). This wasn't a dealbreaker but I think either bring the price down a few dollars or up the quantity and variety.\n\nWe enquired about a rough estimate journey back to JFJ airport and decided to go for the car service the hotel offered instead. It's a fixed price (includes trip, tolls and tip) and no need to hail a taxi or worry about the meter in traffic. We thought it was reasonable and was very practical.\n\nAll in all we really enjoyed our stay at the Gotham, the location was perfect and I'm pleased we stayed there, making a change from the 'larger' hotels.","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is a small hotel copared to others but it is on 46th east avenue cannot get better location to everything. The hotel has only about 60 rooms on 22 floors, We arrived at 1-30pm so we could not get checked in till 3pm thats the rule and they stick by it so dont get upset if they dont budge. The reception staff were very freindly to my wife and myself i surpose because we were to them so if you are the grumpy one expect it back as we noticed with other people booking in.\nWe booked a delux queen size room with balcony but was given one on the first floor No 22 with no balcony, went to reception and pointed out that is not what we booked and they told us that all the rooms were booked and they would change us the next day which we did not mind as we had a long flight and just wanted to chill out for the rest of the day.\nthe bell boys were fantastic nothing was any problem to getting a cab or answering any questions you might have, i found if you are polite to them they will be polite to you.\nThe room they gave us the following day was 32 next floor up with a juliette balcony which was enough for us as we did not want to stay out on it all day, the bed was extremly comfortable not our queen size but our 5ft king size and the bed linen was changd at least 3 times in 1 week.\nThe bath room was very nice enough for any person, with the complementary soaps etc and a wonderful shower which i did like.The room had a mini bar which you paid for if you used be carefull it is expensive for the hotel mini bar bits.\nIf you went up to the roof floor there is a balcony with a few chairs for you to sit and admire the view and a nice view it is at night.\nThis hotel is so close to everything including the underground train on 42st No 5 which takes you down town and No6 brings you back, Was not impressed with china town but that might be me, you have to visit ground zero and take lots of tissues as i would defy anyone who does not have a cry even me. Go visit the museum it is a must you will see and learn so much of that day,dont be put off by the rows of people waiting to get in they are very fast.\nIf you are planning to visit lot of venues expect to put by at least $40 per couple per visist some are more some less so it evens out.\nYou can eat in there restarant for breakfast if you want and they give you a discout if you do but if you get up late and go down it can be limited, my advise is go out try Raffles on the corner of  lexington ave next to the lexington hotel we love this place some say it is costly but you only do it once so give it a try.\nThe restarant food is nice but expensive, you can get cheaper just look around or go internet shopping for places to eat, you must try Grand central station underground food hall as they have mexican, chinese, italian, indian,plus others and they are all put in a box were you can take away or eat there.\ni knew that food and drink would be the biggest cost factor on this holiday so my budget was huge for this and drinks in new york are not cheap eather so my advise is to but what you fancy at duty free and take it with you it could save you a lot of money.\nShops well what can i say you can either afford it or you can't dont be put off go look at the $1 million dollar necklace if you cant afford you cant buy it but it is nice to see,go to bloomingdales it has something for everyone and macies is a store everyone likes.\nAll in all the hotel was very nice and the visit was wonderful, by the way this was our opinion not based upon any other comments made","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Ok, I hear you say it's not there fault the limo didn't turn up... Agreed, however the way it was handled when we got to the hotel was.  The phrase used was \"Well, I didn't book it so I know nothing about that\", no apology for the mix up, no I'm sorry I'll look into that for you, which after a 27 hr travel time would have been nice.  Now, onto the room.  I contacted the Gotham 2 weeks before we left (had to phone them as the email address on there website is wrong) to confirm our room.  We had booked a skyline room with a couch. After speaking to the girl in renovations I was assured that we had this room.  When we finally checked in at 2.45pm, we were given the key to our room on the 18 the floor, only to find out we had been given the wrong room, we had the skyline with a queen bed (not a king as promised) and no couch.  I went back down to see what had happened and was told that room was already booked, but we could have it tomorrow?  I agreed to this as we were staying six nights so that was ok.  \nOk, let's move onto the room.   It was very clean, and the balcony was great, with nice views down 46th st.  It's a good size, with a nice bathroom and shower, beware the bed's edges, they are sharp and both myself and my partner have cuts on our shins.   The bed is self was really comfy, with a great pillows. Now I'll move onto the TV and the aircon. The TV wasn't working when we first arrived, and when I asked someone to come and look at it, they sent someone up who promptly said \"what do you want to watch TV for??\"  I explained we had a long flight and I just wanted to rest,  ummm..  Yeah.  The TV was fixed but only worked about 90% of the time.  Now, the aircon.  It is really noisy, and by noisy I mean it rattles like something is loose and rubbing.  It doesn't do it on fan, only on aircon, but it does make it difficult to sleep, so after much playing around, we figured out how to make it possible to live with.  Set the fan on low, then set the temp 1 degree below the current room temp, then the aircon kicks in and out, still noisy but bearable.    I'll now explain why I had to put up with this aircon, as you may remember we where going to move rooms!?, well we didn't do this because they are doing road works out the front of the hotel... All night... At 3am a worker with a grinder was cutting into the road..  Yay...  So we decided to stay on the 18 the floor instead of moving to the 10th floor were the couch room was.   I was also told that they will be doing this until next year....  So go for a room at the back of the hotel if you don't care about the view and want to sleep.\nWe did have room service one night, it was nice but for $70 you can do so much better anywhere on Madison ave. \nHotel wifi was good and easy to use, having a safe in the room was good as well.\nThe Gotham is a hotel with great potential, I think the thing letting it down was the attitude of - I'm not doing that until you complain about it- which to be fair wasn't the case with all the staff, Joanna at front desk was great, and one of the door men ( his name escapes me) was really helpful and even got my a partner a free hot chocolate when she had a craving for it.\nSo would I stay here again... Probably not, the hotel itself is really nice and in a great location, just the staff, and the organisation let it down.  So if you don't care about service, and just want something nice to stay in, in a good central location, then this is the hotel for you.  If you want service with a smile, and people who will go that extra mile, stay somewhere else.\n","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our room did indeed have a wonderful, spacious terrace overlooking 46th St., but that was all that was as promised.  In fact, when we got into the room I called the front desk because I thought an error had happened in that it was so small, with no sitting area and a smaller bed.  The staff member kind of mumbled something about our room being on a higher floor and therefore smaller.  We had to get going to meet some out-of-town friends so we dumped our bags and left.\n\nUpon returning in the evening we inspected the room more completely and the bed was most definitely not a king-sized bed.  The shades on the windows were dusty and some had stains on them.  The bathroom was outfitted with beautiful tiles and fixtures but was totally impractical.  You had to step into the shower to turn it on, resulting in unwelcome cold water -- plus the shower door leaked.  You couldn't wash your hands at the bathroom sink without first closing the bathroom door as it obstructed the sink when it was open.  That evening I made another call to the front desk about the bed size, and while there was acknowledgement about the level of suite we reserved there was also some side-stepping about why we got the room we got and were recommended to talk to management in the morning.  We forgot toothbrushes and asked for them and the front desk promised someone would bring some.  We waited a half hour.  It took another call to get someone to bring up two toothbrushes in crushed boxes.  One aspect we did like about the room was that there was a fridge that wasn't crammed with mini-bar offerings so that we could put our own bottles of water in there, even though there were a few beverages for purchase already there.\n\nIn the morning I filled out the form left in our room asking for our feedback (the form actually had stains on it!) and I listed out all of our issues, including my email address.  Upon check-out we talked with a manager who said that we indeed did not get a king room and that we got something called a \"California Queen?\" and refunded us $30, apologizing for the housekeeping issues.  \n\nWe loved the terrace, but the cleanliness issues, the design problems, not getting the size bed that we had confirmed, the fact that our room was soooo not what was pictured,and  the non-responsiveness of the staff made us not want to return again.  Plus, as of this writing it has been two weeks and there has been no email response to all of the issues I wrote for the general manager (not the manager who refunded us the $30), which is disappointing as well.  The website for this hotel makes it look beautiful and elegant and indicates a pride in personal service, but our experience just doesn't match up with what was advertised on many levels.  In fact, if it weren't for our nice terrace, I would have given this place two stars for not being transparent.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We went to reception and asked to change rooms but we're told we could only move if we paid an extra $30 per night & if we didn't there was nothing she could do. We were very disappointed with this but didn't see why we should pay more than we had already.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable and we slept well throughout our stay we even got used to the noise of the air con units but never used the balcony (even though it was very warm) as it was very dark and dingy as well as noisy. We had booked this hotel because of the balcony so we were very disappointed that it wasn't a nice place to sit & relax after a hectic day in the city.\n\nThe tickle of water from the bathroom sink tap was a joke, it was so slow & not much water came out.\n\nThe air con wasn't working properly so the room was quite stuffy.\n\nThe safe wasn't secured to anything & the balcony door didn't lock.\n\nThe room wasn't the cleanest, it was dusty & while I was checking around to make sure I'd packed all our belongings I found a pair of shoes underneath a chair that didn't belong to us - obviously the room hadn't been cleaned properly otherwise they'd have been found by the cleaner!\n\nOn the plus side the hotel is in a great location, it's near all the main attractions, this was our 6th visit to New York and our first and last stay at the Gotham Hotel.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel does not have a real lobby and lacks some other facilities but if you are staying couple of nights only you won't really care about it. Customer service is great. Cosmetics provided in the bathroom are of high quality. Among the downsides I could only think about average view (but come on, it's Manhattan), and a small lobby.

The Gotham Hotel was a pleasant surprise! The hotel staff was amazing (especially Donaldo), the room was large (compared to the what we read online about what to expect in New York), we had private balcony and a terrace for the floor. The location was perfect as well.\n\nI have a few criticisms but not based on the level of service or quality of the hotel. The bed frame is wooden with corners. With less than 18 inches of space around the bed, we both hit our shins. My husband tripped in the middle of the night once and his shins will probably scar. The shower, while spacious, was not designed properly. You have to step into the shower to turn on the water and you end up getting wet with cold water. \n\nOn our last day, we checked out of the hotel at 12 noon but our flight wasn't until 7:00pm. We went to lunch, did some shopping and ended up back at the hotel wanting to hang out in the restaurant. The waiter was rude and pretentious. He took my glass of tea off the table without asking me and told me he was required to serve it to me. We ordered an appetizer so that we were not just sitting in the restaurant without ordering. At one point, I was checking on the pasta I bought from Little Italy in my lunch bag. The waiter came over and looked at was I was doing as if I was up to something. It was very awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nThat being said, these items will not influence my decision to return to the Gotham Hotel.

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":1963673,"title":"Fantastic Location. Lovely Stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2014-03-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"We, a couple in our late 20's, stayed at The Gotham for 5 nights in wintery January weather and it was a fantastic base to explore the city. The location of the hotel is excellent. Right on 5th Avenue and moments from the Rockefeller centre, although, because it is located on a quieter side street you feel a little tucked away from the relentless hustle & bustle that New York is famous for.\n\nWe flew to JFK & then took the subway to 51st and Lexington Avenue on the E line. It was less than a ten minute walk (even with heavy suitcases) to the hotel, and because of New York\u2019s grid system, very easy to find. \n\nFirst impressions were good. The hotel has a nice covered entranceway with potted trees and fairy lights, and the doorman was very polite. At check in we were offered a glass of wine and given a room on the 23rd floor, which is the second top floor. There are only 2 rooms on this floor, as well as a large communal balcony to the front of the building with fantastic views! Our room had a great big comfy bed, a lovely contemporary bathroom with a rainfall shower (very nice!) and a small (big enough for a table & chair) balcony which faced the back of the building. The decor was clean and bright and warm, very inviting after a day walking about in the cold. Because the hotel used to be a bookshop there were little piles of books placed around the room on shelves. I thought this was a lovely; it's these touches that give the hotel something special - a personality.\n\nFor the five nights we stayed all the staff were very welcoming, happy to give directions and chat to us. \n\nWe didn't use the onsite restaurant - tenpenny, although it looked very inviting it was rather pricy, and you are at no end of wonderful eateries, because this is New York!! We did eat at some lovely places, one cheap & cheerful, but very tasty place was Uncle Paul\u2019s pizza, just around the corner. We found this on our first night and it was the perfect slightly jetlagged quick & easy meal. We got a cheese pizza and a salad & ate it in the room with a bottle of wine & then slept for about ten hours! There's also a pharmacy on the next block and a grocery store a couple of streets away.\n\nGregory's Bakery is located right next door to the hotel, and is consistently rated one of the top coffee shops in NYC. And, oh my word, are the reviewers right!! We ate here every morning, everything was the best I have ever had, best croissant, best muffin, and best baked apple fritters nom nom!! The coffee was great and the staff were lovely and friendly. There's a big glass window in the back of the shop that looks into the bakery kitchen. It was really nice to sit & watch them making the thing you're eating, knowing its all day fresh & made on site. I would come all the way back to NYC just for this bakery.\n\nThere were a couple of things that I wanted to mention in the negatives column, firstly the noise in the room, and on the balcony from all the air conditioning units on neighbouring buildings was very loud, however after the first night we didn't really notice it. And being at the back of the hotel we didn't get a lot of street noise. The only other issue we had was that my husband managed to lock himself outside on the balcony in our room, but the handyman came right up & let him back in and apologised for the issue (a broken handle on the door). He wasn't able to fix it as the part needed to be ordered, so we just made sure we didn't close the door of the balcony whilst one of us was outside. \n\nThe location of this hotel is really its best selling point. We walked everywhere. It was only 10-15 mins to Times Square, central park and the empire state building. There are a number of tube stops within a 5-10 min walk and it's close to central station. We walked to Penn Station with our bags after checking out and it only took 20-25 mins.\n\nI think this hotel suits couples best, it's got a warm and contemporary vibe, but I would recommend this to any age group. We got a fantastic deal on this hotel. I think it was about \u00a380 ($130) a night. It was definitely worth that and quite a bit more! We would book this hotel next time we're in NYC.","travelDate":"2014-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our room overlooked 46th street and there seemed to be a steady stream of loud trucks which started around 6 am or earlier - so if you are a light sleeper, and don't need to wake up early - ask for a room on another side and maybe that will help.
