{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":93517,"title":"Exceptional value for money","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2024-03-28","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Having read a few of the reviews for the Paramount hotel, my partner and I were doubting our previous decision to book for 5 nights over the past week. However I\u2019m glad to say we really enjoyed our stay and experience at this hotel so despite not being one to usually leave reviews, I thought it worthwhile to detail our experience. \n\nLocation- the location of the hotel was absolutely ideal, close to all the theatres in Times Square that you could possibly want to visit and close to many subway lines meaning the whole city was easily accessible to us. Times Square is naturally quite noisy, however we had no issues sleeping and found generally the walls\/windows were thick enough to keep the majority of the noise out (bar a few sirens which is to be expected!)\n\nReception\/arrival- upon our arrival to the Paramount hotel, we were greeted by several members of staff, all who were polite and willing to help. You have to pay a city tax for your stay at reception, however we\u2019re pretty sure you have to do this at all hotels in NYC. Our tax was $86 (\u00a369) for our 5 night stay. Considering the hotel was cheap anyway, we were happy to pay this no questions asked. The reception of the hotel is a work in progress: half has been renovated and is modern (see pics) whilst the other is still being worked on. We saw no builders or heard no noise related to this work and think the hotel will look incredible when it is done! \n\nRoom- we stayed in a superior queen room on the 11th floor. The corridors and elevators leading us to this room were modern and efficient. We loved our room and frankly didn\u2019t want to leave it!! The bed was incredibly comfy and we enjoyed a lot of time watching the food network on our flat screen tv. The room was big and modern enough for us with a few scuffs but nothing that bothered us really! Could do with a few more hangers for the wardrobes maybe. The bathroom was a peculiar design but did exactly as it needed to- the water pressure was incredible and we had plenty hot water at all times. The bathroom could be modernised and cleaner (chipped paint and wear and tear) but I wouldn\u2019t lower my rating of the hotel because of this. On our first night, we struggled turning the radiator on in our room- it was plenty warm but we needed to dry some rain soaked clothes. We called reception and maintenance were up within 30 mins to change the batteries in our thermostat and show us how to use it- much appreciated.\n\nStaff and check out- the check out process was incredibly smooth. With our flight back to London not being until late evening, we checked out at 11am and chose to store our bags with reception for a small fee. This was well worth it, the concierge labelled our bags up for identification and looked after them whilst we went about our day. We also used the airport shuttle service arranged by reception- this cost $70 (\u00a355) for the two of us. The driver was there bang on time and dropped us right off at our terminal. A special staff shout out to the cleaners at the Paramount hotel- our room was cleaned every day during our stay with fresh towels and bedsheets. When we wanted a lie in, we simply used our do not disturb door marker and our room was skipped only for them to do it later in the day when we removed the sign. \n\nAll in all, we loved our stay at the Paramount hotel and are glad we gave it a chance. For the price we paid, we really couldn\u2019t have expected any more. In our opinion, the value for money was exceptional given the hotel location and facilities. We hope to return some day \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

However the room was quite dated and there weren\u2019t enough sockets (only one socket one side of the bed and one more under the desk opposite side of the bed). The bathroom was quite awful too - the bath was so old that it had stains in the enamel. The sink was small and there was little storage. \n\nThe main problem with the room was lack of a refrigerator and the incredibly noisy - I would dare say not fit for purpose - heating system. It was so old that it made so much noise while it was heating that we ended up turning the heating off and requesting an extra blanket. The engineer did come up but said there was nothing he could do, the system was just old, not faulty. Considering it was freezing outside, it was it wasn\u2019t great to have to sleep without the heating.\n\nAlso there was no kettle or tea\/coffee making facilities although I understand this is the norm in Manhattan hotels - still not great to be honest. Yes there\u2019s an ice machine and cold water dispenser on the 4th floor but that\u2019s hardly convenient.\n\nOn the plus side the bed was large and comfortable and the room\nWas clean. However I didn\u2019t like the bedding. I would much rather have duvets than scratchy synthetic blankets.\n\nWhat really ruined the stay was check-out. I was told we could leave our bags and pick them up later so I tried to do that and was met with the rudest, most unreasonable hotel worker I have ever come across. The bell man said there was a fee to pay to leave the bags which I would have paid without complaining (even though I wasn\u2019t told before that there was a fee and most other hotels don\u2019t charge) but he only wanted CASH!! I had no cash on me. I begged him to take payment by card and he said no. I begged him to pay on return because I was in a hurry and didn\u2019t have time to go around looking for an ATM. Again no. I burst into tears and he didn\u2019t give a damn. He wouldn\u2019t even get the bags in a corner while I thought about what to do. He refused to touch the bags until I came up with the cash. I was really upset by the lack of empathy and complete disregard for customer service. I would not return for this alone.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

First off, the lobby lighting was like \"club\" lighting 24\/7....why so dark ALL THE TIME....and the website touts a bar + game room, which due to traveling with another family, and wanting to have a common meeting area and area to possibly kill time (without spending money at a restaurant\/bar) is NO LONGER a hotel amenity...the hotel bar is but doesn't open until 5 pm but the \"game room\" area has been walled off and is hotel storage.....The hotel doesn't seem to think the year is 2024 as even if your room is not ready, they won't text or email you when it is...they ask you to return at 4 pm to check in....and when we arrrived back after shopping the line was about 40-50 peoplle deep with ONE employee assisting with checking in...finally after about 20 minutes in line a 2nd employee began assisting with check-in. I understand potentially being understaffed in these current times...but if that is the case, allow people to check in prior to 4 pm (meaning get rooms ready earlier)....As I said at the beginning this hotel will continue to book rooms bc tourists from all over the world flock to Times Square daily.....but in the future I won't be one of them","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I had to laugh to hide my pain.\n\nAlthough I was a solo traveler, I never had a room as tiny as this. A small, twin-sized bed with an even skinner closet (some of the space being blocked off by a safe). The bathroom wasn't inviting at all, with the shower being the biggest reason. It's placed in a dark corner, with no toiletries; I felt uncomfortable going in with no shoes in there. For the high price this hotel offers, you'd think there'd be more modern architecture. The lobby appears very classic and sleek, but it's a drastic change when you go upstairs.\n\nI believe I am very easygoing when it comes to hotels. Staying in them is a pleasure of mine that I relish every chance I get. However, I cannot deny that I was not my happiest staying here. While the staff were certainly polite, most of my time was spent lying in a cramped space that reminded me of my room back home. I wasn't trying to pay money to sleep in \"my room\" but in a fancier one.\n\nRooms like this carry the basic essentials for travelers like myself, I understand this, but there's still a part of me that craved to feel luxurious- just for a couple of nights.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

I spoke to several people on reception and explained my situation I advised I no longer needed a large room as it was just myself staying at night after getting back from being at the hospital all day supporting my partner, I asked if they could move me to a single room for a cheaper rate to help. I was advised several times that they could but it would only be 20 dollars a night cheaper. I then looked on booking.com and found the single room for almost a 100 dollars cheaper a night, once again asked the receptionist but they couldn\u2019t help me. \n\nSo I booked on booking.com for a small room, checked out of my previous room, to then be told I could stay where I was in a large room. \n\nAs much as I am aware how sites like booking.com work with hotels I am confused as to why my hotel made it so difficult me when they knew the situation I was in, surely there would of been more they could of done to help.

Once she could see I was visibly irritated it is now late after 11 and so she sent a woman in security to check out the door and she found that even her master wasn\u2019t working and it was an issue with the lock.

On arrival, the receptionist advised us we had an extra \u00a3180 to pay for city taxes which we knew nothing about. \nOnce we got up to our room, we were\u2026 let\u2019s just say disappointed. The room was TINY. There wasn\u2019t enough room for one person with a large suitcase, let alone two. The bed is definitely smaller than a standard double. There were only two pillows set out as though only one person was going to be sleeping in the bed (which is really all that should be sleeping in it). The AC unit was right next to the bed and I\u2019ve never known anything like it, it sounded like it was trying to set off when the cooling fans were on. There was also a sock wedged under our bathroom door. There was no facilities to make a drink the only positive was that there was a big TV on the wall. Now let me talk about the bathroom, it looked like a prison cell, with a steel sink and a tiny square shower space with a rather old looking shower curtain hanging, our toilet also hand a crack in it which looked like a hair. There was no toilet brush and very low pile toilet roll. Overall we were VERY disappointed, but because we\u2019d spent so long travelling, we were exhausted and just wanted to sleep we gritted our teeth and made do. The next morning I quickly nipped to the front desk before heading out, to ask them to double check that our room was definitely logged in the system as a double room because it really didn\u2019t feel like it. She confirmed it was but was happy to move us rooms the following day when some bigger rooms became available. That was a huge relief, the second room we were given was much bigger, it had a really big bed, four pillows and space at both sides, we each had a bedside table and space to put our luggage. The bathroom was still underwhelming but we\u2019d ungraded to a bath aswell as a shower. \n\nThe hotel seems dated but I can\u2019t fault the staff. The location is ideal, a stone throw from Times Square and central that you\u2019re not far from any attractions. It was very expensive for what we actually got, we were very lucky that they gave us a free upgrade but even still, the price that you pay could easily be matched in a much nicer and more modern hotel slightly further out. Also I must warn you, we moved to the 17th floor and it was NOISY! So if you\u2019re a light sleeper, like me, make sure you have ear plugs with you. ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

On our second morning the shower got blocked and no water would drain. This was fixed by the handy repair man. Next morning the bathroom light died on us which was also fixed by the repair man.

When we arrived at our room we did feel quite disappointed with it. The size of the room, albeit, not large didn't bother us too much.  Nor did the view (we are in NYC so the view of the aircon units outside and brick walls didn't bother us, we expected this) due to the air con units outside you definitely would NOT have a silent night sleep in this room. So if you're a light sleeper i would ask to move rooms, there is a constant noisy hum. \n\nWhat bothered us was that the room was tired looking and not the standard we would have expected. It could have done with a good lick of paint, the bottom of what I think is the large old aircon unit on the floor was badly chipped and rusted, the tiles in the bathroom by the door were no existent in the corner. It was an odly decorated bathroom with an absolutely massive stainless steel sink that imposed the room. The inside of the bath was chipped fairly badly and could really do with replacing. \nWe had to turn the \"aircon\" unit off at night as it was unbelievably loud and hardly cooled the room anyway. So night time was pretty warm in the room. The toilet when flushed sounded like it was going to suck you down the pan. \n\nHowever,  the room was clean and the bed was soft and felt amazing after a long day of site seeing. The only saving grace to the room we stayed in was this bed. Well done to the housekeeper who made our bed every morning,  stocked up the toiletries and gave us fresh towels. \n\nThere are NO coffee\/tea making facilities in this room. So we bought a large bottle of water every evening to take back to our room. \n\nThere is a safe, old fashioned hairdryer and steamer supplied in the room  \n\nWe ate breakfast in a restaurant called Juniors which was a 2 minute walk from the hotel and I'd highly recommend a visit. \n\nThe location was fairly good, but that's what you pay for, certainly not the luxury or the facilities.

I normally avoid Times Square, but I had an early morning meeting and wanted to be nearby, so I chose the Paramount. I'll start with the good parts - the lobby was inviting and cozy and the elevators were fast (often a big problem in older hotels). Now the not so good, the room was very small, there was no decor, no view - we looked out over an alley (although no noise, so could be another plus I guess), we were provided with one bath towel each, no hand towels or wash cloth, the toilet paper on the roll was soaking wet (no idea why - but there was an extra) and no refrigerator or coffee. Basically zero frills for over $300. Also, the reception desk at check-in was neither inviting nor forthcoming about any amenities. Also, two of us only got one key, which seemed weird. \n\nAnd maybe the worst part, I had to get up very early and I set my alarm on my phone and plugged it into the outlet next to my bed. By some miracle, I woke up at 5:00 AM and noticed that my phone was black - completely dead. The \"outlet\" did not work at all. If I did not notice this in the middle of the night, and overslept, this would have ruined my whole reason for staying overnight.

Recommend looking elsewhere.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-11-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I rarely write reviews, but I feel compelled to warn others about this hotel. I have traveled extensively and stayed in many hotels and hostels across the world, and Paramount is below hostel standard, let alone a 4-star hotel.\n\nBeginning with the hidden fees of the hotel:\n\nIn addition to the upfront cost of c.$285 per night (what I paid), there were a number of hidden fees. \n\n1. $17 per night for safe (tap) drinking water, WiFi, and the bar facility (this only covers the bar area, not drinks).\n2. Storage fees for luggage kept past checkout time (11am) which does not accept card, only cash complimenting the next charge.\n3. ATM fees of $4.50 per transaction\n\nRooms: 2\/5\n\nThe rooms were extremely small and poorly maintained. The tiling, painting, electrics, and general maintenance were all very poor. For example, live switches and sockets coming off the wall, large gaps and mould in the tiles, an unsecured shower pole, dirty windows, and an old, crumby carpet.\n\nWhen we first entered our room, there were no towels and the bed had two mattress protectors on, one of which was rolled up under the sheet creating a large bump.\n\nGranted, there is AC and it is FREE. However, my flight home was arguably quieter than this unit.\n\nInterior and exterior of the hotel: 2\/5\n\nThe lobby, lift, and general interior of the hotel were also very run down. There were missing tiles from the walls, dirty elevators with mold, dirty carpets, room doors with no handles and holes due to being kicked in.\n\nThe exterior of the hotel was under renovation, with an extensive scaffold covering the front. We were notified of this after booking, but the email stated that it would not affect our stay. This was completely inaccurate. We could hear the drilling, banging, and vibration from our room on the other side of the hotel, starting around 7am.\n\nStaff: 3\/5\n\nThe staff were generally dismissive and more interested in talking to their colleagues than attending to guests. They were dressed in casual clothes, which is fine for a hostel but not a 4-star hotel.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about the staff is that one man was courteous and polite. I didn't catch his name, but he was wearing a suit, shirt, and tie with dreadlocks.\n\nOverall: 2\/5\n\nOverall, this hotel was poor. It was dirty, poorly maintained, and overpriced. The staff were dismissive and the hidden fees were ridiculous. On 2\/3 times that I visited reception, other guests were filing complaints and requesting new rooms. I would not recommend this hotel.\n\nAdvice:\n\nMy recommendation is to avoid this hotel. There are many other hotels around Times Square at the same price point, or even cheaper once the hidden fees are factored in. You could also pay a little bit more for a renowned brand hotel and get much better value for money.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Storing our luggage after checkout also cost extra which I was annoyed about but expected this to be the case after the extra fees at check in. I\u2019ve never had to pay for drinking water or luggage storage at any hotel or hostel so this was rather shocking and added to our negative experience of the hotel.\n\nI\u2019d be interested to know where people writing reviews are from, especially those that thought this hotel was \u2018excellent\u2019.

The check-in process was quick; of note was the fact that payment is collected up front (at least it was for our stay). The Front Desk staff was friendly and provided decent enough information about our stay and where to find things in the hotel. A nice feature (common in my experience in NYC) was the requirement to scan your room key to access your floor via elevator. The public areas were clean enough, too. Our room was average size for an NYC hotel and looked clean. The bed was fine (quite soft) and the bathroom had everything you needed. \n\nWhere we had issues was with the staff. On our first morning after checking in, I left the room to get coffee and ran into a housekeeper in the hall. She asked if we needed any service to which we replied \"no thanks.\" The housekeeper then asked if we had any trash and I said \"actually, yeah we have some. I'll grab it for you.\" The housekeeper then tried to follow me into my room where my wife was still in bed. \n\nThe following night, we had a minor issue with our TV remote (dead batteries) and requested a new remote. Within minutes a new remote was delivered. The team member asked for the old remote and when I said \"I'll grab it, please wait here\" the team member tried to enter our room. The issues with staff were reported to the front desk but as of today (one day after check out) we have not yet received a follow up call from management. \n\nOverall, the stay was fine.

Convenient to get around downtown on foot or by subway.\nNegatives:\nNon-existent breakfast service.\nThe room and bathroom are small, not very clean, absent mini bar, TV without a European channel, dilapidated and non-soundproof fixtures with water infiltration, dirty and smelly floor carpet, authentic guillotine access doors to rooms. Inoperable safe, non-existent luggage rest bench. Around the entrance lamp there was water seepage from the upstairs room and rubble was constantly falling. \nTwice during my stay I had to ask for towels to be given to me because they had not been put in.\nExtremely rude, rude and incompetent staff, it is unthinkable that in a 4-star hotel the Reception staff speaks only one language. Concierge, like a statuette was unable to give information and solve the difficulties encountered for tickets and reservations for museums and shows.\nThe Manager, a woman ( can't be called Lady ), the rudest.\nUnfortunately, a friend of mine had the misfortune to fall and break his leg and, given his age, 80 years old, he had difficulty using crutches. It was not possible to find a wheelchair so that he could get out of the room ( so small that you could not turn around in it ) and stay in the Hall ( there was not even a bar ) nor did they make any effort to find it and even inform us of a possible cost, but it could be transported with the luggage cart, offered to us by the porter the night when we returned from the hospital. The next morning we requested it from the porter on duty who also courteously helped us carry our friend to the lobby. Shortly thereafter the \" Manager\" showed up who railed, in English ( she spoke only that language, Manager!!!!!!! ) against my friend because according to her to walk he had to make do with crutches as using the trolley was against safety regulations. Safety????? from what we saw, the woman manager does not know education and the most basic safety rules. There are outside electrical wires in the rooms, there is no emergency exit, signs for any emergency exits , etcc.\nThe truth is that the \"woman manager\" probably wanted to be paid for such service but did not know how to ask for it. In that situation it would have been shameful.\nIn an Italian facility when what happened to my friend happened to a forestier we make ourselves available and try to solve any problem at no cost, they did not even call the ambulance for us to be able to go to the hospital. As for the stars in Italy a facility like this could be rated 1 or 2 stars always assuming that permits are issued to be able to open.

The day I checked in they upgraded our room to a Deluxe king size on the 16th floor, so that was a lovely gesture from the front desk staff. \n\nSome of our positive experiences:\n\nFirst and foremost the location of the hotel is one block next to Times Square  & right in the heart of theatre district. Everything from here is so convenient and easily accessible. You can be late out at Times Square & it's safe and convenient to get back to the hotel late night. The subway or the bus terminal is easily accessible & are at walking distance from the hotel.\n\nThe front desk people are really nice and helpful & they are very much approachable. \n\nThe hotel ambience is very unique especially the Lobby, it's so comfortable to  just chill on those sofa's, especially when you come tired from outside after long walks across the city and just want to sit & relax.  \n\nThe rooms are very very clean & the beds are extremely comfortable, the house keeping staff is really polite and do a great job in room cleaning every morning. \n\nOverall the place has a very positive feel & hence I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to come and experience the beautiful NYC. In fact we plan to comeback and stay here at Paramount once again in the future. \n\nThe only negative that I would mention here is the construction site that is coming-up right in front of the hotel. They start the work early morning & that is little disturbing sometimes but not much as the entire day we are out.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Me parece una estafa que debamos pagar un suplemento de $35 por noche y habitaci\u00f3n para usar los \"servicios\" del hotel.  Si bien es cierto que como nos dijeron, lo pone en su web, al reservar, no te lo especifica y por tanto no te das cuenta hasta que llegas all\u00ed, si no lo buscas adrede en preguntas de los clientes.\nNunca he visto un hotel que obligue a alguien a pagar por un gimnasio que no vamos a usar y menos por usar los ascensores (cosa obvia) o una fuente de agua en el 4to piso siendo un rascacielos y cuando el agua del grifo  es potable y por el Wi-Fi que en la web pone que es gratis y en algunas partes del hotel, ni siquiera llega.\nSer\u00eda m\u00e1s normal que quien quiera usar el gimnasio lo pague aparte, y si creen que es obligatorio, que lo incluyan en el precio total al reservar (a ese precio, ya no hubiera reservado)\n\n 2. Es imposible dormir o estar en la habitaci\u00f3n con el insoportable ruido del aire acondicionado\/calefacci\u00f3n que cuando se pone en marcha parece que despegue un avi\u00f3n. Es indescriptible y una pena que no me deje subir el video\nEs bastante rid\u00edculo tener dormir con edred\u00f3n (\u00fanica  ropa en la cama) en verano,  porqu\u00e9 son conscientes de que al no poder modificar la temperatura del termostato, hace frio, pero entonces pasas calor.\n 3. Pagu\u00e9 por usar unos ascensores a los que puedes esperar 5 o 10 minutos hasta cansarte y bajar andando o tener que pasear arriba y abajo por un mont\u00f3n de pisos si llegas a cogerlo, antes de llegar a tu planta. Porqu\u00e9 en otros pisos lo estan llamando.\n 3. El armario es insuficiente para una habitaci\u00f3n de 4  cuando hay sitio suficiente para poner estanter\u00edas o una c\u00f3moda.\n4. Deber\u00eda haber 2 mesitas de noche.\n5. No hab\u00eda interruptor para encender y apagar la luz desde la cama y ten\u00edas que levantarte hasta  la general a oscuras.\n 5. Los enchufes no sujetan correctamente los dispositivos que est\u00e1n enchufados, lo que es un problema para cargar el m\u00f3vil y secarse el pelo, porque alguien debe sujetarlos.\n 6. Una tarde no ten\u00edamos agua caliente, y cuando mi marido fue a preguntar,  nos dijeron que en 10 minutos sub\u00edan a mirar.  Despu\u00e9s de 50 minutos esperando para ducharme, volv\u00ed a bajar y me dijeron que era una aver\u00eda general que  intentaban resolver, eso puede pasar, pero podr\u00edan habernos avisado para que no esper\u00e1ramos.\n7. No es normal tener dos toallas de ba\u00f1o y ninguna de manos, cuando somos 3 personas en la habitaci\u00f3n, y que tengamos que pedirlas cada vez que nos la limpiaban. Acabamos por piner el \"no molesten.  Pero es menos normal que el primer dia no nos las quisieran dar en persona en recepci\u00f3n \ny aunque insistimos en que no las subieran entonces porqu\u00e9 ya hab\u00eda un miembro de la familia  durmiendo,  el camarero apareci\u00f3 al rato con las toallas, abriendo la puerta con su llave y nosotros en la cama.  Eso fue para denunciar.\n\n LO \u00daNICO BUENO a destacar es la comodidad de las camas y almohadas, el buen trato de los empleados de recepci\u00f3n y la buena situaci\u00f3n (pero hay muchos otros por la zona)\nEs la tercera vez que estamos en Nueva York y no lo recomendamos.\nNo tiene nevera, ni cafetera, ni desayuno, las instalaciones estan anticuadas el ruido (no exterior) es insoportable. Por este precio hay otros mucho mejores.\nY una estafa pagar mast de 300$ extra al llegar.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I hadn't read the reviews before I left, and it was honestly kind of worrying. Lot of 1 star reviews, people talking about hidden fees, etc. When I got to the hotel, I was greeted cordially by the staff. Not much of a line. Asked for my ID, and I was in. No 200$ security deposit. I was able to spend the next three days relaxing and hanging out with friends around New York worry-free. The staff was always cordial and friendly.\nWith Times Square being down the street, I expected more noise, but my room was completely quiet. Although I could hear construction in the mornings, it wasn't too much of a distraction and I was able to sleep soundly.\nThe rooms themselves are very small, and there are no bells or whistles - it's just one bed in one small room. Being plus-sized, this wasn't too much of an issue - the bed was big enough and was comfortable.\nThe bathroom, on the other hand, could stand to be bigger.\nThe only thing that was annoying was having to go to the fourth floor to grab water, but that's my only grievance.\nParamount Hotel is a great place to stay if you're on a budget (at least during this time of the year, being July), especially for the location.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"NONE"}

We did read previous reviews before booking and were apprehensive. The biggest issue that we had was the air conditioning did not work consistently. By some luck it did the first night and we all got amazing sleep. The next two nights the air went off and our room was 84 degrees. We did call and staff came to fix it promptly and were so kind. However the issue is the AC would not remain on. It kept turning off and we could not get it back on. The staff even came in and replaced the whole AC unit on our last night, so we were able to sleep \u2014 but when we woke it was off again and wouldn\u2019t turn on. So visiting NYC in the hot summer, I\u2019d not stay here again because I was miserably hot. Location was great though, room was nice\/bathrooms pleasant, friendly staff.

AC didn't work, it was so hot in there even after maintenance said they fixed it.  The rooms were beyond tiny for 4 people- (I have stayed in NYC many times and rooms can be small but this was ridiculous), bathroom consisted of an old shower with a too short shower curtain that was too short and leaked water all over, no bath towels (had to ask for them), a tiny metal sink and not enough pillows.  No security guard I ever saw and not the best area to be honest.  Thin old carpet and walls- it was like staying in a horrible hostel... fire alarms were beeping on an off and they made an announcement at 9am that they would be testing the fire alarm system!!!

It ended there. It was 11:30p NYC time and for us, 5:30a as we had come from Europe. The elevators were a mess when trying to use key to go to room. Next, we got off and were smacked in the face with the smell of strong marijuana. We got to our room and it is smoldering hot. I went down and asked for help and I was told Maitenance would come. Nobody did. We called two more times and were told it would be marked urgent and someone would be there. After two hours of waiting and it being 2a I gave up and tried to sleep very uncomfortably. By this time, the marijuana smell had also made it under our door and I had to pull my shirt over my head to sleep on top of it being 78 degrees in the room. By 5:46a, construction started right outside our window. It did not stop. My daughter went down and again asked for help with the air and discussed the construction with an audio outside our room. She was told someone would be coming up and we could check out at 2p. Nobody came and the construction did not subside. She went down again and this time  we were told we could check out at noon and they would see what they could do about a partial refund with Expedia. After the supervisor from Maitenance came, he was upset nobody came all the other times and in fact, our air was broken. He talked to them and they offered for us to check out at 2p and try to get us 50% off of the room. On top of those issues, there was a small amount of blood on the sheet and a dead bug smashed on shower wall. With the heat in the room and the construction, we had zero sleep and it caused a great deal of stress. We should get a full refund as that was the most miserable stay I have ever had. We left more tired and stressed out than relaxed and well rested. Finally, we had a late flight and needed to store our bags.

I\u2019d like to acknowledge that this where their management team shines: AJ, Nat and many many others always get to your needs once they get your calls. Room switching is available should vacancies exist. \n\nSome review up here suggests that their website mentions there is dining and laundry on site which is not true. Paramount has clearly stated on their website that they do not have such services on site, but staff members are more than happy to give local recommendations. This is where their location shines because it\u2019s next to TSQ which takes you to almost anywhere with just a few minutes of walking or a subway ride. Either high-class restaurants or popular diners of any cuisines you could think of are in the neighborhood. Laundromats are close as well.\n\nThe fact Paramount may not provide as many services have reflected on their rates. Compared with at least 10+ nearby hotels, Paramount charges the most reasonable rate. The added values of its location and amazing staff should make up for what Paramount lack compared with others.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":93517,"title":"Very Misleading","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-05-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"If I had to summarize our 1 week stay at the Paramount Hotel, I would say that it was very misleading. The professionally-taken online photos show a completely different hotel from the one we stayed at. See notes below.\n\nJust know before booking that you are 100% paying for location and overpaying for pretty much everything else. We paid almost $400\/night and feel completely ripped off. Do not stay here at all. There are better options in the area.\n\nThe good: \n1) You get a bed to sleep in.\n2) You are in the heart of Times Square.\n\nThe bad:\n1)  The room was *extremely* small and uncomfortable. You should believe everyone else's reviews which also mention the same thing. I'm not picky with room size, but this was pretty bad. You will be crowded in your own room. Our bathroom door did not even open all the way because it was blocked by... our bed. Ridiculous. Also, there is no mini fridge in the room.\n\n2) The hotel is VERY dark. And I don't mean in a cool aesthetic way, it felt more like a \"save on energy bill\" thing. The lobby, hallways, and elevators are almost comically dim and you will have a hard time seeing anything. One can only assume it is deliberate to cover something up.\n\n3) The building is old and not in good shape. Yes, it was built in the 1920s, however, there seemed to be no visible major investments in maintaining the building to reflect the expectations of a more modern hotel. I'm all for the older look, but the hotel feels like it's falling apart inside. Take a closer look at the inside of the elevator and you'll see that it's not maintained at all. This might explain the previous point.\n\n4) The gym has no windows. You will be working out in a dimly lit, small, poorly equipped gym. The water dispenser didn't even work properly. All for $400\/night.\n\n5) The AC unit in the room is weak and extremely loud. I'm not even a light sleeper and I had to cover my head to sleep through that thing.\n\n6) The bathroom is glorified airplane lavatory. Both in terms of size and comfort. The shower was big enough for a single person to stand in, you won't be able to extend your arms in any direction. There are no vents in the bathroom. The sink is a depressing metal utilitarian unit with pretty much no surface area to place things down. Bathroom did not even include hand soap, so we had to go out and buy some. All of this would be perfectly fine in a hostel-type of building but not for this price. Again, I cannot stress enough for cramped you will be in there. Did I mention that our door didn't fully open?\n\n7) There is no breakfast onsite. Yes, you are in Times Square and have a million options to choose from. However, you are also paying $400\/night. Any hotel that charges half that, especially in this location, will offer breakfast in some way. It says more about the hotel management than anything else.\n\n8) The front-desk staff were not professional at all. If you can somehow see them through the dim lighting of the lobby, you'll be greeted with staff that feels annoyed that you're there and who won't tell you anything about the hotel except which room you're in. You will have to ask about amenities and anything else. I've been to many hotels in my life, but never witnessed something like this. Other reviewers have commented the same thing and I can confidently say that they are right.\n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Yes - as per other reviews - the location is great, and the beds are comfy. We stayed for 4 nights and paid about \u00a3950. To summarise some of our issues:\n-From about day 2, the water in the room was scolding hot (even the water in the toilet). We raised this issue in total 4 times - after it wasn\u2019t fixed we were then moved to a different room. The water here was normal.\n-You have to ring reception about 10 times before the phone gets answered\n-Normally in 4* hotels there is a kettle\/glasses\/mugs\/bottles of water. This hotel doesn\u2019t have any of that.\n-The rooms (and bathrooms) are really small. If it\u2019s 2 of you staying you would need a king size room, the double beds seem to be small doubles.\n-The air con system is the loudest noise ever, impossible to sleep with it on. So we ended up leaving windows open which isn\u2019t ideal in the centre of NYC.\n-Our flight wasn\u2019t until the evening so we requested to leave our suitcase - could not believe there was a $2 fee for this! I wouldn\u2019t expect this from a 2 or 3* hotel, let alone a hotel that claims to be 4*!!\n-There aren\u2019t any irons or ironing boards available in the hotel, though they do provide steamers.\n-The queue at reception is always quite long. \n-We had to pay a $100 security deposit at the start of our stay (think this is a North American thing as we had the same in Canada) - but on check out we were informed we wouldn\u2019t receive the deposit back instantly and it would be refunded in 3-5 days.\n\nSo overall, no I wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel. We paid slightly more in order to be on Times Square, but if we were to come again we would look for an alternative 3 or 4* hotel. We went to the Yotel one afternoon for drinks on the terrace and that seemed much nicer and cheaper. I hope management look into some of these issues.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We travelled from jfk airport on the subway.  We got off at 50th street station and it was only a 10 minute walk to the hotel. \n\nCHECK IN -The check in was VERY slow. We waited over an hour in a huge queue with only 2 & sometimes 3 staff checking people in. We were charged $40 per night resort fee! Which is basically free money for the hotel. I\u2019ve no idea why they just don\u2019t add this on to the price of the room, so people are clear on the full price. If you are staying for more than one night this can be very costly. Nearly all New York hotels do this. \n\nROOM - our room was small with just two queen sized beds, a tv and very small cheap desk. Our room over looked the back of some Times Square signs, not the best view. But we were only intending on sleeping in our room so it was ok. I thought being next to the lift it would be loud, but we never heard a thing. There was a steamer to iron clothes and also a hair dryer in the room. No tea\/coffee though. \n\nLOCATION- the location was perfect for us, close to the subway station. If you walk out of the hotel and turn left down the street you will come to Times Square at the end. There are Broadway theatres and restaurants all along the hotels street. It is literally in the middle of everything, the location is ideal. \n\nOVERALL- we loved the location of this place, the price was reasonable for New York prices and the room was small but ok. Definitely nothing luxurious, but adequate. The check in is definitely something that needs sorting out, it\u2019s far too long a process. You can leave bags here for $2 each, which was great.

Not only that but when handing us our room key she announced our room numbers, loudly, several times- which is another huge no-no in the hospitality industry- and again, extremely unsafe. The room was very basic given the price, nothing special, not cleaned very well and the room and hallways smelled heavily of marijuana. There were also hairs on the bedsheets.

Left the hotel for a broadway show and returned at 12:15 only having to wait in a queue for another 30 minutes to get a room key card. The issue I have is that management knew of the problem and did nothing extra to put extra staff to relieve the inconvenience they caused. This hotel just a Money spinner taking the guests for the fool having to queue their holiday away after paying for a service.

I had no problems sleeping and heard no noise from traffic or other guests.  Check-in took a while with two people manning the front desk but leaving was easy and fast as I had prepaid my bill so all I had to do was drop off the key.  The lobby is rather dark with a pool table and lots of seating. A \"guard\" was sat by the elevators but never glanced my way every time I entered but you did need your key to use them.  I thought the TV was placed in an odd place on a side wall near the foot of the bed but no one had told me it is mounted on a pull out\/swivel bracket.  Figured that out on my own.  Was surprised there was a hair dryer and a clothes steamer in the closet neither of which I used.  For a solo senior man it was OK for theater going because of  where it was.  Probably another hotel in the area would have gotten me a bigger room with more \"extras\" for the same price.  For me it was adequate so this review is not a complaint.

We went down to get our new room key and they put us in a much spacious room with  a King bed- foolish me to think that was a kind gesture by Omar. \n\nWe woke up to a construction ZONE across our room - that started at 6:30am, technically NYC is not allowed to start until 7am but they must have had a special permit ( I know this bc my bf is in construction). we changed rooms at 10:30 pm we did not even think to open up the window to look outside. \n\n Please do not waste your $ at this hotel, imagine I was a tourist and woke up to that construction zone outside my window or had children and wanted to sleep in a bit. \n\nWe told Hotels Tonight they shouldn't even have this listed as an option","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

That said, the location is phenomenal. It's about 6 doors down from Times Square and directly across from 2 of the theaters. The theater we went to (Walter Kerr) was only a street away and was a 4 minute walk. Perfect for a quick weekend trip. That said, the location is the end of the amenities. The lobby is significantly nicer than anywhere else in the hotel. The elevators required a keycard to choose a floor but not consistently. Sometimes you could just click a number and one of the elevators had a missing keycard reader. There's no security anywhere inside or outside the hotel either if that feels important. The room looks like a micro hotel. I've had better towels at cheaper hotels elsewhere in the country. I was glad I brought my own wash cloths because the room didn't have any. The bathroom also had a 2-in-1 shampoo\/conditioner, another shame and inconsistent with much cheaper hotels I've stayed at that offer proper sizes of body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. The rooms were very quiet though, I didn't hear a single neighbor during our trip. There was a problem with the air conditioner and maintenance came very promptly to fix it. That said, the room never got below 73 degrees even with the air set to 64 and blowing all night. Even for the middle of winter, we were rather uncomfortable with the temperature.

My first gripe is one that I bare some responsibility for: the \"resort fee.\" I booked through a 3rd party that, to their credit, did specify in the fine print afterward that there was a resort fee to be paid upon check-in. It's $40 a night. This is a deceptive practice designed to make hotel rooms appear cheaper than what they really are, leaving guests in a difficult situation once they book. If you book with the hotel directly and show up, it's not easy to just find another hotel at the last minute. And they're still going to charge you for the first night, anyway. If you book through a 3rd party, you won't be able to cancel the reservation at all.\n\nThe resort fee covers, by the way, access to a rather mediocre hotel gym. You are paying $40 a day extra to use the gym. This practice should be illegal. I've only just checked in and I'm here for several days and I'm already unhappy. Not just because of that experience, but also because the hotel is in disrepair. Our room looks like it got \"the landlord special\" and is falling apart; see images. This hotel really has the unmitigated gall to try and dupe guests and it's not even a nice facility. \n\nAbsolutely cannot disrecommend this hotel enough.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

So much so, I decided to use it for my work colleagues on a recent business trip and sadly were really disappointed.  Our initial check-in was incredible and the receptionist who dealt with is was full of energy, seemed genuinely interested in us as guests and was a real credit to the team.  We had 3 rooms allocated, all rather small and in varying states in terms of condition.  My 2 colleagues reported no hot water and were not dealt with particular well back at reception and after a theatre visit still had no hot water at 11pm.  They were eventually moved.  Whilst I had hot water, the tap was faulty and was running all night, part of the head board was ripped and handing over the bed and the room genuinely needed a thorough clean. I had attempted to open the window to get some air but the whole pane came away from the runners and I had to leave resting against the frame. \nI was moved the next day to a nicer room and before moving my luggage checked the water\u2026 alas no hot water at all. \nAnother trip to reception and I was moved to lovely room that finally had hot running water.   The receptionist that dealt with her check-in handled herself brilliantly, but other interactions during the stay were met with some disinterested individuals who struggled to look up from a phone screen. \nThe hotel just seems tired, the lifts were hit and miss and the swipe card entry system once in the left leaves little to be desired - most units seem broken and if you aren\u2019t quick you will find yourself on the top floor with no way of changing where it is going. \nThe attached bar is fine, but staff seem to interchange when they give you a resident discount or not and seem geniuinely uninterested in your custom - a closed sign was on the outside door for 2 days despite the fact they were \u2018open\u2019. \nOne staff member mentioned that they opened too soon, so I really do hope this is a glitch and the hotel gets back on better form.  You can\u2019t beat it location wise, but the disrepair in some instances was not acceptable.  You really need to read the details clearly, get the wrong room and you will feel like you are inside a box, get it right and you feel more relaxed. \nI will remain hopeful that things will improve, but right now I can\u2019t justify taking my business colleagues there again. \nIF you are booking, Times Square and the theatres are literally right outside the door but at no point do you feel stuck in a tourist trap. \nDisney are building a hotel across the road and so there was incessant drilling from 7am every day in the week.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The information for the hotel clearly said, taxes and fees included. Once the reservation was made, there was a HUGE increase in cost. We tried work with Booking.com, they said that the increase was on the hotel's side who was refusing to budge, saying it was their taxes and fees, which on booking, we clearly paid. All in all, we actually ended up paying double for this room. We could have ended up at a really nice hotel instead of the matchbox rooms we did end up with at the Paramount. There were no amenities, such as coffee in the room, no fridge, no sink space, or drawer space. There was a king bed, and a small table. The space between the bed and the TV hanging on the was minimal, barely enough to just walk by. The staff was also very rude and not in any way ready to holp with what had happened. The check in time was a good 45 minutes as well, due to the fact that only one person was working the front desk at peak times for check in. PROS: The location of the hotel was excellent. Close to Times Square and the transit of your choice. Recap: If you have a choice do not stay at this hotel. It's not worth the extra feet you may need to walk to stay somewhere that is actually nice, up to date and worth the money.

The hotel lobby and the hotel employees overall were fantastic and very friendly and the lobby was very clean and beautiful. However, once you get into the elevators and head toward your room you get a completely different experience. The elevators only worked half the time and often times you would get stuck going up and down to different floors because the buttons wouldn\u2019t work correctly. They were also very creaky and old.\nThe rooms are very deceiving from the pictures that were posted on the website that I saw. The rooms were much smaller, old, dingy and just not what I had pictured.\nThe bed was the most uncomfortable bed that we had ever slept in. Neither of us got much sleep at all for the full five days that we were staying there. The bed was far too firm, the pillows were very flat and it was just overall very uncomfortable.\nThe noise at this hotel was a joke. Even on the eighth floor the windows were not sealed enough to keep any of the sound out so that we could hear all of the sounds  of the city very loudly all night long. There has been no efforts to drown the sound out by the hotel. The walls were extremely thin so that I could hear conversations happening in the room next to me while I was trying to sleep. There were also weird loud random noises happening all throughout the night in the walls and ceiling which I\u2019m not sure what they were, but they were very disruptive. On the first night about 2 AM a ridiculous alarm started going off for quite a while waking myself up and most people on my floor were opening our doors and trying to figure out why this alarm was going off and why it wouldn\u2019t stop.\nAs I mentioned, the pictures on the website were deceiving of the room.

Otherwise, it feels \u201cbudget\u201d on every level: having stayed at several 3+\/4 star hotels in Times Square, it\u2019s high rating is just mystifying. \n\nTheir customer service email bounces back as does their messaging set up on their website, so we were unable to respond to emails from the hotel before or during our stay.\n\nThe elevators are small, run by key card, and under lit, one of which required a flashlight to see the card reader as well as the floor number buttons. For our 4 night stay, the elevators were full of international travelers with large suitcases, going up when they thought they were going down and vice versa, because no one explained the key card system at check in. The elevators only hold 4 people at a time, so this made getting in and out especially difficult.\n\nThe rooms themselves are spartan-no cost incurred. The flat screen tv has network tv and has a set up where you can stream your own apps on it. There is a small plastic desk and even smaller bed table. No reading chair, lamp, coffee maker, dresser, suitcase holder, or any other amenity now commonly found in even in budget motels.\n\nThe carpet was stained, the toilet leaked, and most off-putting of all, the walls were extraordinarily thin. Night one we slept with a crying baby in our room, nights 2 and 3 we shared our sleep with a coughing and vomiting man, and night 4 we had drilling\/rotorouting at 8pm somewhere in the vicinity of the bathroom.\n\nCould not find any ice or vending: there is some kind of eatery off the lobby, but its hours and menu were a mystery. I have no idea what the extra \u201cresort fee\u201d covers other than the pool table in the lobby. I would have loved for them to have spent it on a lightbulb for the elevator.\n\nOverall this was a profound disappointment, as the room was within $40 of rooms at hotels I know are quite nice. I usually travel with my elderly parents, and had they been on this trip we would have needed to eat the cost and booked a different hotel.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When I arrived there was a long queue in the somewhat smallish lobby making guest ready for check-in having to stand in front of the elevators. When I arrived there was one person doing the check-in. After 20 minutes they finally had one more member of the staff check-in guests in and 1 hour and 10 minutes later I got to check-in. On several occasions I saw a manager come out to the lobby to inspect the queue but nothing further happened. The combination of waiting and the humidity was horrible but I got there in the end. After that experience check-in took five minutes. I got a double ADA room on the 6th floor which was very nice. Sparkling clean, spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was very nice however there was no ventilation  in the bathroom making it necessary to have the door open while showering. The bed was very comfortable with nice linen. Big flat panel tv with loads of channels and the possibility to stream from your own device. Very nice. Cleaning is done every day and the staff kept the room sparkling clean.  All the staff I interacted with were ever so nice with big smiles and very helpful. The hotel has 4 elevators which was  kind of sufficient but two broke down during my stay which created some waiting. Check-out was contrary to check-in very fast and the hotels offers luggage storage for a small fee. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely return. I was gonna rate the hotel 3\/5 however having written this I have to say that the unfortunate experience at check-in was just that - unfortunate - but I did otherwise have a great stay so a rating of 4\/5 Is appropriate.

AVOID!!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-12-04","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"On arrival we were delighted with the initial impression; the location was great and lobby was lovely. Then we tried to check in. One word answers were all we got before being given the keys to our Superior Double Room for 3 guests. When we entered our room we were surprised to see two slightly larger than usual single beds with one pillow on each, and exposed wires hanging out from the wall. Clearly not a superior room and only for a maximum  of two people. The floors were stained and had not been hoovered. We returned to reception and asked to speak with Manager and that\u2019s where we met Sheena. We showed her the photos online and Sheena told us that we must take this up with booking.com as the beautiful large double bed pictures were not the responsibility of the hotel, and we had no choice but to stay in the tiny room with 2 single beds, all 3 of us as her computer told her it was 2 doubles. When we showed her the exact same photos were on their website she told us again. Nothing she could do. Like it or lump it. We asked her to come look at the room to see that it was not the same as the photos. She refused saying she was short staffed and couldn\u2019t leave her post, despite only appearing from the back when we requested to speak with her. After paying \u00a31600 for 4 nights this was completely unacceptable . Sheena finally found us another room (despite her telling us the hotel was full when booking .com said they had 11 rooms available) and we could take ourselves to look at it but she was done with us now. Never have I ever experienced such a rude and unhelpful Manager. We opted to move to that room for the night as it was cleaner and had no exposed wires but wanted to be moved in the morning to the size room we had paid for. Sheena told us to return between 7&8 to speak with AJ as he was the only one who could do that. So we took my 67 year old mum to bed as she was exhausted and my sister and I returned at 7:15 to speak to AJ\u2026 only to be told he wasn\u2019t in. \nEventually a manager called Omar assisted us as best he could but ultimately we paid \u00a3400 for 2 single beds on night one for 3 adults. Sheena could not be bothered and lied throughout her conversation with us. \nAvoid at all costs. The rooms are NOT the same as the photos advertised and Sheena should not be in the hospitality trade with an attitude like hers.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}
{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":93517,"title":"I Might Come Back","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-12-02","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"I was travelling with my mother in NYC for a one night trip to see the Rockefeller Tree light up. Paramount Hotel Times Square is listed online as a 4-star hotel and I stayed in their Superior Room with 2 twin beds.\n\n* Location: 5\/5 \nI chose this hotel because of its distance to Rockefeller Center. We were right by Times Square, so I expected to hear the outside from my hotel room, but I was wrong! It definitely felt calm and quiet in the room, so that was very comforting. In addition, when people outside the room passed through the halls, little to no noise could be heard even when they were talking. It's also NYC, so there are most definitely restaurants next door\/near by. You can easily order for pick-up or delivery from this spot and you can enjoy a bar right on the first floor.\n\n* Check-In\/Check-Out: 4\/5\nI had emailed the hotel a week ahead that I would want to check in earlier.  They had replied that check in is at 3 pm, but they would note it. I arrived at 2 pm and lined up to check in - the line was long because only 1 person was at the front, but the line moved pretty fast. They were able to check me in early, so I was very pleased that they accommodated that need for me. They ask for a $100 deposit in addition to your overall payment in case there are any damages made to your room. It gets refunded if nothing goes wrong. Check-out process went smooth and quickly.\n\n* Room: 3\/5\nI was assigned room 1220, which window viewed the back of a billboard ad and some other rooms in the hotel. The room is indeed small, and bathroom is smaller, but it's cozy and decent enough for two people for 1 night. Pictures advertised on Expedia are completely different than what you actually get. To mention some: The table is placed directly under the TV, but it's actually in the corner because there would be no room for people to pass through if it was actually under the TV; Lack of d\u00e9cor on both the table and bed-side table; Beds only had two pillows, sans decorative pillow. There's also a radio with two USB ports, but it didn't work, charge our phones, or turn on, even though it was plugged in. Bathroom had 3 conditioning shampoos. No lotion, no body wash. They don't provide dental supplies so if you don't bring your own, they will redirect you to a nearby 24-hr CVS. Both heater\/aircon worked well during my stay.\n\n* Service: 2\/5\nThe staff were really polite and kind, please don't misunderstand my rating. The reason why I'm giving the service 2 stars is because of the overall experience I had with them. I had gift cards with money to use for the taxes and fees, but their machine wouldn't accept my gift card. I was able to book the hotel with a gift card and knew I had enough money left, but for some reason I couldn't use the gift card for in person payment with them? I had asked if I must swipe it or if there was a way to manually enter the card number, but the person at the front desk had no idea and just shrugged at me. She said she's unsure how the machine works, or if it even accepts gift cards, and told me to play around with it to see if it will work if I keep swiping it different ways each time... I didn't want to hold up the line, so I just ended up using my credit card, which was a bummer. Around 7 pm, I had called the front desk to ask for extra pillows, but the lines were busy and hung up on me a few times. I called again at 8 pm and the same situation happened. After 11 pm, I was finally able to actually connect to someone. Overall, for a 4-star hotel, front desk staff really kicked off a few points. \n\n* Amenities: 3\/5\nMy room did not have a lot of the amenities that are listed online, so I'm assuming the superior two twins don't qualify for the mini-fridge, snack bar\/deli, or laundry? For a 4-star hotel, I wish the staff provided more information on the gym, laundry, restaurant, and the bar. There should be some flyers or pamphlets provided in the room that advertises said amenities. It does not feel like a 24\/7 front desk.\n\n* Pricing: 4\/5\nThe hotels surrounding the area were about twice the price for what I can expect to be the same experience. For what it's worth, it was definitely affordable, but it didn't feel like it was worth almost $200.\n\n* Overall: 3\/5\nWith everything tied in together, I had an OK time at the hotel. I may book again if I ever need to stay a night in NYC!","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

It was very dated- Tough putting two people in a full size bed when they are not used to it- I can\u2019t imagine how plus sized people would handle it. One chair and a skinny lucite table\/desk. Suitcases had to lay on the floor. Our air-conditioner did not cool properly.

By the time we left the next day, it about 78 and muggy. The carpeting was badly stained and long overdue for replacement.

I told the receptionist that he would be arriving later and had given them his name and was told he would just have to show his ID and they would give him a key. We eventually met up a few hours later and we headed back to the hotel. Got in the elevator. I hit floor 4. My friend thought I was messing with him, he said we're on 7. I said \"No, we're on 4,\" He insisted we were on 7. I said \"I'll show you.\" We walked into my room and the look on my friends face was pure confusion. He told me how he was in a room on the 7th floor and when he entered that room there was already luggage in there and he assumed it was mine. We went immediately up to the other room. And it was just as he described it, but the luggae obviously wasn't mine. We were baffled and were trying to figure out what to do. Just then there was a knock at the door. It was the gentlemen who was also checked into that room. He was confused as well. Luckily he was cool and we were cool. This is definitely where this scenario could have gone sideways. We all agreed we needed to go speak to the manager immediately and headed downstairs. We walked up to the desk and explained the situation and the lady at the desk didn't seem to understand it despite us explaining it to her a few times in great detail. It was as if this couldn't possibly have happened and she seemed to imply that we must have done something wrong. It was maddening. She didn't seem to understand the HUGE safety issue that could have occurred. If I or my buddy were sleeping or the other guy was and one or both of us barged into what we were told was our room it could have escalated to violence. Or even worse if one of the involved parties was a woman who was under the impression that they were in a reasonably safe hotel room. The demeanor that the hotel employee showed us couldn't have been less empathetic. So we asked to see the manager. We got the classic \"I am the manager\". I was surprised to hear this seeing as she was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. I am used to hotel employees being more \"business casual\" at the least. But we took her word for it. After some more discussion, it basically devolved into \"Well, what do you want me to do about it?\" We felt that there should be some kind of compensation. Eventually, she said they would refund us the \"resort fee\" I believe is what she called it. Problem is, we didn't pay a resort fee nor were we informed of one upon check-in. After we told her that she said \"Well then we won't charge you for it.\" Soup to nuts, a complete cluster. The lack of customer service was one thing, I know how things are now and good help is hard to find. But don't urinate on my shoes and tell me it's raining. I had stayed here in the past and had a good experience, but never again. In addition to the circus I just described the light was burned out in the bathroom, there were no toiletries, the room was bare bones. There are PLENTY of other options in the area. Do yourself a favor and avoid the Paramount. It's not worth risking your life.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I am also tired of hotel managers who don't seem to care about our current stays and only respond to anything with something like \"... we hope you'll give us another chance next time.\" I don't necessarily care about stained carpets or dark rooms because my apartment is very much like that and we all know how time-consuming and costly it is to clean carpets. Besides, I am aware of the fact that Paramount just re-opened a couple of weeks ago so there are definitely things they can improve on. I'd, however, cast doubts on whether staff members can improve their attitudes through time. Paramount's staff members always get onto my needs right away: From my early check-in; personal fridge; extra key cards, to my request for late check-out, everything takes less than 10 minutes to be taken care of.
