I will admit that I can be picky about where I stay and Hilton hotels usually never let me know.  And this time it was true again.\n\nI must give kidos to the staff, especially Charlene at the front desk.  I called the hotel and spoke to Charlene a few days before my arrival. I have a few questions for about rooms, room locations, etc. She was great when speaking to her and she assured me I would like their hotel and locations.  \n\nUpon my arrival Charlene was at the front desk and checked me in.  She remembered speaking to be a few days before and was just a joy!!  She was right, my room was great, the service is excellent and the breakfast is really good every morning.  Charlene has a great attitude!\n\nI also want to give kudos to Lee and Donovan at the Front desk.  Whenever they say me that asked if I needed anything.  I appreciate the attention to service.\n\nI will say that this hotel due to locations is very busy. Sometimes you have to wait for the elevators during peak times.  Other than that, it's all good!\n\nThe loacation of this hotel is perfect if you want to be in the Times Square area and just a couple blocks from Mavy's and other great shopping.  There are so many good restaruants to eat in the area it will be hard to pick where to go. :)\n\nAll in all, I have found my new place to stay when I am in Manhattan!!

Booked direct and was able to check-in and select my suite directly from the Hilton app. \n\nUpon arrival, managed to bypass the front desk and operate the lift using the digital key from the Hilton app. There are 3 speedy lifts for the 22 floor building. \n\nThe 1 King suite itself was spacious, featuring a full kitchen with crockery and hood, dish washer, fridge, and microwave. The loo was spacious and featured Hilton's latest toileteries attached to the wall. Water pressure in the shower was weak and the towels were thick and fluffy. \n\nThe TV inside the suite had premium business channels although the signal would cut in and out. There is a wardrobe in the suite that also features an iron, ironing board, along with an in-room safe. The \"desk\" for the suite was a touch counterintuiative as it was hard working with such a big TV by one's forehead.\n\nThere was a seating area in living area that turned into a sofabed. The mattress was a lower end bonnell spring mattress and the blankets were quite warm. The mattress was a touch worn out as there were pretty huge indents from heavy usage.\n\nThe HVAC system was quiet and the A\/C kicked on periodically as the suite got pretty warm, especially mid-afternoon.\n\nWithin the property, there is a rooftop garden on the 22nd floor. In addition, there is a laundry room and gym within the building as well. There is complimentary breakfast that is served every morning.\n\nThe convenience store on site has a variety of goods available for sale although the prices on the wall do not correspond to the prices of the goods as an employee informed me. Caveat emptor for those making purchases from the on-site convenience store. Definitely validate the price of items and perhaps even ask for a receipt before stepping away.\n\nThere are hand sanitizer stations throughout the lobby.\n\nHousekeeping does drop by daily as a stayover, although it's a rather quick service of rubbish disposable, towel replacement, and quick bed making.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

The room wasn\u2019t ready but was expected as check in isn\u2019t until 16.00and it was very busy, so they kindly stored our baggage and told us to come back at 16.00. We arrived back at 16.30 but the room still wasn\u2019t ready , was slightly disappointed as we had only come back to freshen up then go back out to explore, we waited 20 minutes then was given our room key.  On first glance of the room we thought it was quite small for 3 people with nowhere to place suitcases out of the way , but this didn\u2019t really impacted us to much as we spent a very small amount of time in the room . Breakfast was very busy so we ended up getting a take out and taking it back to our room . Free tea and coffee in the lobby to help yourself . Location was pretty good , 10 mins to time square, 20min walk to rocket feller and 1hr to history museum . All in all it was a pretty average stay until our journey back home. I had messed up and booked our transfer back to the airport for the wrong day, a lady at reception said they had there own car ( not sure if this meant it was hotel run or just a car service they use ) , she told us it would be $95 so we went ahead.  Driver picked us up , smartly dressed and car was nice , however 20 mins into our journey he tell us we have to pay an extra $ 10 , we explained that we was told it was $95 , he said no no it\u2019s $105 plus an extra $10 , I know it\u2019s not a huge amount extra and luckily I had a few extra $ to hand but if we didn\u2019t we would have found ourselves in a tricky situation . He also said if your not happy with this then you can get out here , obviously we was not going to do that with our son , suitcases and in the middle of god knows where . So there is obviously a miss communication between the hotel and the car service or the hotel just don\u2019t have up to date prices . ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

One small thing to remember is that the fridge is alongside the bed, and  can be a little noisy during the night.\n\nThe breakfast selection is smaller than we expected, but this is most likely due to the space available. That said, there is a good choice of hot and cold items, and the 24 hour coffee station is a great benefit.\n\nA self service laundry is provided, and was very useful for our 9 night stay.\n\nThe Evening Reception is now only on Wednesdays, and this was a little disappointing.\n\nHowever, all the staff we met during our stay were without exception friendly, helpful and a pleasure to meet.\n\nThe hotel is perfectly located for sightseeing, shopping and very close to the subway. Times Square is a short walk away, and there are plenty of restaurants and bars in the area.\n\nThis was a very pleasant stay, and we appreciated the nice touches from the hotel to make our visitors memorable.\n\nThe roof terrace on the 22nd floor is a lovely area, and in warmer weather, would be a lovely place to relax after a days sightseeing.\n\nThe Homewood Suites is a great brand and this hotel is an excellent example of great hospitality.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The subway is very close and, in short, one can move quickly. Oh, and it's two blocks from 2Bros Pizzeria, which I warmly recommend for purchase and delivery to your room.\nStaff is very kind: all the times. \nFree breakfast is not much, but you can have coffee, take it to your room, and top it off with fruits or other foods you have bought.

This hotel was in a great location...close to Penn Station [about a 5 minute walk], Macy's, Times Square, Bryant Park, etc. Our room was a king with a small loveseat.  It had a good size fridge and a two top burner [which we didn't use].  The bed was very comfortable and the room was extremely quiet.  We were on the 19th floor and overlooked a quiet dead end street.  We had a good view of the building where the Edge Observation deck is located.  The hotel has a rooftop terrace that was nice, as well.  The hotel also has a self-serve laundry.  We used it once while there - cost between $8 and $10 for wash and dry [the dryer wasn't very effective, so it did take a while to dry clothes and some we laid out in the room to dry].\n\nBreakfast is included and coffee\/tea is available 24\/7.  There were 3 food sections - one was cereal and fruit, one was breads and pastries that could be toasted, and one was a hot food area.  The hot food area was interesting.  There were a few days where I thought the choices were a bit odd - corned beef and hash was an offering one morning.  Always a type of sausage offered, but never bacon.  And, the food in this area was lukewarm, at best.  That would be my only complaint. \n\nIf you arrive before your room is ready, the staff will hold your luggage for you so that you can go out and start exploring.  Other reviews will mention the homeless people.  We did see them, but not directly in front of the hotel.  We did not have any approach us, and we never felt unsafe.  I did notice that early morning and late evening, they seemed to \"disappear\" from the surrounding areas.  Not sure where they went.  \n\nCouple of restaurant choices that we liked near the hotel - Tick Tock Diner and Joyce Public House.  We had breakfast at Tick Tock and dinner at Joyce. We enjoyed both.

The staff at Homewood suites in Manhattan, NY,  all around were by far the best I have ever  experienced.   From the time we checked in and met the staff at the desk, we felt at home until the moment we left, (well even after).  During our departure,  My wife left a very important jacket in our room as we checked out.  For runners it is called a \"Ragnar\" and she waited 50 years to run this race as a team member.  So you can see how important this jacket was to her.  The housekeeping staff took in upon themselves to make sure we got it home.  When I could not get a prepaid package sent to the hotel, the manager took it upon herself and at her own expense to send the jacket back to my wife.  It brings back something very special to today's society..  I want to thank everyone at Homewood Suites for an outstanding and unforgettable 2 day stay.  They truly went above and beyond to give us a NewYork experiance, that we will never forget, We will be back,  and I will never forget the personal attention they gave us all around  . Thank you.

It made the longer stay more comfortable. The sofa couch was a great place to chill too. The room was lovely and airey with great air con. We went for breakfast at 7 and had no issues.

Great shower- continual hot water and no loss of water pressure. \n\nThe laundry a bonus for a long stay too. Location is excellent, close to everything really including subway. Far enough away not to be too pricey. We got an excellent rate booking well in advance. \n\nSome reviews mentioned homeless outside. It was really no isssue\/they were no issue as in they don\u2019t beg and how can you be angry at someone for simply existing. It was  a lot worse at hotels with outside public spaces. The couple of people that we saw didn\u2019t cause any issues at all. Security always at reception checking who comes in and all lifts carded to go up. \n\nEasy check and out. Roof view is a great \nbonus, great to watch sun rise or set!

Not so at this hotel. They go out of their way to help you and find the way to say yes first.

A great plus: has complimentary coffee at all hours. \nThe hotel staff was really great, each of them always nice and helpful giving the extra mile. One special thanks to Felix Liabeta who was always attentive to where he could help.\n\nOne aspect for improvement for instance, is that our room did not have a full (or 3\/4) body mirror. \nAlso, waiting for the elevator would sometimes take a while, so we would take the stairs instead. \nFinally, the hotel is located in the garment district - a very convenient location as it's near the subway and within walking distance from Times Square, but in the surrounding blocks of the hotel it was very frequent to see drug addicts injecting themselves in plain sight - day or night - and even though there was no security incident at all, it's not an ideal situation specially if when you are with kids.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Two staff members, Amen (front desk)  explained the WiFi status with me and afterward did not charge me for a drink that I had planned to purchase from the lobby.

We arrived on Wednesday evening right in the middle of the Wednesday buffet of soup\/salad\/snacks. A very welcome surprise.  Most of the staff were wonderful. However on the day we were leaving we called for a luggage cart then we waited and waited until we started to worry we would miss our transport. So I went to lobby and got a luggage cart on my own. As I passed the front desk 4 people were chatting with each other behind the desk. I passed in front of them with the luggage cart. An old lady pushing the cart hanging on to my cane. As I neared the elevators, a young man walking past (a staff member) stopped me and told me he would help me. He took the cart and went upstairs with me, loaded our luggage on the cart. (There were three of us all over 70 and disabled--2 on canes and the other on a walker) As we waited for the elevator to go  downstairs the elevator doors opened and one of the persons that had been chatting behind the desk exited the elevator with a cart. He immediately dressed down the young man who was the only one to see me and help me. He told him he should not have left the lobby, that breakfast services was still going on. I interrupted and state that I had dragooned the young man into helping me. I was hoping to stop any consequences for the kind young man. This young man, Luis and several other staff members-Lisbeth and Pedro in the breakfast area were kind and helpful. These kind of staff members make people want to return to your hotel. They go out of their way to make your guests welcome and feel cared for during their stay.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The staff was efficient, answering our questions and requests on time. I used the gym and, for being a hotel gym, it was very complete! And the size was nice. The room was very clean and had a microwave, a good size (medium) refrigerator and everything you would need for eating there comfortably (even a toaster and pans!). The options for breakfast were great!!! They always had fruit, yogurt, milk, cereal, granola, coffee and pastry. Always boiled eggs and another kind of cooked egg (cheese omelette or fried), sausage or bacon and pancakes or waffles. They always had bread and bagels as well. Would recommend arriving early, as it gets crowded and you have to find the seat by yourself. We were very pleased with this place.

Check in time is 4pm which is quite late in the day as it is. We arrived at 2pm on the day of my partners birthday. No acknowledgment of this either despite checking ID\u2019s. We asked if our room was available and they said no but if you pay $70 we can find you a room.

They then said the room is now ready but we\u2019ll only charge you $50 for the early check in. Bit annoying having this and also a bit cheeky asking to pay fees for rooms that are already ready.

My fever was 106 and my body was dehydrated due to the no heat at the room. We were at the hospital whole night and came next day afternoon. Since 28th we couldn't go out and our whole trip was wasted. We couldn't go and see the ball drop which we came to see. My husband had to go to hospital again. After we complained they came and check the room and realized the heater was not working. They changed our room on the 01st. 3 days before our checkouts. But then it was too late. Manager promised me that they will Credit back  $650 to my credit card which never happened. Since we complained about the   Room heater the front desk staff were very rude to us. We paid $ 2800 to the Airline & about $5000 for your hotel to have a pleasant stay. Our whole trip to New York was ruined. Never expected that from Hilton. As soon as we returned to California my husband got admitted at the Hollycross hospital. He is having Pneumonia and Asthma. Because there was no heater working at the hotel room. He is still at the hospital. My ears are still blocked and I still have Cough and fever. My Son also went to hospital in New York and got treatments for ears blocked. He still has that. I will speak to my lawyer about this. Because it's hotel duty and responsibility to check the heating and air conditioning before the guests arrive. ","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The breakfast staff keep the area clean and tidy and although sometimes there is a bit of a wait for tables at breakfast it\u2019s never that long and the food is very good, with fresh muffins, fruit, eggs, bacon etc which definitely saves you a lot of money in New York.\n\nThe location on W37th is very good for local shops.

What was probably worse was the room was not that clean. The floor (wood flooring) was sticky in many areas, and just generally didn't feel clean. The TV also had a large black circle show up after the TV turned on making watching TV pretty much unusable. I also had to iron a shirt which they give you one of those mini ironing boards you have to put on the bed to use which to me is useless. Hate hotels that do that. The stretch of the block it is on is also not a great location. I had to leave early in the morning so checked out using the app again. Who knows if the staff could have fixed things but there was always a line at the front desk. Long and short, I would not come back as I believe you can find something better 99% of the time for a lot less in better location and cleaner.More","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I chose a room on the 18th floor and could not hear any sirens or car horns.  The rooftop is awesome if you are looking for a place to hang out.  Unfortunately, the hotel is located in the garment district and a lot of the shops close early in the evening, leaving the street dark.  Therefore it attracts a lot of mentally ill homeless people and drug users.  Be prepared to see men smoking crack and defecating in the street.  I realize it\u2019s NYC, but  we were harassed coming and going to the hotel just 40 ft from the front door.  The hotel will say the have \u201ccalled the police\u201d, but the police don\u2019t arrest anybody in NY anymore.  They need to do more to protect the property and keep their guests safe.

I would consider staying again, especially with tweenies. It all depends on your priorities, we did a lot of research and Homewood Suites Manhattan turned out to be a great choice for us.\n\nThe good: \nClean, comfortable, friendly professional staff, decent air quality, roomy room for Manhattan, central location in Midtown, walking distance to Penn Station, subway, Times Square and Broadway. \nRooms have big fridge, small freezer, good dishbasher, good TV and good seating area with pull-out table in the room. You could save so much money cooking meals for yourselves and\/or getting takeout to the room, very suitable for families with younger\/fussy\/allergic children. \nNever used coffee maker as no coffe pods in our room, only tea bags, maybe you buy them, I don't know. But there is free coffe\/tea\/hot chocolate available in the lobby all day.\nGenerous breakfast, taking fruit and pastries with you is totally fine, there's even boxes for it. \nWe did a batch of laundry in the basement on our 4th day, cost about $10 (got change for the automats from reception), great, kids enjoyed helping. Didn't use gym but looked good. \n9th ave is just around the corner wich is far better for food and corner shops ie more local quality places. We especially enjoyed Vito's Slices & Ices a short walk away, got takeout from them twice and ate in once at a small counter table at the back once. Laid back and delicious pizza, best NYC slice I've had. \nSushi Star also fantastic, not the cheapest but amazing quality run by hard working family and heaving with locals. Had our favourite Unagi sushi (grilled eel) and other goodies, worth every penny.\nWe got some lovely prosecco from Amster Wine and toasted on the hotel roof terrace. Amazing gourmet \"supermarket\" shopping at Brooklyn Fare a few minutes walk away. The deli items there looked fantastic, we wandered around this meticulous higgeldy-piggeldy  \"supermarket\" (with a hidden michelin restaurant in the middle!) for an hour! Bought snacks, fun drinks and things here. \nDid some browsing at new shopping centre Hudson Yard at about 15 mins walking distance, very polished and nice and there's a Shake Shack. You can also get on the High Line from there. \nOur favourite local restaurant was Ben's Kosher Deli 209 W 38th St, 10 mins walk, visited twice. Kids loved the burgers & fries, we loved the pastrami sandwich & chicken soup, prefer it to over hyped NY kosher delis like Katz's.\nPlease note: Manhattan is a VERY expensive place and tipping staff generously is the norm, ie 20% + , pref in cash.\n\nThe less good:\nWednesday afternoons\/early evenings there's apparently free soup, cheese and crackers and cookies served in the lobby. Would have been great if we were told this at check-in so we hadn't missed out.\nYes the fridge is loud. I pulled out and unplugged mine. Otherwiswe good sleep quality. The tap water doesn't taste good. There's a filtered water machine is in the gym in the basement, we filled up our bottles daily. \nBreakfast isn't gourmet and things run out and it's very busy, but we always ate well and varied, and managed to find a table for four after a bit of waiting each morning. \nMidtown isn't the prettiest part of Manhattan and yes there is an addiction clinic on the same street as the hotel, resulting in a number of vulnerable people just outside and on the way to the nearest subway station. If you or your children have never experienced closeness to vulnerable people this may come as a shock, but we never felt threatened and were never approached.    \n\n ","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Very close to subway and Madison Square Garden.\nThe room was clean. The ac was cold (it was in the 60\u2019s in the city this weekend so it was nice out. You could open your window slightly for fresh air which was also nice. \nWe were allowed a late check out (1 pm) and an 8:30 pm flight and they held our bags. So that was great!\n\nBad: Location, homeless and drug use right outside the door. I know this is not the hotels fault, but it was really bad, just an fyi.\n\nThe room- we had a digital key confirmation for the 14th floor, that room was not available and we were put in a different room-  4  floors lower which we wanted to be higher up.\n\nThe lobby area is so crowded with people you can\u2019t hardly get in the place. Every time we came in you couldn\u2019t get in due to piles of luggage and people everywhere. The set up of the front desk is quite awkward-  not adequate for the number of people checking in and out- and lounging around in the lobby.\n\nThe toilet in the lobby is broken- wouldn\u2019t flush.\n\nThe breakfast was so crowded you couldn\u2019t get anything, and what was available was terrible. Fajita chicken for breakfast? Watered down luke-warm oatmeal, the serving things the lid fell off when you opened them. Watered down orange juice. Awkward set up for coffee service and again SO many people. There were no forks, nowhere to sit\u2026.\n\nPeople said the rooftop bar was great- there is no rooftop bar. There is a terrace on the roof but there was nothing special about it.\n\nThe elevators were terribly slow. Even though our check out was extended the keys stopped working and we couldn\u2019t get back upstairs and had to wait for almost 20 minutes because the line at the desk and one guy working. There was a second guy but he was not doing check ins or outs.\nThe room- was small even for NYC standards. \n\nThe bathroom sink had no room for you to set a toiletries bag and you could not set it on the top of the toilet because the button to flush is there. \nThe shower was small, the water pressure was good. \nThe kitchen area was tiny and so close to the bed you could take stuff out of the fridge door from the bed. \nThere were no glasses for the kitchen, and no large bowls (for chips\/popcorn)- there were cereal bowls. There were no towels for use in the kitchen either, so you had to use a bath towel\/rag if you needed to wash and dry something.\nThere are two bedside tables that are super tiny and I knocked everything off of the one next to my side every time I moved.\nThe couch is not fit to sit on, although we did use it a couple times to eat so we were not eating in the bed.\nIce makers only on every third floor.\nThe pillows\u2026 are garbage they need to throw those out and get new ones I mean come on this is a Hilton!\nThere is a mirror but you can\u2019t \u201cget ready\u201d in front of it if you need to use a hair dryer or curling iron as there\u2019s no plug.\n\nThe lighting was inadequate.\nThe TV does not have options for smart tv functions like Netflix or HULU not that we wanted to stay in and watch tv but there was a hockey game on that we missed because I couldn\u2019t log in to my Hulu account. (We didn\u2019t travel with laptops so we could hook up to the tv).\nThe bed itself was ok-  not comfortable if you\u2019re used to a pillow top mattress. Pretty firm- had a hard time sleeping and I was so worn out from all the walking.\n\nThe view out the windows is an ugly building with zero view of any skyline or landmarks at all.  Just FYI if that\u2019s important to you as you\u2019re planning your trip. I don\u2019t know if the view is any better higher up. We were put on the 10th floor which there is no view from there except into residents windows.\n\nNo light canceling window covers. There is a shade for night and a shade that keeps people across the street seeing in which you can leave down during the day if you need light.\n\nConsistent noise from sirens and car horns all night.\n\nI know some of these things are beyond the hotels control, but they were plenty of things that were within the hotels control that missed the mark for a Hilton brand. This location is good on the one has but not good on the other. NYC is getting back to the 90\u2019s level of homelessness and drug abuse. People peeing on the sidewalk, we walked past people doing crack and shooting up, steps from the door of the hotel.\n\nOverall I was very disappointed considering how much I paid for this room and I have a level of quality I expect from Hilton.\n\nI would not say \u201cavoid\u201d this hotel as I am sure it fits the needs of some- but for me, I won\u2019t stay there again. \n\nHad I been traveling alone it may have been better as far as how small it was-  two people trying to move around in there it was just too cramped. We were in a king suite. Too many other contributing factors make this a place I won\u2019t stay again.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Check in was a bit busy at around 3pm and we waited for about a half hour to have the room ready in the lobby where they serve coffee and hot chocolate and small snacks all day. Excellent location of hotel, only a couple minutes walk to ACE trains, and a few extra minutes to 123 and NQRW trains. The room was clean and large for NYC standards, certainly leaving enough room for 2 to unpack both of our bags without getting in each other's way. We stayed in the King Premium Studio on the tenth floor that had windows out towards 37th street. The refrigerator did make an annoying whining noise occasionally but not enough to disrupt sleep. Could barely hear traffic from the room and could not at all hear other guests. The bed was  a bit uncomfortable and that  is probably because it likely being due for a replacement. At peak times the elevator did take some time and I managed to get stuck on it going in the wrong direction one morning, so the elevators definitely can be finicky. Housekeeping came daily for a turn-down make the bed and replace towels but you could ask for them to clean it like it was fresh the first day you got it if you give them a day heads up. We were there a week and didn't feel the need to have it super cleaned. Water pressure and temperature were great for the shower and sinks. Didn't use the stove or the microwave but we did run the dishwasher before we left with the dishes we used. Free breakfast every morning was wonderful but definitely crowded. Often times they had some version of eggs, meat and a vegetarian warm dish but also your typical continental breakfast items. I had done A LOT of research prior to booking this hotel and did so because this was the biggest room with a refrigerator in midtown for the best price (often times cheaper than hotels that didn't have a refrigerator in the room at all). The 22 floor rooftop area was a pretty great place to visit for sunset with a glass of whatever you BYOB.\nSomething we did notice after walking nearly 10 miles a day ALL over NYC exploring the different neighborhoods and everything is that the block that the hotel is on is in fact the most crowded with people struggling with mental illness and addiction. Which actually surprised us because we walked in all sorts of places and sure as sh*t, our block was the worst. Now that said, it wasn't anything where I feared for myself or anything. It can feel a little uncomfortable but just not making eye contact and moving along they didn't seem to deliberately bother anyone. I've worked as a nurse in mental health for over a decade and these individuals were not a threat to anyone but themselves.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

So far it has Far Exceeded all expectations.\n\nRoom and bathroom size are fine, but more importantly everything is well designed and very practical. Enough real drawer and wardrobe.

There are more hooks and towel bars in the bathroom, unlike all other Hilton chain hotels we\u2019ve been to.\n\nGood size perfect working fridge and freezer - no noise at night!\n\nHigh quality clean hardwood floor throughout, clean stylish tiles all round the bathroom. \n\nAll doors are solid wood doors, well painted, no wide gap letting through drafts and noise, none of those flimsy sliding ones letting through light and noise all around.\n\nThere are numerous lights all over the room, each separately controlled, so you can pick what feels perfect for you at any point in time.\n\nManagement and house keeping have been responsive and courteous.\n\nI know some reviews complain about lack of full room service. The fact  is that the hotel does provide it every 4 days and more frequently upon request. At other times the level of limited service which is garbage removal and towel replenish, is actually all that we want. Anything more even feels intrusive sometimes.\n\nSome reviewers were worried about the homeless population in the neighborhood. There is no denying that there are more of them than in most other parts of town, given the vicinity of the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Penn Station etc. but unless you stay in the upper west and upper east area, I suspect you will find them everywhere, including in the subway trains and all the subway stations. They are all smart enough to leave the general population and tourists alone, in exchange for being allowed to stay.

When we did arrive the front desk gentleman was friendly and attentive.  He looked at our reservation and said he noticed that we had a few special requests.  For the first time in all the hotels we\u2019ve stayed at, he actually called house keeping to double check before letting us up to our room ! How simple but it made a world of difference in their level of caring and customer service ! Very impressive.\nIn the elevator, I loved that there were \u201csmart cards\u201d so you couldn\u2019t go to your floor without using your room card! Love that safety feature!\nOur room was exactly how we had requested which was a pleasant surprise (rarely does that happen ).  The room was listed as a \u201csuite\u201d but that was taking the word literally.  It was a smallish room and certainly no definition between bedroom and another room.  A love seat (sofa bed) was wedged in from the outside wall almost up against the bed.  In the opposite wall there was a refrigerator, microwave and 2 burner Stove top but not much room for anything except one small suitcase.  Not even a proper closet.  The shower was ok but water pressure was a little weak but plenty of hot water! And plenty of clean towels ! \nEverything appeared to be very clean and updated.\nIn the late afternoon, in the lobby, they put out a lovely spread of cheese, crackers and sweets. And plenty of seating capacity.\nIn the morning there were several options ie cereals, oatmeal, fresh fruit etc.  The hot entrees were  obviously prepackaged and barely warm (rubbery omelettes) and limp pieces of waffles.  There was only one flavor of muffin and a few bagels with a line to use the toaster.  The coffee was steaming hot however the hot water for tea was lukewarm at best.  \nWe ended up bringing our breakfast back to the room since it was obviously peak time and very very busy. \nThe hotel was in the perfect location for our needs so I would definitely stay there again because of their cleanliness and customer service.  As far as size of the room goes, I think that\u2019s a NYC given- most hotel rooms in the city tend to be small!!","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":5040757,"title":"Perfect city based hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-09-11","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"Overall we had a fantastic stay.  This was our first visit to NYC but have stayed at other Hilton based hotels and this did not disappoint.\n\nCHECK IN\nWe were welcomed by friendly reception staff, check in was quick and easy.  Staff took time to explain layout of hotel and hotel amenities.  \n\nROOM\nWe were on 16th floor with a room facing onto main road, as on a mid high floor we had a good rooftop view of many surrounding buildings, what I imagined would be a typical NYC view.  \n\nRoom was spacious compared to what we had seen prior to booking.  Room was clean, kitchenette was a nice addition as was good for preparing snacks later at night.  The bed and pillows were both very comfortable, we stayed for 8 days and definitely a comfortable bed for a longer stay.  Good storage space within the room and great addition of having in room safe and iron plus ironing board.  There was decent power from the shower and bathroom was a good size with good amount of space to keep toiletries etc. \n\nWe felt the room was quiet with no noise travelling or noise fro outside, unless we opened the window.  Good AC in room and black out bling was good addition. \n\nBREAKFAST \nWe were impressed length of time breakfast was served between 6am to 10.30am.  We were delighted breakfast was included and we had breakfast everyday of our stay.  Some times were busier mostly from 8.30am onwards but it never felt overly busy as there was a good size of seating areas between seating in breakfast area, outdoor area and reception area, we never struggled to get a seat.  There is also the option the take breakfast away or to prepare yourself a packed lunch for the day. Breakfast included range of continental including breads, pastries, cereals, fruits, bagels, yogurts.  There were also hot food options including eggs, sausage, potatoes, pan cakes and waffles. Also fruit juices, tea, coffee etc.\n\nThe hotel does not have a restaurant for evening meals but we did not miss this as we were out all day and if we did pop back it was just to get showered and changed to head back out.  There is also no bar in the hotel again this did not impact our stay at all. \n\nAMENITIES \nGYM\nThere is a hotel gym which we did not utilise but it did look a popular place and seemed to have a good range of equipment. \nLAUNDRY\nIt was really handy to have this facility, again we didn\u2019t use but we had planned to use due the heatwave during our stay and required to wear shorts more days than expected but due to change in weather forecast heavy rain meant we went back to wearing jeans instead! \nLOBBY\nVery modern and welcoming area, the water fall feature is relaxing and the two areas with TVs was a nice addition.  Lobby also had USB points which was handy especially final charge of phones before heading to airport. \nLOWER OUTDOOR AREA\nWe really enjoyed having breakfast in the outdoor area, it was very relaxing.  Area had a good range of tables and seating and additional comfy seating to relax.\nROOFTOP AREA\nGood size rooftop area on level 22, as previously mentioned there is no bar in hotel but you can take own food and drinks into both outdoor area and rooftop area, which we did on 2 occasions,  Also worked out much cheaper than paying bar prices to enjoy a rooftop!  View was nice and looked onto a view of The Edge building. \nSHOP\nThere is a small shop off reception which sells snacks etc.  We didn\u2019t use the shop but it is always handy to have something like this within hotel incase it is needed during stay. \nTV\nGood range of channels and it was nice to have TV to watch while getting ready or to relax too once back to the room. \n\nHOUSEKEEPING\nOur room was serviced everyday to change towels, empty bins etc.  We did request a full room service due to length of stay which you request, \n\nLOCATION\nLocation is only a few blocks one direction from Madison Square Garden and in other direction from Times Square.  Most places were within walking distance, we enjoy long walks but subway and bus stops are also only a block or 2 away, \nThere are some homeless people who tend to gather at end of street but in all honesty this had no impact on our stay at all.  As we noticed moving about all areas a of NYC homelessness is a problem throughout the city and majority of hotels had people lingering either outside on within the street area.  We commute through a large city daily for work so sadly this is something we are used to seeing and maybe didn\u2019t come as much as a shock to us as other reviewers have felt.  It seems to be something every major city is now facing. \nThe hotel has 24hr security, at night can only access hotel by a room key so people cannot wander into lobby area, again lobby toilets are secured by use of room key not open to public.  \n\nOverall we had a fantastic trip and hotel was a fantastic base for our stay with some extras like the rooftop adding to the experience of our stay.  We would recommend to friends and would stay again in the future.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It\u2019s on the same street as a drug treatment center and there are people doing drugs with needles shooting up in the open and the worst part was as we pulled in to the hotel to unload a man was pretty much completely naked swatting the ground furiously with a towel and we saw parts of his body that should not be seen- very very grapic- our eight and 11 year old with us were horrified and afraid to go into the hotel. The hotel parking they recommend was down the street I dropped the kids and a friend off because I did not want them walking from the garage it\u2019s not bad.

Booked direct and my studio was available slightly before the posted check-in time.\n\nArrived earlier in the afternoon, did a pre-check-in, and dropped off my luggage with the front desk. There was a security in the lobby... Elevators require a keycard to go up to the Suites.\n\nDuring the check-in process, there was no acknowledgement of status nor my 2 bottles of water... \n\nThe Suite itself was spacious by NYC standards at 300+ sq feet. The bathroom was functional, although it could have used some deep cleaning at the bottom of the shower stall along with the baseboards... Water pressure was good. A handheld shower would have been good too.\n\nThe mattress was on the softer side and was the lower end Bonnell spring where the entire mattress moves when one side of the mattress has motion. The sheets were comfortable though. The light comforter was sandwiched in between two flat sheets, which was interesting...\n\nThe filter in the HVAC could be replaced as it was full of caked on dust... The A\/C worked well though.\n\nThe kitchen and closet doors needed some TLC as both the hinges and handles were pretty loose...\n\nAs others had mentioned, the Suite was pretty well insulated from the outside street noise. However, the fridge was pretty noisy at night, along with the front door slamming from the other suites on my floor...bummer.\n\nHousekeeping was by request and they did a good job taking out the trash, replacing towels, and refilling toiletries.\n\nThe kitchenette was fully stock with crockery although it was odd that there was only one pack of dishwashing detergent. There was manual dish washing liquid but no sponge to manually do dishes?!?\n\nThere was a cart that was placed on my floor every morning with additional cups and coffee which was interesting. The cart disappeared by the afternoon daily.\n\nThere is a coin laundry in the basement along with an internet cafe and gym as well.\n\nBreakfast was complimentary and changed daily with both hot and cold items. There were poly gloves available to wear when touching the communal utensils. Staff wore uniforms, name tags, and some even wore gloves.\n\nWiFi worked well and needed reauthorization every day or so. TV had numerous Business channels which was helpful to keep up with the markets.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

It contained an eclectic mix of items including tweezers, clippers, a waterproof phone case, a battery charger pack, some phone cables and a few other bits. I left it hanging from a door handle because the room was quite cluttered and I wanted to make sure it stayed readily in sight.\n\nThe cleaner took the bag, and threw it away.\n\nIt was nowhere near the garbage bin. It was not on the floor. It did not contain rubbish.\n\nI spoke to the hotel staff about this issue three times and their response was absolutely abysmal. There was no apology. There was no effort to replace or compensate me for the items. One young man working on the front desk essentially told me I was lying. The hotel's general manager, Jonathan Lomitola, was apparently told but made no effort to contact me.\n\nI have travelled a fair bit, and no hotel staff member has ever stolen my property before. But - more importantly - I have never seen such a shockingly awful response from a hotel in terms of customer service. \n\nStay somewhere else. There are plenty of other options where hotel staff will not steal and then destroy your property.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

I was traveling with my children and it was very sad they had to see all of that. \nA person asked for a dollar and when we said no screamed on my husbands face. A person also got into the hotel and the front desk had to kick them out. The person then starts yelling fowl language at the worker. Really great for your kids to watch!

The room was quite clean and aside from some wear on the wallpaper there wasn't any real issues and the blackout curtain actually covered the entirety of the window (which was very pivotal given that at the previous hotel I had stayed at this was most certainly not the case). We were also given free water and chips. The only major problem with the room was that the sink for the kitchenette was very narrow, so water kept splashing onto the counter.\n\nThe bathroom was, similar to the room, fairly small and was clean aside from some slight mould growth in the caulking near the shower door. The shower also actually had good pressure, which was something that had been lacking for most of my trip. The faucet for the sink was positioned weirdly, so the water flow had to be controlled in order to prevent it from spraying onto the countertops and there was also limited space in the vanity area to store toiletries.\n\nBreakfast in the morning was among the best I've had at any establishment and the highlight of the hotel. There were four hot options which rotated on a daily basis so there was always something different on consecutive days. The usual breads and cereals were available as well as four different types of juices, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs. Another nice addition was the 24 hour free hot chocolate, coffee, and tea in the lobby.\n\nWhile the room didn't quite live up to my expectation mostly due to the size, the cleanliness was actually a fair bit better than the other hotels I had stayed at during my trip and while the hotel wasn't extremely cheap relative to other hotels, the immense breakfast selection holds a lot of value and with very good housekeeping standards, it outweighs the room not quite matching up to a Homewood Suites standard.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

The location is just unbeatable because we could walk to almost everything we wanted to see, Broadway shows, Macy's, Penn Station, etc. For anything further away, the subway stations were so close. The staff is exceptional -- reception was unerringly kind, the food service people were always polite to us, AT came to make sure we were happy with our stay. There were five of us and we stayed in two rooms. My large 15 year old son slept happily on the sofa bed, which I was worried about beforehand, but it was no problem. It was awesome to have the large fridge and free breakfast every morning. We had the premium King rooms, which I think were mostly worth it for the excellent premium wifi. The free snacks mean that you're allowed to choose $10 worth of snacks per room from the little store in the hotel (items are way overpriced) but my kids loved doing that every day. When we left, we had a ton of suitcases, which the staff kept for us until we came back to pick them up. The only thing was I wished we didn't have to tell reception that we wanted our rooms cleaned, though the kind receptionist did write it down for the duration of our stay so I didn't need to go back to mention it every day. It was definitely worth it for us to stay here and we'll absolutely choose this place again next time.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

For the flight. Booking this late meant we did not get the best price available. \nThere were three adults in our party, and we were looking for a suite rather than a hotel room and this property fitted the bill. \nWe took a yellow cab from JFK  , and just over an hour later we had arrived at the property. As it was before 3.30pm we could not check straight in, but the hotel stored our cases for us leaving us free to go off and have some lunch. \nWe then checked in a while later, this  was easy and quick. The suite was large with a good size kitchen area, large fridge, 2 ring cooker, and microwave. There was also a dishwasher. \nThe bathroom was large and had disabled facilities.

We varied our times but every day was the same. On the last day we collected the food and took it back to our suite, this was a good option. \nThe hotel is in a good location, walking distance to Central Park was about an hour.

I've stayed in NYC many times and paid a lot more for less.  I will stay here again. My breakdown:\n\nStaff: They were always present and always helpful. The hotel is packed (a sign of its success) and these people work very hard. Omar and Idris, behind the front desk, in particular were so awesome. I cannot speak too highly of them. They often seemed to be everywhere, taking care of so many things.\n\nRoom: Yes, it is a smaller room. But by NYC standards, *not* small. I had a King with a sofa and was very pleased. (I was traveling alone for business but there is room for two people as well.) The bed was extremely comfortable... one of the best hotel beds I've had in a while. The small kitchen is such a plus, particularly for a long stay. \n\nAmenities: The laundry room in the basement is a huge plus. (There is also a good dry cleaners right next door.) The gym is nothing fancy but is nice sized for NYC and has what you need to get in a good workout. The breakfast is much better than average. They seem to work hard to vary it day to day, and every day oatmeal and bagels and fruit, etc, are present along with hot items. Coffee is 24\/7 in the lobby as well.\n\nYes the hotel can be very busy and the lobby crowded... they've been sold out the entire time I've been here. I believe it is indicative of how good the hotel is. The elevators can be packed, yes. These older buildings have small elevators, that's NYC. But each floor does have lights indicating where the elevators are. And if you know how to manage elevators (ride up first so they don't fill up before they get to you on the way down; stay on a low floor so you can walk; avoid prime time, etc) you will be fine. \n\nThe hotel is a great location \u2026 very easy walk to Times Square, The High Line, etc etc\u2026 It\u2019s a winner.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":5040757,"title":"Good hotel with select amazing staff","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-03-27","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"My family and I stayed here for an extended weekend as a short getaway.  Our room was clean, but quite small.  We had a king efficiency studio with \"twin\" sofa bed.  My children sleep on a twin bed at home, and I must say this was sub-twin size at best.  On the other hand, the king bed was very comfortable and adequately sized.  \nOur flight came in early and we did end up having to wait until close to 4pm (the \"official\" check in time) to get a room.  The front desk staff kindly kept watch over our luggage and even gave my children a bag of chips to help hold over their hunger.  However, we still had to busy ourselves and find a real meal , as we waited nearly 4 hours before any rooms were available.  I can't say that I have experienced this many times with any hotel chain I have ever stayed with.  Arriving early is usually not a problem, but I could see that one front desk staff in particular was trying very hard to accommodate us as best as she could (kudos to Rochelle!).  \n\nThe first morning we were here, breakfast was well stocked and had ample variety of hot items (including eggs, potatoes, pancakes, beef, etc), pastries, cereal, yogurt, and a great variety of fresh fruit.  However, the second day was very disappointing.  I came out to eat around 9:40 (breakfast isn't over until 10:30) to find almost no pastries, none of the fruit medley, no bananas, and many other items quickly vanishing and not to be replenished.  As a person on a plant based diet, a variety of fresh produce is essential.  However, the cafeteria workers (like Lizbeth) explained the situation and seemed equally frustrated with being unable to meet the needs of the guests.  Lizbeth directed me to whom I should address my concerns. I went to front office and was met with EXEMPLARY customer service from Rochelle.  She was aware of my health issues and dietary needs and went above and beyond the call to go to a nearby store to purchase some fresh fruit and additional food items for me.  This level of customer care and hospitality is rare and should be commended!  Employees like Rochelle are an asset to the Hilton brand!  Rather than excuses and empty apologies, she affirmatively took steps to rectify the situation.  Rochelle's concern and actions are the epitome of customer service.   \nWhile there were some minor cosmetic issues with the room (peeling wall paper in the bathroom, touch up paint needed) that I felt could be better, this was an overall pleasant stay.  The hotel is walking distance to many shops, restaurants and NYC hot spots.  But the amazing staff, especially Rochelle at the front desk, is what sets it apart! We would definitely come back again.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

This was the weekend of the huge east coast snowstorm. The Friday morning of January 28th my meeting was cancelled due to the huge snowstorm. I immediately called the hotel to cancel and spoke with both the operations manager, Nick, as well as the hotel manager, John. They offered a 50% return of my money because it was the day of arrival. I tried to explain that the storm is currently in progress, my meeting was canceled because of the storm and there is no reason for me to travel up I95 from Pennsylvania in the storm. Needless to say, both were quite smug and stated they needed to defer their costs and they would not issue a full refund. As a decades long Hilton Honors member, AMEX Hilton cardholder, and customer, it is amazing that this hotel can't see the forest for the trees. Additionally, if you try to contact Hilton themselves, you can't get any satisfaction. They refer you to Guest Assistance and EVERY agent you get is from far outside of the United States. All they do is call the hotel, get the same answers, and then after putting you on hold for 45 minutes, tell you there is nothing they can do. If you ask to speak to somebody in corporate, they tell you that they are the highest level that the public can access. Hilton has lost my business forever. There are so many great choices for other hotels in Manhattan and around the world.

When I called back Monday to talk with the Advanced Purchase team on Monday, they said since I was calling on the date of the reservation there was nothing they could do.  \nThe Hilton rep said they were open for calls on Sat\/Sun even though the front desk rep had told me they weren't.\nIt's very frustrating.  I bought a $672 ticket, and Hilton was unwilling to make any concessions (not even a credit for a future stay) for a situation that was outside of my control.  This is not the Hilton experience I've come to expect!","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Lots of homeless out front and staff that does not seem to care.  We had to file multiple complaints with the front desk because of all the noise the cleaning crew was making at all hours of the day AND night.  Constant banging because they would clean with the door security lock in place and every time they went into the room which was 20 to 30 times per room you would hear loud banging noises as the door would slam shut.  There was also constant yelling in the hallways, and if you wanted to walk to your room you would have to walk over piles of used towels and bed linens which were stacked in the hallways. Not exactly sanitary in the Covid era.\nWhen we complained to the front desk, they tried to put the blame on other guests for the loud noise but we could clearly see who was making the noise. Finally after two days of this, I asked to speak to the manager however the front desk claims no manager was working. It got so bad that we finally decided we had to leave the hotel which was a first ever for our family.    When we tried to check out, the front desk got aggressive and told us we would be charged for an early departure fee even though we didn\u2019t stay the night.  Again we asked to speak to the manager and they said he left for the day and was not taking any phone calls even though the front desk agent kept going to the back office to talk to him by phone.  The front desk agent informed me after speaking with the unavailable manager that any issues with billing needed to be addressed with the manager, again who left for the day and would not take our call. Whoever heard of a major hotel chain not having a manager on site?!? If that\u2019s the case, they clearly do not caring how the hotel is being run or if a customer was checking out because of numerous issues.  We ended up being charge $420+ for a \u2018leaving early cancellation fee\u2019. Absolutely ridiculous. Avoid at all cost if you value sleep and safety.

They were modern and clean and had everything you would need to cook a meal for 4. Nice large fridge and microwave, and even a dishwasher. A large flatscreen TV on an articulating wall bracket was a nice touch.\nThe 22nd floor terrace had 2 seating areas and decent views of the city.\nNow Breakfast time!!\nLizbeth was soooo sweet and attentive with so many people that I have to give her credit. She showed a lot a patience even when I thought I might not have. My wife had not had potassium in at least 3 days so I asked Lizbeth for a banana after breakfast hours and she got it for me in seconds. I asked her for her name and the chefs name because I had to leave a nice review for her..\nChef Azsa made this egg, potato, onion and cheese souffl\u00e9 that was out of this world.

Nick, who is apparently their Director of Operations was rude and unprofessional.  In all my years as a Hilton Honors member I have never encountered such treatment.

However, we know the hotel can\u2019t control homelessness in our country. What they can control, however- is the cleanliness of their bathrooms and towels- both of which had many hairs that were definitely and obviously not anyone in our family\u2019s. This led us to be cautious about the cleanliness of the bedding and wondering about other supposed cleaning protocols. Overall- this was a fine stay for a later booking on our end.
