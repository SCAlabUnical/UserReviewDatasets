Doris with guest relations reached out to me 2 weeks prior to our arrival and kept in touch up to and throughout our stay.  YES! This is what hotels are meant to be:). I explained what the trip was for and she did everything possible to make it extra special.  She got us rooms near by and even gave them an upgrade with an amazing view. They even sent a lovely bottle of wine to my father in laws room with a birthday note!  The location of the hotel is great as well.  You can walk across a small walkway and enter into BROOKFIELD place.  It is a great high end shopping area.  Even better it has underground access to the WTC train station that can literally get you anywhere.  ALL UNDER GROUND:). The trip was so perfect I had to seek out a manager before we left and thank them.  All the staff were excellent.  The bar. Front desk.  Bellmen. Valet.  On and on.  Just stay here:).

If you want something a little more involving, then Central Park and 5th Avenue are only 20mins away on the subway (closest station is WTC some 3 blocks from the hotel).

With so many hotel choices, we can honestly say that we couldn\u2019t have picked better! We got to the hotel late in the evening and our first impression of the hotel was very good.  We were checked in quickly, by a friendly member of staff and went straight up to our room on the 10th floor.  \nWe had two deluxe king size suites which were spacious, clean and comfortable.  Plenty of complimentary, good quality toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body cream, cotton pads, cotton buds, shower cap, soap).  There is also a coffee machine with pods (replaced daily) coffee mate, sugar etc which was very good and welcome and a filtered water machine with a complimentary Conrad water bottle.  We had read on other reviews about the fridge sensors and checked with reception about additional costs and made sure we didn\u2019t touch the fridge! Snacks were available but expensive (a box of almonds or cookies were $15).\nThe room was very comfortable, plenty of storage space, with separate lounge area, bedroom (with sliding doors to separate both the bedroom and lounge) toilet\/bathroom and large walk in shower. \nWe felt very safe here, the hotel is in a quiet area across from the Hudson River with a view from the river of the Statue of Liberty and not far from the 9\/11 memorial pools and museum. Whilst there is a restaurant in the hotel (we only used for takeaway once, but pizza was very good and staff friendly), there is also a shopping centre opposite the hotel which has plenty of places to eat and drink as well as a fabulous bagel shop underneath the hotel.  \nStaff were very friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  Transport, by either bus or subway are relatively easy once you get used to it but it was lovely to leave the hustle and bustle of Midtown and stay in a quieter area of New York.  \nWe will definitely return to New York and without a doubt will stay at the Conrad New York Downtown and would highly recommend.

I have Hilton Lifetime Diamond status and have 173 nights in hotels this year so when I rate this as one of the best stays I have had anywhere in the world, I think I am reasonably qualified to judge.  The rooms are infact all Suites which is a rarity in a City centre hotel so you can enjoy more of a living space rather than just a bedroom.   It's a big hotel but never felt too busy or full which is a great trick to pull off.  The staff without exception were superb from the Concierge,  bar staff next to the Restaurant or in Loopy Doopy and the Bell boys or Reception.  Nothing was too much trouble and was done promptly without fuss.  The location for us was perfect as it was surprisingly quiet and across the road from Boundary Park with lovely walks along the Hudson in both directions.  Exit the back of the hotel and you have the Brookfield upmarket Mall which goes through to Occulas where the 9\/11 memorials are or you can jump on the subway to anywhere else.  I would urge anyone to try the ferry service as a change to the subway and with a Terminal a couple of hundred metres from the hotel I strongly recommend the Brooklyn trip\nIn summary a great hotel with great staff in a brilliant Manhattan location.  \n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I booked an accessible room at the downtown Conrad Hilton.  I read a lot of reviews for both the downtown and midtown NY Hilton Conrad. I picked the downtown Hilton Conrad because a lot of reviews complimented the staff. The staff was very smiley and friendly. We were able to check in about 45 minutes early on Sunday, November 19th. We were assigned to room 1407. No one from the staff accompanied us to the room. I don't know if this is part of new protocols since  the  covid epidemic. But it was not smart to send 2 disabled people alone to a dark room.  It was also not smart to have a table right near the entrance door of the room. Since the room was dark, my husband did not see the table and tripped over it .Maybe the room should be redesigned  , since the room is supposed to be an accessible room. He landed on the floor and couldn't get up. Luckily, a staff member came with our mini fridge and was able to help lift my husband from the floor. The security staff did call twice to check up on my husband's health. This was not the best way to start our stay. My husband's reaction was I want to go HOME! I persuaded him to stay.  The following items need improvement: 1) It makes no sense that the accessible room we were assigned was located very far from the elevators. Why?? 2) The closets in the accessible room were both geared to a person in a wheelchair. There was no place to hang coats or longer dresses. The room description never mentioned this.  3) The sink in the bathroom was cracked and looked very old. 4) The beds were very uncomfortable. The mattresses seemed very old and it felt like a foam topper had been put on top of them. The foam did not help enough. I actually  had to put a pillow under my body to help me sleep on the uncomfortable mattress. My husband also complained about back pain from the mattress. 5) Since no one went up with us to the room, no none actually showed us how to use the digital room card on the elevator. We wasted time stuck in the elevator because no one had shown us how to swipe the digital card . I noticed in the closet that the hotel was offering a free shoe shine but again no one told us about this offer in time to avail ourselves of it. 6) Since this is considered a luxury hotel, you probably should upgrade the bathroom toilet  paper to a softer version.  As a Hilton diamond member, I usually stay at the Waldorf in Israel. I have also stayed at the Conrad Hilton in Washington DC. The NY Downtown Hilton Conrad was disappointing. There are many areas for improvement. ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

You can also buy them. 3rd of all, the toiletries are worldcat with scents that please and don't overwhelm you. We were in NYC for only 3 days. I booked a trip for my french brother-in-law and his wife, who had never been to NY before. I wanted to avoid the Times Square\/Mid-Town area as I was told by friends that Times Square and mid-town areas had returned to the homeless drug invested hole they were when I lived in NYC in the early 90's.  I am really glad I chose the Conrad Downtown. Architeturally, it is stunning. The lobby is a modern, cavernous, chic, soothing lightshow with an adjacent, elegant bar\/restaurant. You will think you stepped into a movie set of future world. The hotel staff is as professional as you can ask for and incredibly helpful. The place is immaculate! The rooms are cleaner than that! I've stayed in 5 Star hotels that weren't as clean and their so-called 5-Star staff did not perform any where near the level of the Downtown Conrad. This hotel is the epitomy of how to run a worldclass hotel. They have valet parking or you can park your car yourself in the same lot about a 3 minute walk from the hotel. When I lived in NYC, there was nothing but empty office buildings in the Financial District. Today, it has families, playgounds, parks, bars, restaurants and is clean and safe... safe... safe! The hotel rooms were modern and featured all new modern Lutron contactless switches. The room was so clean, I fel like it had just been renovated and I was the first to occupy it. Kudos the cleaning staff. The bathroom and showers were separate and had heavy glass doors. The showerheads featured rain head waterfalls. The fridge was completely stocked. There was a Nepresso machine and various coffe tabs. There were two tvs, one one in the entry alcove and one in the bedroom. There was a sliding glass door that separated the bedroom from the rest of the room such that, if one person wanted to sleep and the other stay up and watch tv, one could do so without disturbing the other.  If you think the Conrad is too far from the mid-town or uptown action, think again. Not only did we tour Wall Street, the Battery and the entire financial district but we were a stones throw cab ride away from the Meat Packing Distirct, Chelsea, The Village, Soho, Little Italy, Chinatown, the Brooklyn Bridge. We also toured the Upper Westside, did the Museum of Nat History, The Hayden Planetarium, took a tuk-tuk tour ride across Central Park (a must do) to 5th Avenue and the Eastside, saw the Guggenheim french exhibition, The Plaza Hotel, Rock Center, Times Square etc. Ate in Little Korea and went to the top of the World Trade Center just before they closed at 7 pm to get a stunning view of NJ, Brooklyn, Queens and Uptown lit up like a carpet of Christmas Trees. Breathtakingly beauitful. I highly, highly recommend the Conrad Downtown both as a hotel and a location. We safely walked everywhere at night in the area without fear, threat or people sleeping on streets. One of the very best NYC trip experiences ever.

We ate outside at P.J. Clarke\u2019s to watch the beautiful sunset over the Hudson River.  The food, drinks and service were wonderful there.  When we returned back to the hotel, being my birthday, a bottle of wine and beautiful spider cake (head with eyes, body and 8 legs) were delivered to our room.

I chose the Conrad downtown because of the room size, amenities, star rating and location. After our stay, I can assure you, everything checked the boxes! \nLocation: the hotel is 5 mins from the ferry, 12 mins. from Statue of Liberty\/Battery Park and a 5-7 min walk to the subway. We never rode the bus, but I know the pick up locations and right by the hotel. It was nice to be away from the loud hustle of the city, yet only a 15 min. subway ride anywhere we needed to be.\nRestaurants: there are so many options around the hotel, but I think one of our favorite dinners was at the hotel restaurant. 5-star food and service. The bartender personally stopped by our table and discussed their signature Manhattan drink when I posed a question to our server. Very personal touch all around at this hotel. The kids meal options were loved by our kids, especially the spaghetti & meatballs! \nRoom: when you search other hotels, very few have the square footage size that the Conrad has to offer without paying hundreds of dollars more per night. This room has everything we expected and MORE. The metal refillable water bottles were such a great touch as you go through lots of water walking around the city. The bathroom was a great size for more than 1 person to be getting ready at one time. I loved the bar area in between the living room and bedroom. There are sliding doors that can be closed for privacy too. We had a double bed room and decided to take advantage of the pull out couch for extra sleeping space for the kids. \nHousekeeping was extremely attentive, always smiled and greeted us in the hallways. They provided new towels as needed, restocked our coffee bar daily and even brought us fresh ice! One day it was scheduled to rain and the doorman offered us an extra umbrella for our family. The staff always went above and beyond for our family. It didn\u2019t go unnoticed. \nI can\u2019t recommend this hotel enough!","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We also have stayed at this location in 2019 and it was good then. This was our first time back to NYC since the pandemic, so we were looking forward to our return stay at Conrad!\n\nWe booked a room with a sofa bed (costs a little more than just a plain sofa) which said we could request the bed be made up in advance. We put that request into the reservation, but when we arrived at the hotel it had not happened. The front desk said they would notify housekeeping right away, and we left for the theater. Before we came back, we phoned to make sure it had been done and were told by guest services that they would notify housekeeping again. Yet when we arrived it still hadn't been done. We phoned again and a very nice man was sent, but he had been told to put away the sofa bed, and had no linens with him. He came back some minutes later, and again, very nicely took care of it, but due to the earlier lack of service we didn't have the sofa bed operational until past midnight. So much for the excellent customer service which our previous experiences with Conrad led me to expect!\n\nAnother issue was that when we checked in we saw that our room had a DOG BED in it, along with dog food bowls. EW!  Quite gross, if you're not a dog person. In fact, a member of our party had dog allergies, so we asked for that to be removed as well. Again, this took multiple requests before it happened. They said it had been left there mistakenly, but in that case, you'd think they would hasten to remove it. \n\nAnother thing which is just a caveat for other guests, the hotel has no food available, even room service, after 10:00 pm. So much for grabbing the first cab back from the theater, and getting dinner there. The immediate area is kind of a wasteland after 10, so it looked like we were going to be stuck dining on the $10 Snickers in the minibar, and it wasn't even 11 pm. If you find the idea of their rooftop bar enticing, sorry, it wasn't open, and we were there on a Saturday night in late June, so I don't know if it is closed for good. However, the guest service guys saved the day for us by telling my husband about a 24 hr grocery store some blocks away, which had an all-night short order cook.  We found it a little surprising that a hotel charging $500 per night has no room service after, 10 pm, so be warned! \n\nSo... a mixed review... 2 thumbs up for nice man who finally made our sofabed and got rid of the dog supplies, and for guest service guy who told us about the all night grocery. But thumbs down for general hotel customer service, sorry to say. ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It\u2019s a breathtaking walk to check in.\n\nThe Conrad provides reusable bottles and in room filters instead of throw away plastic.

Great pillows.\n\nBreakfast at the Conrad\u2019s main restaurant, Atrio, was terrific and priced accordingly. Unlike the Conrad MIdtown, there is no buffet option, everything is ala carte.. HHonors Gold and Diamond members get a $25 per person dining credit that won\u2019t cover breakfast, but  we did have Superb bacon and a great pot of coffee.\n\nThe staff at the CNYD is uniformly wonderful. Everyone was courteous and present. There was one server at breakfast that was clearly having a hard morning, but they were still professional and swift. \n\nParticular props to Richard at the front desk who is always as kind as he can be while maintaining an entirely professional demeanor. \n\nThis is a five star hotel in one of the most expensive cities in the world and it\u2019s priced accordingly. It\u2019s a great use of HHonors points or a free night certificate, but even if you\u2019re paying full price out of pocket, you can expect an experience that\u2019s a cut above.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":208452,"title":"The Conrad remains outstanding, never fails to surpass my expectations...","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-05-08","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Although I can only speak to the pricier rooms\/suites (well, all rooms are suites), the Conrad Hotel is worth writing about as the neighborhood (my neighborhood) changes and downtown NYC generally splits into a sea of budget vertical motels dotted with the occasional oasis reserved for the superrich. The Conrad occupies an amazing sweet spot. It may be the best overall hotel in Lower Manhattan.\n\nSince Hilton (under their Conrad brand) took over the property a dozen years ago, it has been exquisitely upgraded and properly maintained. The rooms are designed in a very contemporary mix of sumptuous materials (dark woods, mirrors), light-palette Scandi hardwood floors, rugs, and window treatments, plus the marble and brass lamps and tables West Elm has trained us to expect everywhere. The result is almost perfectly fancy-utilitarian and shows how committed Hilton is to keeping their Conrad looking great in between renovations. \n\nAll electronics (TVs, light\/room controls) are top-notch. Room service--a disappearing art--is fast and good. The mini bar (another disappearing act in many hotels) is excellently provisioned. Bed, linens, pillows (I'm fussy) are very, very good.\n\nCaveat: I like the river view suites just fine for an overnight; the stunning view does much of the heavy lifting. However, it is only at the \"executive\" and especially \"luxury\" suite level that the room design shines and the fancy feel really kicks in. But regardless of room type, I've saved the best for last...\n\nThe Conrad is an atrium-style hotel building, but OMG what an atrium!!! Not only is it huge and gorgeously designed and appointed, with a sexy, lounge-y lobby restaurant, a discreet deep-wood modern reception area with white-glove service to match, but the whole 15-story space is dominated by a massive Sol LeWitt wall painting (called \"Loopy Doopy,\" as is the rooftop bar). Other artwork abounds, including an impressive selection of editions by Mangold (Robert), Peyton, Dine, Schnabel, etc.; be sure to wander near the conference\/ballroom area. Simply put, the Conrad's atrium is a sight worth seeing all on its own. I never tire of it, and I'm there >10 times a year (my local movie theater is in the same building).\n\nTL;DR: The Conrad is secretly a luxury hotel! Between the location, customer experience (atrium, art, and top-flight staff -- special thanks to Elliot), the Conrad is hard to beat. Add in that every room is a suite and some of those are genuinely luxurious (all are excellent) and it is easy to argue that time and money spent at the Conrad is time and money well spent and a bargain at that. A $500 night at the Conrad is in every way the equal of a $1300 standard room at the nearby fancy\/boring rhymes-with \"poor reasons\" and a $1000 night at the lovely\/pricey\/noisy rhymes-with \"meekman.\" If you can, splurge for the luxury corner which is big enough for a family to live in (1.5 baths!). It would cost 2-3x more at the previously mentioned hotels. Of course, the area has dozens of cheaper options, but the pandemic chased the big players away and properties are being run in pop-up style by unknown companies with troubling features like 6pm check-in\/10am checkout and snaking lines of grumpy customers.\n\nFive stars for the Conrad for never making me wait, never minding a late checkout, and somehow always outdoing themselves. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Given all the glowing reviews, we had such high hopes for the hotel. What we got was a big disappointment. The night we arrived, there was no one by the front door. No security, no doorman. I only knew we were at the right place because of the signage, and the photos on the website. We took the escalator up with all our luggage, and checked in by the front desk. Polite service, not much else. That\u2019s fine \u2013 figured this is New York after all. Got to the room, everything was great. Even had chocolate-covered strawberries to welcome us! Place was clean, bed was comfortable. Shower was awesome! Slept well. Trouble started the next day. \n\nMy husband tried to log in to a business meeting from our room (525). No go. The only place we could find some signal is right by the door or outside in the hallway. We had better signal at the Conrad Maldives in the middle of the Indian Ocean! We called front desk. We were told to call Tech Support. Waited 30 minutes for Tech Support to come back and say one out of the two routers in the room was down, and they will call the hotel maintenance to restart the router. 2 hours later \u2013 nothing. Nobody came. We called front desk again -  they had no idea what we were talking about. Told us to call Tech Support again. Business conference was done, husband missed the meeting. We just gave up.\n\nTried to order room service to celebrate the new year in our room. Could not get through. Tried for an hour. Kid now really hungry. Finally went down to the restaurant (Atrio) to ask what was happening \u2013 turns out they were extremely short staffed, and orders were backed up like crazy. Manager was nice enough to give us some cheese, crackers and fruit (bless you). What a way to welcome 2023. \n\nI complained to the front desk when we checked out the next day. He said he was going to give me back 50,000 points, but more than a month later \u2013 nothing. Spent 180,000 points for 2 nights. Was planning to go back next summer.

Would have been great if he could have checked with the kitchen as it was dead on 10:30 when we sat down.

I am a Diamond Hilton member for years and have stayed in many hotels over the years both for personal and business. The rooms are very nice and the beds are comfortable. The only negative review I have is one of privacy and poor follow up. One evening my husband and I were in our room laying down after a long day in the city. All the sudden there was a quick knock on the door and someone entered our room without waiting for us to reply. After they heard us, they quickly closed the door. Then again about 20 minutes later, someone knocked on the door and then left themselves into our room. My husband got up and went out in the hall and saw two workers. When asked what they were doing they said they left a bag in a room and were looking for it. First of all, why would u come back to the room you had just entered as you know we were in the room. They didn\u2019t even allow us time to answer before just letting themselves in. We reported the incident to security and he investigated. Stated that they the employee had used bad judgement and guest services would follow up with us. We still have not heard anything from them to date. We felt an invasion of privacy and lack of respect in not allowing us to answer the door and then to come back again and just let yourself in the room you knew someone was in.

I have left a positive review previously.  \n\nPrior to arrival I was told I was Upgraded.   All suites are pretty much comparable besides the view.  My upgraded suite came with a side of hair and a very dirty toilet.  This was kind of awful.  So, as an optimist with experience I went down to the front desk and mentioned that it needed to be cleaned.  I was told if I did t mind downgrading I would be comfortable in my king suite on another floor.  Upon arrival this one came with a completely new odor, and a full commode.  Rather than call down again I surmised I would hold my nose and flush the toilet.  This was not the answer.  As it took a while till it cleared and the icing on the cake was that in the shower and bath there was literally long strands of black hair everywhere.  Again not up to standards.  \n\nI returned with pictures of the full commode and the shedding hair and was \u201cupgraded\u201d to a better view.  The view was lovely\u2014 however the chronic shedder had left their locks again throughout the room and there were glass rings on the night side tables.  At this point Goldilocks decided to stay put.  As my luggage had be delayed an I needed to return to the airport to retrieve it.  \n\nAfter a conversation with Adam via text whom assured me and Leblanc from housekeeping would call to speak with me.  No, an email exchange followed with Ms Leblanc.  I didn\u2019t return to my final room til after midnight with luggage in tow with nothing to eat as I had been playing musical rooms and room service and the restaurant close at 10pm.  So Goldilocks had no porridge.   Bound and determined to get some rest I wake up the next morning and take a shower.  Mind you my luggage was delayed my toiletries were mislayed and so the hotel provides them in the shower and bathroom.  Until you\u2019re wet and realize all the dispensers are empty.   \n\nThe text of the morning is from the front desk to rate your experience.   I explained the no toiletries and explained I wanted them refilled immediately.  This was at 10 am.  At 6pm nothing so I took the empty containers to the front desk and was assured they would be brought up.  That didn\u2019t happen.  In fact it was that when they were doing turn-downs that I got the attention a housekeeper to replenish the supplies.  \n\nI sent an email to Ms.  LeBlanc.  No response.  I sent a text to the hotel.   No response.  No communication.   I was \u201ciced out\u201d.  The next day I had eaten in the restaurant and life was uneventful.  Checking out they made 1\/2 of a room night\u2019s concession for all they put me through.  \n\nThe point is everyone has a bad day.  But three in a row.  Not so much.  Sorry this time you don\u2019t get a pass.  This hotel is typically lovely and exemplary in service.  They missed the mark on this stay and it was expensive.  Will he stay again or won\u2019t he\u2014 probably not again.  This was as I said a deciding factor.  \n\nIt was an opportunity for them to do better and they didn\u2019t.   They could have apologized upon checkout, they did not.  They could have made an adjustment that was indicative of the level of discomfort they made me to feel.  And so I say to Ms Leblanc and to Adam or whomever the MOD was that day.  You let a Diamond member down and a loyal customer is difficult to find.  So, at some point there are consequences.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":208452,"title":"THE Place to Be in Downtown","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-11-28","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"At this point, the Conrad is Downtown's quintessential hotel experience. It's located perfectly, in Battery Park City, just off the Hudson River, adjacent to the Financial Center\/Brookfield Place, and just across the street from the World Trade Center, so it's pretty much in the area of all of Downtown's prime attractions. \nAs for my personal experience...I was here in the spring of 2017, but my most recent visit in 2022 stood out to me much further than the previous one.\nWell, I got to New York from DC at around 10:30pm, and my relatives (who live in Queens) gave me a ride to the Conrad. The first thing to notice walking in is the grand, GRAND atrium lobby. It's all marble and beautiful steps and 15-story ceilings, with a gigantic purple mural and a skylight that looks up towards the Freedom Tower. The main lobby is one floor up from the entrance (seems to be a standard across Conrad hotels, as I don't recall visiting one where the lobby was just off the entrance), reachable by escalator. \nCheck in was smooth, and lasted just over a minute. After that, I was ushered up to my room, disappointingly a FLOOR above the lobby... but it was fine, because I had booked a river view suite and the view would have to be nice regardless. And that brings me to my next point: this is an all-suite hotel, which is fabulous to me.\nHowever, you shouldn't reserve a room at the Conrad expecting your normal suite layout. In fact, to me the layout was quite odd, but it wasn't even a bad thing, just a tad inconvenient if I weren't traveling solo (which, thank goodness, I was). The door to the suite opens straight into this living room\/den type setup, quite bare-boned honestly if you ask me, especially considering there are no windows in this part of the suite. I didn't really use this area during my stay. Then there's a marble hallway of sorts that divides the living room from the bedroom, and that's where the minibar cabinets are. Unfortunately, that hallway also leads straight into the shower stall, as well as the main bathroom space with the sink and toilet. So if you're traveling with company, you need to ensure to steer clear of that hallway when one of you takes a shower. The bedroom is the only room in the suite that gets actual natural light, which, considering the alternative, was quite appropriate to me.\nOther than the weird layout, I found the actual components of the suite to be amazing. The decor was minimalistic and Japanese-inspired, something I appreciate across all the hotels in Conrad's portfolio. The bed was among the most comfortable I've experienced. The view was great, from morning till night, with equally beautiful dawns and dusks on the Hudson River. The minibar was stocked--a rarity since COVID hit. There was a cool water filtration system in one of the hallway cabinets, though I only found out on the last day. I also appreciated that the hallway hosted a second sink. Oh, and the marble shower was like a spa. There's a frosted glass window inside to receive indirect natural light from the bedroom, and the rain-shower head fastened to the ceiling gave off perfect water pressure. The one lacking aspect here was a bathtub, but honestly most Conrad hotels don't offer bathtubs in the rooms, save for the most exclusive suites, so I wasn't really disappointed or anything.\nThe food at the hotel restaurant, ATRIO, is somewhat Mediterranean-inspired, and serves delicious food in a nice ambient setting just off the lobby. I believe I tried a nice pasta dish here, but what really wowed me was the dessert, a chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with orange. I ordered that every day until I left. Room service breakfast from the restaurant was nice, too, with a hearty American-style breakfast of toast, sausage, eggs and home-fries that left you full and satisfied. Oh, and the croissants are delicious too (especially the chocolate ones).\nIt's a shame that every time I seem to stay at the Conrad, the rooftop is closed for the season, so I never got to experience that, though it seems like such a nice place to be, with prime river and city views.\nThe hotel's staff were mostly pleasant, especially the folks over at room service. There were some people with a slightly sharp tongue on my last day before\/while checking out, but overall I was happy with the service here.\nOverall, for $500\/night, I'd say this is one of the nicest deals you can get in Downtown. Especially if you're someone that focuses on space, comfort, and relaxation. $500 for a five-star hotel in Manhattan is quite hard to find, honestly, so I'd say run with this place, and you won't regret it. (Granted, I've not stayed over at the Four Seasons, but after my experience here, I might not need to.)","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

After a long day all you want is an iced beverage and the last thing you want to do is hunt down an ice machine. Also, our room was cleaned each day and our bed was made not once but TWICE!!! We'd come back each night to a freshly made bed and cleaned room, and that bucket of ice! Literal perfection. I, also, appreciated their hours for their restaurant as they kept the breakfast open late even on the weekdays which was so nice for us traveling from Arizona and the time difference, as well as the dinner was open late so we could get a bite to eat after a long day.

I booked a deluxe suite with two double beds that was on the 14th floor. Here are some details about my stay:\n\nRoom: The room was so spacious! It had a living room with a sofa and table, a middle area with a bathroom and shower, and a bedroom with two beds and closets. The beds, linens, and pillows were comfortable. There was a connecting door in the living room that connected to the room next door. I thought this would be a problem but it wasn't.\n\nBathroom: The shower area was separated from the bathroom, which was where the sink and toilet were. There were two sliding doors that you could pull out to close off the bathroom\/shower area, but since this area was in the middle, they separated the bedroom from the living room. Both the shower and bathroom did have separate doors, but they were glass and didn't lock. I was just glad to have any type of door. I stayed in another NYC hotel before that didn't have anything to close off the shower area.\n\nNoise level: The hotel is pretty quiet inside and the neighborhood is also quiet. I did stay on the 14th floor so I'm not sure if you could hear noises from the lobby on the lower floors. I think I only heard one car horn from my room the whole week I was there. It's far enough away from the World Trade Center that you don't hear the tourists visiting that area.\n\nLocation: The hotel has a nice view of the Hudson river. The hotel is next to some office buildings and is across the street from Brookfield mall. When we arrived in NYC, it was around dinner time so it was nice to walk across to street to get dinner (you can also eat at the hotel restaurant if you prefer). There were a few restaurants still open at the mall at night. The hotel is also within walking distance of the World Trade Center, Seaport, and the surrounding areas downtown. There are no subway stations near the hotel. It's about a 10-minute walk to the nearest one. \n\nWiFi: The WiFi was free and the speed was pretty good. I was able to connect every day and it didn't lag, so that was good enough for me! \n\nExtras: During check-in, I requested a microwave and refrigerator and the hotel was able to accommodate my request. This was amazing because we purchased food that needed to be refrigerated and heated. The mini bar is full of drinks so you won't be able to use it to store personal items. I loved the water filter machine that comes with the room. I didn't have to buy water bottles every day since our room had filtered water to drink. \n\nCons: My only con would be the hotel phone. Usually, the phone buttons are self-explanatory but my room phone didn't work as I expected. There weren't instructions on what buttons to press to call out to different staff members, so I had to ask the front desk how to use the phone.\n\nCheck out: The day before we left, we checked with the front desk if we could check out late. Since they had other rooms available the day we checked out, we were able to check out at 1 pm.\n\nStaff: All the staff I came across were so helpful. From the bellman, front desk, and housekeeping, everyone was able to help us when we needed it.\n\nOverall, I had such an amazing stay at this hotel. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family and I hope to stay again!","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

There is a single work chair as well as an arm chair adjacent to the door.\nThe bedroom is simple with a wall unit including closet and modest amount of drawer space. Bathrobes and a pair of slippers are the usual expected items along with Conrad standard complimentary laundry and shoe bags along with stay with room brush and umbrella for those unpredictable rainy moments in NY. The bed is firm as well as the pillows. Comforter is Duvet style instead of the top and bottom sheet combo. It is warm and comfortable. Room temperature control is good.\nThe bathroom is an unusual arrangement with a completely separate toilet with a single vanity and a large, almost room-sized walk-in shower. There is no tub. The roof mounted rain shower head used to have a huge flow but is now fitted with a restrictor for water conservation but the water remains hot and plentiful. There is a separate handheld bar shaped head with individual control.\nThe bar area has added a rOcean brand water filtration system which is interesting. This is in lieu of bottled water which I believe, is still available at the gym at the 2nd floor main lobby. There is NO in room refrigerator. The space is occupied by a fully stocked chilled unit for purchases. Aside from the filtered water dispenser, the bar comes with a pair of coffee cups, regular and wine glasses. Nespresso coffee machine is standard.\nStaff is extremely attentive and courteous as expected and the facility retains its stunning central view over the Hudson with the Jersey high rises offering a lovely daytime as well as nighttime view.\nOverall a beautiful and high end hotel in lower Manhattan. Look for lower weekend rates because of its financial district location.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

My brother was visiting the US, and I was able to book three nights at the hotel and loved every moment of it! We are both very active, and were glad to be able to walk to most attractions in the area. We took walks along the Hudson, enjoyed the Parks in the area, and walked to the World Trade Center, 911 memorial, Brookfield Place, Statin island ferry port, the Financial District\/wall street, Brooklyn bridge, and Chinatown. The subway was about a 10 min walk from the hotel, very convenient if you need to get to Time Square, Broadway, Central park, etc. There were so many restaurants, cafes, and shops in the area. \n\nCheck-in was flawless! The Room was not ready as we arrived early, but we were able to use the food and beverage credit at the Artio restaurant, and shortly after, we were informed that the room was ready. The salmon at the restaurant was delicious. I am not a morning person, so I prefer to use the food and beverage credit for lunch and was not disappointed.\n\nWe were upgraded to a beautiful suite. Since my brother and I shared a room, we needed separate double  beds. I would have loved to be upgraded to a room facing the Hudson River but was informed that none of the double rooms face the Hudson. No worries, as the suite was spacious with a separate living area, TV ( 2nd TV in the bedroom), Nespresso machine, and a fancy water filter machine, so there was no need for bottled water. The complementary bottle of Prosecco was a nice treat. I absolutely loved the rain shower and separate toilet since I was sharing the suite. I also loved that we could communicate with the concierge via text message, and all needs were addressed. Rooms were cleaned daily unless you opted not to have housekeeping service. \n\nThe hotel has a gym, spa, a movie theatre, and a beautiful rooftop bar with views of the Hudson. Luggage was stored upon check out as we had planned to go to the US Open before heading home. Check-out was easy. \n\nOne of the best Conrad hotels I have stayed at.

The rooms are also great for this purpose as the layout offers privacy for the parents and great in-room amenities such as the water filter (all hotels should offer this!). The room is well appointed with awesome bedding, shower and amenities. The hotel has a modern clean design and smells great.

But if you want a calm oasis, this is the Conrad for you.  All rooms are suites.  Also each room have a water filter that dispenses drinking water on demand.  Tips:  would use the Diamond food credit on lunch\/dinner instead of breakfast.  Dinner and Lunch have better value dishes compared to the more expensive Breakfast (which is very odd).

With a excellent location just infront of the river and a mall and a subway station that brings to most of NYC, i enjoyed the location.\n The room condition was good but there were some slight dissapointments. The hotel was originally Embassy suites and have renovate and changed to conrad. While most parts are on the standard of conrad, I was able to observe points that might be seen in embassy suites, not conrad. But , it is not visible usually, it is a good property in downtown NYC. Other disappointment was check in and check out line, where guests needs to wait for some time. As hotel have quite empty space, I hope this review can be considered. Also, one last disappointment was that the restaurant was not on  expectation. The restaurant was not so recommendable in combination of taste and price. While there were no big lacking point for restaurant, the overall experience was not so great (except servers, they are not the ones to be blamed as they were fine)\n\nStill, this hotel provided me somewhat unique experience, where umbrella is prepared in the room, paperbag that can be utilized, and a water purifier that many travlers would enjoy. It is a small differences but I believe that differences decides the class of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

We are a family of 5, so it was important to book a room big enough so we all could fit in, and this is one of the very few hotels where every room is a suite.\n\nI called before booking to make sure of this, and Kimberly was so kind and wonderful over the phone and helped me to set up everything.\nI got a text message from Angelique on the day of our arrival, just to make sure if any accommodation was needed.\n\nNeedless to say that we were given an upgrade to a king suite (King size bed plus a sofa bed) with a Hudson River view. We were personally greeted by Kimberly on our arrival.\n\nNow here\u2019s a little big detail that set them apart right away from every hotel we have ever stayed in. They had arranged goodie bags for our kids, including a hand-drawn card by Darwin (front desk) written and signed by all of the employees. I\u2019ll upload a picture of this. That right there won me over.\n\nThe room was on the 15th floor impeccable. Filtered water for drinking, Nespresso with complimentary coffee. A sofa bed and a king bed. The shower was amazing, like truly amazing, and the view was unbeatable.\nWe ordered room service only one time (pizza), and it was pretty good. We had breakfast every day at Atrium (restaurant).\nI did not get the names of the host and servers, but they were warm and kind every single day. \nMy wife and I enjoyed the \u201cbowling green\u201d dish. (Bowl with quinoa, avocado, eggs, cherry tomatoes) delicious. The kids favorite of course was the chocolate chip pancakes. \nWe asked a couple of times for essentials (toothpaste, shaving kit) and it was sent right away to our room.\nWe went to the rooftop bar just to check it out and it was beautiful, a little small but cozy, more for adults than for families so we did not stay there for long or order anything, but I would say if it is a bunch of adults, definitely check it out. \n\nThere is a Shake Shack on the premises, and Italian restaurant that we did not try and a small convenience store (I think the name was Battery place market). There is a Mexican restaurant, that my wife tried and was good.\nIf you cross Vesey st (south of the building) you will see the Brookfield mall. There is an Amazon go store there and a Rite-Aid (kind of a cvs, walgreens store) where you can get snacks, medication, etc. I mention this because for families it\u2019s always good to know where you can find essentials or first aid supplies.  \n\nI hope someone from the hotel read this review, because I am so grateful with each and everyone at the hotel, you guys made a huge difference in our family vacation, and we can\u2019t just wait to go back. \n\nI will upload a video on the family youtube channel on how to get around the area, so everyone can see what a great location it is, and how easy it is to move around.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

The bathroom is a separate toilet room and the shower is very large, walk in and with multiple shower heads. You are given very soft and thick robes to wear.

The bed itself is a little low to the ground but you will sink right in because it\u2019s so comfortable. \nThe service is impeccable.

Check in was seemless. We were given a room on the 11th floor which was perfect. The room itself was vast, with a seating area, TV and desk leading into a hallway with a bar area (and a super cool water dispenser!), bathroom and seperate shower. Beyond the hallway was the bedroom. Rooms were ultra clean, super quiet (no street\/neighbouring room noise whatsoever, with sliding doors between each section) and very modern (tons of USB chargers, touch pad lighting controls and 2 big TVs).\n\nWe had breakfast each morning which was a real bonus. Food was really good but the thing that made it extra special was the F&B manager, Dena who greeted us each morning and was an absolute joy; full of smiles and so friendly. I was there to celebrate my birthday which we had mentioned to Dena one morning. The next day when we arrived for breakfast she greeted us with a birthday card which was so lovely. She also made us 2 Mimosas to celebrate! She was an absolute star!\n\nI've been very lucky to stay in some wonderful hotels around the world, but without hesitation this is right up there with the best of them for service and room quality.\n\nA final note on location. I was worried it might have been a bit out of the way of all the action being \"downtown\" but it was perfect. Well served by subways and it turned out to be a welcome relief to be able to get away from everything a little and not be caught up in the busyness of Manhatten 24-7.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend the Conrad Downtown. A great hotel and wonderful staff made our trip extremely memorable.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was Certainly amazed upon entering through the front entrance after the gracious bellhop took care of our luggage. This hotel is beautiful! I would Say one of the best hotels I\u2019ve ever stayed in and I\u2019ve been in quite a few. The hotel room is very modern. Everything in the room is controlled by a switch on the wall. The lights, tv, temperature, cleaning service, etc. You can also control a few of those that I mentioned on the TV in the bedroom as well. I love That the hotel room is a suite. If I\u2019m not mistaken, every room is a suite. So, your family could easily be accommodated comfortably. The living room has a pull out sofa and there are the moving doors you can use to close if privacy is needed. Big plus that the toilet and sink are separate from the shower. And the shower, omg\u2026AMAZING! It is a huge walk in shower and it is temperature controlled. Their is a rainfall shower and it has an option for a detached shower head to use as well at the same time. We had our daughter with us and she loved being able to set up her play area out in the living room and able to close the the doors. The subway is only a few blocks away. It took us about 10 minutes to walk to the subway. I love How the hotel is also within close walking distance to the location of the World Trade Center.

Most hotels in NYC are the size of a closet and you have to \"go outside to change your mind.\" Not here - you have a real room with real amenities.\n\nPros:\n- The staff treat you like they care from the moment you arrive, greeting you\nby name (how?) and taking your bags up to your room.\n- No one seems to busy to smile and say hello.\n- Extremely comfortable bed with clean, soft fluffy pillows and blanket.\n- No skimping on amenities like some hotels these days - they provide nice soap, shampoo, conditioner, skin lotion, mouthwash, and tons of towels.  \nEverything was replenished mid-day.\n- Great consistent hot shower.\n- Mini-bar + refrigerator for your stuff.\n- Coffee machine (pod-based), AND filtered water with complimentary bottles.\n(replenished daily).\n- Your needs are anticipated!  We ordered room-service breakfast for one, but knowing we were a couple they provided cups and plates (and coffee) for two without asking or charging us.  \n- No skimping on the room service - everything was fresh, full, and wonderful.\n- They don't \"nickle and dime\" you for every little thing.  Free newspaper delivery!\n- Room cleaning service daily! No signs about \"we only service room on request\" to \"save the environment\" (actually money).\n- Control all lights from each room including a master off switch at the door.\n-Ample closet and dresser drawer space.\n- Nice wide flat screen HDTV with cable channels.\n- Great food everywhere including the bagel place just outside the back.\n-Great NYC pizza close by too.\n\n*** Not sure if all the amenities mentioned are available in all rooms.\nWe stayed in a 750 square foot luxury suite.\n\nCons:\n- Some might not like the location as being a little from major sites uptown, but \nwe love this area with the new WTC, Oculus, Hudson River, and Trinity Church.\nSee actual part of the Berlin Wall and Statue of Liberty from the Hudson.\n\nDon't bother going to any other hotel.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

They are practicing safety protocols without compromising service. The hotel is gorgeous in its own right. Beautifully decorated for the season. The front desk was super courteous, the cleaning staff and bell hops were also great. We stayed in the 6th floor, with a room without a view and away from the elevators but the perk of this is how quiet it is! If you want to feel like you have the whole place to yourself you won\u2019t mind not having a river view or proximity to the elevators. We stayed in a double bedroom which included a full size sofa bed. The beds were firm but comfortable, the pillows were so nice! The room we stayed in was disabled accessible so the shower doesn\u2019t include a tub, you may need to place some towels on the floor to prevent from slipping. The room has a very cool water dispenser. Location wise there are two subway stations just 3\/4 blocks away from the hotel. Chambers St. and WTC\/Cortlandt station. There\u2019s a Regal Cinema in the hotel! A great option for an evening activity or rainy day. We watched the new Spider-Man movie. There are several food options around the hotel.

All of our issues were with the hotel staff and service, for which we expected more from a hotel of this caliber.  \n\nUpon entering our room, we immediately noticed we had no luggage stands and the mini-fridge was locked shut.  Upon calling the front desk, we were told they would send someone up right away with the luggage stands and a complimentary mini-fridge, as we were told we could not store personal items in the \"cash\" mini-fridge.  After one hour, nobody had showed up.  We were waiting for these items to unpack and get settled.  It took another 4 calls and another 1\/2 hour before the issue was resolved.  We were told numerous times the items were on the way (thus the reason for so many calls when nobody showed up after 5 or 10 minutes), the manager was personally delivering it to us, etc.  All were untrue.  \n\nNext, as we were finally getting settled, we noticed the filtered water machine in the room was not operating.

In the meantime, we asked, and were provided, bottles of water so that we would have drinkable water in the room. Needless to say, the filtered water system was never repaired during our stay.\n\nDuring out entire stay, we had no operable internet.  We are Diamond status and entitled to the \"preferred\" internet.  The internet clocked in a 10MB per second at its best and, at many times was much worse.  Pages would error out before loading. \n It was just useless and frustrating.  Due to our prior, frustrating experiences with management and the front desk, we did not report the issue and continued to use cellular which had its own limitations due to a weak signal in our room.  Finally, our last morning at the hotel, we heard repeated tapping upstairs starting as early as 7 a.m., as we guess some repairs were being made elsewhere.\n\nFinally, we found the staff to be cold and aloof.  If we did not say hello first when passing by, nobody would.  We had just come from a 6-night stay at the Marriott Vacation Club in Midtown, where everyone was friendly, warm and personable.  It was like night and day between the two.  \n\nThis was to have been a \"pampered' end of the trip highlight before we headed back to the West Coast.  We greatly enjoyed the room decor etc., but the poor, non-existence service ruined this stay for us.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

We love the design, style, professional service and attention to detail.\n\nFor this stay, we enjoyed a River View King Suite which also included a view of the Irish Hunger Memorial (a touching and beautiful green space). The location of the hotel is adjacent to the Hudson River, Brookfield Place shopping center with ample dining and shopping while One World Trade Center is just across the street.\n\nThe suite is beautifully appointed and the design seems inspired, at least in part, by top luxury aviation and yachting interior designers. A very efficient and intentional use of space. Lots of little touches, right where you would expect them. The bar area with built in water filtration system were a great touch. The parlor and bedroom can be closed off with two sets of sliding privacy doors that bookend the bathroom, shower room and bar area which are located in the middle of the suite. The colors and textures are classically elegant and very comfortable.\n\nOf particular note is the consistently exceptional quality of the bedding, mattress and overall sleep experience at Conrad Hotels and this property was absolutely on par.\n\nThe lobby and atrium are, like the Washington, D.C. property, a work of art in them selves. The Atrio bar and restaurant are located there and offered a fresh and elegant take on a great pizza, super-juicy burger and plump honey wings.\n\nAs a Hilton Diamond member, I appreciate that the staff at Conrad Hotels just \u201cget it\u201d. They understand that our time is precious and they work to make the most of your stay in an unobtrusive, warm and professional manner. I appreciate that the staff understand we are experienced travelers and make sure things flow seamlessly.

My Niece was getting married at a different hotel in Tribeca, so my husband and I stayed at the Hilton downtown because we are diamond members. It was extremely clean, the staff was friendly, and we had a suite with a Riverview. The hotel has a bar with a limited menu, and we had a drink and a bite to eat. There\u2019s also a barbershop in the hotel where my husband got a haircut and I got a manicure. One block away, the Brookfield building has beautiful shops and plenty of choices for dining.\n\nMy issues are not with this specific hotel but with Hilton, in general. For instance, the hotel was not honoring complementary breakfasts for diamond members. They offered points instead but my understanding was that you had to purchase the breakfast and then you would get the points. This should not be the case, since I\u2019ve had to spend quite a bit of money staying at Hiltons to become a diamond member. In fact, I really don\u2019t know what benefits I did receive as a diamond member other than using my app to check in, which didn\u2019t completely work, because I still had to have the front desk send my digital key and do my check out because the app wasn\u2019t working then either. If diamond membership really doesn\u2019t mean significantly more perks, it\u2019s really not worth it and I plan to bring this up with management.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My usual go-to is The Dominick in Soho, but rates were insanely high during fashion week, so I decided to give Conrad Downtown a try. \n\nI love Battery Park and the stunning waterfront view. The service in this hotel was stellar - all of the hotel staff I\u2019ve encountered (from the front desk to the bell desk) were professional and courteous, and I never have to wait more than a minute to be helped when I call guest services. \n\nUnfortunately, the soundproofing at this hotel is HORRIBLE. I was startled awake by what sounded like someone frantically knocking on my door, only to find that no one was outside my suite - it was actually my neighbor upstairs pacing up and down the hallway between the bedroom and the living room that is covered with marble flooring. Frustrated as I was unable to rest after a long flight, I went down to speak with a front desk staff member. I asked if it was normal for me to hear such noises in my suite, and I was told that it was \u201cnot ideal but it happens.\u201d \n\nI requested to be moved to a suite with better soundproofing. Although I was no longer below prancing stilettos, the soundproofing was still unacceptable. I could hear the sound of a vacuum cleaner being dragged across my ceiling every morning, my next door neighbor opening and closing their closet doors, and people talking in the hallway outside my suite. I could not rest well at all during my stay here.\n\nIf you\u2019re a light sleeper like me, or simply would like to get a good night\u2019s sleep when paying for a 5-star hotel, I recommend staying somewhere else.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This was a well deserved vacation for me and my wife.\n I had dealt with a few people before we arrived to confirm our stay. I did not want anything to go wrong. From the moment we arrived, we felt special. We were greeted by the bellman (Danny). What a breath of fresh air. He made sure that the luggage was taken out of the car, the car parked and the luggage delivered to the room. The lobby is on the second floor. We met up with the front desk folks. Again, they made us feel special. It was a little quiet this week and we were staying for 8 nights, so, they gave us an upgraded room. that was an unexpected gift. Another nice thing that these guy do is that they allow pets. What? So we took our tshitzu. They do a nice job with pets where they set the room up for your pet with a bed and dog bowls. Again, what? So not only do you feel special but so does your fur baby. The room was a very nice size. A suite that was Bigger than a cruise cabin, with a shower to die for. The view was breathtaking.\nThey have a restaurant and a rooftop bar. The location is right and the foot of the new WTC building. We were able to walk everywhere in downtown. From Battery Park all the way up to Little Italy and everything in between. We were able to take a few tours (Statue of Liberty and WTC Memorial) and we could walk to both places. Walking the dog was easy, right outside the hotel. A few grassy area for pets like mine that are not use to concrete everywhere. The first night was unbelievable. the bed was awesome. Almost like home or better. This area is also quiet for a NY street. So the room was pretty quiet. the room has 2 nice size TV's and plenty of channels to keep you entertained if you want to watch TV. \nThe Atrio restaurant is on the 2nd fl. We ate there a few times because the food and service was top notch. At the bar, we met Danny (#2). This bartender was awesome. He makes a great drink and assured that everything was perfect. I hope you are lucky enough to get him. In the morning at Atrio, breakfast is nice. Again, we had a great waiter (Luis). They made sure that everything was just right. Service again was awesome. At the Rooftop Loopy Doopy sky bar, we made a reservation and got a nice table. the waitress and crew there gave good service and made a nice drink. Allot of the local office workers end their day there also. Nice way to end the day for everybody. The customer service person (Sanela) was the best. She checked in with us a few time to assure that our stay was going well. She was beyond awesome. thank you.\nThe entire experience at the Conrad was exceptional. What a great home away from home.

My husband and I agree this was the best hotel, judging from the amenities, location and staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant, Doris Fong the Assistant Director of Guest Relations took the time out to be sure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Johel the Manger of the rooftop bar, Loopy Doopy, was attentive during our visit; drinks\/food were great! I was unable to get the names of housekeeping though every person we met was kind and welcoming. \n\nHotel Location - A gem in downtown NYC. The hotel is steps away from the water-edge so late night walks were breathtaking and relaxing, very different from busy bustling NYC. Living in NY, who wants to be around busy bars, loud patrons, car horns, etc.. \nIf you want to venture out to different bars\/restaurants just a short cab ride away!\n\nHotel Room - We stayed in a Riverview Suite. View was beautiful! Very clean and actually had a wonderful smell (had to mention). The shower was GREAT. Water pressure was unusually strong and could get very hot (don't get that often in NYC) You can't use the fridge for personal items, but hey - unless you're storing medication\/baby food - do you really use whatever you put in the fridge at a hotel??  The room also had a filtered water dispenser which was an unexpected plus. \n\nHousekeeping - We stayed 3 days, 2 nights. Provided toiletries were replenished even if we requested extra. Turn down service was great, it included a little scented stick to put on your body to get ready for bed, as well as a card letting you know the expected weather the next day. \n\nRooftop Bar, Loopy Doopy - Great drinks and food! I had a prosecco with strawberry daiquiri Icee. The food was tasty! I tried the rotisserie chicken sliders. VERY fast service and this was Friday night. Vibe was chill and relaxing view was AMAZING! Great photo ops. \n\nOverall our stay was EXCELLENT!! We would defiantly recommend this hotel and most certainly be back if we were visiting the area.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

When I checked in, the front desk did not seem to be engaging as much, did not offer me a bottle of water because \u201cthey did not have any and they were leaning towards a recycling program to save the planet\u201d and that our room had a water fountain station. I headed upstairs just to realize my room keys did not work. When I lined up to get some help, I saw him giving bottles of water to a party of 4 adults that were checking in (which needless to say came across as rude to me). I proceeded to see another agent and she switched over my keys and apologized for it, she even asked him why he gave me regular keys when I was a Diamond Member (at that point I couldn\u2019t care less). Once I reached my room, I was pleased with the space and amenities. Room was spacious and clean. One issue I told the manager about when I checked out was that the front desk told me I could use my $50 credit for B\/B credit at the bar\/ restaurant area and next morning when I went downstairs the restaurant was closed, I couldn\u2019t even get a coffee at the coffee shop around the corner he suggested because there was a humongous line. Front desk also provided me with miss leading info regarding their roof top. He said \u201cit would be open\u201d and when we reached upstairs one of the employees told us it was closed due to rain.  Property has a lot of potential and I know things have been hard during the Pandemic but Considering it is a high end property (A CONRAD) one would expect more.

Situated in lower Manhattan, the 15 floor hotel has views of the Hudson, Statue of Liberty, and the Irish Hunger Memorial. We stayed for two nights in a corner river view room on the 8th floor. The views were exceptional. The room had a separate living room with a tv mounted on the wall. There are also windows which open. Lightning is controlled from the walls in each room or from the nightstand in the bedroom. For privacy, there are frosted sliding doors to separate the rooms. We also had a monitored wet-bar in the room with a full fridge of items available for purchase. I loved the filtered water dispenser in the room as well! The walk-in shower was spacious and the water pressure\/temperature was excellent. For parking, the hotel offers a valet service. There are cones out front and a door greeter to welcome you. Valet service is provided through Icon parking across the street on River Terrace. When picking up the vehicle, expect to wait up to 30 minutes for your car to arrive back to the curb in front of Conrad. There are no in\/out privileges, but there was no need for us to use the car during our stay. The hotel is near the 9\/11 memorial and the train station there services all of the subway lines. It was a short 10 minute walk each time and the area felt safe. You can also walk to the ferry for the Statue of Liberty and that was 25 minutes away, walking time. There is also an upscale mall next to the hotel. If it\u2019s raining, you can quickly walk to the mall which has an entrance to the subway system. This Conrad property also has a very small outdoor rooftop bar serving great drinks and some small appetizers. It was open 4pm - 10pm; however, the staff was accommodating to everyone socializing after 10pm. There was no breakfast for Diamond members; however the hotel communicated this ahead of time and offered 5,000 points per night back. In room dining is available for breakfast and dinner for a charge. My only issue with this hotel was the elevators. The floors are not secured by room key access even though there is a RFID reader in the elevator. When waiting for the elevator, there was no way to know if it was going up or down. Regardless of the direction, the elevator would choose the next stop even if we wanted to go the other direction. Not a big deal, but just get in an elevator instead of continuing to wait. There is also a back entrance to the hotel and signage said it would close at 8pm. We found the doors still open after 10pm, which was fine and convenient for us, but nobody was monitoring this entrance. Overall this property is a complete 10\/10. I highly recommend this hotel when traveling to NYC. If you have a car, it is extremely convenient and the rates do not exceed that of any external locations. To the staff - thank you!

The Hudson River Suites provide tremendous views of the River and the Statue of Liberty. The room service staff and cleaning staff do a great job at keeping the hotel clean and the food from in room dining was delicious! \n\nI would like to thank two very special individuals that work at the property who truly made my stay one I will never forget! Mikey Remo the guest services manager and Sanela the front desk representative. Both Mikey and Sanela truly went above and beyond to make my mother\u2019s birthday special. Mikey\u2019s hospitality and generosity is why I will always stay at the Conrad whenever I come to NYC. Sanela is a gem as well, her  customer service from start to finish during my stay was superb. They both made my stay enjoyable. \n\nI would recommend the Conrad NYC Downtown to anyone who wants to experience luxury in NYC.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Decades roll by, new hotels emerge, but the Conrad in Battery Park keeps up, pedaling faster as trends come and go. Standard rooms are some of the largest in the city, bedrooms separate from a comfy living room, with a TV in each. The design and aesthetics are timeless, still modern and up to date. Towels are thick, bathrobes comforting, and the powerful shower refreshing.  Sometimes the little things make a hotel special, and the Conrad has not forgotten a thing, with a Nespresso Coffee machine, a Rocean water filtering system, leather desk accessories, and a HVAC that works well.  It's luxury with comfort in mind, not luxury with image in mind. Service is professional and friendly, there when you want them, unobtrusive when you don't. Housekeeping, a thorn in the side of every hotel these days, was on point and well trained. Bravo!\n\nThe only aspect of the Conrad Downtown that used to detract was the neighborhood.  Yet, the Conrad was a pioneer as Battery Park developed around them. Now the exclusive Brookfield Mall development is across the street, as is the wonderful Hudson River Park, a respite from the grit of the city. Restaurants, bars and shops are steps away, with Tribeca and a subway stop a ten minute walk. A rooftop bar enhances the Conrad's \"hip\" quotient, and an in-house restaurant and room service are available. The Conrad meets every traveler's need and adds a bit of cachet. I will stay loyal to this Conrad. It has never let me down, and the hotel is better than ever.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This was because this hotel utilizes their Mobile App like a Rock-Star! Check-In was able to be accommodated much earlier than expected and was streamlined in every capacity. WOW FACTOR # 1 \n\nRooms- Sealed To Ensure Cleanliness was a nice reassurance of knowing that no one has been in the room since it was last cleaned and sanitized. The Rooms are by far bigger than your average guest room in New York City. Whoever designed this property should be given an Award for Exceptional Design & Use in a Room. The fact that the toilet and the shower and separated into two different areas with each having its own sealed door is a genius design. I am not ever over-exaggerating, when you think about traveling with others this is a huge game changer in every aspect. The Shower alone had to steal the show for being the best shower in Manhattan. The Rain shower was like \"Heaven on Earth\" and kept its Hot Water for 3 Individual Hot Showers Back to Back (Very Impressed). The Room was certainly larger than most guest rooms in Manhattan. The specific room I stayed in was the King Deluxe Suite & It met every standard to calling itself a suite with a very impressive slim & sleek sliding door system that creatively boosted privacy between the two rooms that made the suite. High Ceilings, Double Insulated Windows which kept any noise from outside just there outside. You never heard one-siren or any loud commotion coming from outside traffic, it really didn't feel like you were in Manhattan. \n\nIn-Room Dining Was Present & Didn't Disasspoint Either- Every item that we ordered for Breakfast from The Avocado Egg Toast, to The Breakfast Potatoes, The 3-EGG Omlet all on-point. In-Room Dining was even able to be ordered via the Mobile App. \n\nThe Conrad Downtown went above and beyond in every capacity. When businesses are usually slower in the season you would expect to get a slower version of service. However, that was certainly not true at all. Every person I experienced whether directly or indirectly via phone or mobile app- brought their A GAME to Work EVERY MOMENT. \n\nI normally don't write reviews but this hotel just won me over in every way.

{"helpfulVotes":6,"locationId":208452,"title":"Epitome of Hospitality","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-05-28","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"Now let me start off by saying that I check out tomorrow but I\u2019ve been thinking about writing this review since I arrived at the Conrad on April 19th. I\u2019ve stayed a total of 23 nights at the Conrad and I am completely satisfied, honored, and grateful for the hospitality and service I received during my stay. \n\nI\u2019m a registered nurse and was granted a free hotel room through my membership with the American Nurses\u2019 Association. I originally booked a King Deluxe Suite but was given a Deluxe Suite with Two Double Beds. First off, since the room was free, I was really expecting to be offered the smallest and most standard room. So that was a huge pleasant surprise. Check-in was a breeze and the GSA who checked me in was so professional. I was shocked when I entered the most beautiful hotel room I\u2019ve seen in a while. It was so clean. Everything was so modern. It smelled so good. The attention to detail was just something I would expect if I were to open my own hotel. So to see a hotel doing something I would do, touched my heart.  I walked into my room and the first thing I noticed was a letter from general manager, Marlene Poynder. Not too far was a complimentary bottle of Conrad labeled hand sanitizer. The hand sanitizer was so considerate and a nice touch. The letter was so very sincere. It informed guests of all the amenities that were temporarily suspended due to COVID, which I understood and appreciated. She mentioned what the Conrad put in place to still accommodate guests.  Like the 24 hr concierge available through text, the microwave in the lobby to heat food up, the limited housekeeping, etc. It really made me feel like the staff was really here to serve those who were serving. I was SO honored and immediately at peace. \n\nMy room at the Conrad was an oasis and refuge compared to what I was dealing with at work. Being here was better than being home, which is why I stayed so long. \nI had two TVs! One was in the parlor and one in the bedroom. I was able to sync and stream my favorite shows (except for Netflix) and music through the My Away app. The bar area had a sink, Nespresso  machine, with wine and champagne glasses, espresso cups, and mugs, and a wine opener. The rain shower was luxurious. The shower was separated from the toilet and sink. I thought that was a cool and thoughtful design. Everything about the room was PERFECT! I felt like I was given my own studio apartment. They gave me everything I needed. Extra shampoo, conditioner, lotion, towels, trash bags, etc. I was so comfortable. \n\nThe location of the Conrad was perfect too! Target is not too far away. Shake Shack\u2019s downstairs and Rite Aide was right across the street at Brookfield Place. If you needed some fresh air, Rockefeller Park\/Battery Park Esplanade was literally a minute away. Granted all the shops at Brookfield were closed but I\u2019m sure when they\u2019re open, if you like shopping, the Conrad is the place to be. \n\nOn my 6th night, the Conrad staff did something amazing for me. It was so small but it touched my heart in the most deepest way. I was literally storing my perishables and left overs on ice, in one of the trash bags given to me. It was no biggie to me cause honestly, I understood why the mini-bar cooler was locked and I just made do with what I had. I walked out of my room to pick up my Uber Eats order when I noticed a mini fridge right outside my room. I literally stood in front of my door and asked myself, \u201cHow\u2019d they know I needed a fridge?\u201d. I used the Hilton Honors app to message the staff to ask if it was for me and if I do use it, is it at an extra cost per day (which I was totally willing to pay). Johel quickly replied, \u201cAbsolutely! It\u2019s for you to use.\u201d  I immediately broke down in tears. I really want you to understand how much I value not having to ask for something but for someone to do it anyway. I think it\u2019s the most important thing in hospitality and the Conrad gets that. \n\nMy boyfriend came to spend a couple of nights with me at the Conrad. He was so pleased to see my room and relieved that I was comfortable. He knew I wasn\u2019t given a microwave or a fridge for food at my last hotel, so he was happy to see that the Conrad went out of their way. We enjoyed the Patron and snacks left in the mini bar. \n\nSecurity was soooo attentive! One time after getting off from work, I walked into the building and elevator without a mask. I guess security saw me and got on the speaker in the elevator and reminded me to wear a mask in public areas. It was a little weird but I respected it 100%. The Conrad said the well-being of their staff and guests is their highest priority and I clearly saw they meant that! \n\nThere was another time I forgot I had to check out because there were no rooms available. Unfortunately, I was at work and wasn\u2019t getting off till 7pm. So I messaged the staff through the Hilton Honors app and explained my situation. Michael replied promptly and granted me a one time courtesy to check out at 9pm free of charge. I ended up having to stay late at work and messaged the staff again through the app to let them know I\u2019m running late. Min Yi replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, take your time :)\u201d. Every time I communicated with the staff in person and through the app, I received the upmost respect and professionalism from EVERYBODY! Not to mention the staff constantly thanked me for my service as a frontline worker\/nurse every chance they got. \n\nThe Conrad did something I didn\u2019t see at any other hotel I stayed at. They really recognized Nurses\u2019 Week!!!! OMG!!! They provided complimentary cookies in the lobby for us and put up signs everywhere thanking us!! They even had a little table set up in the lobby with goodies for nurses. It was the most beautiful and thoughtful thing. I was speechless and truly thankful and honored! \n\nHousekeeping was AMAZING!! The hotel is SPOTLESS!! And midway through my stay, I came back from work to the cleanest hotel room.... my sheets were changed and everything! I knew they had limited housekeeping but given the circumstances due to COVID, having my room cleaned was going above and beyond! Every time I passed by housekeeping in the hall, I was greeted with a smile and professional good morning. As a former housekeeper myself, I\u2019m inspired by their selflessness and bravery. I LOVE THEM. \n\nEvery day and night I stayed at the Conrad, things just got better and better. I stayed in a total of 3 rooms. My last two rooms, the mini fridge was put in there automatically. Which was again something the staff at the Conrad did without me asking. The Conrad started adding standup automatic hand sanitizer dispensers throughout the hotel.  I\u2019m writing this review with tears of gratefulness for the staff\u2019s grace because my stay at the Conrad was nothing short of amazing and sadly coming to an end. \n\nI would like to thank some of you individually....\n\nMichael - thank you for making the check-in and check-out process a breeze. I had multiple reservations and you didn\u2019t mind transferring my folio. Also thank you for letting me check out at 9pm. You told me \u201cwe\u2019re happy to welcome our medical responders\u201d and that just made me feel good. Thank you for your several text messages welcoming me back to the Conrad. \n\nHeather - thank you for being so sweet and granting me late checkout on 5\/23. I asked for 2pm but you gave me until 3pm \u201cjust in case\u201d. \n\nMin Yi - thank you for being so patient the day I had to check out at 9pm. You put my mind at ease when you said \u201cIt\u2019s ok, take your time\u201d with the smiley face (LOL). \n\nDoris - thank you for helping me with any questions I had and your prompt responses through the Hilton Honors app made me feel I can depend on you and you were there for me. \n\nJohel - thank you for your prompt response to my fridge question. Your answer made me feel SO special. \n\nKeonwoo - thank you for helping me authorize my cc for incidentals from work and checking me into the same room. You were patient, kind, and really made that process a breeze. \n\nAnthony - thank you for having housekeeping bring up two pillows and extra shampoo to my room. You have a very melodic and soothing voice. Your response to my request with your voice, will leave a lasting impression on me :)\n\nSecurity - thank you for giving me a sense of security during my stay and offering the luggage cart to me and my boyfriend when I checked into my last reservation. You even showed us how to maximize the space by hanging some of the items. Thank you for also leaving the first outer door before you approach the automatic doors open so people didn\u2019t have to touch it during the daytime hours. \n\nHousekeeping - Spasibo! Thank you for EVERYTHING! The cleaning, fine attention to detail, and positive attitude. Sorry for leaving my two beds together. I couldn\u2019t put them back where they belong because my boyfriend wasn\u2019t around to help me. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if I didn\u2019t mention you specifically but just know I appreciate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. You are ALL amazing and I will never forget you. Ms. Poynder, you have a WONDERFUL team! Thank you for opening your doors to medical responders! I am honored to have stayed in one of the most beautiful hotels in NY! I\u2019ve stayed in two other Hilton hotels and the Conrad stood out the most! Especially cause the WIFI never failed! (LOL) Hands down the best experience! Thank you for your time and very very kind consideration. I TRULY LOVE YOU ALL! \n\nWarmest regards,\n\nJamie C., RN\n\nP.S.

However, this Conrad really disappointed us both. If you\u2019ve to stayed in Conrad properties before, I\u2019m sure you will be disappointed too. \n\nWhen you enter, Conrad\u2019s always have beautiful decor, big lobbies and welcoming staff that will do anything to assist you. This property had none of this. No one to assist us, a bland and boring lobby and reception staff that didn\u2019t want to be there. \n\nInteraction with the reception colleague that checked us in was minimal. They were simply going through the motions like a robot. There was no personality, no Conrad flare, nothing. \n\nThe room was a of a good size for New York City, we had a good view, the bed was comfortable, the shower was large and had great water pressure. However, again it was bland. White and beige, white and beige. Corporate cooperate corporate, boring boring boring. It had no personality and it certainly wasn\u2019t a Conrad property. \n\nJust to mention, the house keeping staff here were amazing! So friendly, personable and our room was kept so clean. I wish I got their names because they were great! \n\nThe breakfast was very dire. You order from a menu, which is great. But...that\u2019s it. No fresh fruit, no continental offerings, no pastries etc... We\u2019ve stayed in many properties where you order from a menu but they always had other offerings to accompany your meal. We were really shocked! Our server was pleasant enough, but again, she was like a robot. Saying what she needed to, no personality, corporate. \n\nWe chose to stay here because we love the Conrad brand. We\u2019ve stayed at many and we really love it. This isn\u2019t Conrad at all. \n\nI keep saying that word corporate and that\u2019s honestly all this hotel is. It\u2019s for the average businessman away from home that\u2019s stressed, wants minimal attention and minimal stimulation. \n\nWe won\u2019t stay again and we wouldn\u2019t recommend it unless you\u2019re travelling for business and you want to be right next to your office.

The staff were perfect and couldn't do enough for us. We did all the sightseeing and when exhausted relaxed in our fluffy bathrobes and slippers and were impressed with the standard of room service. Only draw back was it was a long way from Midtown New York, but we enjoyed walking up and the use of the water taxi from Battery Park. There's still a lot around the hotel if you explore and handy for visiting Ground Zero, The Statue of Liberty and an amazing new shopping centre, we also frequented the local whole foods market which had everything you could want to eat after a long day exploring New York.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

I am so glad we did; everyone was so so lovely and nothing was too much trouble. \nOn arrival our room wasn\u2019t quite ready so we got a $25 voucher to spend at the bar and have a nice drink. Lovely gesture. The concierge told us about how to get a good deal on Broadway tickets whilst we were there (google broadway roulette - amazing tip if you are not fussed about what play you want to see!!). \n\nAs honeymooners they gave us a lovely little welcome in our room, some champagne and chocolate covered strawberries which was sweet. Whilst we were there it was also my birthday, we didn\u2019t tell the hotel but they did see the cards displayed in our suite and so in the afternoon of my birthday when we came back, there was a card and chocolates wishing me a happy birthday. Again, what a nice touch. Our room was fab, a delightful view of the Hudson River and the Jersey City, which at night was stunning. \nWe had lovely cocktails on the rooftop bar, and again being able to see the Statue of Liberty in the distance was a nice touch. \nThe hotel was always clean, smelt nice, with friendly, attentive staff. It was ideally located for us, a nice quiet sleep away from the hustle and bustle of midtown. I have recommended this hotel several times since we can home, and when we ourselves return to NYC we will definitely stay at the Conrad again. \n\nThanks so much to everyone at the Conrad Hotel for making our honeymoon so lovely.  \n","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room as previously noted is large, and I noticed that the shower was strong which is enjoyable. I was thinking at some point they'll need to think about a refresh (say in 2-3 years) as obviously a room used day in day out will get worn; so they left a notice that they are replacing the carpets and TVs in the rooms, the work is not noisy and this will make the suites even nicer.\n\nI did not try the restaurant.\n\nCheck out and retrieval of the car was just as efficient. I also was texted twice to check if I needed anything.\nI wish all hotels could provide such excellent service, well done Conrad team.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The receptionist said they would move us the next day to a higher floor with a more wow view. Good to their word the next day we had that Insta room view over the Hudson. Just lovely.\nThe public spaces are huge with an amazing atrium which connects the front of the hotel to the rear, to the bar, the restaurant and the rear. This was decorated for Christmas so did feel very special.\nThe room was spacious and more mini-suite than standard Hilton format. Two large TVs created a nice space split between the bed and the lounge and lots of bits to make your stay comfortable.\nReally hard to fault anything about the hotel really.

This was the third straight December we stayed at the Conrad, this time for 7 nights.  We arrived at 10:30am, and our room was ready.  Check-in was quick and the fellow who checked us in was courteous, friendly and professional.  \n\nThe all-suite concept at the Conrad suits us just fine.  Plenty of space, clean, and the shower is amazing!  Housekeeping staff was wonderful.  Always pleasant and cheerful.  \n\nA couple of service glitches to report.  On two consecutive days, we left the room at 11:30am and I asked the fellow at the front desk if he could contact housekeeping to have the room cleaned as soon as possible.  On both days, we came back 2 1\/2 hours later and the room was still not cleaned.  We waited in the common area for another 2 hours before the room was ready.\n\nWe were in room 521, and every evening there were slight smells of grilling wafting from the shower room.  As it turns out, our room was directly above the grill in the hotel restaurant!  I'm assuming the rooms directly below us on each floor receive the same smells?\n\nIn any event, we had an excellent stay, and look forward to returning next December, if not before.  \n\nBy the way, the Conrad must be the best smelling hotel in the business (notwithstanding the cooking odors from the shower room).

The location is wonderful with Brookfield Place mall right across the street which connects to the Occulus, Path station, Subway station, World Trade Center buildings.  During the winter, or in rainy weather, being able to walk indoors through Brookfield Place to the Occulus is very convenient.   The service is excellent.  When I left an item in the room after having checked out, and contacted the hotel, the hotel promptly mailed the item back to me.

I can say that I will most definitely stay there again whenever I can - everything about our visit was wonderful!\n\nMy family and I arrived at the hotel around 10:00 PM on Christmas night. We were welcomed by a very friendly employee at the front desk (I believe his name was Elliot). I couldn\u2019t believe how nice and accommodating he was to us. Since it was Christmas night, I was prepared for a poor check-in experience and wouldn\u2019t have blamed the employee for it. Luckily my preconceived expectations were completely wrong and the check-in process was easy.  The rest of our trip was just as pleasant - every hotel employee that we encountered was very helpful and friendly. \n\nThe Hotel - if you have looked at the pictures you will see how beautiful it is. Lots of open space, everything is clean. We picked the hotel based on location: Downtown and away from all the craziness of Times Square. Also right near the 9\/11 Memorial and Museum which was on our trip itinerary. \n\nLocation - we had no idea how convenient the location would be but it was just about perfect. Arrival and departure from NYC is easy due to the proximity of the West Side Hwy. The Conrad is also a short walk from many subway lines. It\u2019s also relatively close to the Staten Island Ferry if you want to cruise past the Statue of Liberty. I should also mention the Conrad is right near the Hudson so there are amazing views. Across the street is Brookfield Place which is a higher end mall with a few dining options from casual to high end. \n\nRoom - largest standard room I have stayed in when visiting NYC. We had a king bed with a pullout couch bed for the kids. I don\u2019t know if I could have slept all week on it but it was fine for the kids. It has a very nice mattress, doesn\u2019t feel like sleeping on springs like most pullout couches do. The room also had a spacious rainfall shower. The only \u201ccon\u201d would be a lack of privacy (if you need it).  The bathroom is separated from the living areas by sliding glass doors. They aren\u2019t see through but also not soundproof and they don\u2019t lock. I don\u2019t think it will be a problem for most people but could be an issue for some. Shower and bathroom walls are also glass so if the lights are on, people on the outside will have lights on too. \n\nThe Conrad is now my favorite hotel in the city and I have no doubt that I will be back again in the future. I stayed at another Hilton property in NYC a month ago and was extremely disappointed. The Conrad has restored my faith in the brand for properties in NYC.

First of all, the hotel is a bit far from the subway (8-9 mins walk in the cold) and the Uber driver sometimes have trouble finding it.\n\nRegarding my experiences, they are mixed but the bad ones overcome the good ones. We stayed for two days on new year\u2019s eve. The first day experience was very positive when Michael and Heather did such a great job in accommodating us. The Hilton Diamond normally allowed for two free breakfasts, however they made an exception and told us we could all go for breakfast because we had more than 2 people staying. However the second day was pretty bad. We went to breakfast again and this time they told us only two was allowed. When I called the guest service from my hotel room to ask why there would be an inconsistency, the lady was very angry and she lied to my face said the hotel would never allow any diamond member to have more than 2 guests for the complimentary breakfast. So I told her we were just there yesterday, she changed her tone and said okay you can go now, without even an apology for being angry and rude earlier. Then during the checkout, when the gentleman asked me how was my stay, I shared this unpleasant experience with him and he just said: oh yeah I\u2019m sorry about that. But you can clearly tell he was not sorry at all and was just trying to get me to stop talking and leave. It is a VERY bad stay and I would not go back to this hotel anymore. I stayed at Park Hyatt New York and it was quite nice. Highly recommend that hotel instead of this Conrad one! ","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Check in was smooth and welcoming, the valet staff was very active, the lobby area is so airy and gorgeous with an atrium and art themed ambiance and neon lighting.\nThe room size is on the bigger side considering other competition in the city, I just wished it would be more wider than long. The view of our room wasn\u2019t of the Hudson but the mall across the street which was fine, window was a bit small though (wished it was floor to ceiling) covered only half the wall. The beds were comfortable but a bit low for my taste. The shower and toilet are in the middle of the room and can be very uncomfortable to use if you are traveling with kids or your co workers, one would have to block themselves from both sides of the suite with the sliding doors in order to get some privacy. The rain shower itself was one of the best I have experienced in recent times with tons of space (no bathtub). The minibar was filled with goodies but no space to put your personal beverages but the hotel was kind enough to send another fridge to use free of cost. \nThe real winner at this property is their team of wonderful people, we were traveling with an infant and couldn\u2019t really dine in for our breakfast so were given take away boxes to take back to the room. We were lucky to get a nice buffet spread as they had a special holiday week going on otherwise one has to do with an Ala Carte menu (unless its a weekend). A special shout out here for Doris Q at the restaurant who was super nice to my wife and kids and is definitely an asset for this hotel, its people like her that make one\u2019s trip so much better than it is.\nThe location is awesome neighboring the one World Trade Center and 9\/11 memorial along with some decent food options, shake shack located right next to the hotel. \nSome of the minor drawbacks I can think of besides the weird layout of the suites is the high price for valet (charge even more for an suv) compared to other properties in NYC with no in\/out privileges , rooms which are accessed from the atrium tend to have this constant loud thumping music noise coming in through the door (like a heavy bass in distance), lobby is located on the second floor and not on street level and can be a little inconvenient if you\u2019re going to be doing a lot of back and forth. Also wished they had some rooms with two beds facing the Hudson, most of those rooms only have king size beds.\nNonetheless I would definitely be back the next time I\u2019m visiting the big apple.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our room was ready within a half hour of our arrival since we were early.\n-The room was a large suite and quite comfortable for the 3 of us and our own space. The only thing lacking was a place to put larger suitcases...the maid service was great and was always clean with fresh towels available..also nice bath products. If anything you needed you were given.  \n-Atrio Restaurant was very nice for breakfast with weekends offering buffet and weekdays a' la carte. The food was always good and twice we ate our evening meal in the restaurant. Great service we had the entire time! The pizza was tasty! \n-They did offer a \"Happy Hour\" over the weekends Friday & Saturday...wine & cheese 3-5 pm.\n*Nice gesture since they do not have an Executive Lounge for Hilton Honors who have status.\n-Every single person we encountered at the Conrad always spoke and made us feel important. The hotel was clean, modern decor and always smelled nice as you walked around. \n-The location was great particularly for those who come for Liberty & Ellis Island plus 911 Memorials & One World Trade Center.  Easy to access the subway from Brookfield Place (just a short walk across the street).  Oculus close as well. \n-Because this location is in the Battery park area we never felt like it was crazy or that people were everywhere. It was nice for a change especially this time of year in the city. \n\nEverything about this experience at the Conrad was wonderful! I will be back in the future!

We had a fantastic stay.\n\nThe hotel is ideally situated, on the Hudson, a 5 minute walk from One World Trade Center, and several subway stations. There are lots of great restaurants nearby - our favourites were Blue Smoke, and El Vex, both in the same block as the hotel.\n\nThe deluxe suite was well presented, with two queen beds and a double sofa bed. We asked for a fridge, which arrived within 5 minutes. Housekeeping did a great job, despite my two kids best efforts!\n\nStaff at the front desk, concierge, and restaurant were friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet, on Saturday and Sunday was excellent. On weekdays, breakfast is a la carte, with a reasonable choice. One point to note is that, on one morning when we came to breakfast at about 9am, there were no tables. It appears that business-people reserve tables for meetings (the hotel is next to Goldman Sachs and other big companies). So, if you're having a late breakfast, perhaps best to book a table. Most days we ate at 730, so as to hit the sights before the crowds. If you don't want a big breakfast, there's a great little bagel place just next to the hotel entrance, with an amazing range of cream cheeses.\n\nThe rooftop bar has great views over the Hudson and the Statue of Liberty. Prosecco Popsicle cocktails were great, if a bit expensive at $24.\n\nAll in all, this is a great base for a visit to NYC. Recommended.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This stay, which cost me almost 300,000 Hilton Honors points, was very disappointing. I walked into my room and was overwhelmed with the smell of chemicals, which had been sprayed to cover the smoke smell. Since it was late at night, I waited until the next day to transfer to another room. After transferring, it became clear that the hotel staff had not communicated with each other. Since the restaurant was closed for remodeling, I had to order room service to get on-premise food. When I called for room service I was told that I was not registered for my room. Then I had to ask to have the mini bar unlocked, since it was not open when I got to the room. I called the front desk and was told that I had not provided a credit card for the deposit (although I had done so at check in). They eventually opened the mini bar, but it was missing about 25% of the items. At checkout, I again had to explain the confusing debacle to the front desk to get charges sorted out. This was not the stay I would have imagined for a Conrad; certainly not worth 300,000 points (or over $500 per night, if I had paid cash at the current rate).","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Going up to midtown is 20-30 mins on the subway depending on where you need to get.\n\nFriendly staff - the breakfast greeter remembered me by name;  decent wine bar\/restaurant - not the most amazing ambience but as an \u2018in house\u2019 choice it\u2019s solid.

After going to Times Square I would never want to stay there with the crowds and crowds of people.  This was located by the water next to plenty of restaurants and stores and a mall.  The mall next store takes you right to the subway station without having to go outside but for a brief second.  There is a wonderful deli next store with all sorts of options.  You can catch some boat tours right across the street and you can rent bikes across the street.  The room we were in was wonderful with a fantastic view of the water.  The service at this hotel was absolutely amazing and the breakfast that was included was fabulous.  A very large selection on the buffet or you can order off the menu as well.  There is a roof top bar that we did not even get to.  I will definitely be back to the Conrad.  It was an amazing stay.  You get a stocked refrigerator, umbrella's, bottled water that is always refreshed, robes and slippers that all come with great service.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

First impressions hotel was modern and clean. Front desk staff not overly friendly on greeting us. Not once on our whole holiday did a door man smile, greet us with hello or help with the front doors bags or no bags. Which I felt was extremely cold and not welcoming. Our first night we ordered room service which was extremely late and the time it came it was like it had sat in a corridor half hour. Cold and sweaty. After a long journey we just left it and decided to not get worked up about it even though it was $100 Order. Decided not to bother eating there again after the horror night before. Room was spacious we had a corner suite comfy bed; few issues, shower leaked, sliding doors didn\u2019t shut between rooms. I previously emailed the hotel to arrange hair do for the day of my wedding which they failed to deliver on! What should of been my magical day started as a nightmare! No apology funny that. People walking In from The street as it has a public cinema a-joined to it. One night there was people sitting\/laying on the hotel floors. Guests? People from the street getting warm? Who knows. All in all disappointing and really did put a downer on the trip. I just think it\u2019s one of those places that if you don\u2019t look the part they haven\u2019t got time for you. $$$ if you\u2019re a tourist I wouldn\u2019t recommended this hotel.

With the great service that began with the initial texts that Doris sent, the unexpected gift tray, and the well-made plates of breakfast we ate every morning at Atrio - we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. \n\nThe quality service and amenities combined with the great location in Battery Park City make this property feel like an oasis away from the hubbub of midtown, where I normally stay. It does take several minutes longer to commute to the places that we normally visit by cab, Uber or subway, but we also took in more of downtown during our stay. Evening walks along the water were peaceful and relaxing.\n\nThe Honors points per night were very reasonable for the 2 bed + sofabed suite that we reserved compared to other Hilton properties in Manhattan, and the \u201cpoints & money\u201d option allowed me to easily select the right combination.\n\nWe will stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I stayed mid-week a couple of days before the 4th of July holiday. \n\nAs a Hilton Honors Diamond member, I felt very valued at this hotel. Guest Services manager Doris Fong was very essential to my wonderful stay! She was very responsive with communication and her warm energy made it a pleasure interacting with her. All of the staff that I interacted with(phone or in person) were ultra friendly, helpful, efficient, and very professional. I received a handwritten card from Marlene Poynder, the General Manager. The card thanked me for my Hilton loyalty & welcomed me to the hotel. Nice touch! \n\nI had a Hudson River view suite which gave gorgeous views of the Hudson River. I loved how the bedroom overlooked the Irish Hunger Memorial. The suite was absolutely spacious with generous closet space and drawers. There are sliding doors in the living room and bedroom for extra privacy. A convenient bar area in the suite has a sink and cabinet filled with glassware.\n\nI did online check in the day before, which makes things simple and easy. I also opted to have a digital key since I have the Hilton Honors app. It was very easy and convenient to operate the digital key on my phone. I didn't have any technical issues. My room was available a bit earlier than official check in time. I was notified of this through the app.\n\nAn extra bonus was having the complimentary Diamond breakfast buffet during my stay. The buffet is usually only on the weekends, but there was an exception due to the upcoming 4th of July holiday. I found the breakfast to be quite delicious and appreciated the variety of foods. My server Carlos was very efficient, attentive, and pleasant.\n\nSome people are put off by the location of the hotel, which is an absolute plus for me. I don't like the craziness and crowds of Midtown. The area is very chill and laid-back, but chic. It's very me, lol. There are tons of bars and restaurants near the hotel. Shopping is close by as well. There are various nearby subway stations including the Oculus which makes this a very accessible hotel to other parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and NJ. These stations are just a 5-10 min walk away. \n\nSelfishly, I want this hotel to remain an undercover gem. I can easily see this hotel becoming my favorite in NYC. The only thing that is missing is having a pool. I'm already planning my next stay here. This was my first stay at a Conrad property. The Conrad New York Downtown has set the bar high!

From the friendly people at the desk at check-in (Kenny was awesome) to the beautiful room and great location.  When we got there we were a little early. So we checked in with Kenny at the front desk. He was very friendly and very helpful with a few questions we had.  Since our room wasn't ready, they took my cell number to text once it was.  We then checked our bags and headed out to grab some lunch.  The location of the Conrad is wonderful.  You are a 5 minute walk to One World Trade and 10-15 minutes down to Battery Park.  Once we got our text that our room was ready we headed back and stopped in at the front desk to grab out keys.  Then headed up to our room.  The room was amazing.  A sitting area with a pull out bed. A beautiful rain shower, and a great king size bed.  It has all the amenities we needed.  Both the bed and the pull out were very comfortable, and the room was clean. I would highly recommend the Conrad to anyone looking to stay in the financial district.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This hotel however, delivered on just that. I booked this hotel on a whim as I had a business trip last minute; I\u2019ve never stayed at a Conrad so I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. I didn\u2019t get a chance to check reviews or photos (sooo not a thing for me) but upon arriving, I wasn\u2019t a disappointed. \n\nThe location: PERFECT. Downtown near the financial district, located in a perfect shopping area, views of the Hudson and there\u2019s a shake shack literally downstairs (my NY go-to)\n\nThe staff was phenomenal, I was early (meeting was at 11) so I knew my room wouldn\u2019t be ready; the front desk held my bags and put a digital key in for me so when I returned everything would be upstairs & no stopping at the desk was needed (yes please!) \n\nMy room was HUGE. I literally felt important. The bathroom shower is out of a movie; probably could of stayed there all night. Turn down service was also an amenity that I never experienced before - it just added to my entire feeling of importance. Peeled sheets, weather prediction for the next day, towels removed, bottled water and a little something sweet = WOW. \n\nBreakfast was interesting, super long lines but my gold status was attached to my name so I found my self being seated rather quickly. Not complaining but I didn\u2019t recall getting seated prior to folks who were already in line; even heard a few bickers under their breath. \n\nThe rooftop lounge is gorgeous, unfortunately there was no seating when I was staying but definitely has some great views. \n\nThis classy hotel certainly captured my heart and attention. I\u2019m planning a trip back in 3 weeks and already booked my stay here. Between the level of service, room quality, attention to detail and location... just can\u2019t beat it. \n\n","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This time it was just terrific (with the exception of our experience in the wine bar\/restaurant, which I've reviewed separately).\n\nThis \"staycation\" was part of my birthday weekend.  One of the things I really like about this hotel is the location -- while it's close to the financial district, it's on a little street near the Hudson that feels calm.  In some ways you feel like you're on a cruise ship when in the hotel as at times you can see the water from some of the rooms.  Yet you can easily walk to get a great cup of coffee at Laughing Man, or head over to Brookfield Place for some restaurants\/shopping, or go a few blocks more and you're at the Oculus.  And if you want to just sit and look at the water and the boats there are a number of nice outdoor benches for you to do that, too, which is a rarity in Manhattan.\n\nThe hotel itself has a very modern vibe, with a soaring lobby and all kinds of art pieces, which I like.  And, every room is at least a two-room suite with a huge shower and bathroom.  Our room was very clean and the a\/c worked well.  Since I know that there is one of those mini-fridges in the room where if you move something they charge you, we asked for an empty small refrigerator be placed in the room right away, which was done.  (This is a pet peeve of mine for hotels -- I dislike those fridges stocked full of mini-bar items, especially when the hotel is located in an area where it's easy to pick up a few beverages for the room.   And always appreciate an empty mini fridge for a few bottles of water or seltzer.)  My other pet peeve is that when you make a reservation for two people, two people check in, the front desk gives you two room keys, there are two bottles of water waiting in the room, yet there is only one bathrobe in the room?  That was the case here.\n\nStill, we were super comfy in our room.  I love that they do turndown service, particularly since they fill up the ice bucket.  Staff members were pleasant.  \n\nThis place remains on my \"short list\" for NYC staycations!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

After sharing my concerns through the Conrad's messaging system, I'd not heard nothing back for five days, and so I posted my original 3 star review.\n\nShortly thereafter, I was contacted by Michael, who wanted to get to the bottom of things.  While the timing may seem dubious, I had messaged her a second time before posting the review, and she was calling in regards to the text, so I genuinely believe it was NOT related to my original TripAdvisor review.\n\nShe apologized profusely, explained that there had been a glitch in the messaging system (so she had not received my initial text), and that she was reaching out as soon as she learned there was an issue.  Not only did she spend a good deal of time with me on the phone listening to my concerns, she asked a lot of pertinent questions, and really seemed determined to make things right.\n\nFinally, while I hesitate to share the following, I think it says a lot about the property and its management, so I will add that: in addition to her sincerest apologies, Michael gave me her personal cell phone number and asked that I reach out to her directly for future Conrad stays.  She also offered me a free night the next time I'm in town.\n\nIt should go without saying, but don't EVER complain just to try and get something for nothing.  Hotels work hard to please lots of customers with lots of different expectations.  It's not an easy gig running a tight ship in the service industry -- especially at a large, upscale property like the Conrad.  Michael went above and beyond to take care of me, and that's why I'm updating this to a five star review.  Well played, Michael...\n\nVery well played.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":6,"locationId":208452,"title":"Exceptional Staff = 5 Stars","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-06-06","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"I grew up in New York. I have stayed in many different hotels in Manhattan ranging from very pricey high end hotels (Mandarin, Peninsula, Ritz Carlton) to some pretty pedestrian hotels (Sheraton on 7th Avenue, the old Hotel Pennsylvania across from Penn Station) and lots of hotels in between. I was really impressed with the Conrad and ultimately the thing that really made the difference was the quality and training of the staff. Really top notch. \n\nThis hotel was originally constructed as an Embassy Suites. It is located adjacent to Goldman Sachs\u2019 (unmarked) headquarters building and the story I heard is that Goldman has owned the hotel for years but its staff was refusing to stay at an Embassy Suites and was staying at the nearby Ritz Carlton Battery Park (now the Wagner). So about 7 years ago they reflagged the hotel as a Conrad. The building is obviously the same with the trademark Embassy Suites soaring atrium and rooms split into a small bedroom and sitting area to form a small suite but they have redone all the finishes,  furniture and soft goods. The end product is very nice and they did a great job making the hotel feel upscale. There is a nice but small rooftop bar and the lobby is very welcoming. \n\nIf you scroll through the reviews here you will see that the general manager, Marlene Poynder, carefully reviews and comments on reviews. That shows her attention to detail. You will also see that some of the guest relations staff is regularly mentioned - Doris Fong and Michael Remo in particular - and with good reason. Many Hilton hotels use a text messaging system through the Hilton app and direct to your phone to welcome you to the hotel and address requests. My experience at almost all Hiltons is that this is useful for routine requests but you rarely see the same person responding to you and frequently wait some time for a response. Moreover anything that is more than routine does not seem to work well with the text message system. Not so at the Conrad. Doris, Michael and their colleagues were very attentive and gave me very personal attention and service both before and during my stay and went out of their way to address my requests and be proactive. \n\nThe hotel was sold out both nights of our two night stay and for the night of our departure. Nonetheless the staff jumped through hoops and accommodated a request for slightly early check in (2pm), a late checkout (2:30) and even a particular room request and upgrade. I am a diamond member but these are all things I would not expect to receive at a 100% sold out hotel so kudos to the team for working some magic and somehow accommodating my requests. By the way despite the fact that the hotel was sold out it never felt busy. No lines at the front desk or elevator or anywhere else. \n\nI noted that some of the reviews mention issues at breakfast. I made a breakfast reservation on\nOpentable to avoid waiting - and we arrived to an empty restaurant. The host told me during the week they have a business rush around 8am but the big crowds come on the weekends. I took a look in opentable and noted that they block out the ability to make reservations on Saturdays and Sundays between 8am and 11:30 which is the unfortunate. We had a nice diamond breakfast but my suggestion if you are staying on the weekend - either make 8am reservations online and get down there early or get breakfast elsewhere. There is a decent bagel shop on the street level and lots of other options nearby. I would opt for paying for breakfast outside the hotel rather than wasting time waiting around to be seated for a free breakfast. \n\nWe also had lunch at the bar in the restaurant and cocktails on the rooftop. Both were great and again the service differentiated the bars from your standard hotel bar. \n\nHousekeeping was timely and attentive. Every staff member we passed in the hallways made eye contact and greeted us. Same for the front desk staff, bellmen and concierge. \n\nOur room was very nice. Be aware that many rooms only have showers (no tubs) so if this is a concern be sure to call the hotel direct so you can book an appropriate room category. Apparently people fight for the upgraded Hudson River views. There are large multistory windows on every floor that let you take in the view and perhaps I am a bit jaded as a New Yorker but the view of New Jersey doesn\u2019t really impress me (some rooms probably have a view of the Statue of Liberty far off in the distance). So if you don\u2019t get the upgrade don\u2019t be too disappointed!\n\nThe hotel has a great location. Google maps won\u2019t help you with this, but you can go out the hotel door, cross the street and enter the Brookfield Place office and shopping complex. Inside there are bars, restaurants and shops and a great upscale food court on the second level of the atrium.  Brookfield Place connects underground to the Oculus which serves as the transit hub but is also filled with more shops and restaurants and is an architectural masterpiece. You can basically walk over 1\/2 a mile all the way to Church Street underground. We arrived at Penn Station on Amtrak, took the E Train and basically only had to go outside to cross the street to the hotel after walking inside. Be sure to go inside and check it out. Great on a hot or rainy day. \n\nWe took an Uber to Chelsea Markets, walked the Highline, shopped and dined in the Meatpacking District and then rented Citi Bikes (currently just $3 for 30 minute ride) and took the dedicated bike way along the River back to the hotel. Of course do not miss visiting the 9\/11 memorial which is a short walk away. \n\nBottom line, this hotel differentiates itself not just with the all suite accommodations and great location but with top notch staff that has been very well trained and is helping to make a hotel that could easily just be a 3 star hotel one that I give 5 stars for the service. We spent some time in midtown of course and didn\u2019t mind our hotel being in lower Manhattan. \n","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Usually my wife and I go for a night, but this time we took our 4 and 7 year old boys. I haven't stayed in a ton of NYC hotels (did stay st the Park Hyatt once), but this is still the best.\n\nThe rooms are clean and spacious. Location needs a subway ride to the hustle and bustle, but that's why I love the Conrad....away from the crowds. It is situated in a nice business\/residential neighborhood right by the river. Close to the world trade and statue of liberty. There is a free little red downtown connection bus that makes a loop around the downtown area and stops in front of the hotel. Walk across the street to Brookfield Place Mall, down the escalator to an underground passage to the subway World Trade Center stop or path to NJ. Path to NJ is down on the weekends now so we parked in Jersey City and took the Harborplace ferry across the river, letting us off 200 ft from the hotel. Talk about convenience! (BTW if you take that option pay PATH fare and enter exchange place PATH. Immediately exit and they'll give you a round trip ferry voucher (just weekends while the WTC Path is closed for repairs).\n\nBreakfast is phenomenal and another reason I stay here. I'm a HHonors Diamond, but Gold and above get free breakfast for 2 (and kids 12 and under included as well). Nice full buffet or credit towards a la carte item.\n\nI tried the rooftop bar last time. Great views but didn't care for their cocktail menu as much, so this time I had cocktails at the Atrio bar in the lobby. If you like spice, I suggest the Picante, Picante.\n\nFinal tip - I found out at 4:35 through text when my room was ready that Fri and Sat there is a complimentary reception in Atrio bar from 3-5pm with wine and cheese. Unfortunately I didn't know this before and we were uptown at a museum at that point. But keep that in mind if you are checking in then or around. Personally, 5-7pm would be a better time .... Kimpton and Homewood Suites properties I've been to with a manager reception do it at that time. But at least know it is there if you'd like to use it.\n\nAnother score for the Conrad. Will definitely be back for more!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We enjoyed being a short subway ride away from all tourist spots while not being in the center of what you would consider a typical NYC tourist area.\n\nFYI-If you move anything in the minibar, you will be charged $25, even if you don't actually drink the item moved.  There is a notice near the minibar advising you of this.  We had bought bottled water for our room and milk for our youngest.

Conrad did that and more. \n\nFirstly, Doris, the head of guest relations, was in contact in the days leading up to and throughout our stay. Not only did she arrange a room upgrade so we had a beautiful view of the Irish Hunger Memorial and the Hudson, she made sure that a wonderful set of welcome amenities were waiting for us after our day exploring. \n\nShe gave superb recommendations for coffee, cheesecake, dinner reservations, even donuts! We tried every single one, and were not disappointed. The personalized experience and spectacular attention to detail throughout the stay was wonderful. I cannot say enough good things about Doris, she simply rocked. \n\nAs for the hotel itself, our room was SPOTLESS, even the shower head had been wiped dry before we arrived. The water pressure in the shower is the best I have ever experienced, my girlfriend and I even joked we wanted to stay just for the shower! The rooftop bar (pictured) was of course a bit pricey, but it\u2019s worth the experience and my girlfriend found it to be wonderful. \n\nThe breakfast buffet (girlfriend\u2019s plate pictured) was incredibly, and included with our diamond status. In the evening, their was a cheese and wine tasting that accented an incredible stay with just another fun and interesting event to partake. \n\nOnce again, I am hard pressed to say I found anything wrong during this entire stay. We had superb and responsive service from all the staff throughout our stay, and will happily be back when I return. \n\nConrad has made me happy to be a Hilton loyalist with this one!

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":208452,"title":"Great City Break","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-05-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"A short five night city break in April. After an 18 hour flight from Singapore we were ready for some relaxation, so the relatively short car transfer from Newark airport, and the friendly and efficient welcome at the Conrad check in were just what we needed. We were quickly in our room with the minimum of fuss.\n\nRooms are well equipped and ours was spotlessly clean. A small lounge area and good sized bathroom with separate shower room. Plenty of wardrobe space although the actual bedroom was quite small. Wifi was available in the room and throughout the hotel and was easy to stay connected without any breaks in service.\n\nThe main restaurant and bar is quite large and well laid out. Service at breakfast was very good and everything we ate was of a high standard. We didn't use the restaurant in the evening although did have a couple of visits to the bar which we enjoyed.\n\nThere is a further rooftop bar which is nice but is obviously subject to the weather. In April it was a bit chilly although there are heaters at some of the tables and the very friendly staff gave us a very warm welcome. It's a lovely location and I can imagine that it's a fantastic place to have a drink on a warm summers evening. \n\nLocation of the hotel is excellent in my view. Some good restaurants close by and a short walk into Tribeca where there are plenty of options. Close to the Business District and Battery Park areas and right next to the river with good views over to New Jersey. A short walk to the One World Observatory, 9\/11 memorial and 9\/11 museum. Nearest subway is probably no more than 500m away so access around Manhattan is relatively easy. So nice enough to feel connected to the city and the sights, but not surrounded by too many tourists!\n\nOverall we had a very enjoyable break. The usual Conrad hospitality was evident throughout and all of the staff were excellent. I was a little surprised that the hotel didn't have an Executive Lounge - having stayed at many Conrads and Hiltons across the globe and having HH Diamond status, this is always a welcome extra, but this small issue didn't detract at all from a great city break. When next in New York we will return to the Conrad and would happily recommend the hotel to others.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is in a quiet area with a few restaurants and a mall nearby.  It was cold when we were there, but it would be pleasant around the water with better weather.  Very close to the Oculus, so excellent subway connections.\nUnfortunately, there was no lounge, and, somehow it all felt a bit sterile -- no special feel or personality that you get at some hotels.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's super convenient to the starting line as well as the SI ferry, which is how we get back to Manhattan after the race.\n\nEveryone at this hotel is great as are the rooms and service. I love having a suite, especially when I have my bike, as there's extra room. The weekend breakfast buffet is great, especially since it's free for elite members.\n\nMy two, albeit fairly minor, gripes about this stay are:\n\n1 - They used to give elite members both the 1000 bonus points AND the free breakfast but now they make you choose. Don't get me wrong, most hotels make you choose one or the other but the Conrad used to give you both which was very nice. Pro tip - take the breakfast over the points as 1000 points aren't worth anything.\n\n2 - The concierge, while nice, didn't really know anything. I asked him a few questions and he always had to look it up on his computer and didn't seem to know where anything was. I can Google things myself but wanted his professional opinion, which didn't seem to be an option.\n\nAnyway, all in all it was a great stay and I will likely be back again, especially for the Five Boro Bike Tour.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We picked Conrad New York for its connivence to many nearby transportation options and that the weekend rates were lower.  \n\nAfter taking the escalator to the Atrium Lobby we were amazed by the many aerial art sculptures suspended from above pleasantly filling the Atrium air space.\n\nAt the front desk, we were warmly greeted and welcomed as if we were returning guests.\n\nOur room suite 924 came with King size bed, night stands, double closets, and large screen HDTV; large sitting area with a very comfortable sofa and easy chair, coffee table, desk and chair, and large screen HDTV.  The refreshment center had a coffee maker, specialty coffee k-cups, and mini bar. \n\nBoth the bedroom and living room were well decorated and coordinated in light color beiges and off-whites with light wood trimmings.  The bedroom view was overlooking the Hudson River flanked by buildings on both sides of the Irish Hungry Memorial below.\n\nThere were 2-USB ports and 1-electric plug above each night stand.  There were additional electrical plugs at the desk.\n\nThe bathroom was large with quartz top sink vanity and dual buttons toilet.. Adjacent to the bathroom entering from the hallway, the separate expansive walk-in shower had a rain shower & handheld spray, and was beautifully decorated marble tiles on the floor and walls.\n\nThere are four elevators and they are very fast.  Once inside two of the elevators, I had a bird's eye view of the entire hotel interior core as the elevator goes flying up to the upper floors. The building is well design with guest rooms on the exterior perimeter with inside walkway opening to the Atrium air space where natural light streams into the building from above constantly.  Natural lighting provides a very comfortable atmosphere\n\nOn the Atrium Lobby level, the Fitness Center, Business Center, & the Barber Shop is available to guests \u2014 \nFitness Center:\nThe fitness room is very good size with good variety of equipment along with hot & cold water dispenser, and towels.

The Atrium lounge area was especially nice since it was quiet setting for sitting & relaxing under the aerial art sculptures.\n\nIn a nutshell:\nBed mattress - firm and very comfortable \nPillow - several pillows per bed & fluffy\nBathroom - very roomy\nShower - separate, rain shower & hand spray\nSofa & Chair - comfortable & no sunken spots\nElec Outlets\/USB ports - yes...bed & at desk\nView - Hudson River & Irish Hungry Memorial \nNatural Lighting - western exposure\nElectrical Lighting - good for relaxing & reading\nRoom Cleanliness- Yes\nFresh Linens & Towels - Yes\nStaff -  very friendly & helpful \nPublic Space - very relaxing and comfortable\n\nLocated in Battery Park, the hotel is central to many of New York\u2019s notable points of interest, including Tribeca, SoHo, Nolita, Bowery, Little Italy, Chinatown, Lower East Side.  There is easy access to the buses, subways, and ferries.\n\nEarly morning or late evening walks or jogs are ideal along the The Esplanade next to the Hudson River to burn those calories.\n\nIt felt like a luxury retreat in the heart of downtown.

The staff is incredibly cheerful, smart, and service-oriented.  They make a real difference to the experience. We were blown away by the proactive response of one of the housekeeping associates on the 15th level. We requested more decaf Nespresso pods.  She asked what room we were in so she could tell her co-worker to put extra pods in the room for us as well....above and beyond service! I was also impressed by the assistance provided through the proactive text service [Doris, Michael and Giulia]. They deserve credit for how they took care of us.\n\nSo what are two things that need improvement?\n1) BREAKFAST is kind of a bust. Each day of our three day stay required a wait for a table [up to 30 minutes]. When we were seated there were multiple tables around us that hadnt been cleared. One day the whole bar area was empty [see photo].  We had to ask to be seated there. The buffet offered a limited selection with very few changes. It felt more like a Hilton or Embassy Suites ...not a Conrad. The quality was meh..chopped melon [no berries], the pastries were cheap\/nasty, the bagels were hard [this is New York!], eggs seemed industrial. I'm sure many people were getting breakfast included as Honors members...the quality\/choice should still be better when you're paying almost $400 a night\n2) DIAMOND BENEFITS...no room upgrades: \"sorry but we're fully committed\" that's funny...you're showing upgraded rooms available on your website right now.  No 4 pm checkout [one of the staff told me the hotel wanted to get the housekeeping staff home early so they could enjoy Easter.

I will preface by saying I had gone to the hotel before making a reservation to see what accommodations could be made to ensure a happy occasion. My son, with a life-threatening condition, would be accompanying me and trust me - transitioning him without incident is difficult and challenging at best and most certainly can tax a modern-day \"saint\".  It seemed as though they would be up for the challenge but when I called back to confirm my reservation and make final plans, no one called back or answered my emails. I was upset but had my heart set on going to this hotel because of its location in Battery Park and the fact it was a Conrad property.  \n\nAfter numerous calls, I had the incredible good fortune of being directed to Doris Fong-Guest Relations Manager. We are Hilton Gold members and are loyal to Hilton properties but the professionalism and humanity that Doris showed us during our stay was unparalleled. She took care of every single tiny detail with her personalized style. She was the consummate host and through every moment of our stay she personally made sure someone was attending to our needs. Doris was extraordinary in every aspect and a shining example of what a Conrad Hilton property is all about. ATRIO Wine Bar & Restaurant is home to the quintessential bartender: Victor Diaz. Frank, the 2nd generation owner of the Barbershop\/hair Salon in the lobby of the hotel is remarkable and one has to make his place a must appointment.\n\nThese beautiful memories made with Doris and her incredible staff and co-workers highlight the fact I had never felt so embraced and welcomed - so much so - that leaving was bittersweet.  I have told countless people since then they MUST stay at this property and experience the Conrad Hilton in New York City Battery Park. I can hardly wait to go back and spend more glorious days with them and make more beautiful memories.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":208452,"title":"Very Nice and Spacious Hotel for Family Vacation\u2026Poor Customer Service.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-04-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"EDIT \u2013 Originally posted this last year.  Because it contained a complaint about their customer service, a Conrad hotel rep (Nancy Orlarei) left a reply to my review to contact her to further discuss my family\u2019s experience.  I sent her multiple emails to follow up, but never received any response.  I tried to update my review to include her non response, but Trip Advisor\u2019s bot assumed I was making a different update and put a temp hold on my review.  \n\nThe location has many amenities.  The hotel is situated above many shops and restaurants.   There was a wine store, and a small market where one could buy drinks and snacks.  Across the street is the Brookfield Place mall (some luxury shops like Gucci & Louis Vuitton, nice sized upscale food court & grocery, also a Rite Aid location).  Two blocks away is the World Trade Center and 9\/11 Memorial.  Oculus Shopping Mall is right next to the WTC, and holds an Eataly inside and access to the subway system.   \n\nThe hotel gym is fairly small.  It has several treadmills and elliptical machines.  Good amount of dumbbells going up to 50 pounds, and a weight cable machine.  So one can get a solid workout.  They provide towels, bottle water, and even headphones in the gym.  It would be nice if they put a few clocks in the gym.  I don\u2019t think most people work out wearing a watch, so it was hard to keep track of time.  \n\nWe chose to stay here for a family vacation because even though the property is located pretty far south of the major attractions in Manhattan, the 750 sq ft of space was great to have for our kids during the long trip.  Having a small dining table, and two bathrooms, was ideal for our family.  As others have commented, the rooms are modern and kept very clean.  I loved having the large sectional couch in our room.  Which also contained a pull out bed.  And with the added length of the sectional, one could possibly sleep three people on the couch.  There was a mini fridge in addition to the mini bar.  So one could keep drinks and other items cold.  \n\nWe had the corner Luxury Suite, which produced some awkward layouts in the main bathroom.  Even though the overall size of the bathroom is quite large, the shower space gets narrow very quickly when going inside and standing at the shower head.  The dual sinks in the main bathroom are also quite narrow, so it doesn\u2019t give you a lot of space when washing hands or brushing teeth.  Because of the layout of the shower and toilet doors on each side of the sinks, there wasn\u2019t a lot of space for them to install bigger sinks.  Conversely the sink in the half bathroom is quite large, and is the one I ended up using for most the majority of the trip.  One issue with the half bathroom is that there is no place to hang a towel, so I had to leave my hand towel next to the sink.  The half bathroom is also spacious, so I can\u2019t understand why they wouldn\u2019t install a small towel rack, or even just a hook on the wall.  Also, the sliding door to the half bathroom doesn\u2019t close all the way.  Not an issue for us since we are family, but if one is having guests over, there is not complete privacy in the half bathroom. \n\nOne major complaint about the furniture in the hotel room is the coffee table.  The top is a triangle, and it\u2019s base consist of three legs.  So it looks nice, but it wasn\u2019t very steady.  Putting any significant weight on any of the three sides made the table topple over.  I discovered this when I put on of my bags on the table.  What is worse is that one of my kids was drawing on the table, and the table toppled over and severely bruised his big toe.  And since there is a lot of walking to be done with any New York trip, it was very uncomfortable for him for a few days.  We asked the front desk if they could replace the coffee table with a steadier four-leg model, but they said they only have the triangle table available.  In which case we had them remove it from our room.  So just a word of warning to others who might be staying with small children who will spend a lot of time in the living room.  I recommend putting the coffee table away to the side of the room, or just having the hotel remove it altogether.  They sent a security guard to take a report regarding the incident\/injury, but didn\u2019t offer any other medical assistance beyond a band aid and ice from the ice machine.  I know this is primarily a hotel catering to business professionals, but their lack of response to my son\u2019s injury was disconcerting.\n\nOne final issue, and I\u2019m not sure if this is Conrad\u2019s policy or Hilton\u2019s.  The hotel would not honor my Hilton Gold status because I had used Chase points to book the hotel.  And \u201ctechnically\u201d that counted as a third party booking the hotel, and not me booking the reservation.  Gold status would have allowed me a complimentary continental breakfast each morning.  And from my understanding the continental breakfast is just some bread and juice.  It seemed rather stingy of them to not allow it.  At a stay at the Conrad Tokyo also made with rewards points, Hilton status was honored and their $35 breakfast buffet became complimentary.  We did try breakfast at the Atrio restaurant in the hotel.  I would highly recommend the Avocado Toast, but their Scrambled Eggs Bruschetta was disappointing.\n\nOverall the large space of our hotel room made our week long stay in New York much more comfortable and relaxing.

I had emailed the Conrad New York ahead of time to make sure that our stay would be kid-friendly, fun and perfect for the purpose we had planned. However, things started going wrong at online check-in. We had been upgraded to a river view suite as a Hilton Diamond and we were checking in for a room on the 15th floor in the app. As I was attempting to check-in, it timed out and crashed. I had restarted the app and the room was gone. Instead it was putting me in a room on the 7th floor. I had contacted the front desk and the were able to assign me a room on the 11th floor, but my originally selected room was gone. We lose a few floors in view, but not the end of the world. But then as I emailed to confirm that I had my requested preferences, I was told that the room does not have a bathtub and was shower only. With young kids, a bathtub is a must-have! Clearly the people in charge of assigning rooms here have no clue. (They suggested putting an infant tub in the shower for my 4-year old - which absolutely would not work.) Or I can downgrade back to my originally booked room with no view to get a bathtub. As I was already en route to the hotel, I decided to just deal with it in person. When I arrived, the front desk staff (Lisa(?)) explained the same thing. Or I can pay to upgrade the 2nd and 3rd nights to an executive room during my stay (as it was sold out the 1st night) for an extra $190\/night which does have a bathtub. Note to all Hilton Diamonds - I asked and was told that they do NOT offer complimentary multi-category upgrades to luxury suites or executive suites or beyond. Anyway, my app was showing a nor1 upgrade to the Conrad suite for $200\/night so that wasn't much of an accommodation at all! She proceeded to tell me to just book the app upgrade because she can't offer anything better. So we took the app upgrade and paid extra to take the Conrad suite.\n\nThe Conrad suite itself is huge and having all the space is so nice with kiddos, but there were a few things wrong when we checked in. The whirlpool tub was showing an error (which we had to call down to fix), the TV in the bathtub is missing a remote so cannot turn on (which we had to call down - but they didn't have the remote, so it remained off the entire 3 nights), the blinds in the office are broken and cannot be pulled up to open, the powder room toilet clogged (which we had to call down to fix), there are only 2 thermostats for multiple rooms so we could never get the temperature right in all of the rooms, the lights randomly turned off (we assume there is a motion sensor somewhere, but we never figured out where), and the cute bell hop outfit stuffed bulls are not available anymore - we received ones wearing cheap white shirts.\n\nAs the welcome amenity, we received one still water, one sparling water, and a small box of chocolates as a Diamond. (I've seen photos of fruit trays, but we never received one.) They also did send a birthday cake, but for some reason told me they couldn't send it due to our nut allergy because the mix is made offsite. I informed them of the nut allergy a week ahead of our arrival, but they waited until the last night of our stay to let us know. We did work it out so they could send it up to us (birthday boy doesn't have the allergy), but they sent a carrot cake. For a kid turning 5. I've seen photos of red velvet birthday cakes and chocolate birthday cakes - not sure why they thought carrot cake would go over well with a 4 year old turning 5. It didn't. Oh well, guess it's the thought that counts. (But it seems like there sure are a lot more misses than hits here.)\n\nAlso, as a Diamond, breakfast is included as part of the package. They had buffet on the weekends and a la carte on the weekdays. Our Saturday buffet was uneventful, all the food was fine. Nothing really stood out. However, there are no made-to-order eggs (i.e. no omelettes) as part of the package - you'd have to pay additional at the a la carte prices. However the Sunday buffet - omg, was a nightmare. The guy at check in was not friendly at all and were quoted a 20 minute wait for a table. We asked if we can wait back in the room (since we had small kids with us) and was told no. Once we finally got seated, they were running out of food and did NOT restock. Our waiter took pity on us and gave us a fruit plate when there was literally no fruit left in the buffet (thank you for the gesture - it was greatly appreciated). I understand they were busy. There is no exec lounge at this Conrad, so all the Hilton gold and diamond people end up at the restaurant. However, this is still supposed to be a high end restaurant at a high end hotel. ACT LIKE IT!! This exact scenario I would expect at an Embassy Suites or maybe a Hilton (although I've had much better experiences at both ES and Hilton properties before), but not a Conrad. Get it together!!","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The architecture is somewhat reminiscent of the Hyatt Regency hotels as rooms surround the periphery of the atrium.\nOur suite at the Conrad Hotel in NYC was spacious and very comfortable. The room was surprisingly quiet throughout our three night stay. The decor is conservatively sedate and contemporary. The bedroom and living room area are comfortably large. The living room has a couch, which perhaps converted to a bed, a television, desk and coffee table. The bar area contained a Nespresso coffee maker w\/ accompanying necessities, e.g., coffee mugs, espresso cups, etc.\n The bathroom amenities are excellent and our room had an enormous shower, bigger than most cruise ship bathrooms. The configuration of the shower may not be comfortable for people not related sharing a room. It did not seem convenient to put a towel and\/or robe w\/in the shower \"stall\". To term it a \"stall\" is a misnomer considering its size. At the risk of belaboring the point about the shower's size, grab bars on the walls should be considered.\nOur particular room did not have an impressive view. We faced an office building which was too close to leave our drapes open. If views are important to you, a room on an upper floor may be preferable. \nThe location of the hotel is excellent in terms of dining. There are a lot of nearby restaurant choices, a shopping mall across the street and a \"bagelry\" almost outside the door of the hotel.\nIts location of the hotel to the Freedom Tower and the Memorial may be of importance to visitors and a poignant reminder.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I read a comment where a guest said you can see through the frosted glass door of the bathroom, but that's not true of any room we've stayed in. It's also a mistake to believe that tourism is centered in midtown around Times Square because it's not. Many of the biggest tourism sites in Manhattan are in the financial district and the lower half of Manhattan has a heavy concentration of great restaurants compared to the Times Square area.

I wanted Mgmt to know that we booked this after finding out about it from World Venture but we were too late signing up for that group. Suggestions: bar should open before noon as NYC is an international city, and there should be iphone outlets or or least outlets in the massive seating areas. Fabulous courteous service. Thoughtful touches abound (see cord wrap). Ask for a room on the river, more expensive but worth it. Would definitely stay here again.

Booked a 2 x double bed suite with sofa bed (1418) which meant we all had a decent sized bed, critical on such a short incredibly busy sightseeing trip, when we all woke up at different times of the night due to time difference\/jet lag.\n\nCheck in was informative and really friendly, perfect when we were tired. My pre arrival request to have sofa bed made up had been actioned, thank you. Equally check out and bell gentlemen were friendly and extremely helpful.\n\nHousekeeping exceptional. Extra towels when requested as well as ice.\nShower fantastic pressure and great amount of space.\n\nDowntown is a super choice for a quieter location, which suited us at the end of busy days and close to many subways. We happily used the subway during the day and cab at night back from Midtown. Bit confusing but do some homework and it's ok. New Yorkers always seemed happy to help if we looked confused. \n\nThe Conrad is moments away from 9\/11 memorial and One World Observatory. Both museum and memorial are must sees in our opinion. It has been so tastefully done and incredibly respectful to the victims and their families. There is so much to see and read, I suspect everyone leaves having read or seen something different that particularly resonates with and will stay with them for life.\n\nThank you Conrad.

We had avoided downtown for the most part, thinking that being by Central Park is better. \n\nWe decided to try the Conrad New York through the Amex Hotel Collection and boy, are we glad we did. It\u2019s location in a quiet part of Battery Park beats Central Park any day. The view from our suite (725) was ridiculously picturesque. There is a good amount of storage in the suite, as well as a very comfortable bed, separate sitting room, huge and powerful shower, and thoughtful touches.\n\nWe tried breakfast, dinner and happy hour at the hotel restaurant. We also had room service. Everything was terrific. There is a great variety of choices on the menus. Special note to Hilton Gold (and up) members - the free breakfast is extremely generous, and the included buffet on the weekends is huge, including just about anything you could imagine at multiple stations. I was particularly impressed by the multiple egg choices (even scrambled egg whites on the buffet) and meat choices.  Also varieties of potatoes, cereals, pastries, yogurt, oatmeal, fruit, breads, juices, cheeses, things I can\u2019t even remember...You can eat as healthy or as unhealthy as you want at this buffet. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to eat at the hotel, there are other dining options such as Shake Shack attached to the building, as well as a movie theater. Brookfield Place (high end mall with Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Burberry, Herm\u00e8s, and the like) is directly across the street and through it, you can connect underground all the way to the Oculus, where you can catch just about any subway line you need to get anywhere in Manhattan. In this mall and connecting underground corridor (which is extremely well lit, well traveled, and safe day and night) are many, many food and dining options, including an Eataly. \n\nIf all this weren\u2019t enough to impress us, the neighborhood itself was really special. It\u2019s a quiet, upscale, lovely corner of Manhattan that never seemed noisy and overwhelmingly crazy. Yes, we\u2019ve enjoyed staying by Central Park, and a little \u201chustle and bustle\u201d is part of the fun of NYC, but it\u2019s also nice to return to a quieter, homier, yet decidedly upscale area at the end of the day.

Housekeeping was a true gem in providing a bucket of ice without even asking when they saw our bottle of champagne during turn down service and providing literally a bag full of toiletries when requested.

The hotel itself was relatively quiet even on New Year\u2019s Eve , just a little noise from the cinema.  \n\nGreat to have an umbrella to take out , even though I forgot it the only day it rained. \n\nAll staff were friendly , only issue was our room wasn\u2019t ready on arrival when we went back 1 1\/2 hr later they tried to give us a low level room, we raised this and they found us a room ready towards the top floor. We weren\u2019t bothered about Hudson views but the walk to our room took us past a lovely view over the Irish Famine memorial (nicer than sounds) with the river behind. \n\nThe hotel location is to be recommended, close to a lot of the things we wanted to do and see, and restaurants, shops, nice little bagel shop for breakfast just outside too. \n\nIt felt very safe, and to walk out past the 911 memorial each day was poignant, the whole area has been managed so sensitively, even with all the people around it felt calm and serene. \n\nI would recommend this hotel to anyone planning to stay in New York, alone, couple or families.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

What a lovely hotel!!!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-01-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"We travel a lot and while we like a great hotel, we appreciate a good value. Staying in Manhattan, often means very limited space, despite price paid. This hotel was a really great surprise. When we visit our children, we consider those trips utility and mostly look for a good value in the location we desire. These are not our \"vacations\" and they really just need to be clean, pleasant and well located. We enjoy staying at different properties, which keeps our travels from getting boring if we go back to the same location.  One of our kids lives in the financial district, so we tend to stay near her apartment. This was in battery park, so a quick uber ride and turned out to be amazing.\n\nThe location is great. Right across the street from a high end shopping mall with an equally fancy food court and Starbucks that opens up early.  There is a movie theatre in the building and it is easy access to all of Manhattan by car or train.\n\nThis is a 5 star hotel without any of the usual pretentious attitude you get from a 5* hotel. They are like a fancy \"all suite\" hotel. Great gym. Staff is all super helpful. Hotel is new and extremely clean. House keeping is great.  Turn down service and they are environmentally responsible!  Lots of towels, lovely linens, they give you bottled water. Unlimited hot water, with good water pressure. HUGE shower, HUGE room and we got a lovely room with a water view, which was VERY nice.  The room had a great feeling. The temperature in the room was perfect and there was none of that on and off radiator sound all night. Elevators where efficient and even the longest shower never left any steam in the room. The joys of a new building.  The lobby is modern and sparse, with sort of a modern odd vibe, but serves the purpose.  We had brunch for $28\/ person and for NYC that is a fair price for an all you can eat situation. The food was fresh, the view was nice and the table was quiet.  It was very cold, so we stuck to cars, but there are lots of things to walk to close by! Internet was free and fast. 2 TV's in the room and sliding screens that you could divide off the different areas of the room and that is for a standard room. Bed was comfortable, linens where very nice and lots of great storage space. Would not have minded a little more lighting in the sitting area, which was kind of dark, but that may be part of the whole energy efficient LEED certification thing. Either way, that was the only thing that was not perfect and even that was fine.  You can also stream your own Netflix and such from your phone on their TV units.  \n\nWe got an amazing deal on hotwire, so the value was beyond our wildest dreams. Even for what most people paid, it is a wonderful place to stay. Sometimes the hotels we stay at, in Manhattan or so tiny. Like a bed with walls around it, and for a higher cost.  \n\nSTAY HERE, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!!!! Looking forward to staying here again.It was surprisingly perfect! Oh, and they will mail your letter for free. Just a little extra that makes you feel like you are getting really great service.  This hotel is the perfect blend of price and amenities. Really outstanding and very impressed. Thanks Conrad. We will be back.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":208452,"title":"Loud rooms and poor service at check-in, but great location.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-12-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"My husband and I spent 3 nights at the Conrad choosing it with the expectation of a quiet stay to enjoy the city at Christmastime. I specifically booked this hotel because it offers a separate living area which we needed as we were both working remotely on Christmas Eve. Upon arrival at the hotel, it was a lovely lobby area \u2013 very modern and spacious. I believe this was formerly an Embassy Suites hotel which you can immediately see in the design of the lobby. \n\nErika was the young woman at the front desk to check us in. We are Hilton Honors Gold members and asked if there were any upgrades available to which Erika immediately responded that we had already been upgraded which was a pleasant surprise. We received our keys and made our way to room 1428. I had booked the room myself on the Hilton website and knew immediately that this room was not an upgrade from what I had reserved. It was smaller than I thought it would be and the view, which is supposed to be a view of the Hudson River, is really a partial view of the Hudson River. I headed back to the lobby to find out if I had misunderstood Erika. Based on the look on Erika\u2019s face when she saw me, I realized that she knew we had not really been granted an upgrade. I told her that the room we were given was the room I had reserved online and she immediately acknowledged that, no, it was not really an upgrade. So, my question is, did she know when she gave us the keys hoping that we wouldn\u2019t know any better or was a legitimate mistake. I would think that when your main job is to check guests into their rooms, you would know if a guest is getting an upgrade or not. She said that they did honor the request I had made online for a quiet room, though, by giving us a room away from the elevator. That didn\u2019t make any sense, either, since you literally walk by only one other room to get to the elevator from 1428. I mentioned that the room was a little on the small side and the obstructed view of the Hudson wasn\u2019t expected and if there were any other rooms available. She actually said that there were no upgrades available for me. She said there were other rooms available, but nothing that she would be able to give me and I think it was her delivery that threw me. It was almost a condescending attitude that I didn\u2019t appreciate. She did offer some vouchers in place of an upgrade. When I got to the room, I saw that they were $20 vouchers for 1 drink at the bar and neither my husband nor I drink, so that was something that wasn\u2019t a benefit to us. I understand that upgrades are only granted when they\u2019re available and had Erika told us at check-in that there were no upgrades available, I would have been fine with that. But, to be told that we had been upgraded only to find out that, in fact, there we were not and then to be told that there were no upgrades available for us, is unacceptable. An expectation was set and then revoked. \n\nSo, seeing as there was nothing that Erika was going to do to accommodate us, we had to make the best of the situation. Unfortunately, it ended up being far from quiet in our room. The guest above us was so loud, we thought that they must have non-carpeted floors. I couldn\u2019t believe the banging and the knocking that was coming from that room, not only during the day, but late into the night. Also, the doors to the guest rooms are so heavy and there\u2019s no soft-close feature, so you just hear banging when guests or housekeeping is entering or leaving a room. Every time the heat would kick on in our room, there was another loud banging noise coming from behind the thermostat where the duct work is. \n\nThe bathrooms are awkward in that the shower leads right out into the hallway and there\u2019s no place to lay your clothing should you want to dress before leaving the shower \u2013 you\u2019re either walking out into the guest room in a towel or naked which is fine if you\u2019re alone or with your spouse, but anyone else, it would be awkward. The door to the room with the sink and commode is a swing door with a considerable gap around the perimeter of the door, so no real privacy if you need it. The floor of the room is not level with a significant drop leading from the hallway to the bedroom. It\u2019s very unsettling and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s due to the hallway being tiled and the bedroom carpeted, but it\u2019s a horrible transition that should have been addressed during remodeling. \n\nNo experience is all bad. I thought housekeeping did a very nice job and, aside from the stained carpet, the rooms were clean with a good supply of toiletries and plenty of towels. The WiFi was very fast; the robes and slippers are comfortable and there\u2019s even an umbrella for use on those rainy NYC days. There\u2019s an in-room safe and there is a fridge, but don\u2019t place any personal items in it as you will be charged $25 which is notated at the bottom of the mini-bar menu. The lights in the room and shower are dim and the control panel for the lights is awkward.  Sean, the host greeting guests at breakfast was very friendly and always had a smile on his face. \n\nThe breakfast buffet was average, at best. Nothing anymore extravagant than what you would find at a Holiday Inn Express offering scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fruit, bread, oatmeal, etc. I thought the location of the hotel was very convenient as you can walk right over to Brookfield Place and through the Oculus to get to Fulton Street station to catch the subway. There\u2019s more than enough shopping within walking distance offering everything from Louis Vuitton to Starbucks to Target. \nWhat I would say to management is that first impressions are everything and clearly the front desk staff does not consider the comfort of its guests a priority and for a hotel, that should be priority #1. This is supposed to be like your home away from home and by the 2nd night, I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to my home and some peace and quiet. It was just one annoyance after another. I had thought of going back downstairs to discuss with the front desk our concerns, but considering Erika\u2019s attitude, I didn\u2019t think it would be worth it as I think the attitude of management is almost always reflected in the attitude of its staff members, so if Erika wasn\u2019t willing to accommodate us, most likely it\u2019s what she\u2019s directed to do by management. Also, she made it clear at check-in that there were no other rooms she could give us, so I felt that we were stuck where we were. Unfortunate experience and I question the value of being a Hilton Honors Gold member.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I also want to thank the staff at Atrio for accommodating my food requests for my family. Also, in advance I am a Hilton Diamond member, so anything I'm referring to about upgrades \/ food could be based on that status...not trying to brag, but just as an fyi. Based on my experience, I think you would have a wonderful stay even as a low level Hilton status member though. \n\nWe had a really bad flight in to LGA and our driver to the hotel was terrible, so my wife and baby and I were very tired (and honestly grumpy) when we arrived. The staff at the Conrad New York were standing by the entrance to the hotel greeting us with smiles on their faces. The bellhop immediately took our bags and said he would have them to our room as soon as we checked in, which is a small thing but when you're tired and have a cranky baby, it's nice to not have to worry about your bags as well. \n\nThe first night there wasn't an upgrade available, but Richard said that he would keep an eye out. The standard room is very nice, but I was secretly hoping that a Hudson River view would open up. (more on that later). The staff had put a crib in our room with a Conrad stuffed bear that our daughter absolutely adored, along with a note from the manager welcoming us to the hotel. \n\nOur first morning we went to Atrio for breakfast. The food during the week is to order, and on the weekends it's a buffet layout (there is a to-go desk however). My food recommendation is the french toast, my wife and I got it multiple mornings because it was so good. We ordered fresh fruit for my daughter and they brought her a huge bowl of fresh raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries...and I mean fresh, I couldn't find fruit that looked that good at the Whole Foods by my house. \n\nTo jump ahead to stay on the food subject, multiple mornings my family and I were in a rush and couldn't find time to sit down and eat before a sight reservation, so we would typically eat on the subway. The Atrio staff were very accommodating about providing orders to go, so our daughter could get her fruit and we could get our french toast fix. It's really the little things, but they provided a sturdy paper bag and solid containers for the food...it wasn't a plastic bag and styrofoam that would have probably went everywhere. \n\nFriday we went to talk to Richard about an upgrade and he was able to find a Hudson River view room for us on Saturday(hurray), and if you have the chance to get one, do it. The view is amazing. We had all our bags packed in our old room, and while we were sight-seeing, the staff moved them to our new room (again, it's the little things). \n\nThe Conrad New York is walking distance to the subways, and as a tip that I didn't know until a few days into our stay...there's a mall across from the hotel and you can get from it underground to the Oculus. Very helpful if it's raining. Just leave the hotel via the back entrance and walk across the street. You're also walking distance (albeit a bit longer of a walk) to the Statue of Liberty cruises. The Irish Hunger Memorial across the street is interesting to walk through, they have stones from each of the counties in Ireland. \n\nAll in all, we had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend the Conrad New York to anyone.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel has a gym, restaurant, barber center(paid) and a computer room for usage by the guests.\n\nThe rooms are very nice. There's a sitting area which opens in to the bedroom. Sitting area contains sofas and working table as well as a TV. \nThe bedroom has a queen bed, another widescreen TV, couple of wardrobes. The shower area and rhe bathroom are in separate enclosures, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe room has a coffee maker, couple of telephones, touch pad lighting, iron for pressing clothes. Rooms were cleaned regularly to perfection.\n\nCons\n\nFor some reason, the wifi in my room was pathetic! It's hard to believe how that can ne an issue in such an upscale hotel! I called them couple of times to complain. First time they routed me to a tech team who tried doing some refresh but did not help. Second day they offered me to change my room, but it was late at night so i let it go.\n\nTheir room service is not the greatest. I ordered food couple of days and it took really long to deliver. Once i ordered food from outside and asked them to give me plates and cutleries. It took them two reminders and 45 minutes to give it to me.\n\nThe days I ordered food from outside, they refused to deliver it to my room via a doorman. The lady at the reception flatly said I have to go and get it from the lobby. Not something you would except from a 5 star hotel!\n\nOverall, a decent hotel but few loose ends to tie to make it a great one.\n\n","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

When maintenance came up the next day, they realized the wires were crossed, and apparently had been that way for quite a while.\n\nThe first night, I was awakened at 12:05 a.m. with a cracking sound behind my headboard.

Top that with a good gym in the hotel and a SoulCycle just a block or so away, you can stay in shape at the same time.\n\nStaff was very friendly.\n\nAtrio is a great place for breakfast and lunch.\n\nThe hotel has a contemporary design; I believe it may be a remodeled hotel but I wasn't mad at it.  I truly loved my room and the amenities.  I would definitely stay here again!","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My husband, my son and daughter (21 and 18) were there for a week. The hotel is really nice, with a very modern lobby, and amazing views of the Hudson River. The room was perfect for the four of us, we stayed at the one bedroom\/two double beds room, that was separate from the living area with a sofa bed and a table, which was perfect to have more space. The hotel is very modern and just across from a great mall with many restaurants and an ice rink during winter time. We love the area downtown, it is becoming one of the best areas to stay in NY. World Trade Center is just one block from the hotel and the subway is right there! There is a rooftop bar at the hotel but it was closed due to winter season.

You are also next to the Tribeca which is awash with great restaurants and bars (up and along Greenwich Street) which are well worth a visit.\n\nAs with all Conrad hotels, the rooms are all-suite with a sitting room, parlor, bar, walk in shower and bathroom with pretty much everything you need - two TVs, minibar, Nespresso machine which is free to use with complimentary coffee pods, central control of all the lighting.  The beds are of the low level type, so this may be a concern for those who have trouble stooping down to get into bed I must point out.\n\nI made a request prior to arrival because this trip was for my husband's birthday and the hotel made a lovely cake for him and it was ready for us when we arrived in our room, and we got a complimentary bottle of wine on the day we left.  This pretty much sums the Conrad New York up - nothing is too much trouble and the staff work really hard to make sure you have a fantastic time.  The worst part was having to check out, but even then the concierge chased up our airport transfer back to Newark when they didn't turn up on time.\n\nSo in summary another excellent experience,  No, it isn't cheap to stay here, but then quality has to be paid for.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Great views of the Hudson. 3- The bed was very comfortable, had a great nights sleep. The hotel has a roof top bar with great popsicle drinks and great views of the river.

Definitely the nicest  and largest rooms - though I agree with other reviews about the layout being a bit odd with the shower separate from the toilet and sink.  Also, the doors don't create for the most privacy when using the toilet.  It would be better if they had a fan, but I think this is a rare thing in hotels.\nThe lighting is very interesting - touch screen on\/off buttons and a master button that turns all the lights off at once when you're leaving.\nFor me, one of the most important criteria for a good hotel is how soundproof the rooms are.  In general, these were decent.  However, we could hear the person walking (stomping) around above us pretty well, especially when laying in bed.  If you have an early waker above you, you might be disturbed - even with a white noise machine, we could hear it.  I always try to be mindful of my footsteps when I stay in a hotel because of the people below me.  \nThe other problem was the proximity of the movie theater.  Our first night, we could even hear the movie IN our room!  It was very noticeable in the lobby area.  We asked to move to another room, and the staff were WONDERFUL.  They moved all our bags for us the next day and we received a room with a view of the Hudson River for the next 3 nights.  It was lovely.  \nI especially appreciate the message feature on the Hilton app - any time I had a question, I just sent a message and I would get a response fairly quickly.  For those of us that have adapted to text messaging, it's the way to go! \nWe are Diamond members, so our first day we received a hand-written note and a box of chocolates!  Way to show appreciation for loyalty, Conrad NYC!  We did not get this attention at the other two Conrads.\nWe also thoroughly enjoyed our discounted breakfast each morning - delicious!!  Definitely try the waffles.  Yum.\nSleep was great in our King bed and shower was AMAZING.  I think you could fit 4 people in that shower.  :D\nLocation was pretty good - our room looked down on the Irish Hunger Memorial, we were just a block from the 9\/11 Memorial and pools, and another block past that to the subway.  Our first day, we wandered down to Battery Park and back up through the historical section of downtown.  I had no idea there were some OLD buildings in there that date back to the beginnings of NYC.\nIf you like classy hotels with great service - this is the place for you!","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

After much research, mostly on Tripadvisor, I found the Conrad, which ticked off all the boxes. It is sometimes difficult to find hotels with rooms with two beds (I travel with my daughter and we both sleep better in separate beds). The great reviews of the Conrad sold me and the positive comments were accurate. The beds were very comfortable, room and living room (such a bonus!) spotless and it was very peaceful and quiet at the Conrad. I am a light sleeper and so this is very important to me. Check in and check out were very easy. We enjoyed the rooftop bar one evening and even though the weather was not that great, we got great views of the skyline and it was all very cheerful and fun. The server was gracious and knowledgeable. Others have commented on the interesting things to do very close by, so I will just say that compared to our last stay near Times Square, this felt so much more relaxed but it is also a fun and interesting area with lots to see and do close by. The Observation Tower was excellent and the memorial waterfalls powerful and sensitively done.\nWe will definitely be back!

Contemporary design, the rooms were huge - all rooms are suites with separate lounge area, wet room style shower and every amenity you could possibly want,  really comfy bed with great bed linen and pillows.  BTW the bath robes are divine and if they were not priced at $100 I would have bought one!  Great location - although a bit pricey as this is the financial district and most of the bars and restaurants are more expensive.  Also beware the hotel bar is very expensive - we had two cocktails - \u00a315 each and the boys had a gin each and the bill was $75.  However everything was perfect.  The service was spot on and nothing is too much trouble.  There is also a cinema complex on the top floor which proved really handy after we had checked out and had a couple of hours to spare before needing to leave for the airport.  Pick a Bagel just round the corner perfect for breakfast - or if you can find Stage Door Deli near 9\/11 memorial you must go for the experience. The Loopy Doopy bar is perfect if you have good weather - although again quite expensive.  I would stay here again if ever need to visit New York - location by the Hudson River was perfect in the summer.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":208452,"title":"Many wonderful things with a need for attention to detail","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-09-09","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We like this hotel.  In fact, I believe this is our third or fourth visit here because of many terrific aspects to this property ... it is located on a calm mostly residential street just a block or two from the hoopla of the financial district plus a block from the Hudson River, the rooms are all suites (being a former Embassy Suites) with contemporary decor, there are a number of parking garages nearby if we don't want to use the hotel valet, and there is a decent restaurant\/lounge on the premises at the lobby level.  However, there are some details that could use improvement in order to make this a five-star property.\n\nThis particular visit was a year after our previous one which had a number of problems to the point where a front desk manager moved us to a huuuuge apartment-sized suite during that stay (and that one had somebody else's pants in a drawer!) and then invited us to reach out to her so that she could handle our next reservation.  So for a belated anniversary weekend we decided to reach out to that manager once we made the reservation.  I emailed her and waited but didn't receive a response.  \n\nAfter a number of days I called the hotel to find that this manager no longer was at that property (here's a detail that was missed -- why didn't her email get shut down?), but I was put in touch with an assistant director of the front office who was very gracious in emailing me back.  When we arrived we were given a little upgrade to a suite with a river view on a high floor.  In general our suite was very nice -- I wasn't sure the a\/c was working but it turned out they had already checked it and it was indeed functioning fine.  \n\nWe tried going up to the rooftop bar (small) but it was inundated with raucous twenty-somethings so we opted for the more serene lounge on the lobby level to have drinks and snacks.  Another detail missed -- the furniture where we were seated had crumbs on the seats from previous patrons.  However, our server was super accommodating and even traded my original happy hour cocktail (too strong for me) for another cocktail without charging me the full price.  Snacks were deelish and we enjoyed being there.\n\nWhen we got back up to our room for a little rest before our evening started, I noticed that there was what appeared to be a dried blood stain on the curtain.  Again, a cleaning detail missed.  I texted with the front desk and they came and cleaned it while we were out for the evening.  For a hotel of this caliber I don't expect to see this sort of thing.  Plus, and this has always been the case with this hotel, the wooden blinds on the windows are tied together with plastic ties so that you cannot use them.  I don't understand this -- it looks a little shafty and why have blinds that guests cannot use?\n\nA really nice touch was when we returned we discovered a nice bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for us with a note of congratulations for our anniversary.  That was lovely.  And outside of the issues I've already talked about, our suite was comfortable and clean with a great view of the Hudson River.\n\nThis place could be spectacular if they just upped their game a little.  Nevertheless, it is a very good place to stay and we would consider another visit understanding that this is not quite the five-star property it could be with some attention to detail.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Going to the Conrad involves forgoing the midtown area that most first timers in New York stay in, but this was necessarily a bad thing. The Financial District downtown location is about 3 blocks from One World Trade Center and the 9\/11 Memorial. The Chambers St subway station and the World Trade Center are right by One World Trade Center, so you have a pretty easy rail link to JFK airport by subway or LIRR and Newark Airport by PATH, which is an important consideration. The subway makes up of the slightly out of the way location since you can be to Midtown and the sights in about 20 minutes or so. I liked how quiet the location was at night, though there's still stuff going on nearby.\n\nThe hotel used to be an Embassy Suites and as a result all rooms are still suites. It was nice to have the extra space in the room for sure, as I've heard NYC hotel rooms can be pretty small. However the design and furnishings in the room still felt like a fancy Embassy Suites to me rather than what I've seen at other Conrad hotels. \n\nI found the front desk staff to be very helpful, the associate that checked us in (unfortunately didn't catch his name) was able to accommodate our extremely early arrival at 830 am and get us into a room when all I was going to ask for was to store our luggage until check in. \n\nOne let down to me after great experiences at 3 previous Conrad's was the breakfast buffet. The food was passable, but far from anything special, definitely felt like and tasted like food I've had at an Embassy Suites breakfast buffet many times. The a la carte menu was pretty good however. \n\nI think we'd probably stay here again if the price point was right, I don't think I'd pay the Conrad price was what felt like a lesser experience for me though.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was a great size, perfectly clean and had all the modern bells and whistles. The lounge area really did it for me as it gives you just that extra space you need for a family of four over six days. \n\nThe lobby is truly breathtaking and so are the views across the Hudson to New Jersey.  The hotel in its own right deserves a five star rating, however the location is just as impressive. Step out and turn the corner to see the inspiring Freedom Tower reaching the heavens. The whole WTC area has obviously had a massive amount of investment which stands out for me compared to a crowded and frankly messy Times Square district. Here you have many places to eat and a brand new shopping mall under the site of the WTC. Subway is only five minutes walk. Alongside the Hudson and literally a step outside the hotel are some beautiful walkways leading to Battery Park. Perfectly safe in the evening with the views of New Jersey at sunset.\n\nMy only negative for The Conrad was the roof top bar. We did ask if children were allowed, however when my daughter (13) and I visited we felt very awkward and not welcome. To the point where the waitress took orders from two tables who sat down after we had. They never attended my table and I walked away. The roof top bar is open to non residents and my feeling is it is very much an after work meeting place for locals. The positive to this though is we attended the Atriam bar in the main lobby and got to know the great staff there. They were excellent and remembered us each day, even what we drank - first class service which more than makes up for the rude staff on the roof top.\n\nOverall an excellent hotel in a great location.

Great view of the Hudson, with easy access to the running trail and other riverfront spaces. Hotel entrance and lobby are well done.\n\nBut we struggled with the room design. The separate bathroom and shower - only accessible by walking out in the room - was awkward. And we found the lighting to be a pain in the neck. Some light switches work directly; others only in concert with the keypads located throughout the room. A 2 AM bathroom visit on night one got complicated, stumbling throughout the room - in the dark - looking for the keypad to activate the lights. (I ended up using my phone flashlight to find it).\n\nThe indicator lights on the keypad are quite faint; we missed housekeeping one day because we inadvertently hit the \"privacy\" light. In addition, the really small bathroom sink has a 2 inch gap between it and the wall. On two separate occasions items rolled through this gap - we had to get on our hands and knees to retrieve them.\n\nWe brought a bottle of champagne for our celebratory weekend but we should have brought our own ice. Our 15th floor room required a long walk to the \"nearest\" ice machine - one floor down and a decent walk on top of that. My wife stayed in the room with the door propped open, mistakenly making me believe I didn't need my key. (Wrong - needed for both the elevator and the stairs, which I only discovered when I started my return trip to the room).\n\nWe decided to end the first night at the rooftop bar. Nice view but our bartender was having a bad night. He very begrudgingly wiped the water-logged spot that we chose. And, when we decided to move from our barstools to a newly opened table 15 feet away, he curtly said \"close out with me first\". We did - and were happy to have our service taken over by a terrific waitress.\n\nWe used the breakfast buffet both days - it was also disappointing. The sausage and frittatas were cold (on both days). The pastry and bread selection was very good, as was the coffee and staff.\n\nThese are first world problems. The room was very nicely appointed and the bed super comfortable. Housekeeping, front desk, and main restaurant staff were all top notch. But we had high expectations for a premium spot like this and they were not met.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We checked in late around 11:30pm so our room was ready. The gentleman at the front desk was was very welcoming and recognized my husband\u2019s Hilton Diamond status and gave us a run down of the hotel. We had been notified two days ago that we were preblocked into an upgraded corner suite on the 8th floor. We also received a confirmation text for the same room earlier in the morning. However when we arrived the room number he gave us was not the same one they had texted us. It was late and we had driven almost 6 hours, so we did not question it. When we arrived in the room, it was not a corner suite which was disappointing since they had confirmed twice with us previously. We travel quite a bit and I understand upgrades aren\u2019t always available. I just expect the hotel to not confirm a upgrade multiple times and then put you in another room without an explanation. They should just not offer one until check in. \n\nThe room was nicely appointed and has a huge shower. There was also a nice amenity left for us on the coffee table. That was a nice touch and very appreciated by our daughter who loves little treats. We called room service and ordered a margherita pizza. The girl who answered was very nice and took our order quickly. Unfortunately, it took a long time to get the pizza and it was completely undercooked. It was lukewarm when we got it and the bottom looked barely cooked at all. The cheese on top was barely melted and looked congealed. It definitely was not the food quality that should come from a luxury hotel. We were so hungry that we ate half of it anyway. It was almost 1 am and we didn\u2019t want to wait for another one. I called room service to let them know and she was extremely apologetic and offered a new pizza on the house. I declined and explained we were exhausted and were going to sleep. \n\nAs we were getting ready for bed, my husband found a bug on the wall. We panicked for a minute thinking it was a bed bug, but it was NOT. We trapped it in a glass in case we needed to show it to the hotel. After some research, we realized it was a spider beetle. They do bite but they are not dangerous so we just flushed it down the toilet. We thoroughly checked the room and saw nothing else. \n\nThis could have been an excellent experience but I felt like it started off on the wrong foot by confirming an upgrade we never received. There weren\u2019t any sheets for the sofa bed so we had to call housekeeping... who never answered. The front desk did send someone up to make up the bed but it would have been nice to just do it ourselves and not have to wait since it was 1:30am. I\u2019m hoping that we had bad luck or because it\u2019s so late there were some housekeeping\/ kitchen issues. Everyone we encountered was genuinely nice and wanted to be helpful so I\u2019m hoping tomorrow will go more smoothly. \n\n","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I have stayed at the one in London so knew the standard of hotel. The one in NY did not disappoint. \n\nLocated in Downtown Manhattan it is close to the ferries for Statue of Liberty (and also New Jersey) and World Trade Centre memorial and complex. It is also relatively easy to get to other areas of Manhattan via the subway as it is only two blocks away. So it is perfect for sightseeing and exploring other parts of New York. If you are there for business then it\u2019s next to Goldman Sachs and the financial district.\n\nThe hotel itself was modern and spectacular in the lobby - the art work was impressive. My daughter very much liked hanging out here & people watching!  \n\nThe room itself was very nice and clean.  For me the decoration of beige, oak furniture and white linen was light and airy, which I found pleasant. The separate living room and large shower was much appreciated. An additional bed with a proper mattress was provided for my daughter that went up against the wall when not in use in the living room & lay down at night. The only thing was that it was a little cramped for opening up suitcases - we did this in front of the wardrobe, so we got it to work for us as a family of three. If there are only two people it is very good.\n\nWe didn\u2019t eat here for dinner (there is so much to explore in NY!), but breakfast was great. What we really appreciated was a breakfast that was cooked on order - none of this scrambled egg that has been warmed for ages or limp pancakes. I thoroughly would recommend the scrambled egg bruschetta; my daughter loved the pancakes and my other half loved the eggs benedict. Quite frankly after a dish like those served with coffee\/tea and juice\/water you were set up for the day ahead. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was worth every penny. \n\nWe also went for an evening drink - tricky with a 7 yo. We first went upstairs to the roof bar terrace and we thought this was not suitable for my daughter not because it was bad, but it was a little smaller than imagined and the I don\u2019t think the other clientele would have appreciated us. We arrived early evening. Please note; this was not the hotel\u2019s policy and they welcomed us. I would love to have hung out with the crowd but not this time in my \u2018mum\u2019 role. Do go up there the view of the Hudson River is amazing. \n\nWe did go downstairs for a cocktail and we found this to be pleasant experience & the staff treated me and my family with warmth and were friendly. I also liked my cocktail!\n\nI understand the hotel has a fitness centre which I didn\u2019t use. If you are expecting a swimming pool, I\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t have one. Now this isn\u2019t unusual, but I would have loved one :)\n\nOverall I found this stay to be a great two nights. The hotel manages to work for the business crowd (lots on summer interns when we were there) and also families. I think this is a tricky thing to pull off but they do it well. Thank you for a great stay and I have no hesitation but to recommend you to others and return for another stay. \n","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Atrio Wine Bar & Restaurant with a fantastic view to the Battery Park area below. \n\nGracious hostess, wonderful service by Aura and excellent menu - i zeroed in on the avocado toast. We've all seen it on menus; it's like when beets-goat cheese-walnuts were all the rage but you know what...avocado toast is so delicious. What I didn't know...is how incredible and delicious THIS avocado toast tastes. \n$21... the most I've ever paid.  Poached eggs, whole wheat bread (seriously delicious bread), pomegranate, ricotta salata, radish, watercress. When it arrived, it was much larger than I anticipated. Immediately, I thought to myself: \"what a shame that I will only be able to eat half of this\". Fast forward 20 minutes...clean plate club. Seriously the BEST avocado toast I have eaten. Worth every dang penny too.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

We wanted to stay there because we were familiar with the wonderful spacious rooms. First of all I want to mention Natalie Pecorino, she helped us set up the block of rooms we reserved. Natalie was a wonderful person who knows how to treat guests and keep us informed on our timeline months before the actual stay. She often reached out and asked if we needed anything and actually wrote us a hand Congratulatory note on the wedding. She is an asset to the hotel. Lisa at the front desk checked us in without any wait at all. She always had a smile on her face and greeted us when we walked passed the desk. I don't know how she can remember all the faces, but she was kind and delightful. My favorite person at the Conrad is Doris, the hostess at the restaurant. Doris has remembered us from our initial stay. It is really unbelievable because we only stay there a few times a year. She is always so kind to all the guests she seats and speaks with. Doris actually remembered us saying we were coming for my son's wedding. On our last morning Dorris made flowers from silk and had them on our table for breakfast because several people in our family were joining us. What employees in huge hotels do that? It makes us feel like we are in a small bed and breakfast and that they care about us at the Conrad. When we were leaving Morris helped us with our car and was just so nice and had the biggest smile. We had no cash at that point to tip him and he just made us feel fine about it. These people made our stay. These are four reasons we will return to this wonderful hotel.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We had enjoyed Conrad Tokyo last year so I booked us to stay at Conrad NYC. Our friends advised us to stay in Midtown to be closer to some attractions so I cancelled our Conrad reservations. I booked a far inferior and more expensive hotel in Midtown and did I regret it. We ended up not enjoying our NYC vacation.\n \nRecently we needed a night in NYC for a layover from returning from Europe. I decided to book a room with points but had a difficult time with booking the room. However, Cinella went way out of her way to help me book my room. Although I couldn\u2019t get the exact type of room I needed, she told me that a rollaway would be available for us. Cinella was simply wonderful and accommodating.\n\nWe ended up arriving a little bit earlier to the Conrad NYC. I noticed rollaway was not in the room which wasn\u2019t a big deal. I went downstairs to see if we could still get one but by the time I went downstairs, the rollaway had indeed arrived as promised. My wife thought that we only had a couple of towels in the room so I called housekeeping who immediately came upstairs with extra towels. A few moments later, we realized that there were enough towels in the room (they were just in the closet). The service was always one step ahead of us.\n\nThis location ended up being much better for us than the Midtown area. Less noisy and less claustrophobic yet still reasonable close to many attractions. \n\nThe service, staff and space (for NYC) all exceeded my expectations. Absolutely top notch service and love the location. My family actually ended up loving NYC this time around!","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}
