We stayed in a Times Square view suite.  The view was great, but even at the 48th floor there was substantial street noise--not as bad as other hotels we've stayed at in New York, but enough to keep us up late into the night from intermittent honking horns, revving cars and emergency vehicles.  The location was convenient to the subway, Broadway shows and local shopping, but in the future we'd probably stay further from Times Square.\n\nThe room was well appointed and clean, and housekeeping was responsive and thorough during our 5-night stay.   We did use the sofa bed - it was adequate but just barely so.\n\nThe lobby is minimalist but efficient.  Staff was friendly.  The gym on the 4th floor has a good mix of cardio and weights.  We used it twice and it was never more than 1\/3 full.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Despite my efforts to arrange an early check-in, the initial experience with the hotel significantly impacted my stay, with a continued series of frustrating events.\n\nUpon arrival at 5 AM, I was informed that the double queen room was occupied, despite later discovering it was actually vacant, and awaiting cleaning. Despite repeated inquiries about the status of the room, it remained unavailable until late in the afternoon. At 3:50pm I called and was told it still was not ready; once I was visibly upset, they told me it would be ready in minutes. \n\nMr. Richie's abrasive and argumentative attitude towards my concerns only added to the unpleasant experience. Moving to a larger room on the second night seemed like a positive change, but it was quickly overshadowed by plumbing issues in the shower and the lack of proper maintenance response. The lack of communication and acknowledgment of the inconveniences by the hotel staff was disappointing.\n\nFurthermore, the oversight in finding and returning a personal item left behind during the room change and the discovery of a non-functional phone in the new room highlighted a lack of attention to detail and guest satisfaction.\n\nAmidst the series of disappointments and frustrations, Mr. Tomas repeatedly went above and beyond to genuinely address my challenges. His exceptional customer service and dedication to ensuring guest satisfaction showcased a level of care and professionalism that set him apart as a true asset to the hotel's staff. If his coworkers adopted just a few of his qualities, this hotel would never fall short of guest satisfaction with a long lasting impression of their stay. \n\nLast year, I had a superb stay at its sister location (Grayson) down the street. The differences in service and amenities provided by these two sister hotels were truly remarkable. I was warmly welcomed with early check-in and even offered a complimentary late check-out when I inquired about storing my luggage on the last day. The rooms had robes and slippers for the guests to use during their stay. It was quite disappointing, that I didn\u2019t experience anything similar at the Centric Time Square","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They helped us arrange transport to JFK in a large, comfortable car, for all 5 of us including lots of luggage. Nothing was too much trouble, and the whole team were very friendly, from the reception staff, doorman, housekeeping, and even kitchen staff who pointed us in the right direction when slightly lost using the lifts at first - different lifts service different floors and key card required to access. \n\nWe had 2 rooms, one with a large king bed and the other had 2 queen beds. The rooms were spacious by New York standards, and lots of places for charging\/plugs etc. The rooms were cleaned daily and bottled water and coffee machine replenished (even told we could have as much as we needed). There is a mini fridge in the room which was great for chilling water and milk for tea. There is a hairdryer provided and the shower was great with waterfall option. We did not have breakfast in the hotel.\n\nThe hotel has a roof top bar, however as we had an under 21 with us we did not visit the bar for drinks, but the hotel staff accompanied us up in the morning, before the bar opened, for a tour and some time looking out on the views of the New York skyline (and amazing Chrysler Building) so definitely worth a visit up to the 54th floor for that.\nI would certainly return to this hotel and would recommend it to anybody wanting a comfortable stay in this busy part of the city.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel manager, Alana, immediately attended to the situation and tried to resolve the issue. Her efforts to make the situation right is deeply appreciated.

The Museum of Broadway is next door. Starbucks is almost across the street.\n\nCheck-in and check-out was easy. I noticed lines at other times but my timing must have been lucky.\n\nHad a room on the 10th floor with a view facing out the back of the hotel towards 46th Street. There are only 11 or 12 rooms per floor so not a lot of noise from the neighbors. Elevators were prompt. The hotel had issues with the TV system the first morning - no channel guide or Chromecast available. They did get it fixed by the evening. \n\nPicking up food\/beverages in T45, connected to the lobby, was easy. The only room service is for breakfast and the prices are very high. Oatmeal, banana and coffee was $24 plus tax plus 18% gratuity. They wanted an extra $6 plus tax plus tip for berries. Food is delivered in a bag in disposable containers. Best bet is to go to T45 where prices are much lower (but still high - this is NYC!). Salads, baked goods, sandwiches, etc. were very good at T45. Plenty of tables in the back or you can ask for the food to go. Charging to your room is permitted.\n\nOne night, went to the rooftop bar. Had a reservation and was quickly seated. Their specialty cocktails start at $24 and bar food is available. Two drinks, two sliders, and two empanadas resulted in a bill (with tip) of $108. Outdoor terrace was closed, supposedly for renovations even though there was no apparent construction. Nice views, even from within the lounge. \n\nI used Curb or Uber to preorder cars. Curb cabs consistently arrive 15 minutes before the time I requested. This was an easy way to ensure I had a cab\/car when needed.\n\nWhen returning to NYC, I would have no concerns about returning to the Hyatt Centric. ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We asked for an upgrade from a double queen room and were sold a deluxe room at $70\/night which seemed fair. While my husband was speaking to the front desk executive, my friend & I were standing next to him, by default positioned in front of the desk next to her. Another executive came & stood at that desk & literally gestured rudely with her hands, indicating we move. I couldn't believe they have such brash staff at their front desk. Her attitude showed you can work at a 5 star and still lack class. Note that there was no one behind waiting to be assisted! Regarding our check in: It was 2.15 pm & we wanted to freshen up & get somewhere. We grabbed lunch & returned at 3.30 only to be told we'll have to wait to get the room, as check in time is 4 pm. So don't arrive even half an hour early unless you've paid for it! Finally we got the room key by 3.50 pm, but our bags took 20-25 mins to arrive. Another friend is joining us tomorrow around 1 pm, and we have a second room booked. But as we asked for an early check in, we were given the \"pay for it\" story.\nThe in-room situation: the duvets aren't duvets but a thin sheet placed inside a duvet cover. We asked for a proper blanket - Each time, it took several attempts for someone to answer the \"guest services\" call. Finally a dirty one arrived after 3 calls & 45 minutes. \nThe room situation: Some of the pillows have been slept in for so long,  they've gone flat. There's a closet that doesn't close even if you put a medium sized suitcase in it. And I don't want to get started on the electric situation! Operating the lights in this room is more complicated than operating an aircraft simulator. I haven't tried the shower yet. All in all, terrible service & I wish I could've stayed back at the Homewood Suites Hilton. Honestly, for a 5 star & for the money we paid, the least you expect is half decent service, good bedding & someone to answer your call if you need someting at night.  Won't recommend staying here, there are far better options around here at a lower cost. ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The manager assured me that they were trying to get it back, but I sensed it was just lip service. The housekeeper apologized profusely, but the front desk staff was pretty indifferent to the seriousness of the situation. Anyone with young kids knows that losing a favorite stuffy is a big deal.

It was difficult to find NYC hotels with Queen beds, but we found a great deal here and were happy it was so centrally located.  \n\nThe room was well-sized for our family of 4 (kids ages 13 and 10).  The bathroom was a really nice size and had a great shower with good pressure.  We were on the 10th Floor, and were surprised at how quiet the room was being right off Times Square.  It was well-appointed and the beds were very comfortable and clean.  Air-conditioning worked very well for a warm week in October.  There is an in-room safe and small fridge.  Not a lot of drawer space, but the closet was big.\n\nHotel was clean, front desk was courteous and helpful, and I liked that they checked for room cards in the evening before accessing the elevators.  Elevators were fast, even though only 2 went to our floor.  Lobby was clean.  The gym was a good size, and we had some good snacks from the lobby cafe.  We got free water bottles every day which was a nice perk.\n\nLocation is great from the perspective that you\u2019re near an exciting part of town and can pickup almost any subway line with a few minutes walk.  It did take longer to get here via taxi from the airport because of traffic, but wasn\u2019t terrible.\n\nCan definitely recommend for families and got a great value for our dollar.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Reception staff were pleasant but not particularly friendly, we weren't even asked on departure if we enjoyed our stay etc. but she was kind to store our bags for us, also the 'resort fee' is a complete money scam, over 300 euro for the 8 days on top of we we already paid. I would advise to skip breakfast here, its only a $20 credit, the coffee for over $5 is horrible and the options for food are very limited and expensive, also staff working at breakfast were unfriendly.

The lobby is a bit underwhelming, but it served its purpose. And because of the quaint size of lobby, the elevators are conveniently located just steps from the front door of the building. The hotel is 54 stories tall, and has incredible views from the top floor Bar 54 lounge. And because we were traveling with our kids, it was great to know that this hotel had an option of two queen beds, rather than double beds, which was the primary reason we selected this hotel, as the majority of NYC hotels do not offer 2 queen beds.

This is completely and utterly NOT acceptable!\n\nI have contacted my credit card provider to stop and revoke any payment from your hotel. I see from other websites, you are also being called out for this shoddy practice!\n\nThe only thing I agreed to was the $150.00 upgrade to a \"view\" of Times Square, which was, let\u2019s be honestly with ourselves here, non-existent! Before even telling us where in the hotel we would be located, the reception staff asked for $15 per room per night to be upgraded to \u201ca view\u201d of Times Square. I was expecting to see something more than once digital display board\u2026 I\u2019m not exactly sure what you consider a view, but this \u201cview\u201d was absolute nonsense!\n\nThe staff are unfriendly, unhelpful, not interested in interacting with you whenever there is a problem. I was advised this \"Destination Fee\" is really a \u201cresort fee due to their location in New York and as youre see close to broadway\u201d (their words, not mine) and that it was billed due to the location of the hotel. I asked is this was option or compulroy by the City or State and could not be given any form of a comprehensible answer. This comes as quite the surprise when I booked and paid for the hotel 10 month in advance as I wanted this location\u2026 and after getting married in New York, i didnt not have $1000 at hand to pay upon departure, having already made sure I would not be using Room Service or any other items at cost.\n\nI formally request that you contact me urgently to discuss this!\n\nThe location regrettably is on a very dirty street with garbage on the sidewalk, and overflowing garbage bins outside. The street has 24\/7 food trucks burning charcoals and engines running, and every single night without fail, we have been offered weed and cocaine by dealers at the entrance to the hotel and the street. Take a left out of the hotel and meet the friendly dealer who will greet you with \u201csmoke, smoke, smoke. You want weed?\u201d\n\nSecurity in the hotel is slim to non-existent. You DO NOT need a keycard to access or enter the elevators, and with the high volume of degenerates in Times Square this seriously needs addressing! Absolutely anyone can enter this hotel.\n\nThe ONLY, and I seriously mean this, the ONLY positive thing in this entire hotel was the Housekeeping staff on floor 34. I as always greeted with a smile and wishing us a great day. Always asking if we needed anything, fresh towels, the room serviced etc., and sadly the front of house\/reception mostly chat amongst themselves and spend more time on their phones than customers. \n\nWe visited the restaurant\/bar but did not take a table as we were denied entry due to a member of our group being under 21. The rooftop itself was closed for refurb. We didn\u2019t order any room service, and we definitely will NOT be returning.\n\nI have stayed in Hyatt hotels before (Grand Hyatt Tokyo is one of my favourite hotels) and this Hyatt Centric hotel definitely needs some attention \u2013 urgently. I have already made a complaint to your customer services via email.\n\n1. Location: perfect if you want Times Square, but the street experience is simply awful\n2.

We were a family of 4...2 adults and our 18 and 21 year old, so we needed some space. The room was great.  Fridge kept things cold. The hotel is central to everything we wanted to do, so for us, the location was perfect.  We did not get a city view room, so we didn't hear any noise at night.  My sister was across the hall in a city view room and it was slightly bigger than ours.  I would recommend the city view room for that reason.  I am not sure if she could hear noise from the street, but she didn't complain, so I think it was fine.  The rooms were clean and, Jennifer, our housekeeper was amazing!  The little market downstairs was good for coffee and a quick bite in the morning. There are many places in the area you can buy food for less, though, one being the Eatery just a couple doors down.  Connolly's was great for late night food and drinks. I have only a couple complaints...one was that there is very little space for storing suitcases and clothing. There are bed side tables where the drawers pull out, but they are not drawers.  They are like extended table tops.  I feel like, with the size of NY rooms, they could have made those actual drawers to provide more space for things.  There was no outlet in the middle bedside table.  This is not a make or break for the hotel.  Just an observation.  There are outlets on the other bedside tables, just not the one in the middle.  One of the reasons I chose the hotel was for the outside terrace, however, it was closed during our stay, so that was a bummer, but Connolly's, next door, had a rooftop bar (kids under 21 are allowed to go up, as well), so we went there a few nights. There is security at the hotel and you have to show your room key after 4pm to go to the elevators.  There is a lot of activity in Times Square, so it made me feel safer having the doormen there to check for keys.  For this reason, make sure everyone in your party has a key or they may have difficulty getting up to the room. If you like all the hustle and bustle of NY, this is a great place to stay!

They boast NYC's highest rooftop bar (54th floor) and are located in the heart of Times Square.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't want most of those things. I wanted something quiet, close to the ground, and without a lot of outside interaction. They gave me the quiet room... but it was on the 34th floor. Once I realized that would be a problem they changed it (7th floor) but the room was now facing the street, so I could hear the constant city noise from below. I also had to clear every single Uber delivery person with the front desk in order to deliver directly to my room. Part of me likes that for security reasons, but it was draining. Also I had issues with the room phone which required even more knocks on the door from the technician (to their credit they did get it fixed that day).\n\nThe only meal you could get delivered in house was breakfast, which was quite expensive (though not surprising given the location). With the room price I paid, I expected (and pretty sure I read somewhere) that room service for all meals would be available. But it wasn't.\n\nSo while it was super convenient to be down the block from the theater where I was attending a Broadway show and across the street from a 24 hour Walgreens, I would not stay here again. That doesn't mean it's not for everyone though.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Twenty one floors up street noise was minimal. The air conditioning kept the room very comfortable. The restaurant off the lobby had great pastries, coffee and grab and go food. Best of all we were less than a block from Broadway and many attractions could be reached on foot. It was also extremely easy to arrange for transportation when needed.

Our room was lovely and the hotel was very quiet - we didnt hear another guest and was at the back so no street noise either.  Our room was cleaned everyday.  The room has a supply of  with coffee and tea but no milk.  We went to the T45 market in reception to buy some and he gave us a full cup for free - brilliant.  The location of this hotel is superb - less than five minutes to the hustle and bustle of Times Square.  Checking out was easy (though I do hate the $30 plus tax destination charged per room per night - certainly added up for our 7 nights in USA).  We asked the man on the door to get us a cab and he informed us that the hotel has its own SUV that could take us to the airport - perfect way to finish our stay in an aircon vehicle with free water - much better than a cab dearer at $120 but much nicer).

There is no such photo shoot at 10:30 AM on the top level, everything other resort fee benefit was also baseless and empty. No access to vending machines or convenience, food or snacks anywhere in the hotel. Our hotel room was not fully cleaned as there was garbage under one of the beds.

I would certainly expect far more from a four star hotel. \n\nThere is a roof top bar (21+ so don\u2019t expect to enjoy a drink if travelling with kids).. we went up in the morning when you are allowed to go with children only to discover that the terrace is closed because they are renovating. Disappointing. \n\nOne of the strangest things about the hotel are the surly security guards who guard the lifts. I presume they are meant to be checking that only guests and bar patrons are in the building but I was only asked to show my room key once, when I had both hands full. Didn\u2019t feel very secure as pretty much anyone could just walk in and go to any floor. \n\nOne amazing thing about this hotel which I cannot leave out is the housekeeping team- always friendly, flexible and doing the best with keeping the rooms spotless- top marks to them! \n\nWe won\u2019t come back to this hotel again as for this price there are many much nicer hotels in NYC","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our orders had mistakes and missing items 2 days in a row but the last two days, the orders were accurate. If we had an error with our food, the kitchen was quick to send the food to our room.\n\nGlobalist recognition\/Room: The most disappointing part of our trip. I used a suite upgrade award for my family of four and we were given a standard suite. According to Hyatt guidelines, a standard suite is reserved as a complimentary upgrade for Globalist members pending availability. Whenever I have used a suite upgrade award at other Hyatt properties, I have always been upgraded to a much larger suite. I spoke to the front desk person regarding this and they said that the larger suite was available but only if I paid extra for the suite. I was very shocked because I used a suite award prior to booking. My family was very cramped in the standard suite and we were not comfortable at all. I was also not happy with Hyatt booking us in a room with an adjoining door knowing that we had two children with us. I feel like I wasted my suite upgrade award on this trip and Hyatt Centric Times square. I was extremely disappointed and I wish I could have my suite upgrade award back as this award was not recognized the way it should have been.\n\nRooftop bar: The rooftop bar was closed unfortunately due to \u201cwinter\u201d but the weather was beautiful when my fianc\u00e9 and I went to the rooftop restaurant. We were also disappointed that one can of soda to go cost us $6.00! The caf\u00e9 downstairs closes WAY too early and this hotel should provide options for snacks and drinks after hours. A vending machine would even suffice. \n\nOverall: my stay here was mediocre. I left this property expecting more and this was also my first time in a Hyatt Centric. I\u2019m not too sure I will visit a Hyatt centric again unfortunately, as my stays at other Hyatt properties have treated me more like a Globalist than this property.\n","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"NONE"}

This was inappropriate due to the time (2am uk times) and the fact we already had one in place. When booking the holiday with British Airways we was able to take advantage of the special offer which was a complimentary room upgrade if we booked before a certain date. The gentleman who was checking us in was very adamant and insisted we was wrong and that room upgrades are only available upon availability. I then had to look through my emails to prove that we was sold this complimentary room upgrade, in which he said that this is at fault of British Airways and I should email them as he does not see it on his system. This is definitely not what a customer wants to hear after traveling all day. I appreciate that a room upgrade given in the end, however upon check in we were made to feel gulled and un-welcomed. Apart from the check-in process everything else was as expected. The location of the hotel is superb.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"NONE"}

This hotel entrance is much better than some others, with a good sized lobby and adequate staff. Check-in was good but could have been better - why do I need to do the whole thing with a human instead of picking up room keys from a kiosk? Why do I even need room keys? \n\nOn the good side, ironing board was close to full size and iron was great. Room size better than expected. Bed comfortable, sufficient towels for me to avoid room service my entire stay. In-room coffee (uses pods) was good enough and front desk gave me pods when I asked. Good that the hotel provides bottled water in the room. Desk chair not great, nor is the desk surface. Lighting controls were quirky but the blackout curtain worked well enough. Elevators and lobby could end up mobbed by huge groups - there was a group of perhaps a hundred kids with chaperones several days I was there and just getting an elevator between 6-9pm could take thirty minutes!

I understand that just because we request a window seat doesn't automatically guarantee that we'll get one, but there were seats available and we were not allowed to switch (reason stated: they were filled up with reservations). However, when other people came in after us and asked to move seats, they were re-seated... and by the time we left (1 1\/2 hours later when our time was up), there were still a ton of seats available.

I've never stayed at one of the Centric hotels and wanted to experience how it compared to Hyatt's other brands. In my opinion, this Centric is a step up from a Hyatt Place or a Hyatt House. We were staying on points so not sure what the rate would have been. \n\nUpon entering the hotel, the lobby is very small with one sitting area to the left. Eva at the front desk welcomed us as Hyatt discoverist members and quickly checked us in at 12:30pm. We were thrilled that our room was ready so early and she also offered us a 2:00pm checkout the next day (perk for being a Hyatt member). \n\nOur room was on the 46th floor with floor to ceiling windows and a great city view. The room was a decent size considering hotel rooms in nyc are usually tiny. The room was clean, had a decent size closet, nice clean bathroom and four bottles of complimentary water. The bathroom also had a floor to ceiling window but had a shade for privacy. \n\nThere is a rooftop bar that is open from 4:00pm-midnight but unfortunately we did not get a chance to utilize it. There is also a coffee shop to the left of the lobby that had some nice sandwiches, salads, specialty coffee's etc. \n\nThe location is perfect for midtown. We drove in and found parking a block from the hotel ($63 for 24 hours). The hotel is less than a block away to Broadway. There is a Starbucks and Walgreens directly across the street and a million places to dine and explore. \n \nWe would definitely stay at this hotel again next time we need to be in midtown!\n\n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We could very easily walk everywhere, including to a restaurant we had at a Michelin restaurant located in Hell's Kitchen - about a 15 minute walk.   Staff was very friendly, gracious, and accommodating. We felt very welcome, and the proximity to Time Square and Broadway is hard to beat.\n\nThe rooms were clean and nicely furnished - though an extension cord might be nice to pack as the number of plugs is a little limited depending on which side of the bed you're on.  The rooms were decently sized for a NYC hotel, with all the usual amenities - in-room safe, refrigerator, free Wi-Fi, shampoo\/conditioner\/body wash, etc.  Each room is equipped with a shower, which has a rainfall shower head in the ceiling, and a hand-held sprayer you could switch to on demand.\n\nWe initially had a corner room, which was larger than the regular sized rooms, and the bathroom for the corner units have heated floors, which was a really nice touch since we were in NYC on one of the coldest days ever.  Air temp of 2 degrees F, wind chill of -15 degrees F.  The drawback of the corner room was that if the wind was blowing a certain way, there would be a \"tea kettle\" whistling effect that could be heard almost constantly throughout the night.  I sleep very soundly, so I didn't hear it until perhaps 4-5 a.m.  My wife and daughter heard the whistling sound all night.\n\nWe asked the front desk to change our room for the next day, which they did to the room next door.  This was not a corner room - thus no heated bathroom floor.  We could hear the whistling effect in the corner room while moving our luggage to the new location, but it was quiet in the new room.  Fortunately, the tea kettle effect was just confined to the corner room.  This is a nice hotel, with super fast elevators - a plus.  The elevators are so fast that you can feel the air pressure change in your ears.  I would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel itself is situated just up the street from where it's all happening for tourists at Times Square and fast food etc is a stone throw away. There are loads of sights to see all within walking distance for a relatively fit person, even after a mince pie filled Christmas like me. Upon entering the hotel we were greeted fairly warmly by the workers and first impressions were good. We stayed on the 46th floor and the room was lovely with impressive views even in January in the rain. All the modern tech worked well, coffee machine, WiFi, TV, Iron etc were all brilliant. The bathroom was spotless and the room was maintained well upon leaving for the day. The rooftop views at the bar are jaw dropping and was a nice ambience about the place. We ordered a breakfast bagel for room service which was amazing and well timed, although a bit on the expensive side, I guess that's paying for convenience and taking into acount that New York is the most expensive city in the world right now and definitely the most wallet bashing I've ever been to. I didn't feel any awkwardness about tipping in the hotel due to the fact that upon arrival they inform you that there is a destination charge which I've interpreted as cover the tips for the workers. This is $30 dollars a day so be prepared, on checkout, with our Bagel room service the final bill was $200 ish dollars which was a sickened but again, that's nothing against the hotel, from what I gather and experienced, ist the going rate to stay in the city. Overall the stay was pleasant and if I can ever afford to go back I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. A point worth noting is that there is a nice Irish pub right next door to finish the busy days of sightseeing of with a drink. ","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were tired from a redeye flight that was booked last minute on Delta thx to Southwest Air cancelling our original flight in what I call the awful \u201cSouthwest Air Meltdown of 2022\u201d.  So, our arrival into NY around 9am was not planned.  Uber ride from Laguardia to hotel was fast and we walked into the hotel at 10am not optimistic that a room would be available.  \n\nIndeed, there were no rooms available for an early check in.  We were able to leave our luggage there, however, and went to explore the city.  Received a notification around 2pm that room was ready so that was nice.\n\nWe had a 2queen room on the 20 th floor.  The room view was blah but not a big deal.  There was a mini fridge and Keurig in the cabinet below the tv.  Beds were comfy and there was plenty of storage space.  No upgrade available as my booking was thru Amex The Hotel Collection but those are not guaranteed.  They did deliver a bottle of small pinot and wine glasses to our room which was appreciated!\n\nUtilized the bfast room service once, as I had credit through Amex The Hotel Collection, which I was thankful for as the menu is limited and pricey!! My order came within 20min of calling - super fast! It was packed great with all condiments.  In fact, I didnt notice that my side of sausage was missing until I received a knock at the door 10min after delivery and a staff member with the missing item apologizing for not including it!  Ordered the pancakes, egg scramble with side of sausage and juices.  It was hot and good and I liked that we could dine in the room.  Wish there was an all day room service option!  \n\nWhen I didnt want the room cleaned one morning, the staff member still gave me extra bottled water, coffee and tea pods, cups, and face towels and asked if I needed anything else.  Great service.\n\nI will def return if visiting the area again and the price is right.  This was the most cost effective choice of The Hotel Collection offerings and the location was great.  The only downside is the lack of an onsite restaurant and the rooftop dining is 21+.  I traveled with my 19yr old daughter so this was not ideal, but theres so much nearby within walking distance.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Most everything is walkable and useful major subway lines are a 5 minute walk away. Being a 1 minute walk from the middle of Times Square was really cool. Just an absolutely fantastic location in midtown that can't be beat.  \n\u2022 King Suite was quite spacious for a NYC hotel room and a family of 4. Bedroom is separated from the living room with two pocket doors. Not too sound proof but having some separation from the kids while they slept was great. The sofa itself is uncomfortable to sit on but the kids had no complaints about the sofa bed. \n\u2022 Housekeeping was excellent and staff was friendly.\n\u2022 The room-service-only breakfast was tasty and quite quick (always under 15 minutes). Would have liked some more options though and wasn't the most comfortable to eat in the room. \n\u2022 Bar 54 has some good views and very tasty but very expensive ($23+) cocktails. Also did the family friendly 10:30am daytime viewing which was cool. \n\u2022 Heat worked great considering we were staying during that Christmas cold snap with wind chills around -10F. Never felt cold once in the hotel. \n\nBut there were some negatives: \n\u2022 I found the bed really firm and never slept that well. My spouse and kids thought it was fine though so YMMV. I do prefer soft beds. \n\u2022 Outside noise (on 12th floor) facing 45th street could sometimes be **extremely** loud with insane honking, blaring music from cars, and emergency vehicle sirens. I have no idea what possesses multiple people over multiple nights to decide it's a good idea to blare a car horn for 20 seconds straight at 3 in the morning but that's a thing that happens outside this hotel. I'm a very deep sleeper who has lived and visited downtown in other cities (including other hotels around NYC) without an issue, but this was unreal.\n\u2022 The resort fee is a scam and their justifications for it are absolutely ridiculous. Just add it to the room price if you're going to do that. \n\nBut overall I enjoyed the stay, mostly due to the size of the room and the excellent location. Maybe just ask for a room not facing 45th street if you're not going to get a room with a view anyways. \n","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

My husband emailed the hotel directly and we were overwhelmed by the generosity of the Manager who agreed for us to push to booking back with no penalty fee or money loss involved. We will always be grateful for this gesture.\nWhen we did finally get to go to New York in December 2022, every extra second waited was worth it. We arrived at the hotel at around 2pm - we were greeted in a friendly manner and were politely told that our room wasn't quite ready, but we were more than welcome to leave our bags with them and return later - which is exactly what we did. We got a message a little while later telling us that our room was ready. When we returned to the Hotel, we were met by another extremely friendly member of staff, who had read on the booking that our stay was a Birthday treat - she gifted us $50 to spend in the bar as a \"Birthday gift from Hyatt.\" \n\nOur room was on the 40th floor and there was something quite special about heading up in the lift, knowing we were going to have a view over Times Square. I was not prepared for the beauty of the room or the effort the staff had gone to - putting a personalised, hand-drawn card and balloons in our room. Thoughtful and very much appreciated. Our room was truly wonderful - we had a large living space which comprised of a desk area, sofa, table, tea\/coffee\/coffee machine facilities and a flatscreen TV. Beyond the living space was a lengthy balcony which had the most incredible views - the balcony also ran parallel to our bedroom. The bedroom had a bigger than king-sized bed, clothing storage including a well lit wardrobe, drawers and units, flatscreen TV and aircon\/heating.\n\nThe bathroom was well stocked with shampoo\/conditioner\/moisturiser\/soap\/toilet rolls\/tissues and drinking water as well as having a waterfall shower, handheld shower head and bath - all were fantastically warm and of good pressure.\n\nWe visited the Rooftop bar once - mainly to use our $50 and to make the most of the stunning views, and although we didn't have a reservation, the staff found a table for us. Personally, I felt that the drinks were a little on the pricey side, but having been gifted the credit, it was nice to put it towards a drink!\n\nThroughout our stay, nothing was too much trouble. We were greeted with a smile every time we passed reception, the doors were open for us and we were frequently told to \"have a great day.\" The Hotel staff who maintain the rooms always ensured our bed was made, we had fresh drinking water and clean, fresh towels. \n\n On our departure day, the Hotel staff kindly looked after our bags and booked a cab for us - we did however cancel this can at a later hour as they were charging $110 to JFK, where we knew that the standard yellow taxi's have a flat rate. The Hotel were fine with this and did not make us feel uncomfortable or awkward about cancelling their option.\n\nThe Hyatt Centric is probably one of the most central hotels you will find to Times Square, with it taking approximately 30 seconds to get from to door to the Square! I couldn't have asked for a more perfect hotel experience than the one we got from Hyatt. \n\nThank you so much for everything.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

She was a very genuine person and went above and beyond to make my stay memorable.\n\nBeds were comfortable, I appreciated the mini fridge and decent in room Keurig maker, Wi-Fi was consistently reliable. \n\nThe hotel was very centrally located and a perfect \u201chome base\u201d for seeing all New York had to offer. Several subway stations were within walking distance and it was very easy to get a cab\/Uber\/Lyft. Walgreens\/Duane Reed is directly across the street from property.\n\nFinally, I was pleased with the soundproofing of the rooms. You\u2019re in the heart of Times Square, so it\u2019s unreasonable to expect that you won\u2019t hear an ambulance, or someone honking, every now and then. However, compared to every other hotel I\u2019ve stayed at in the area, this was significantly quieter. I never heard any other guests and they did a good job of blocking out as much of the road noise as possible, and I\u2019m usually fairly sensitive to this. Turn on a sound machine and you\u2019ll be golden!\n\nOverall this was a great hotel that exceeded my expectations. I look forward to returning one day soon!

Terrible service.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-11-15","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I have been to this property before. The location is great and that's why this time I'm bringing my child as he hasn't been to NYC. But this turned out to be the worst experience in my entire Hyatt career.\n\n1) Room service was terrible. The hotel restaurant is renovating, and instead of using the rooftop bar (which it is capable of) for breakfast, the hotel forced us Globalists to use \"Room Service\". But room service was only some brown paper bags with takeout food in plastic trays. The presentation and taste are worse than any Uber Eat or Doordash. Further, the room service never managed to get our orders right for all six nights we stayed. One day, it's missing coffee. Another day, it's tea. It's honestly a random lucky draw. \n\n2) Upsell & unfair pricing. As a Globalist member, who had my fair share of Hyatt hotels, this is definitely the worst Hyatt Centric -- and the worst Hyatt property -- I have stayed. Service hasn't been attentive at all. Check-in also felt that the property is trying to squeeze out every penny from its guests. We have stayed at this property before. And last time, we upgraded to the suite. But this time, the hotel forced us to pay $50\/night + tax and fees for the EXACT SAME suite on the same floor (Rm4901). While during check-in, the staff made it sound like a big upgrade, we were shocked when we realized that it was the same room we stayed in previously. How's that an upgrade and why do we need to pay additional amount for it if we had stayed there for free before? The staff even realized that we stayed in that room before (for free) and told us about it when we brought it him to him. If so then, why did he charge us? It felt like predatory pricing. A few days before check-in, I also noticed that the pricing had come down, especially on other non-Hyatt websites. And when I tried to price match it with your staff on Facebook, they come up with many non-sense reasons such as I paid a non-refundable Advanced pricing (which turns out to be more expensive than the normal price selling later). In the end, I didn't get the price to come down even though the hotel was already selling at a lower price elsewhere. After that, I have lost confidence in Hyatt's price guarantee.\n\n3) Additional. And at every Hyatt property, we as globalists would receive some recognition, be it a piece of chocolate, fruits, or as simple as a letter. But nothing at this hotel. Nada. The F&B was so bad that I took my son to Park Hyatt NY, which was great!","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Especially for the amount that I had to pay for the total days including the view upgrade and all. I found so much better deals around Manhattan and especially in time square but I chose to stay in Hyatt centric because i thought this is going to be the best option I have. I was also embarrassed I told my friends to stay there as one was celebrating her birthday and she was also not satisfied with her stay and I feel embarrassed because I convinced them to stay there even when having to pay more for each night. Our room was extremely small and we did not even have a closet to put our clothes in to hang and most of our clothes were all wrinkled and on top of that we were going to have to pay extra to use the laundry so our clothes look decent and not wrinkled because we had them in the bag. I\u2019ve honestly never been to a hotel without a closer to hang out clothes in. The shower kept making really loud noises and bothered anyone trying to sleep in the room so had to wait on my girlfriend to wake up to be able to take a shower. \n\nThe most frustrating thing was the AC. After we talked to the front desk about our AC issues we were greeted with attitude from the front desk lady which I was not going to cause an issue about at first. Then we were told that the AC is by motion and people have to be moving for it to stay working. I\u2019ve never ever heard that in my life, am I expected to move around at 3-4am just to keep the AC on? Every morning we would wake up drenched in sweat because the AC would stop working middle of the night. I woke up multiple times just to go to the thermostat and turn it off then back on for it to work again and again. I paid almost $2,000 for only 3 nights and I\u2019ve traveled almost all around the world and I\u2019ve never had to deal with anything like that for a place that I had to pay this much for. I honestly really wanted to love the hotel but all these things kept on happening and we didn\u2019t even have one single good sleep during our stay. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m having to complain about all this and I really don\u2019t usually do so but I was honestly so disappointed by it. I hope you can fix the AC issue so that the next guests don\u2019t have to go through the same thing as it was really frustrating. After all this I also had to pay an extra $260 cuz of the room upgrade that was offered to us when we were checking in but I was really not satisfied by any of it and didn\u2019t want to complain because I was on vacation and wanted to have a good time.

Lobby is small, not the usual Hyatt size and attractiveness. The room was noisy from hall noise. It was small. No stationery, no mini-bar, no robes and no floor access security (same elevator as the rooftop bar). The TV cabinet had a broken hinge and hanging door over the few days we were there. The shelf the safe is bolted to could be yanked out. The provided glasses were plastic and the coffee cups cardboard. On the plus side, besides excellent location, was the comfortable bed, decent rooftop bar (although limited view due to surrounding buildings), good wi-fi and wireless phone charging. There was a Keurig coffee machine, but not the promised unlimited stash of coffee. There was a fridge, hair dryer and iron with board. In general this is an ordinary hotel.

I needed a central place where I could work comfortably during the morning, and easily go exploring in the evening. Room was clean and the service staff that I interacted with was very friendly and helpfull.  I had a kingsize bed with balcony. The furniture on the balcony was a bit simple, but the view was great and the room had a big desk to work on. The desk had all kinds of relevant ports (usb, usb-c, hdmi). Big pluss for the wireless charging station! The chair was a bit uncomfortable to sit and work in for longer periods. The wifi was stable enough to use for work. The safe was big enough for a 16\u2019\u2019 laptop.\n\nThe hotel is located right next to Time Square so do expect a lot of traffic and people in the nearby streets. There is a rooftop bar, but did not get to go there for a drink since it was reserved for events during my stay. However, they offered a viewing for guests 10:30 AM which I managed to get before I checked out. The view was great, and I imagine it is spectacular at night. Did not try the gym, but it looked quite decent.\n\nThe hotel is on the pricier side and european guests should be aware of the \u00abDestination fee\u00bb + tax, which is around 35$ per night.

So I made the reservation, and the show ended later than I thought, so I canceled. They still charged me for it! No bar for the guests!!!????? Then I went to my room and tried to order room service.\n\nAt least you could have packaged sandwiches or some food, not requiring a kitchen. NO ROOM SERVICE FOR $400 a night!!!! The Hyatt should make the very clear on your website with a needed acknowledgment. Just very disappointing for an HYATT. The Manager offered me a discount, but I did not want money. Could you fix this?\n\nThe Bar in the hotel should be for Hyatt's customers. For room service, maybe a small menu supported by a local restaurant.

Unfortunately, our stay this time wasn't as good.  \n\nOn the plus side, the location is great, the rooms are a good size and the beds are super comfortable.  I can't speak for all the rooms but our room on the 24th floor had a good view, which was nice to look out to in the evening.  Staff were attentive and when we required more towels and water, it was replenished aplenty.  \n\nA few things marred our stay.  The room seemed clean but the bottoms of our socks were black with dirt before we even left the room each day.  This would indicate how dirty the floor was, even if it didn't look like it.  I was also bitten on my leg in the night and it has remained to be painful despite using ointment to minimise the itching.  The shower was very weak.  I took forever in the shower as it took a lot of effort to rinse the shampoo and conditioner out.  Not only was this frustrating but this isn't good for the environment.  Lastly, the toilet paper is ridiculously thin.  I expect better for the price paid for the hotel.\n\nBased on the above, I don't think I would choose to stay at the Hyatt Centric again, which is a shame due to all the plus points.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Great view, room and bathroom was big enough. Furniture in the room felt cheap and old. The room needed drawers and more cabinet space. There just wasn't enough space to store items. The floor was laminated hardwood so the sound tends to bounce around and it can get loud easily - which means we could also hear our neighbors easily.

The entire team from front desk to housekeeping was exceptional.

There was a very bad chemical smell, the bedding wasn't tucked in and the duvet cover hadn't been done up. The plumbing was extremely noisy and the shower rattled. The bedside lighting didn't work and an engineer was sent out twice, very quickly but, it couldn't be fixed. I was offered another room.\n\nSecond suite was lovely! Slightly dated but, very clean (which is the main thing), linen tucked in properly with pillow and mattress protectors. The Wi-Fi was a little unreliable and you can\u2019t Chromecast much onto the TV. No bin liner for bin, which is a nuisance as there is nowhere to dispose of feminine hygiene products; Thankfully, I'd brought my own bin liners. There were no heated towel rails so, you couldn't wash anything and dry it yourself. Perfect built-in wardrobes with room for suitcases also. Not enough hangers but iron and ironing board provided.\n\nFantastic A\/C. The room was on the 'City View' side, which was incredibly beautiful. Very quiet, considering location and had fabulous views with the Chrysler Building and river etc.\n\nThe subway is just round the corner. No restaurant at the moment but Bar54 (hotel roof) is ok. Service was great but the was food average. I sent mine back as undercooked and soggy. The staff gave free drinks and were apologetic, which was great.\n\nStarbucks and Walgreens are just over the road. Mc Donald's is also over the road, if you're desperate. It's easy to find something to eat locally. The hotel is very central and a short walk to 5th Avenue, all the sights and Central Park etc.\n\nGreat security presence on doors so it felt secure. There was even someone to open the car door upon arrival and departure. The front desk staff were obliging.\n\nThe pillows awful!! Had six and still had to use my jacket, travel pillow and both dressing gowns to slightly elevate myself. I had requested non-feather pillows but when I got there I was told that down pillows are the standard pillow.\n\nDefinitely a mixed experience but, I would go back there tomorrow, if I could!

When valuing the World of Hyatt (WoH) points at a $0.01, we paid $505 for the night, which is seems asinine for less than 24 hours in a room, but sadly is par for the course in NYC. This property is centrally located to Times Square, etc., which can be both a \"pro\" and a \"con,\" depending on your perspective. \n\nI checked in really early (10:30am) on the WoH app but upon arrival, was told my room wouldn't be ready until 4pm (I actually didn't get a text notification until 4:45pm).  The lobby was small, as expected with a Manhattan hotel, and somewhat chaotic with many rooms turning over simultaneously.  The staff managed the chaos in a friendly, if not methodical manner. The lobby fixtures (namely the plastic flashing on the lobby walls) seek to give off an air of modernity, but up close, are pretty beat up and tired. The lobby bathrooms were similarly tired and \"clean enough\", probably due to constant use; many guests appear to dart back to the hotel to use them while milling about Times Square. \n\nThe room was fine, but not as we expected, based on World of Hyatt app pictures. Both the bedroom and \"living room\" parts of the suite were spacious (particularly for anything in Manhattan) and the pull-out sofa bed was about as nice as I've seen recently (great for kids).  That said, some of the fixtures felt cheap and overly pre-fabbed.  Also, I expected a larger bathroom and carpet, not the faux-wood vinyl flooring. All in all, these weren't deal-breakers for a one-night stay, but made the room feel a bit cheap and not a \"suite\" at a Hyatt, but instead something akin to a Fairfield Inn or Springhill Suites (not to trash their product; they're fine). \n\nBack to the common areas...I was invited to take a tour of the (\"T45\") bar and restaurant for the views but didn't due to time constraints and the fact the cool weather wouldn't make for desirable time outside, on a high floor terrace.  The fitness center has a decent selection of newer, well-maintained equipment but is not nearly as large as it is made out to be in the website photos.  Again, not a deal breaker, but worth considering if you are attempting to avoid crowds due to COVID or want to ensure you are able to use what you want.  \n\nAll in all, great location and generally pretty good by Midtown Manhattan standards (which is not saying much), but not luxurious.

Of course, after staying at the Park Hyatt it feels like you're slumming it.  Ha, ha.   But seriously it was a decent hotel.\n\nWe aren't in the room too much other than to sleep and shower in the morning and we were going to a bunch of Broadway shows right in Times Square so this worked out perfectly. It was literally one block from Times Square and about a 5-minute walk to any of the theatres we went to.\n\nI booked a King bed and a connecting room with 2 Queen beds and it was comfortable.  I read a lot of great reviews on TripAdvisor and they did do a great job.  My Hyatt Concierge requested a connecting room a while back and they immediately the same day I booked saw that my wife and I were both Globalists and they proactively upgraded us to an Executive Suite.  All for free without having to burn an upgrade certificate. I thought that was a great touch right from the start.\n\nOur room was on the 19th floor so wasn't too high (the building has 54 floors with a bar at the top).  They do a free tour to the top that you can go to with kids at 10:30 AM each morning but other than that kids aren't allowed up there.   The view was nothing special, especially after visiting Summit One Vanderbilt which I highly recommend.\n\nBreakfast is free for Hyatt Globalists but the restaurant is closed in the building. They just do this QR code that you can select and then they deliver it to your room in bags.  I think they use Grubhub.   Nothing special at all.  You can pick from oatmeal, breakfast bagel with egg and bacon, Avocado toast, cereals, various eggs, etc.  \n\nThe rate was about $400 per night per room with taxes.  The only issue we encountered was the bathroom sink in our kid's room didn't really work without first turning on the hot water and then turning on the cold water.  There was no water pressure for the cold water if you were using that alone.  But it was ok and we didn't want to move after arriving.  \n\nIf you're seeing some shows in Time Square this is an easy location. This isn't a luxury hotel so expectations should be realistic. But it's a good mid level hotel that was clean and besides the bathroom sink everything worked including the AC which worked super well.  The elevators are a bit slow but were ok and had a friendly employee down there letting people in.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Hotel well situated in city close to subway station and many major attractions within easy walking distance.\nRooms were clean, with large floor to ceiling windows, nice shower and a bath and the staff were friendly, helpful and welcoming. It was sadly pouring with rain on our first evening but the hotel provided guests with large orange hotel logo umbrellas which were a godsend for us.\nAs others have said, one of the biggest flaws was the slow and overworked elevators which is compounded by the split level make up of the hotel, so although there are 5 lifts (2 of which broke during our stay, I pity the poor guest stuck in there) they only service half of the hotel. Our children on floor 24 used the 2 left side elevators and my husband and I on floor 42 used the right hand 3 and only the right side went up to the rooftop bar. This meant having to elevators on floor 25 every time we needed to visit our children\u2019s bedroom\u2026.very time consuming.\nA plus was the rooftop bar with wonderful views which we visited to toast my husband\u2019s birthday (sadly minus the under aged 21 teenagers - aware this is not the hotels fault but US law) but we were unable to book a table as the QR code booking system requires a text confirmation set up which as we had no mobile data we were unable to complete, again aware this was not the hotels fault but thought it useful to point out to UK travellers who do not have the perk of data roaming ( it also stopped us accessing the citibikes hire for same text confirmation reason) \nAlthough we are unlikely to return to the city and therefore this hotel, I would have no issue recommending the Hyatt as an option to friends visiting the city.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel itself is clean and the rooms themselves are on the larger side (for New York City). Fair warning, the hotel is just off Times Square, which can be a bonus or negative, depending on your perspective. The major problem with the hotel (in fact, it's so bad it impaired the overall rating) is the elevator situation. There simply aren't enough elevators to meet the needs of the guests (plus the guests share the elevators with those eating at the rooftop bar\/restaurant). In the morning, guests can expect to wait 5 minutes to ride down. If you come back around dinner time, you should be prepared to wait in line for as long as ten minutes to get an elevator up to your room (I timed it on Saturday night). I realize this is NYC, and its a busy hotel at a very busy spot, but the elevator situation made it all but impossible to get to and from my room. On Saturday, I forgot my umbrella in my room, and couldn't spare the 20 minute roundtrip it would've taken if I had been forced to wait for an elevator up and back down.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

The staff were very pleasant and helpful.  We booked through American Express and received some \"extras\" which was nice.  We got a hotel credit and a late check-out.  They still do not have their traditional restaurant available for breakfast, but they have a call ahead hot breakfast through room service.  It is brought to you in a paper bag, so not room service style, but good if needed.  The breakfast is very pricy, but we used our resort credit.  Now, my one complaint - I really did not like the coffee.  I don't know if it was a type I don't like or if it was not good.....but I did not like it.  Luckily, there is a Starbucks across the street.  We could see it from our room!  The location of this hotel can't be beat.

This is a hotel yards from Times Square that has large clean rooms and enough facilities for everyone to enjoy. You come to NYK to spend time in the city rather than in the hotel so as long as the beds are comfy (they are super comfy) and the staff are nice (they are all very polite) then this is what you need. The rooms are large for NYK and also the bathrooms so there is no banging your elbows in the shower.\n\nWe had a great room with a balcony and it all just works (the 'busy' carpet could go though in the hallways). There is a bar at the top of the hotel on the 54th floor, but in these Covid times you need to make reservations. It does have a lovely view of the New Year Ball in Times Square. At 1030am each day they also allow guests to go to the bar for the views as there is outside space. Checkout at 2pm which is very useful and Louis on the door sorted our car back to JFK with no issues whatsoever.\n\nIf you want sweeping staircases and sprawling lounges then go to the Knickerbocker, but if you are here for NYK then you'll be fine here.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Stepped out of the taxi, and walked into reception. \nThe service and staff in the hotel, In our opinion is Just not good enough. Staff are so rude, did not want help.\u2018 too busy talking behind the desk to one and other.  You would think that there is no other hotel and we\u2019ve been allocated this hotel. \nAsked for help with where to eat, looking for a bbq place, supermarkets outside town, was told \u201cnot sure\u201d and then \u201ccan\u2019t understand this in English\u201d was told to use Google to find somewhere close by as they did not know. It makes no sense? \n\nUpon checking into the room, Coffee machine was not been working, turns out that you are unable to use more than one electrical device in the plug at the same time. So, if you have your coffee machine plugged in, then you are unable to also plug a charger in. Bizzare! \n\nJust as well, we also did not get any milk in the room, when we asked for milk we was told \u201cthe kitchen is closed, you will need to walk and find some from a mini mart\u201d. \nSame thing a couple of days later when asking if anyone had a lighter or matches. \nStaff just do not want to help at all. \n\nAsked for them upon check in to make a reservation for the bar upstairs, was told we needed to call and do that. When we did they advised we did not.\n\nOverall the hotel reception staff are rude, the hotel is not the best and massively Overpriced in comparison with others: the pictures shown on most websites are very different to reality. Four of our friends came out 2 days after us, stayed in a cheaper hotel around the corner.  the room was bigger, better views, and staff were much more friendly and helpful.  We visited them when they arrived and the hotel staff were very helpful when we asked them anything. Do not waste your money here!! \n\nwould never use your hotels again based on the experience. Room was not as we hoped,\u2019carpets in hallway are dated Just not good enough.. Room was not as we hoped,\u2019carpets in hallway are dated and do not even match the decor. Room was a time square view when booking, when mentioned on front desk at check in was told \u201cthe room has been allocated now\u201d. Not as described. \nThe only positive I had to say was, there was a lady in the roof too bar, very good and very lovely service. Cannot remember her name, but she had glasses and blondish hair. \u201cOld\nFashioned cocktail\u201d is very good. I would recommend this bar, the views are amazing. Very expensive. We had two cocktails each and it came to $120 - which in my opinion is expensive, would not pay $25 a cocktail in LONDON.\nour Maid, she was very good. Very helpful and friendly, always left our room clean.\n\nPersonally, we would advise you to save your money and go elsewhere. There is massively better Hotels, Cheaper with better service in New York than this place.\nTotally disappointed. Will be taking it up with our airline provider too.

This room was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever stayed in when visiting New York City, the best I\u2019ve ever stayed over the past 20 years. It\u2019s super modern and updated, with tons of \u201cextras\u201d And top of the line items including various lighting options, a robe and slippers, a premium hairdryer, a fabulous rainwater shower, tons of toiletries, including any toiletries you can imagine that you may have forgotten they provide you for free, Bottled waters, refrigerator, a Keurig, tons of closet and dresser space, Comfortable chairs and a couch, and the bed is so comfortable. The Florida ceiling windows provided an amazing view. The pull curtains were very convenient to easily open during the day and to close during the evening. There were two different televisions and also two different temperature controls in each room which I really liked so if someone stayed in the other room there were pocket doors to separate the two rooms and each room could have its own temperature. The housekeeping staff went above and beyond and when you ask for extra towels you actually get a ton and not just one or two like normal hotels. Each day they offer a private view on the top floor of the outdoor rooftop bar where you can get a beautiful view of the city at 10:30 AM each day and a free photo keepsake.  We ordered breakfast for room service and it arrived super fast and everything was packaged nicely in little containers and was delicious. The only thing I wished the room had was a microwave but this was the only thing missing and we ended up not needing one anyways. We will 100% be back and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful comfortable stay with friendly staff in the absolute perfect location. We were able to walk to Times Square and get to plenty of restaurants and shopping without having to take a subway or any other transportation. A+!!","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel mostly exceeded our expectations.  The lobby is no frills and basic.  But, the room is very nice, well updated, well appointed and clean.   The room was small, but once our things were put away and the luggage in the closet, it was adequate for two people, and much the size I would expect in New York.  \n\nThe hotel staff was very friendly.  Every person we saw had a pleasantry and each were helpful.\n\nThe location is excellent, within easy walking distance to many theaters, restaurants, bars and Times Square.\n\nWe were on the 36th floor, so we did not hear any traffic noise, etc.. so, the room was quiet, (with the exception of someone walking down the stairwell one early morning next to our room)\n\nMinor Complaints:\n\nI guess it is a personal preference.....but, I found the bed to be very hard and the pillows were very flat.   I used two pillows, folded them over, and they still didn't support my head.     The sheets were also scratchy and not soft...as were the towels.  In addition, the towels did not always match.  All of them were white, but some had a design around the side, others did not.   \n\nThe elevator was a bit slow.....Because the sign said no more than four on an elevator, (due to covid restrictions), we ended up waiting 5-10 minutes each time we needed to ride it, especially at busy times.   One day, we finally asked if we could get in with 4 other people....as, we had refused three other cars that already had the limited number of people.   \n\nThe \"Bar 54\" on the rooftop had excellent views.  However, it was the only place we found the staff to be a bit distant and not friendly.  Likewise, the food was not good.  The charcuterie board was horrible; dry, hard meat and cheese....grocery store delis are much better and cheaper.  \n\nFinally, when we left we found additional charges on our \"prepaid room\".  It appears they charge some type of \"gotcha charge\" of a \"destination fee\" of $30.00 per day?  I'm not sure why this wasn't included in the original price listed for the hotel, as it appears to be a standard part of the hotel charge....when I prepay for the room, I expect that to cover all but incidentals of room service, etc...\n\nNonetheless, when I return to New York, I will definitely consider this hotel again.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

We'd previously stayed at the Grand Hyatt at Grand Central Station, which is a superior hotel (obviously . . . Grand vs. Centric gives it away) but we had to walk a lot more. We will be staying at the Times Square Centric from now on. \n\nOur room was a standard NYC room with two double beds. Though we were considered a low floor (23rd) and facing away from Times Square, it was plenty high and had a nice view. Housekeeping did a good job.\n\nThere are two elevators for floors 2-25 and another for the higher floors. Staying near the top of our elevator's range was a boon because there was never anyone already on it when it came. I would recommend floors 22-25 for this reason. I didn't pay attention to how high up the other floors were, so I can't make any recommendations there.\n\nYes, breakfast is delivered in a bag (it said it would be left outside the room, but the delivery person knocked, eager to receive a tip no doubt), and the menu is limited, but I enjoyed it. Go to Connelly's a couple of doors down for a good sit down breakfast. \n\nAnother thing this hotel doesn't have is a mart in the lobby, but there's a Duane Reed across the street.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Everyone I encountered at the hotel was friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to be accommodating. I was emailed by Jorge prior to my arrival to ask if there was anyway they could make my stay more enjoyable, which was unexpected but greatly appreciated! I was provided an upgrade to a city view king room on the 25th floor, which was better than I expected for the room I initially booked! Checking in was an easy process, and DeeDee at the front desk was so welcoming and was able to check me in immediately, even though I arrived much earlier than the typical check-in time. \nThe room itself was very comfortable and tastefully decorated. Bathroom looked sleek and the rainfall showerhead was great to experience after a long flight.\nThe location is right off Times Square, which is perfect if you are visiting to watch shows or sightsee in the area. Really convenient to be able to easily retreat to the room when you need to. There's a Starbucks right across the street, and several restaurants within walking distance.\nThere were a few very minor issues; the bed pillows were a little flat, so I had to stack three to have a comfortable resting height for my head. Upon check-in I noticed a wet stain on the desk, but housekeeping had cleaned it up by the following day. Connecting to the TV's chromecast was somewhat tricky, so I barely used it. Otherwise, the room was a much needed quiet oasis where I could feel completely relaxed. \nThe tiny issues aside, what really made the stay great was the staff. Everyone made me feel like a valued guest. Item requests like a bathrobe, slippers, laundry bags and toothpaste were provided to the room promptly free of charge, and the doormen and security would always greet me when I returned. On the last day of my trip before check-out, I asked if I would be able to visit the rooftop to take in the view, which they allowed. Shaun accompanied me to the rooftop and, after I took pictures and videos, he asked about my trip and we had a nice chat. It was a great, memorable way to end my vacation. \nThe people who work at the Hyatt Centric Times Square really made this a special trip; just for this reason alone I'd wholeheartedly recommend staying here.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":4799063,"title":"Great Location","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-09-19","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This was the first time my wife and I stayed at a Hyatt Centric and after our experience we would definitely stay at this hotel again and also at another Hyatt Centric. We stayed at this Hyatt Centric because we wanted to be close to the 7 subway line to attend the US Open. Here are our comments:\n\nArrival: We arrived at the hotel at about 3:30 pm on a Friday after taking a Lyft from LaGuardia airport. The Lyft was about $70.00 to the hotel and it took about 20 minutes.  When we arrived at the hotel a very nice bell person asked if we needed assistance, we declined since we did not have too much luggage. We entered the lobby and went to the front desk. The lobby is small compared to other lobbies. But like the rest of the hotel, it does it job. \n\nChecking In:  Check in was quick because we were the only ones checking in. The person helping us was great, she explained the wifi access and also informed us to always show our room card key to the security stationed right near the elevator. We asked we declined the housekeeping service. We did not receive any additional points for declining the service. We was assigned a room on the 37th floor. I did not receive any notification or special perks due to being a Discoverist member, but maybe if I was a higher status it would be different.\n\nRoom: Part of the reason we chose to stay at the Hyatt Centric was due to the comments that the room is a little bigger than other New York hotels. Yes, I do have to agree that the room is bigger than the ones we stayed before. For the two of us, plus three suitcases the size was sufficient. The pictures on the website was accurate, there was a desk next to the television, and also a mini refrigerator. A chair with a floor ramp was next to the window, and the bathroom was a nice size. The door to the closet looks like the door to the next room, I guess other guest get this confused because when I called the front desk the person said other guests get this confused. There is an AC\/heater control which worked well. Sometimes too well, because it got really cold and when turned off it got hot again. Since our room was facing part of Times Square, there was a light from one of the advertisements that kept shining a little into our room. It was okay for us, but for others you might have to close the drapes.\n\nHotel Amenities:  There is a bar on the top floor, we did not see it. It seemed that it is a popular bar, especially on the weekend nights because when we arrived from the tennis matches, there was always a group trying to go up to the bar. The security did a great job holding the group back and allowing us to go up to our room by showing our room card key. I did not see a restaurant or gym facility. I did notice on the morning we were leaving the hotel that behind the front desk there is supposed to be a Concierge. Instead there are travel brochures and maps which might have been helpful to see this when we first go there.\n\nLocation: As others have said, the hotel is about a 1 minute walk to Times Square. The hotel is located on the same block as the closed Planet Hollywood. There is a Walgreens and a Starbucks right across the street. To get to the Times Square subway station, which various subway lines go to, it is about a 5-10 minute walk. If you walk the opposite direction away from Times Square, the shops on 5th avenue is about a 5-10 minute walk. Since you are near Times Square, Broadway theatres, there are a number of restaurants and stores nearby. Times Square can be a little intimidating to some people with the crowds (it is getting to be a little more crowded), the street performers, and some of the homeless people. However no one bothers you if you just keep to yourself. If you look interested in them they will approach you. \n\nHousekeeping: Even though we declined housekeeping, when we saw the housekeeper she always made sure we did not need cleaning or if we needed extra towels or the complimentary water or coffee pods. She was very pleasant.\n\nChecking out: Since we left the hotel at about 4:00 am, there were no one so checking out was very quick. We did use the luggage carts that was available. \n\nOverall, we did not encounter any major problems with the hotel. The staff was great, very helpful, and very responsive. The location is great, especially if you want to spend time near Times Square and want to see a Broadway show. Since New York has a ton of hotels, I think to decide where you want to stay will be determined in what area you want to be. For us, if we were to attend the US Open again, we might stay in the Queens\/Flushing area. However in this case we had no regrets staying at the Hyatt Centric and hopefully you also don't have any problems.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Due to the pandemic NYC was very quiet so we were offered the chance to upgrade the room for $25 per night, we declined this as didn\u2019t intend on being in the room that much. The room we had, on 20th floor, was really nice. Could see some of time square lights, plenty of room (By NYC standards) and a big bathroom. The hotel is yards from time square, an ideal location if you are a first timer to New York. I felt the pricing was a little inconsistent, when we asked before we arrived about cars to and from the airport we were quoted $120 (ish) each way, however, when we asked at the hotel it was $75 set fee. We opted for this as it was only $5 more than the total price of a set fee yellow cab. When we asked to keep the room on it was $50 per hour, which seemed excessive considering NYC was in an emergency situation and travel was prohibited from a lot of countries so rooms were available and an upgrade was only $25.\n\nStaff were helpful when needed.

This was my first experience at a Hyatt property in the US and my only previous frames of reference in terms of US hotels were Marriott and Hilton properties. This was a long 16-day trip and I was more than a little concerned about being comfortable. I was so cautious that I had my office split the booking so that I could check out if I was not happy. This hotel blew me away. The room and bathroom were great and everything worked the way it should. The decor and color schemes made everything seem airy and light. But the X Factor was the service. I have never experienced this level of warmth and friendliness outside of Taj, ITC and Shangri La properties in Asia. The staff were efficient, proactive, warm and friendly and they anticipated my needs. The GM of this hotel deserves to be commended for putting together and leading such a great crew. From Dyana and Michael at the reception; to Mickey at the bar; to Veronica in housekeeping to Jason, Walter and Luis, the doormen...HUGE shout out! What else can I say except that I will be back.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
