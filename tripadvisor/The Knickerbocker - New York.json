Everything you would want to is all within walking distance and Times Square is great when travelling with a 6 year old.\n\nAlso the hotel is impeccably clean and I liked the minimalist design of the interior. \n\nThe roof terrace bar is also excellent and worth a visit to sink a vodka martini at the place it was invented.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We have been to several \u201cDog Friendly\u201d hotels in NY. Last April 3, we drove to Boston and check in to Revere Hotel with our English and French bulldogs for 2 nights. Never had a problem. April 5 we checked in to Knickerbocker at NY together with our dogs. We arrived there at around\n4pm. We were told by the front desk person that we could not leave our dogs and should have the owner be present at all times\u2026 that we will be charge $350 when our dogs barks on top of Pet fee, but they will let us know when will be charge beforehand. We told her that this was the first time that we heard of this policy. And we find it rediculous that there is a fee charge when dog barks! And of course they gonna bark! So we asked for the manager because we were stressed by this and knowing the NY city does not have a lot of indoor establishments that allowed Pet to bring. Mercedez, the manager that time had explained to us that this was worded wrong. We also have tried to find the Hotel policy about unaccompanied pets and there is no where we can find it in the site! She also explained that they only charge for Noise disturbance fee when dogs are excessively barking which made a relief on us cause knowing the dog breed we have and they are very lazy. Plus we have Trazodone that we usually give to our pet only when we go out and a baby monitor connected to our own mobile WiFi. Plus our dogs does not have anxiey separation issues. Not even 2hours when we left our room, we have received phone calls from the hotel that they were receiving complains from other guest that our dogs was making noise. In the middle of our broadway show, 19:46 to be exact, another phone call, and after another. So right after the show, instead of getting few drinks we rushed back to our hotel and check our pet. With my friends, we stood in front of our room for like 5 minutes, no bark or noise made by our dogs. \nSo I went down at the concierge and spoke to\nMercedes, she has explained that they have been receiving complain from multiple guess. I had explained to her that my dogs does not continously barks,. I also heard from the other staff that there were other dogs on that floor. Our room was situated besides an elevator and only 1 room in front of us. She explained that because it was a common area, my dogs might be barking when guest alights from the elevator which I said they have to move us to another room. I also said that the phone calls we have been receiving is ridiculous and we have never had encountered this problem before. We are trying to enjoy the city for a little time that we have in NY but this hotel has stressed as out. At one point, I thought of being scammed, and I told Mercedez that I felt like we were being single out because we complained on our checked in. She also has explained that some other guest might be sensitive to noise. I have explained to her that as a \u201cdog Friendly Hotel\u201d I find it ridiculous, that we are getting a phone calls everytime a guest complain about barking! On our check out, of course we were charged $350 without informing us, without intervening on what can be done to pacify other guess while we also enjoy our stay in the hotel with a peace of mind that out pets are safe for a little time that we were out, and that no evidence to prove that they are excessively barking other than complains from other guess. That person who was checking out on Sunday morning at around 6am was also very rude. We asked the manager,  Ji won seo and he waived our fee. We also demanded to give the name of that front desk person but he refused to give it out. From cheked in to checked out, this hotel has done nothing but stress to us! We didn\u2019t even get the Plush bed, set of bowls, custom dog treats that they advertise in their web site!","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is just outstanding! Regarding the criteria classifying it a 5* hotel, I question them very much!\n\nConsidering this category of hotel, the major issues we faced are:\n\n-  Lack of consistent and accurate information shared among different units within the hotel, e.g. reception, restaurant, ... generating negative consequences for the clients\n\n-  Total lack of professionalism, client service mindset in all the dining infrastructure (restaurant, roof top). Before leaving, I shared my candid feedback with the Client Experience manager. He listened to me, apologised and offered us the unique dinner we had in the restaurant\n\n-  Outdated infrastructure (the elevators are quite old, you do not see at what level you are and quite often the badge does not work  [ observed a couple of people struggling to get to their room ] )\n\n-  Level of cleanliness : hardly acceptable for a 5* hotel\n\n- We had asked for a room with view on Time Square. We got a room with a view on the wall of the building next to the hotel! The only advantage was that it was very quiet.\n\nOn the other side, we found the two concierges - Stephanie and Diana, that were just great and Victor - one of the baggage porter - that demonstrated an impressive client service mindset and went clearly beyond his primary responsibilities, helping us to solve the issue that the restaurant employees should have solved!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We then asked to speak to the manager Kevin to file a complaint, he was quite rude and aggressive in his delivery of the information that \u201cwe will not be waiving your resort fee\u201d, which he also felt the need to reiterate a fair few times even though we never asked for a refund, only to file a complaint.

From the check-in which was swift and elegant, to Jay and the concierge service which was impeccable, from our beautiful, clean and quiet 8th floor room overlooking 42nd Street to the great restaurant and rooftop patio literally 150 feet from the Times Square NYE ball, everything was perfect. The room rate was great, offering excellent value. The location is ideal, across the street from the south end of Times Square and literally above the subway station. We walked just about everywhere, except when we needed to get to 72nd street on the Upper Westside which, thanks to Jay\u2019s advice, took us a mere 10 minutes on the number 2 express subway downstairs. We loved our stay here. Even a few hours without hot water due to a hotel boiler problem didn\u2019t create issues, as it was quickly fixed by the hotel.

The bathroom was clean and spacious. The shower does need updating. For a suite, I would have thought a built in rainforest shower should be expected as a minimum. It was a basic shower head and the pressure wasn't as powerful as I'd like, however, I know this can differ. \nService: Service was good. I can't complain on this. Everything we needed and wanted was dealt with professionally and with speed. \nFood\/Drink: We used the bar once, it was lovely and clean and spacious. Cannot comment on the food in the bar due to not eating in there. We did have room service (breakfast) which was lovely. Granted, American food isn't UK standard but I was happy with no complaints. \nGeneral: The only issue we had was when we checked in, the original room was no as advertised on the hotel and British Airways website.

The hotel is in the \u2018Leading Hotels of the World\u2019 group and markets itself as the only 5* hotel in Times Square - This is NOT a 5* standard hotel. \n\nPros -\n* Location, perfect for sightseeing \n* Housekeeping, the room was always immaculate on our return.\n* Room sizes, larger than the average NYC hotel.\n* Noise levels were so low considering the chaos outside.\n\nCons -\n* Tired decor in room, carpet frayed at the edges and stained with what looked like make-up. The dressing gowns provided had seen better days and were not wearable.\n* the rooftop bar, you\u2019ll be lucky to get in as it\u2019s always used for \u2018private events\u2019 seemingly at peak times, this was annoying.\n* No personal touch - because of the way the lobby is laid out staff literally have no idea if you\u2019re a resident or just a customer using the bar. We stayed at the hotel a week and couldn\u2019t tell you any staff members that stood out to us or made it special or even recognised us as guests.\n* No in room tea\/coffee facilities. There were free hot drinks in the lobby in the morning but this would have meant getting dressed to go down to get a drink.\n* No \u2018do not disturb\u2019 sign for the door - this is something I\u2019ve never encountered before as a problem, but due to this the housekeeping would come in the morning\/evening and wake you up by knocking. This is an easy thing that could be rectified.\n\nI would recommend this hotel but that\u2019s purely based on the room size and location but I think you could probably get nicer for less money not too far away.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Even Premier Inns in the UK have a Nespresso!  Also the bars in the hotel shut  early, so by the time you have had dinner and return they are shut - not great.

Long ago, the hotel decided that renting out the lobby to a sneaker. Store was more important than a grand entrance for your guests. The lobby is tiny and has very little seating for guests waiting to check in. We joined the queue leaning against the wall and waited 20 minutes to check in. We spent this time listening complaints from guests going to the front desk. We had hoped we would have a better experience, but that was not the case. \n\nOur first room was an awkward interior room with a view of the hotel HVAC system. It went downhill from there. When we came back from a show we noticed that the room was quite warm. Turned thermostat all the way down but it kept warmer. Opened the window as much as we could. Kept waking all night from the heat. It was 80 degrees in the room and impossible to get a good sleep. \n\nIn the morning I went down to request a room change. They asked if they could look at the problem first. I described how horrible the experience was and said not only should I get a room change that the hotel should make a concession for putting us in a room that should not be in service. agreed to provide a new room but would only offer a $50 food and beverage for a horrible night. She said if I was unhappy with that she could have a manager call me I said that would be helpful. She also said that someone would call me when our new room was ready they would call. We never received a call the room was ready. \n\nWhen we returned around 5 PM, they did indeed have a new room for us. At this time, I mentioned that no manager had ever called me and I was still waiting for that call. We went up to our new room, which had better temperature control and an improved view, which was less important. The problem was that like the other room it was beat up and outdated. The carpet was stained, bedding had stains, curtains were ripped, and the furnishings showed significant wear and tear. \n\nI should also mention the elevators are horrible. You\u2019ll spend a great deal of your time in this hotel, waiting for an elevator. Not only really slow, they don\u2019t even have an indicator to show which one is coming and which ones are near. Some things old are nostalgic and charming. Some just need to be replaced.\n\nDefinitely not a five star property. Not even close. to request for a manager to call me any three night stay, never happened. \n\nThis hotel has a wonderful location. The benefits and there.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Just an hour before checking in and as I was on my way someone from the hotel called and informed that they cannot honor the $70 price as it was mistakenly put online and is too low. He offered a price of nearly $200 per night or my reservation would be canceled, to which I agreed given I did not have anywhere else to go on the last minute. I was checked in with an African-American reception lady and I asked her if the higher price also included breakfast, to which she said yes and confirmed my rate includes breakfast.\n\nAn hour later the hotel charged me $443 for \"security deposit and resort fee.\" When I complained over the phone to the reception, they reported that my hotel rate did not include taxes, resort fee and security deposit.\n\nThe next morning when we went for breakfast, I requested the server for an espresso and he coldly responded that they do not serve espresso based coffee and that I had to go to the cafe in the lobby on ground floor to get an espresso if I need one. Forgetting about espresso, I went to check what kind of breakfast they were offering and given I was told my breakfast is included, I and my girlfriend grabbed a glass of orange juice, a croissant and glass of milk since there wasn't much options anyway. (The breakfast included only croissants, scrambled eggs, two types of bread, milk, orange juice, yogurt, some fruit and veggies and potatoes and that's it. The funniest breakfast I have seen in any 5 star or so called 5 star hotels!) The breakfast service was so bad that my girlfriend joked about a chic-fil-a's service being better than this so called 5 star hotel. We were still joking about the breakfast when the waiter brought an even funnier $120 bill in which we were charged $45 per person for a glass of milk and orange juice. On top of that, the waiter had included an 18% gratuity twice, yes, you read it correct TWICE and a total of 36% gratuity to the bill. When we mentioned the breakfast was included the waiter very rudely responded that if it was included we would get a refund but WE HAVE TO PAY and sign the bill. Having left with no option I paid the bill and as I was exiting the restaurant, another waiter directly ran after me and asked me to pay for breakfast to which the waiter I had paid the bill to shouted from the other corner of restaurant that I am clear to go. Very funny scene!\n\nI reported all this to the front desk and they promised that one of the managers would contact me. An hour later one of the managers called and asked me about the situations I have had with the hotel since the previous day. After I explained everything, the manager very cold and unapologetically said that everything has been conducted from their side as per the hotel's policy and that she can't help me. When I insisted on being overcharged she without saying anything further hang up the phone and did not answer my call after.\n\nUpon checking out I was furious and tried to talk to someone who would probably care but the front desk couldn't find a manager after calling here and there for a long while. On top of that, when I complained to the African-American reception lady who checked me in the previous day that she gave me wrong information about breakfast being included, she straightforwardly lied to my face that she did not check me in! After the failed attempts of finding a manager, one of the front desk gentleman promised me that one of the hotel managers would call me eventually after my check out. Now it has been three days since my check out & I haven't been contacted by anyone from the hotel!\n\nThe amount of unprofessionalism and carelessness towards guests I saw in this so called 5 star hotel is unparalleled to any hotel I have ever stayed in!!","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Nothing remarkable in the inside","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-11-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"The overall experience was good, the location at the corner of Times square is absolutely top with a subway entrance just out of the door. Rooms are comfortable and correctly sized. What disappointed us a bit is the lack of \"personality\" of the inside of the hotel, which is in contrast with the monumental exterior facade and the long history. There is nothing unique or remarkable inside the Hotel, the all place is functional but \"aseptic\", when you are inside you could as well be in any other standard hotel. This is also in contrast with our usual experience in the hotels member of the LHW. \n\nBreakfast had a somewhat limited choice but the quality of everything was very good, so nothing to complain about. Not so for the breakfast room, where every seat was exposed to a stream of cold air from the ceiling and there was music too loud (we had to ask twice to turn it down).\n\nOne of the best things in the hotel is the bar on the top floor. First of all you do not need a reservation to find a place, you just walk in. There is what seemed a nice and spacious terrace, but it was too cold to sit outside so we sat at the bar. We had two different barmen in the two evenings we were there and they were both good. A Manhattan seemed appropriate, given the location, and it was great. Only minus: they do not offer any nuts or similar with the drinks. A questionable choice, had we had something to crunch we would have ordered a second drink, since we enjoyed the first one, but that was not the case. \n\nIn the room initially there was no kettle or cups or anything and the shower gel dispenser was broken. After we informed the reception both things were rapidly corrected (but why didn't they check before ?) We found later that two drawers and one light were broken, but honestly we did not bother asking for repair (in theory also that should have been checked by maintenance, without us asking for it)\nElevators are too slow for the numbers of stores of the building and there is no indication inside of the floor Nr. at which you are. (at least, it was not working)\n\nPersonnel was like the interiors: functional but impersonal. Only one lady at checkout was nicer than the average and managed to give us a copy of the nice book about the hotel history which we had seen inside the room. Appreciated.\n\nIt was possible to get only two hours of late checkout, unfortunately. (late checkout is one of the (not guaranteed) benefits for LHW members, like us.)\nSo we left the luggage in deposit for a couple of hours. I was a bit surprised and irritated that when collecting the bags the employee explicitly asked for a tip. I ignored the request but I found it unpolite and inappropriated in such a hotel.\n\nPrice is on the high side for what you get, but I guess the location is the main cause for that.\nIn summary, if it fits your budget, this hotel is a good choice.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Someone must know someone because I have stayed at four star hotels that shoot this sterile joke out of the water. \n\nI complained and politely asked to change rooms upon arrival and was told they had nothing. I called two more times the same evening to no avail. Then at 6am upon waking called to talk with a smart man who said if i cared so much I should have come down last night and complained. I was shocked at his audacity and explained we have three little ones upstairs why would we do that when obviously we have still\naccomplished nothing over the phone as we would in person. \n\nFirst off the customer service here is non existent. Upon arrival we were not acknowledged in any warm way. The room we booked was to have a view of times square rather we have a view of an office building rather than the city. The window is shoved in the corner and you quite literally have to stand in the actual window to see out it. \nOne generally prefers to wake up and look out a window in this care that is not possible. \nsee here you must choose\u2014large bathtub or view. I chose view for my children despite how they prefer a bathtub so they could still see the city the outside when up in the hotel resting. There is nothing to see. \nYou should not book a room with a \u201cview\u201d because there is not a desirable one\u2026..this may work to trick someone into thinking they are viewing something if you have never been to NYC. Our room look\u2019s NOTHING like the pictures online. \n\nWe specifically chose this hotel because it was supposed to have that new york charm however you cannot get past the cold unwelcoming feeling this shell of a building gives you.\n\nAvoid this place at all costs for the sake of your pockets and your NYC experience. This has zero charm, snarky rude staff and they on top of it are noticeably understaffed.\n\n$200 at the restaurant in the hotel for some cheeseburgers old pasta, no server just a hostesses shuffling about. The whole restaurant made us so uncomfortable. Super strange there were two ladies just sleeping on the sofas when you enter the restaurant\u2026.\nAbsolutely atrocious. \n\nThis has been a really disappointing start to our birthday getaway for our son, We even we\u2019re told to call the day of arrival for a special birthday welcome and then we\u2019re informed once calling it was the day before. Someone isn\u2019t communicating with their staff to the guests correct so they stuck a measly chocolate up here for him. No card like happy birthday nothing. I\u2019ve stared again at four stars in the city that greet you with strawberries and champagne, have incredible views and bathtubs not compromising square footage. That warmly welcome you and make you feel at home. \nShame on us for even thinking hey let\u2019s try something different and stay in the \u201ctouristy\u201d area.

And the elevators were bizarre - no indication of which floor you were on while inside the carriage! Very strange. \n\nThe rooms were very spacious, beautiful bathroom, comfortable beds.\n\nI received excellent support from the Sales Team regarding my room block.

The rooms were a decent size and very hi-tech (you could tell absolutely everything had been considered right down to the little light in the toilet that gave off just enough light so you could go in the middle of the night without needing to wake up too much or wake anyone else). The location was also fabulous as you could walk to most places. Pre-arrival communication for things like arranging transfers etc was excellent and timely.\n\nCons: despite being made aware on numerous occasions by both myself and my travel agent that we were there to celebrate my 40th birthday, not once was I offered so much as a word of celebration which is practically unheard of in the travel and tourism industry. When we requested a restaurant recommendation, we were automatically given a top end one (dinner that evening cost me $200+ and I've had MUCH better for under $100 (I later learned the hotel is affiliated with a number of restaurants so they will only ever recommend them). The location, whilst great, is also a lot more dangerous than other areas which is obvious when you smell the amount of marijuana being consumed in public and witness the amount of emergency vehicles being required in that area (we were unable to vacate the theatre after the show we'd been to watch until it was deemed safe to do so. Housekeeping was hit and miss and the maid seemed shocked when I gave her a tip. Aside from door\/security staff, the rest just seemed like elitist idiots that had been mixing with over-privileged guests too long.

That's fine, if not for the fact that it was $500 the night when I stayed there.  The room was small and bare bones  (weird things I suspect happened during the Covid \/ homeless era.). The bar, which used to be cool is overrun by cruise line types.  But worst of all...only two elevators were in order.   It took me 30 minutes to check into my room and I had to plan a strategy for exiting the hotel, packing my bags and figuring out how I would get to Penn Station.  I will say at least  the staff was attentive, that was a redeeming aspect.   They were doing their best.  But this once splashy, cool hotel is now just another Times Square special that could find a place on the seedier side of the Vegas strip,  I'm sure it's not easy running a hotel in NY these days, but it's a three star hotel that should never be higher than $300 per night.

Reading the book it was fascinating to skim through all the beginnings of the hotel and it's evolution, but does everyone really take the time to do so when there is so much in the city to see and do?

I ususally stay at another hotel in Time Square but that hotel was closed so was forced to try something new.  We arrived and they assigned a lower category room than what we paid for.  We complained to the front desk and at first they told us that the hotel was fully booked and nothing could be done but that changed when we asked to speak with the Manager.  At $700 a night I wasn't going to settle for anything less than what I paid for.  After showing us several rooms we finally agreed to take an accessible room which wasn't ideal but it was the best of the lot since we weren't going to be disturbed by the constant pinging of the elevator.  We ate breakfast at the restaurant and it was good but pricey.  The staff and door people don't pay any attention to you, we weren't even offerred assistance to get a cab.  The location is ideal and the hotel is clean and modern but my husband (who is less picky than I am) says we won't stay there again, the check in experience was off-putting and the hotel isn't really anything special considering it's branded as a luxury hotel.  I've stayed in luxury hotels and the Knickerbocker isn't it.  Having said that, if you're not that picky and want a great location in Times Square then I would recommend it.  Rooms are small but it's clean and serves its purpose.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Beds very comfy and the room wasn't too noisy given the busy street the hotel is located on. Sadly on our last night the people in the room next door were having VERY loud sex at 2am which kept us awake then in the morning they just had a screaming argument. Very selfish and inconsiderate behavior. \n\nThere is a very good coffee shop on the ground floor called Jakes which we frequented every morning with lovely helpful staff. Biggest let down really was the St Cloud rooftop bar. Service was either slow, non existent or completely inconsistent. My husband asked for a smoking table so he could vape and we were put into a small atmosphere-less 'box' area then when we looked behind us in the middle of the main bar a guy was sat smoking a massive stinking cigar. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food.\n\nBest thing about this hotel is the concierge Stephanie, the most helpful, knowledgeable and enthusiastic concierge we have ever met and a real credit to the hotel.

When we checked out, one of my kids left their phone in the room by accident. They were nice to offer to have the phone shipped to our house since we had already left.

I was ok with everything else but that was not cool. The manager on the phone said she would have the concierge look into it. The person who accidentally shared my info sincerely apologized. That was fine but management did nothing to respond. I, personally, would have paid an extra 300-400 per night at another hotel if it meant I would get better overall service and what I asked for.

Location just above the subway at SEC of Broadway and 42nd in Times Square makes you a quick walk\/ride from the entire city. Doormen were present half the time, brought bags to room quickly, and kept away the non guests from entering. Elevator requires a key card to access your floor as most do in major cities now. The room was ice cold during some of the hottest weather in NY this year, remote controlled drapes kept it plenty dark to sleep in after a late night. Double vanity sinks huge mirror, walk in shower with rain soaking head (was spa like) with opaque glass doors. The bathroom door is a sliding glass opaque glass door with a drape for extra privacy and to block light from the bathroom window. Queen beds instead of the full size at many NY hotels is one of the reasons we chose the Knickerbocker; they were the best beds of our east coast vacation. Large sitting couch was a nice place to crash after walking 5th Ave and Times Square and crush Joe's Pizza in the wee hours of the night. Room was clean, two bottles of water each day, ice delivered by food service as needed, remotes for lights, drapes and to show privacy wanted or service needed. Small closet had slippers\/robes, hangers and a few drawers including a safe if you feel the need for one. We hope to be back.

Although when booking we requested a room away from the elevators (we had read reviews that people congregating for the lifts could be noisy), we were given a room by the elevators.  The next day the staff moved us to a room further along the corridor with no fuss.  In the first room the bathroom\/lavatory lay-out was rather odd meaning little privacy.  In the second room it was better but not great.  Another negative was that the window blind did not fit well (I think it was worn out) meaning that the flashing lights from the huge neon signs on buildings around Times Square infiltrated the room.  On that note, I'm not sure I have seen so many small lights for this and that in the room all through the night.  If you are very light sensitive, this might not be the place for you.\n\nIt was pretty good value although breakfast was not included (something that I usually loathe but not a problem in NYC as it was fun to breakfast out).  Whilst I have given it 4 stars, next time I will look elsewhere for a quieter location.  That said, I wouldn't be upset if I had to stay there again.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Once the morning came and the usual suspects were back at the desk we were met with \u2018 well if maintenance can\u2019t fix it, there\u2019s nothing I can do\u2019 and immediately turned away.  We asked to change rooms rather than stay in a room with no tv. She huffed and puffed and said \u2018well we can\u2019t upgrade you\u2019 implying we were fishing for a freebie. FFS we were staying a week and just wanted a working tv. So after much muttering and typing and avoiding all eye contact she conceded they could move us to another room. But it wouldn\u2019t be ready until 5pm. So we asked if we could keep our existing room until then, for a seamless handover. More staring into her screen and muttering and finally 10 minutes later we got a reluctant ok. But then we got locked out by our room key, and were met with defensive explanations rather than \u2018let me help you with that\u2019 . It felt like dealing with petulant, lazy teenagers. Frustrating and annoying. Other guests felt the same way, we shared eye rolls and sighs as we waited in queues together, so it wasn\u2019t just us. \n\nI\u2019d love to go back as it was a great hotel. But hopefully all the petulant front desk staff will be gone and will be replaced by welcoming, communicative adults.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Heavy glass doors add to the ambiance but aren't very useful in a small hotel room. The $45 residence fee\/night gets you the option to pay for water at a reduced rate.

Times square has an accessible Metro 140ft away, that also has a direct shuttle service to Grand Central station, and the hop-on hop-off sightseeing bus stop right outside the hotel door. This makes getting around New York and seeing the sights a breeze, with most of NYC many attractions near a metro or bus stop. If your staying for a while get a Metrocard or Omny pass to keep costs down, these are valid on both the subway and local buses. \nThe Hotel itself was exceptional. An iconic building in its own right, frequented by many celebrity guests over the years, its Victorian fa\u00e7ade, hides a state of the art interior. If you have time, look for the old hidden door to the knickerbocker hotel still visible in the Times Square metro station, or visit the ultra-modern St Cloud's Lounge on the rooftop and enjoy a drink or snack. \nOur room was very spacious, scrupulously clean, extremely comfortable and surprisingly very quite. We had views over times square, access to the gym, and the rooftop bar. The air-con was great for the hot weather, as we returned to a nice cool room. The walk in shower was perfect, and multichannel TV. kept us up-to-date with world affairs and the weather.  A coffee pod machine can be requested. If you miss your morning cuppa just ask for a kettle. Room came with a built in fridge, plenty of storage space and a safe.  \nHowever, More important to us than the location (which was perfect) and the exceptional hotel, was the attitude of staff. We have never been treated with such respect, and hospitality. The staff went above and beyond being courteous and friendly without being in-your-face or obvious. A big shout out to the housekeeping department who kept our room spotless and topped us up with bottled water, and the concierge and reception staff who assisted with a return car to the airport. We highly recommend this hotel on so many levels, and would love to return here.

We couldn't hear any street noise or noise from another room.  The room was modern and very well designed.   No room bar, which I never use, a nice closet, plenty of drawer space, a comfortable desk, and a nice and comfortable bed with four large pillows, two firm and two soft.  Convenient power outlets and adequate connections for my devices.  The bathroom only had a single sink, but it was cleverly laid out with a nice shower and a separate toilet area.  Daily maid service was provided automatically unlike the trend in many other hotels.  If you don't go the theatre in New York you probably should not stay in the Times Square area, but if, like us, you do, the combination of a good location for Broadway theatre and a very pleasant hotel makes this a great pick.

The main issue is that apart from the concierge service (particularly Hector) which is amazing everywhere else is really poor, its like you're doing everyone a favour staying there. This was my uncles 70th birthday present trip we did a tour of the US and stayed at 5 hotels from LA to NYC and this was the worst of the lot. On arrival it was 930 pm  at night and the reception staff clearly were not bothered, no welcome to the hotel no smiles or explanations about the services. I asked if we could get dinner anywhere and they said the restaurant was closed but the bar on the top floor was open until 11pm... we get up there and this bar is on the rooftop and its party central which was fine, but the waitress was about as interested in us as a cockroach crawling on the floor, we clearly were not 'on trend' its like a devils wear Prada interview, we said we wanted food (it was 10pm but needed to wait for my uncle) couldn't get coffee or tea just cold drinks, we ordered food at 10.15pm, waitress came back 10 min later to say kitchen closed .....Gave up went out.  Next morning we spoke to reception as we had asked for a kettle and hadn't had any water in our room, which you are supposed to have daily.  We repeated this exercise three days in a row, got water two days and the kettle never turned up  despite assurances they would ( there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms).  One of our rooms was a disabled access, which meant room bars everywhere and no sofa... we asked for it to be changed but again got nowhere.  Sounds like moaning maybe but its an expensive hotel and supposed to be 4\/5 star. forget it.  its really the service it just sours it. Dont bother, pay less for a Hilton and get what you pay for.

I have lots of good things to say about this hotel BUT the fact that when we checked out were stuck with an ADDITIONAL SERVICE CHARGE added to our room per night made the entire experience of the hotel less shiny and a bit disappointing. The Service charge was $45 + tax per night! We asked if it was charged at all hotels and a NYC law, but they said it is something that they have just starting charging - so apparently hotels can just stick you with a \"service charge\" on your stay. And it is TAXED! We made our reservation through LastMinute.Com and it included services and taxes. And isn't part of staying in a 5 star hotel getting great service? If we had known we were actually paying for the great service and slow WiFi we received we wouldn't have given all the staff such good tips!\n\nSo THE HOTEL - is nice. All staff were very friendly and the maids for morning service and turn down service we amazing. The entire housekeeping team were great. The rooftop bar is great! Good vibe, good music and friendly staff. Breakfast was good - not amazing and seemed reasonable but after coffees and a side of bacon it came to over $100 - so only did that once -there are great diners around the corner that are amazing including the diner from Seinfeld (Westway Diner - fantastic!)\n\nLocation is great if you want to feel the gritty part of NYC and be close to things by the river. Times Square is on the doorstep and you can see the famous NYE's ball from the roof top terrace. Also easy for Subway that goes uptown and lots of Ubers around. It is a very lively area and a postcard of Midtown NYC and Broadway. Lots of things close by or very easy to get to. Plus a Whole Foods on the corner!\n\nThe ROOMS are very spacious (we had 2 doubles) but there was not a stocked minibar and no tea or coffee maker - we asked for one at the front desk on check in because we read from other reviews this was a problem (thank you). The decor is nice but a bit dated and isn't as luxurious as they make out on the website. I was excited that they had Diptyque products in the rooms (I judge the quality of the hotel by their products) and I have to say I was disappointed. The whole hotel, while nice, needs a bit of a little makeover and needs to be more generous to its guest. Aesop products (not nailed to the wall) and a little redecorating is needed. \n\nOverall it was a good stay and I would recommend it but just BEWARE OF THE SERVICE CHARGE.!!!!","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Already in NYC (and as a local), I know that accommodation can be overpriced and kinda meh on this weekend. The Knickerbocker was a fantastic experience all around, and I wouldn't hesitate at all to return or to suggest the hotel to friends and family members at any point of the year. \n\nThe room was spacious, clean and quiet, even though it was located above arguably the biggest street in NYC (42nd St). Check-in was seamless, and the staff were extremely accommodating. \n\nHowever, the best part about the stay was a special experience. I had asked the staff if they could organize a martini experience, since the hotel is known as the \"birthplace\" of the martini (to learn more, ask about what that means!) Sofia, the Food and Beverage Manager, and Julian, a world-renowned Mixologist, curated the most amazing martini tour for me and my partner. Sofia brought her outstanding expertise on the history and cultural aspects of the hotel, while Julian curated a similar historical trip through the martini's timeline. Highlights were the tour of the older aspects of the hotel and a trip in time through the variety of the tasting. I truly believe that Sofia and Julian have created a most unique experience, and we are very grateful to them. \n\nCheckout was seamless as well. I would highly recommend the Knickerbocker at any point. As a Manhattan resident since 2002 and as having stayed in many hotels in the city, I would say that this has by far been my favorite due to the combination of kind staff, exceptional service, fair prices, and spacious, comfortable rooms.

He checked on us continuously, made sure my mom (who is handicapped) got into cars safely, and always was so patient and welcoming. He made our stay memorable! We looked forward to being greeted by him everyday we stayed. \n\n2- stephanie and Diana concierge - these two also made our stay feel so personal. We felt like we were guests in their own home. They checked up on us, treated us to a tea for two in the bar and sent up a bday cake slice for my mom!! By the end we were exchanging hugs! Cannot wait to see them again. \n\n3 - Louise was INCREDIBLE. Such a wonderful conversationalist and also so kind and helpful with my mom. My mom is a senior who is slower in movement but loves to chat and Louise gave her a lot of time and attention. It really brightened her whole day. She felt important and seen! \n\n4 - jimmy - bellman - such a wonderful, helpful man. He made sure our bags were taken care of and loaded. Got us a great deal on transport to the airport and was the last person we interacted with on the way out. Such a fun man, so nice and helpful to my mom. \n\nRooms are nice and BIG and spacious for NYC! and for hotels in general. Beds are comfy, diptyque products are so luxurious and the location is so perfect if you want to be in the mix!

It's a landmark Beaux Arts building and its prestigious Times Square address means easy access to NYC notorious attractions.\n\nI relished my Premier City View room with King Bed and great view over Broadway. Soaring 12 foot ceilings and oversized doors and windows created an outlandish sense of space. Decor consisted of textured fabrics , oak wood finishes and bespoke lighting that all taken together promoted a heavenly ambiance. The bathroom was spacious, sleek and luxurious with marble sinks and a frosted glass walk-in shower with waterfall.\n\nThere are 3 distinct dining venues at the Knick. Charlie Palmer at the Knick specializes in American cuisine and offers 3 categories of service namely: breakfast, bar& lounge and in room dining. Breakfast options range from the buffet to a la carte and the all-day lounge menu featured a range of plates and I tried the signature fried chicken.. amazing.\n I found Jakes @The Knick coffee shop an excellent spot for grab-and -go pastry and a cup of Joe. For a view , I headed upstairs to St. Cloud, a rooftop bar purveying inventive cocktails.\n\nSo, if you are looking for luxe accommodations in the heart of Manhattan but want to escape the Times Square mayhem..............then try the ............Knickerbocker.......A Times Square Hotel without the Frenzy.\n\n ","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

How this place ever got 5 stars is beyond me. Here are a few of the reasons why:\n\nThe doorman was not at the door. For three full days we never saw him anywhere but chatting in the back with coworkers. This matters in NYC a lot\u2026exhausted guests wrangling with bags and heavy doors while staff just enjoys their conversations was pretty annoying. \n\nUpon check in we had no toilet paper or tissues in the room. Pretty awkward and inexcusable. \n\nOur first showers in the room included mold falling off the plumbing fixtures ONTO us, and it took three calls and two days to get someone to \u201cclean\u201d it but they didn\u2019t really fix the problem. There was so much mold buildup in there it seemed it hadn\u2019t been cleaned for a very long time. \n\nNo coffee in the room, the furniture is terrible quality and beat up and the drawers barely open or close. There was no bathroom door in our room - just a curtain. Which is sheer. Strange for a room with two queen beds - obviously not a couple using that room. There is a window in the shower with no blind, so morning sun came in the bathroom and shines right in the room with no door or way to stop it - exactly the opposite of what you want in a hotel room. \n\nAt one point, someone spilled a cup of coffee in the elevator so the staff, instead of just wiping it up, propped open the elevator door for what may have been an hour which made the other elevators useless - all in a Monday morning during checkout. I was tempted to get some paper towels and help them out. So stupid. \n\nI kept wishing we had chosen the Hilton Garden Inn right next door. I bet their bathrooms aren\u2019t moldy and they probably have a coffee maker in the room. \n\nIn addition to the property problems and the lazy staff, there was an issue with my reservation and even though I had an email confirmation IN MY HAND, the hotel did not honor it. I had changed my checkin and checkout dates and instead of doing what was right for the guest, they informed me that I had been charged for a no-show the night before and I had to pay for my third night.\n\nI spent hours and hours trying to rectify the situation during our vacay. No one - not even the GM - was empowered to do the right thing for me and stop making me work on their problem. In the end I locked my credit card so they couldn\u2019t charge me. \n\nJust choose somewhere else - the five star rating doesn\u2019t translate and there are plenty of places to choose from in Times Square.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Excellent location cannot be beat. The coffee shop is open now. The hotel is very quiet given its location, but city-view rooms will let in a bit more noise than non-city view rooms. This is mostly evident on Saturday nights and if you hear anything, it will likely be a car engine being revved to show off a loud exhaust or something similar. The hotel has been increasing room prices throughout the year as demand increases, but this is also true of all of the NYC properties I checked out for this trip. They now have turn down service, but it did not happen on Saturday night and no explanation was provided. It did take place every other night so not sure what that's about.

But on reading reviews I saw it had been recently renovated and was quiet (my number 1 requirement), and I thought that because it was the old Astor mansion, it would be an interesting and different hotel, as many Leading Hotels of the World properties are. Was I ever wrong. I could have stayed at the Marriott for half the price and it would have been better. I entered the hotel and the Concierge who was busy looking at her phone never looked up and never greeted me. (and again, not once the whole stay). I was escorted past a bank of plain elevators, not the Beaux Arts building I was led to believe, where a disinterested staff member checked me in, and seemed annoyed when I asked if there was an upgrade available. It looked like NY office building from the last century. There was nothing wrong with the room but there was nothing special either. No coffee maker, no mini bar,  bare shelves, none of the nice amenities that one associates with a luxury hotel. The bathroom amenities were scant, half were missing, and the ones that were there looked like Best Western bottles and smelled like my grandmother. \nI arrived after a long trip and looked forward to a relaxing cocktail in the lounge. The 'bartender' (who in all fairness was doing his best), took my order of an Aperol Spritz, arguably the most popular cocktail in the world. He took out a champagne flute? and a shaker?! So I nicely asked him if he knew how to make it. His response revealed he did not and he apologized saying he was just a server. Clearly he had been corraled into this against his will, but was a team player. I explained how to make it and he tried, but it was awful, it was served without a garnish, without ice and no napkin. I got a 'discount' but still, there was no way I should have been charged for that drink.  \nThe next morning, at a truly sub-par breakfast, 3 of the servers got into quite the shouting match in the middle of the dining room. Nice look. The food and the coffee were dreadful. Denny's would have been better.\nThat night the Broadway drummer (you know, those guys that bang on plastic tubs in the street) was below my window making the most gawdawful racket til after midnight. Windows were definitely not soundproof. \nI was charged $300 for my 5 lb dog!!! I have had far better experiences at a Marriott. I cannot fathom how LHW could include this in their portfolio of beautiful hotels that pride themselves on treating their guests well. It was just dreadful. Even if they get their staffing problems under control, you can definitely do better in the NYC luxury market.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

We stayed in a corner suite on the 9th floor. Great room with over 600 square feet overlooking Times Square and 42nd Street.  The guest room was spectacular, as well as the amazing updated, modern bathroom!!!!   Housekeeping visited 3 times a day to clean and bring amenities to the room.   We never saw them or heard them during a 7 day stay.  Very extraordinary. It is notable that I mention housekeeping first. They are underappreciated and undervalued, but they can make the hotel experience very special. They are there everyday and can make your stay memorable. The concierge desk was amazing with advice, reservations and great tickets for whatever we wanted to do or see.   The doormen were very helpful with good advice on nearby, walkable diners for breakfast, simple lunches, as well as navigating the subway system or helping stop traffic on 42nd Street for us to cross and catch our lyft ride.  A terrific location with modern, technologically up-to-date rooms including high broadband wifi as well as remote controlled black-out shades and remote controlled lighting levels.  All the staff were thoughtful, helpful and, again, special kudos to the housekeeping staff that made returning to our room a joy.  I would highly recommend this hotel for location, service and value (space and ambience) for the price.  As an aside, it\u2019s a half block to the 42nd Street station for subway #7 to Jackson Heights in Queens; free transfer to the bus, Q70, to LaGuardia Airport.   WOW, 45 minutes for $2.75 vs the lyft ride at an 1 hour, 10 minutes for over $100 dollars.   Easy, seamless and inexpensive.  Subways are cheap, safe and great!!!!

So, I decided to take them to NYC to show them the best of the Country. I chose the Knickerbocker for its reviews and also, the location had seemed useful, and it had come recommended by my boyfriend. We arrived to the hotel via the Acela at about 4:45pm and had rented a junior suite as there were three of us and I wanted it to be as luxe as possible. Our room wasn't ready. We had just fought our way through the hottest, loudest, overwhelming Times Square crowds, with a lot of luggage and were sweaty and very casually dressed. Not to speak of my friends' jet lag.  The check-in agent offered ZERO apology. Just a \"Yeah, room's not ready yet. We'll give you these drinks coupons for the roof deck while you wait. Giving us two coupons each. Keep in mind that we all needed showers and to freshen up before being public facing and this rooftop bar was filled with smartly dressed millennial Euro types. We were entirely underdressed and self conscious. We walked out onto the roof deck and a man blew a full exhale of cigar smoke right into my face. The smoking section is placed immediately at the entrance to the bar. We lumbered around awkwardly to the non-smoking section which was basked in hot sun, and found seats. We tried to order the champagne that we would have ordered if paying for our drinks and were immediately told that we could only buy drinks priced to $20. So, basically, drinks we didn't want were comped to us by the non-fussed front desk agent. We got in another argument with the waitress who was completely unapologetic and finally went and got approval for us to get what we wanted. (Even when I had offered to pay the difference in price, we weren't allowed to do that! So, the \"comped drinks\" did nothing to assuage our anger, but only made us more angry.) We finally got into our room at about 6pm. This is a day we paid about $1k for, and we were only allowed access at 6pm.   The room had a view of a warehouse 10' from our windows and garbage dumpsters at ground zero. It was equipped with 2 coffee cups. 2 of each size towels and one set of soaps and shampoos. In a Suite. Our whole stay was a disaster. They later comped us breakfast for both mornings, which was the only saving grace. However, even that wasn't entirely useful, as it precluded me from showing my friends a diner I had planned to take them to. I slept on the pull out sofa and it was straight out of 1972. Painful.

We were really surprised that we could not hear any outside noise from the streets which was a good thing.  Our room was across from a stairwell so we could hear that but it did not impact our sleep or stay. We visited the roof top bar but only to look around. The host let us check it out even though we didn't request a table. We had breakfast on site which was very good.  The price for the buffet was pretty high but the $25 credit we received when booking lessoned the blow a little. The check out process went very smooth and it took us about 5-10 minutes to get to the cruise terminal from the hotel via a Lyft.

El servicio es excelente, siempre se est\u00e1n preocupando para que tengas una buena estad\u00eda y todas las personas a las que acudimos por diferentes razones siempre nos atendieron con buena predisposici\u00f3n. Sacamos la habitaci\u00f3n mas b\u00e1sica asique la vista daba a una pared pero debe tener muy lindas vistas... El rooftop es hermoso y el clima es muy agradable, los precios un poco elevados pero vale la pena pasar una noche all\u00ed. Me encanta sentir que estamos en un hotel y que no est\u00e1n viendo de que manera cobrarte todo lo que necesitas, nos repusieron caf\u00e9 en la habitaci\u00f3n cada vez que pedimos, nos dieron un microondas para cocinar nuestra avena por la ma\u00f1ana y nos permitieron recibir paquetes, todo esto sin cargo adicional... Generalmente siempre se cobra todo aparte.\nLa ubicaci\u00f3n del hotel es lo que mas nos gust\u00f3, en pleno Times square, a una cuadra del mercado org\u00e1nico wholefoods donde hac\u00edamos todas las compras de comida y desayuno y a una cuadra del Bryant Parck. El subte tambi\u00e9n ah\u00ed nom\u00e1s. Vali\u00f3 mucha la pena el hospedaje y SIN DUDAS LO VOLVER\u00cdAMOS A ELEGIR!!! Espero que la pr\u00f3xima podamos acceder a una linda vista desde la habitaci\u00f3n sin pagar diferencias tan elevadas. GRACIAS POR TODO!!\n\nUN DETALLE IMPORTANTE y no menor: Nuestra habitaci\u00f3n era de las m\u00e1s cercanas al ascensor y el problema fue que cada vez que llegaba a nuestro piso sonaba un timbre para avisar que el ascensor estaba ahi... La verdad un detalle innecesario que podr\u00edan desconectar porque sub\u00eda y bajaba gente hasta las 23\/24 hs y arrancaba el timbre desde las 6 de la ma\u00f1ana... Este sonido se escuchaba desde adentro de la habitaci\u00f3n y era bastante frecuente en esos horarios... SI NO FUERA POR ESTO DARIA UN 10 A ESTE ALOJAMIENTO... Pero como todo lo demas fue EXCELENTE me parece que no vale la pena bajar la calificaci\u00f3n.\nOtro detalle importante: Solo tuve que reclamar una cosa (no vale la pena mencionarlo), lo importante de esto no es que haya tenido que reclamar algo sino la manera en que lo resolvieron, muy bien predispuestos, compens\u00e1ndonos con un cr\u00e9dito de regalo y adem\u00e1s asegur\u00e1ndose de que no vuelva a pasar... Estas son las razones por las que uno vuelve a elegir el hotel, por la buena predisposici\u00f3n y GANAS de hacerte sentir que le importa que est\u00e9s c\u00f3modo.

Not even on a good day. When a 5 star hotel lacks amenities to be awarded five stars the hotel fully depends on the quality of the rooms and the service .Both lacked which made you wonder why this hotel is charging $700 per night. The only thing does very well is blaming covid-19. Where even a Hampton Inn can make sure all lights are working, not at this hotel. \u2018Covid has limited room inspections and maintenance \u2018 . Room 1515 (tiny) had no luggage racks, no body soap, no stocked mini bar , no coffee makers and the bare minimum of towels \u2014- when you ask? Covid Covid Covid! It is the first text message you receive after check-in . Because of COVID amenities are limited but they will bring you what you need.  When you arrive the bell captain will tell you that because of COVID they don\u2019t valet cars but they have no issue to bring your luggage to the room and spend some time in your room without a mask . The only thing this hotel has figured out during Covid is how to cut every amenity away and see how far you can push it. The hotel is a embarrassment for all visitors staying and hospitality in general.  For the money there are so many better options in NYC. Even a Renaissance inn offers more amenities and luxury for half the price . I would not return, I actually didn\u2019t extend my stay and run to the Peninsula. Strangely enough COVID had not resulted in removing amenities only a few blocks away. Perhaps as long as this hotel (mis) uses COVID as reason to cut most of their amenities, COVID should be the reason to not stay at this hotel . With rooms not being clean, staff not wearing masks and elevators packed with guests , the hotels concern regarding COVID apparently only are a concern when it is costing the hotel money .","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We chose the knickerbocker for location and its modern decor and we were not disappointed. The location ls perfect as it is just off times square and within walking distance to most sights and attractions. The room was clean and spacious with electric blinds and lighting. Thr bathroom was modern with the toilet and shower in separate frosted glass enclosures. The shower was hot and powerful and toiletries and robes were provided. There was a fridge and 2 bottles of water are left daily (we left empties outside if we didn't require housekeeping and they were exchanged ) it was a quiet hotel and we slept well. There are 2 bars, one a rooftop serving lite bites, but be aware that both are closed in a Sunday and Monday.  We were given a complimentary drink voucher on check in and we used it before a show so ordered some sliders and Mozzarella bread which were fresh and tasty. The only downside other than the bar closures which we were unaware of, was that there is no tea\/coffee making facilities in the room. We asked at reception and were provided with a kettle and 2 cups which should be charged at $24 for the duration of the stay but this was wavered. We feel as a 5 star hotel this should be included. Also the breakfast is very  expensive at $44 (if I remember rightly) per person...we ate at a nearby diner for half the price. Despite these niggles i would definitely reccomend this hotel as there was nothing that wasn't sorted and as a base for seeing the city it was perfect. ","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":7255276,"title":"A Times Square Classic, Right in the Middle of Things","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-01-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"The hotel is easy to find, literally right at the corner of 42d St and Broadway.  At street level the hotel\u2019s portico makes it easy to find.  The entrance is on 42d St.  The hotel staff does not hail cabs for guests but we did okay for ourselves out front.  Just down the street is Broadway, and the traffic there guarantees a cab hail in no time flat, with a nice safe place to pull over, too.\n\nCheck-in was a bit slow, as it seemed they were a bit short on staff.  I overheard another party having difficulties with reserved suites, having to settle for donwgrades.  We did not have a problem with our reservation, in and up to the room in good time.  Our baggage arrived in no time.  I asked for a portable luggage rack, which showed up in very good time.\n\nThe elevators are activated by your room key, which is a nice security feature given the traffic in the Times Square area.  It\u2019s mighty dark in the elevators, which makes it somewhat difficult to quickly read and punch your floor.  There are cameras in the elevators.\n\nThe room was clean on arrival, but showed some signs of wear, specifically the wooden veneer on the bedframe, clearly showing some intense wear.  Given that this hotel is literally right on Time Square, that\u2019s not too bad.  The room was in order, with everything working except for the bedside reading lamp on one side.\n\nWe got some instruction on the working of the automatic blinds, which worked just fine.  Both of the huge windows do in fact open, to only about 6\u201d, so you can get some \"fresh\" air if you want it.  But you\u2019ll also get all of the sounds and delightful scents of the street, which is why we kept the windows closed.\n\nThe TV was good size, could have been bigger.  The channel selection was modest, not that impressive, and the remote control was a bit sluggish.  The room desk had an HDMI plug for your own video.  The desk also had a USB port and two electric plugs for devices; there were no USB ports at the bedsides.\n\nThere was a mini fridge, which was a godsend, in the closet, with some small space above it.  There was no coffee maker or coffee service in the room.  The closet was good size, with a number of amenities.  No sofa, but a single swiveling but non-reclining easy chair.\n\nThe bed was big and pretty comfy.  There were lots of pillows, surprisingly fluffy and resilient; they did not smash down flat after just a couple of minutes.  One side of the bed had a huge shelf next to it, lots of space, while the other side had a tiny little shelf, no space at all for a bottle of water, phone, etc.  There were electrical plugs close by on both side of the bed, but no USB plugs.\n\nRoom servicing each day was very well done.  My partner and I both sleep with our own woobies, and whaddaya know, the staff had actually incorporated the woobies into the bed on each side when they made the bed each day.  That\u2019s some wonderful and attentive service, for which I left a nice tip.\n\nWe called down to room service twice, first for some plates and flatware and a second time for coffee cups and flatware.  Service was quick and helpful.\n\nRoom lighting was good, but the controls were screwy and hard to figure out, all set with push buttons on the walls.  It was hard to suss out how to work individual lights, with the entire room going dark or lighting up.  The bathroom light control was cleverly hidden by a countertop magnifying mirror.\n\nThe room thermostat was good, intuitive and immediately responsive.  It got mighty cold in NYC while we visited, and the thermostat did its job perfectly.\n\nThere were two phones in the room, both of which worked just fine\u2026but not so much for Guest Services.  I called the number, noted right on the phone a couple of times and no one answered.  Not ever.  Eventually it went to the hotel central service and I was asked to leave a message.  Midway through the visit I got a hotel survey via text, which I filled out with something like \u201cyeah, answering the phone would be a good thing when guests call.\u201d  I got an email from management and a couple of notices asking me how things were going, but nothing else\u2026not a personal visit or, ahem, a phone call, as it were.\n\nThe bathroom was spacious, with a separate toilet room and a walk-in shower for at least two.  Depending on how friendly you are, you could easily get four folks into the shower.  Good space, good heat and water pressure, with modest shelf space inside, but no seat, no bench, no hook or rung for a washcloth, and no step at all inside the shower.\n\nLots of awesome counter space inside the bathroom, which was very good.  None at all in the powder room, which is not so good.  For some reason the toilet is very low-slung, with the toilet roll holder all of 11\u201d from the floor\u2026why so low?  In distinct opposition to the ample counter space there was only one peg in the entire bathroom, on which two hotel robes were already hung.  So where to towels go?  Can\u2019t throw them over the bar as the powder room and shower have floor-to-ceiling glass doors.  There were smallish handles on the powder room and shower doors, but not very big.  Put up some more pegs or rungs for things, folks.\n\nNote that the breakfast buffet is not included with the room.  It\u2019s a modest buffet, with the standard stuff like eggs, bacon, fruit, cereals, etc., all of it pre-made and nothing done with a chef.  Enough choices but nothing really spectacular.  I figured, yeah, you know, a Times Square hotel, so maybe something like $35.  Nope, it was $42.  Sorry, but the food and the service was not even close to a $42\/person experience.\n\nBottom Line: this hotel is about as close as you can get to the heart of Times Square\u2026and you\u2019ll pay for that proximity.  The site is a good one, clean and in proper working order, not perfect, but right in the middle of things.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The room was a great size for a family, large bathroom and little sofa area and a small fridge. 2 large comfy beds. Excellent location, clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff, doormen always pleasant and welcoming. We requested a quiet room. We had room 1519 on the 15th floor and it was perfect. We didn\u2019t have any particular view from the room as it was an internal view room but it was extremely quiet which is rare for a hotel room in NYC.

Rooms were cleaned daily\/beds made and new towels when you press the service button by the door. The only negative is you have to pay $25 for a coffee machine in the room which we weren\u2019t impressed with. No tea making facilities. We had to ask for coffee pods to be replenished.

I think there\u2019s more wear and tear on the elevators and the cards wouldn\u2019t read all the time so it was difficult to push the button to our floor without the elevator moving elsewhere because the floor didn\u2019t stay selected. Aside from that, I would say the worst part was actually the staff. Reception was wonderful, but the valet was not. I believe his name was Chester? He was very rude and not helpful. We got ticketed twice while in the loading zone of the hotel to check in\/out. The first ticket had colorful language that the officer had written down. I didn\u2019t realize that he was the one that said \u201cf\u2014 you\u201d and I had tipped him for handling the car even after the first ticket! When we were were leaving, we noticed that there was another ticket and Chester had knocked on the window to give us back our valet key, and had very rudely said \u201cthe car\u2019s been here over an hour\u201d as if we were stupid and caused it. \n\nNot only was that a gross exaggeration, but we were just following rules of what the other staff when checking in had said about calling to get the car from the garage: on Sunday, call an hour ahead of time you need to leave to get the car because it gets very busy. That\u2019s what we did. We also never heard from the hotel that the car was out front, so we got out there shortly after check out time (around 12:05 pm). \n\nI usually recommend this hotel for first timers going to New York because of the location, friendly staff, and spacious rooms, however, I won\u2019t be coming back due to the poor experience we had. I was super embarrassed about overselling this hotel and not have it live up to the expectations I had given my partner. With that being the start to our last day, he had said \u201cI can\u2019t wait to leave the city\u201d and I think it\u2019s such a shame that there was this rudeness from a stranger working in the hospitality industry. It\u2019s been a hard couple of years for everyone, and while we try to be compassionate to those who are working hard with long hours, this was inexcusable.  Do better.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Sadly, the hotel doesn't live up to the 5-star promise; it struggles with the basics like cleanliness and attentive staff. I appreciate that it's hard to find and keep the right team. It's the management's job, though.\n\nMy stay at The Knickerbocker Hotel must have been my worst hotel experience for the last 30 years. Here's the list :\n\n- First night, electric window blinds were not to be closed for whatever reason. Great, if you want to give others an unobstructed view of you. Maintenance showed up to fix it and couldn't, but at least got it lowered for the night using brute force. Set the next day.\n\n- One of the bedside lamps not working. It was never fixed due to 'LED bulbs not available.'\n\n- Inner closet light was operating permanently, providing a 'nice' ray of light during the night. Fixed the next day.\n\n- Glass walls in bathroom dirty \u2013 some yucky-colored and dried-up water runners - totally disgusting. Housekeeping never managed to clean it. After two days, I got tired of it and cleaned it myself.\n\n- Restrooms on 4th floor next to gym\/breakfast area on Sunday, 11-14-21, 4 pm unbelievably filthy (apparently not looked after for the whole weekend), our son: \"Saying, 'like in a 4th world country', would be a great injustice \u2013 to those countries!\"\n\n- When getting ready to checkout, our son discovered the dirty coffee (let's hope!) stains on the duvet under which he had slept the last few nights (see photo). Here we are, amid the COVID pandemic, and this hotel doesn't even get basic cleaning done.\n\n- Upon scrutinizing my bill at checkout, I found out that the breakfast staff hadn't accepted my tip as written down. Instead, they had left their suggested tip of 18% on the check (which I had crossed out - 18% tip for self-service breakfast, I don't think so). In any event, I call this thievery!\n\nThe last incident called for the involvement of the hotel management. Tenzin, the assistant manager on duty, got hugely embarrassed when I showed her photos of the duvet and the breakfast check. To her credit, she managed to calm me down and promised to get the breakfast check right. In addition, she offered to drop the daily $30 for wifi, gym access, and water bottles on the room.

It doesn\u2019t help that the reception area is small and dark, but for a 5 star hotel, they could have made the most of their welcome.\nThe main criticism however relates to the noise. The first night we were located by the elevator - a BIG mistake in that every time anyone arrived on our floor, we could hear the \u201cbing\u201d. Imagine being woken up at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning by this!\nThe reception staff accommodated us the next morning by swapping rooms, but again in a very formal and unwelcoming manner.\nThis room was on a lower floor, and with the location directly in Time Square, the noise was again an issue.\nUnfortunately we had to move a second time, and again the reception staff were helpful, but not gracious.\nFinally had a room on 15th floor which was nice.\nIn short, I think the service was certainly not up to the standard of a Leading Hotel of the World (main reason we chose it), and only stay if you are not bothered by noise or stay on the top floors.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The TV failed repeatedly throughout our week-long stay, there was no coffee\/tea service in the room (just water stains on the desk from where it obviously used to live) and several lights had burned out bulbs or were non functional.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the rooftop bar is owned\/operated by the hotel or a third party, but since they promote it with signage I\u2019ll mention it here on their review - it was terrible. Servers were too few, to ridiculous wait times - it took more than 15 minutes to order drinks which then took over half an hour to arrive, at which point we left due to the wait and from hearing our neighbors on both sides complain after their food arrived that it was cold. We were very excited for a rooftop bar overlooking Times Square, and it ended up nothing but a disappointment.

From there we made our way to the guest services desk where we were greeted by Paola, the most professional, responsive and attentive customer service attendant I\u2019ve ever met.\nPaola greeted us with a smile, shared in our joy to be celebrating a milestone birthday and ensured that the Knickerbocker was honored to be chosen for our stay. She truly exemplified what I envisioned service would be at this historic hotel. Paola you are amazing!\nOur room was lovely and much larger than most rooms in NYC. The large window gave us a great view of Times Square. It was quiet and included an electric black out shade so sleeping in our comfortable beds was easy. \nWe indulged in the amenities offered by the hotel including the Charlie Palmer Steakhouse where my husband had the best spicy lobster spaghetti of his life, and the rooftop bar where we had Martinis and Manhattans under the glow of the New Year\u2019s ball.
