The bed was so comfortable. It made me go into a deep sleep that not even an earthquake could wake me up.  Our butlers on different days were so professional and very attentive. They made sure we were comfortable and we had everything we needed.  The bellman and doorman were always friendly and helpful.  \n\nThe staff at the reception were a bit slow. Check-in took longer than expected. On one occasion, we stopped by at the reception to inquire about something, but the desk was empty.  We had to wait about 10 mins before someone showed up. \n\nThe saddest part of my stay was that after we checked out, I realized I left my ring on the ring holder in the bathroom adjacent to the bedroom. I don't usually take that ring with me during vacation, but that time I did.  I called the hotel and got connected to the security. I spoke to Maria, who said the room we stayed in was already occupied. Anyway, to make the long story short, no one turned in my ring. I was quite disappointed, but I guess I just have to charge it to experience.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I used a suite upgrade to the Madison suite room 535.  The rate for that room was around $3105 per night.\n\nThere is construction going on. This was disclosed on website and I didn\u2019t hear any noise. The effect is that the elevator and check in is puzzling although there are signs to direct guests. I confused which elevator bank to use more than once.  Would suggest signage in lobby elevator that it does not go past 2nd floor. Thought my key card was malfunctioning.\n\nDoorman. Gave directions and friendly.  I think they offer some complimentary transportation service, never explained by front desk, doorman or butler. \n\nValet. Spot on, helpful and prompt. Always present, busy  and engaged. \n\nFront desk: Mixed.  Varied from good to annoyed. Examples, inquired as to breakfast benefit. Told matter of factly that it was limited to continental breakfast because \u201cconstruction prohibits preparation of an American breakfast\u201d, not sure what this meant beyond meant to advise I was limited to that option?  Was told this benefit could be used via room service or on 20th floor temporary restaurant   Later advised restaurant was only option by morning staff. Requested a late checkout which is a hard guarantee for elites. Got a lot of pushback on this by young lady who had to \u201ccheck\u201d with someone in the back and then only begrudgingly agreed to 3P.  Other interactions with Suzanne were more positive. \n\nButler: Greatest service failure . Stayed at StR in Middle East, Asia, Mexico and multiple US locations, shockingly poor interactions with our 4 to 12a butler. Examples: No introduction, no offer of any of touted services. Requested coffee service around 5P, best description I can give is the reaction you get when you press call button on a domestic economy flight. Almost visibly annoyed.  Small carafe of weak coffee. Tipped anyway, no reaction  Called housekeeping later for turndown service and ice in order to avoid butler, he called back, again annoyed. Brought ice, nothing else - Ignored our used tray and shoe shine bag by door on way out. Never used this or pressing service, bad vibe and didn\u2019t want the interaction  Used overnight butler, requested coffee around 6A. Look tired, but was prompt and polite. Coffee was a large carafe and very good quality Tipped.\n\nRoom. Large, two bathrooms. Great bath products, towels and very good water pressure. Furniture, a little tired as were bed mattress quality.  View limited on 5th floor. Good sound proofing and beautiful building overall. Tile work in room, baths and lighting were aesthetic highlights. \n\nLocation. Fantastic, close to Central Park and tons of dining and shopping options, best feature of this property. \n\nDining\/Elite benefits: We had breakfast on 20th floor. Our waitress was excellent and explained that even though the front desk tells customers that continental breakfast is only option, it\u2019s actually $100 credit. Which makes the prior explanation by front desk even more annoying.  Why the weird hustle, just explain to your elites what is the allowance. The continental breakfast as the only option was messaged by two different staff members. Based on previous reviews, this is an ongoing problem at this location. Not sure why you want to annoy your elites as the messaging by front desk is to give impression your only option is a continental breakfast.  Why? \n\nSo many options in NYC to include JW and RC at Battery Park, as mentioned, I would skip this location.  Based on other reviews and my experience, it is hit or miss service  when it comes to this location which is unforgivable for this legendary brand and this price point.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I didn\u2019t even get a suite upgrade for the first time ever here, upgraded \u201conly\u201d two categories to a Grand Deluxe Room, but it still turned out to be a very comfortable room and an outstanding stay. I loved it yet again.\n#newyork #stregis #stregisnewyork #grandeluxeroom #upgrade #nofreebreakfast #renovation #ambassadorstatusmatters #aircon\n\nI did consider changing to the RC NoMad after learning about the public spaces renovation and concomitant temporary suspension of the breakfast benefit only in mid-January, quite a while after my original booking. But the RC NoMad only guarantees 66 F in its rooms and suites as opposed to my knowing the St Regis easily can guarantee down to 60 F. Also, the St Regis concierge already had booked reservations for me at \u201cimpossible to get\u201d 1* Tatiana, \u201calmost impossible to get\u201d 1* Kochi, 1* Rezdora, and the Polo Club, and \u201chard to get\u201d 2* Aquavit \u2014 with the Polo Club across the street and Aquavit only down a block. And I had that incredible $477 BRG rate, to boot. The best rate I found for the RC NoMad was $680.\n\nSo even with the renovation, and even without the breakfast benefit, I stuck it out with the St Regis. And thank goodness I did! EDIT: the hotel later honored my breakfast benefit and refunded the $181 for my three breakfast charges at the hotel.\n\nWith the grand deluxe room normally costing about $1200 and my BRG rate of $477, I still had an Ambassador upgrade value of $3600 or so.  Pretty nice, all things considered. #ambassadorstatusmatters \n\nMy grand deluxe room cooled as low as 58 F, but largely stayed at 60-62 F for the entirety of my stay. Just about the only mistake for the whole stay came when housekeeping accidentally reset my thermostat for turndown on my third night, but within 30 min of my return the air con returned to to my Arctic delight. #greataircon #airconworks \n\nOtherwise, my grand deluxe room was plenty spacious enough for me alone. But it would have been fine even with my husband, too. They had blacked out both windows as per my usual pre-arrival instructions, but the view was nice enough otherwise. They also had fulfilled all my other pre- arrival checklist requests, including pre-cooling the room to below 65 F for my arrival, extra bottles of room temperature water, a fan by the bed, and chocolate covered strawberries as my luxury hotel welcome amenity (along with a bowl of fresh fruit). #prearrivalchecklist \n\nThe St Regis New York showers continue to be my favorite all time \u2014 with the most amazing soft but full water pressure ever. It\u2019s a small space, but I love that water effect. I take unusually long showers here every time. The WiFi was also fantastic at usually 130 Mbps up and down. \n\nI ordered room service breakfast three times of my five mornings \u2014 costing me $72, $62, and $74 extra. At $0.007 a point, that would be just over 29K Bonvoy points. So the courtesy credit of 25K points from my Ambassador seemed a pretty fair compensation under the circumstances. But the room service items were delicious, hot, and prompt each time \u2014 I don\u2019t think I waited more than 20 minutes for any. (The hotel also is operating a 20th floor ballroom as its breakfast restaurant, but I prefer room service.)\n\nRoom service continues until 9 pm during the renovation. Only once did I crave something for room service after that time. So that really was the only time I missed what usually would have been available to me. Not too bad. \n\nButler French press coffee was delivered promptly and perfectly each morning. Due to the renovation, I didn\u2019t insist on warm milk as I\u2019d usually do here. The only other mistake of the entire stay was the butler once bringing two cups rather than one. Seriously. Not bad yet again. \n\nThe butler service also unpacked for me on arrival after I went to dinner that first night. And they did shoe shine for me once. I didn\u2019t need packing service at the end. \n\nHousekeeping was perfect (except for messing with my thermostat that one time) and invisible. They always brought more water, too. Turndown was done every night, usually timed to after I informed the butler I was leaving for dinner. \n\nI did complain to the hotel that their towels didn\u2019t seem as plush as I remembered and the toilet paper was ridiculously thin and cheap. Housekeeping did bring me more plush towels, but a hotel manager called to apologize that they were using the Marriott provided chain-wide toilet paper. Clearly, that\u2019s something they need to address for the luxury brands! \n\nAll in all, I had another exceptional stay despite the renovation. I did miss having a drink at the King Cole Bar, but instead I enjoyed drinks at the Polo Lounge across the street and at the Chatwal bar (which wasn\u2019t as good as before, so I won\u2019t return). It was a little annoying taking the elevator on entry to the 2nd floor (where they have the temporary lobby, front desk, and concierge) and then walking to the different elevators to get to my 16th floor room, but I managed. Otherwise, it wasn\u2019t that different for me. \n\nI tipped the front desk, butler team, concierge team, and housekeeping. They all did a really great job, not even considering the unusual renovation circumstances \n\nWould I stay again at the St Regis during this renovation? I have to admit that I might. It was still that good to me. And the air con, rooms, service, and F&B quality are as good as ever. Paying for the room service breakfast that good doesn\u2019t bother me for a stay this nice, tbh.\n\nBut I can\u2019t wait to see what the new public spaces looks like after they finish. Rumor is that they also will renovate the rooms and suites when they finish the public spaces, so stay tuned.\n\nP.S. I did manage to visit and check out the RC NoMad for the first time after my lunch at nearby 1* Rezdora. Suffice to say that the mostly southern exposure windows for almost all rooms and suites wouldn\u2019t make for the best or coldest air con experience for me compared to the much better air con at the St Regis. But it\u2019s a very nice hotel otherwise with impressive modern decor for those that like that. And I absolutely love the NoMad neighborhood. The rumor is that the hotel will be acquiring the northern side of the building soon and will renovate that to add northern facing rooms and suites \u2014 which will be more appealing to me!","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

As others mention, the hotel is currently being renovated and the usual breakfast location and the King Cole Bar are currently closed. I understand hotels need to renovate and I always appreciate it when finished. You would think because of this, they would step up their game to balance this disruption. St Regis is going a different direction. I have platinum status which gets you free breakfast. Not so during renovation! I was told my only welcome amenity to choose is the 1,000 bonus points. The equivalent of $9 lol. But no worry, I can pay full price on the 20th floor for the same breakfast. Would love to know the person at top that approved this. We went next door to the Peninsula and had a fantastic breakfast for $200. So instead of the St Regis giving me $50 to put towards an already expensive breakfast they rather irritate their brand loyal customers have us vote with our wallets instead. Again very boggling decision from upper management. \n\nThe feeling of being nickel and dimed didn't start at check in, however. You get the usual precheck in email asking if you will be celebrating anything special. I stayed for Valentines Day and emailed them that I will be celebrating that with my wife. In return I was sent pdfs that had options like $24 chocolates and $180 for a dozen roses. Now I never expect for the red carpet to be rolled out, but cash rates were $1.2k for Valentines Day. Yes the room is great, the bathroom is beautiful, but is that worth that kind of price? This is NYC and the options are plentiful.

I've seen the great ones ..... and some that made me cringe.\n\nThis property falls in the middle, but slightly closer to the cringe end of the scale.\n\nTo begin, then really don't give any credit to your status for a potential upgrade, and believe me we did reach out several times .... and I booked over 275 nights last year so if I'm not getting a bump, neither are you unless you're some type of royalty or entertainment luminary.\n\nThe most important thing about this property is that they are UNDER RENOVATION, so many of the rooms are out of service. \nADDITIONALLY,  the bar and restaurant are out of service as well, although they do have a meager selection available on the room service menu. A colleague ordered some chicken soup and ice cream and reported the chicken to be well overcooked and inedible. The ice cream was flavorless, as well.\nIf you stay here, plan on eating out or bringing your own sandwich, as you'll get nothing worth eating here, while the hotel undergoes month's of renovation.\nThey will not comp you for breakfast during this renovation for some reason (typically, Starwoods ALWAYS offers you a free breakfast as a reward ) but if you have really deep pockets they are now serving a PAY breakfast up on their top floor.\n\nThe room we received (they claimed upgraded) was rather smallish, and I would estimate roughly 300 sq ft. It was adequate for a single person, but certainly not more than two.\nBed was comfortable and bathroom was smallish but well appointed.\n\nRoom was NOT READY until about 5 pm, so if you get here early you may be unpleasantly surprised at how long you'll wait.\n\nThe hotel has historically beautiful details throughout the common area's with extensive marble detailing which does extend into the bathroom area's, but again the rooms are nothing special (at least ours wasn't) and for the astronomical cost per night you would normally expect much better value.\nAdditionally, the hotel is \"landlocked\" by office buildings, so you'll get no view of anything worth seeing. You would be well advised to keep your window shades drawn as well, if you don't want to wind up on some murky, perverted website.\n\nThis property has most certainly seen better days, and if you truly want a better taste of Manhattan, I would certainly suggest an alternate such as the Plaza or the nearby Ritz Carlton, both on top of Central Park.

After roaming around the suite we decided to go to the King Cole bar for a drink.  They really make it civilized at the bar.  Only a certain amount of people are let in so it never feels crowded or people on top of you.  The drinks while pricey were excellent. For breakfast the next morning we ate at the Astor Court which was included.  Food and service was on the spot. As part of the $50 destination fee you receive some $ amenities.

Having stayed as a loyal Titanium Bonvoy member in other St.Regis Hotels (e.g. Singapore) I had of course some kind of expectation, but this? \n\nCheckin was chaotic and we didn\u2019t receive half the info needed. There was no note or some kind of welcome in the room. After first contact with the butler service they just didn\u2019t pick up the phone and didn\u2019t call back. We tried every day and even after informing front desk no answer. We asked for a water cooker for tee, since there was no tea\/coffee service. It was broken. So we had to order hot water for 8$ from the room service which magically worked fine.  \n\nSince we used our Bonvoy upgrade option, we got upgraded to a slightly bigger room next to the extremely loud and on weekends busy service elevators which I realized only after 2 sleepless nights. I talked to the reception that I would like to change our  room. The reception staff said that there was nothing available at this point and they would contact us until  14:00.\n\n Guess what\u2026 I checked the Bonvoy App and there were 5 different room categories available for our remaining stay\u2026 !

It was a busy weekend in December, and all of Midtown was packed.  Some of the guests in line were taking it out on the people working at the front desk, who were doing their best.   I am not sure how the people working check-ins were able to keep their demeanor based upon how they were being treated  - yes this is a 5 star hotel, but clearly they were slammed with dozens of people checking in at once.  Despite how busy it was, the woman checking me in was nothing but smiles as she searched for a room, unsuccessfully.   I told her to please not worry about it, I'd give her my phone number, and she'd contact me when the room was ready.    Meanwhile they took our bags, and we went for a cocktail nearby.   An hour or so later, our room was ready - not a big deal, not sure why others can't be more patient.   I'm not in NYC to hang out in my room.  Upon checking in, they acknowledged my Platinum Elite status and my birthday, and provided an upgrade.   \n\nThe room was absolutely fantastic.  Very luxurious, with a wonderful view of 5th Avenue.   They also gave us a $100 hotel credit to make up for the tardiness of our room - much appreciated!  The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathrooms very posh, and immaculately clean.  This was honestly one of the best hotel experiences that I've had, and I've traveled quite a bit, also having stayed at 3 other different St. Regis properties.  \n\nThe only thing that I would change is that the sole option for getting a cocktail in the hotel was at the Cole Bar, which ALWAYS had a long line to get in.  I am not going to wait 30+minutes to wait for a cocktail in Manhattan - plenty of other options, but I'm sure others would not mind.  Personally, I like to have something cozy and less trendy in the hotel I am staying in, but again - that's just a personal preference.  \n\nFinally, the location is great if you want to be in Midtown.   Of course, very touristy, but that's to be expected.  It's very convenient to the major sites this time of year, such as Rockefeller Center, Saks, etc.  I'm more of a downtown person but it was nice to stay in a different part of Manhattan for a change and a quick and easy subway or cab ride to escape.\n\nIn summary, thank you, St. Regis New York, for a memorable stay and treating us so well.

I agreed to pay additional $2200 for that and was assured it was all set. Upon arrival the check in staff informed me that the connecting room (double) is not ready\/has issues with plumbing, and they need to move us to another configuration (no additional charge). We agreed to that and were finally checked in into a one bedroom suite on the 3rd floor, with a connecting single room, 303\/305, the hotel considers that a 2-bedroom suite. Checked out two days later, my bill was for two separate rooms, total a little less than $10,000! I called the hotel, spoke with Tracey and was assured accounting will fix the issue and she will follow up with me. I never heard back from her and had to call her myself the following week. She again assured me that accounting fixed the over billing and I'll be receiving credit.

Despite meticulously pre-arranging our stay, including wiring payment and exhaustive email communication, we were confronted with an unexpected and unwarranted demand to validate my corporate status. The staff's insistence on this during a holiday period, coupled with their inability to recognise the efforts we had already made to confirm our stay, was not just inconvenient but deeply humiliating. And that they expected we read through the hotels website terms and conditions before arrival, yet no one mentioned this in any of the emails (who reads hotels terms and conditions on the website), usually the booking confirmation and email confirmation will suffice. \n\nThe handling of this situation by the staff member, Erik, was particularly upsetting. His inflexibility and apparent disregard for the nuances of our situation \u2013 traveling with a young child and an elderly person \u2013 was not only shocking but also set a tone of unwelcomeness that pervaded our entire stay.\n\nThis experience at the St. Regis did more than just inconvenience us; it dealt a severe blow to our confidence and sense of self-worth. To be made to feel so undervalued and judged, in an environment where we expected the highest standards of hospitality, was both disorienting and deeply hurtful. \n\nFurther aggravating our stay were the repeated oversights in basic hotel services. Requests made in advance to the concierge and butler were ignored, and basic housekeeping needs were consistently unmet. The bizarre and unsettling incidents of our doorbell ringing in the middle of the night without explanation, and the apparent lack of adequate security, compounded our anxiety and discomfort.\n\nIn conclusion, our experience at the St. Regis New York was not only far below the expected standard of a five-star hotel, but it was also a deeply wounding experience that has left a lasting negative impact to me and a few members of our family. The treatment we received was unacceptable and has significantly marred our perception of the St. Regis brand. I strongly caution others against staying here, as the hotel's failure to provide basic respect and dignity to its guests is inexcusable. This stay was not just a failure in service; it was a devastating blow to our personal esteem and confidence. \n\nI would advise the hotel staff to not consider how they treat people by their appearance linking to wealth or their knowledge of someones wealth and treat everyone as equals - as the saying goes, never judge a book by its cover!

We had heard about the signature experience at this hotel, complete with a dedicated butler.\n\nUpon our arrival, we were informed that our butler would meet us to explain this special service. However, we waited in our room for two hours without anyone showing up. When I ventured to check out the view from our room, I was shocked to discover that it overlooked scaffolding, trash, and construction debris (photo attached).\n\nLater, on our way back from dinner, we informed the front desk about the no-show from the butler. Instead of addressing the issue, they simply asked me what I wanted. The next day, during check-out, I spoke with the manager who offered apologies and promised to comp our breakfast, which had already been paid for in the booking.\n\nHowever, when I reviewed my credit card bill a week later, I noticed that the hotel had charged me for breakfast, despite the earlier assurance that it would be waived. This is technically a double charge since the reservation included breakfast. This prompted me to call the hotel to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, I was transferred and placed on hold for an extended period before speaking to someone who could assist. I was able to get the breakfast waived from my card but it was still charged in the original booking.\n\nGiven that this was supposed to be a luxury room experience, I must say that this entire ordeal was truly disappointing.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The St. Regis NY was nice, but I expected more from the flagship hotel.  Don't get me wrong, it was great to be able to stay at the St. Regis where it all started, but I am torn on what I got for the price.  It was definitely a beautiful hotel, but a bit tired and dated.\n\nThe good - staff was excellent in all respects except for the front desk check in.  Patrick out front, Frank and some of the other folks who brought room service were all excellent.  The front desk staff though for check in was lacking.  They were understaffed at night and allowed people to jump the line to front, walked away while we were waiting to escort visitors upstairs, it was chaos.   Rooms were large by NY standards, well equipped, very nice decorations, bed was comfortable as was the down comforter and pillows.  Adequate closet size and hangers.  Bathroom very big with tub and shower, great water pressure.  Bonus was free shoe shine each day and two items pressed each day for free from the Butler service.  Cleaning staff was also excellent, room was made up twice a day.  Room service was very fast and always friendly.  Nice touch was the messages they put on the coffee foam.  Internet speed was okay and was able to conduct work on a laptop without issue.  Also, location is excellent, easy walking distance to Central Park, 1 block to the MOMA, a couple blocks to the metropolitan museum.  \n\nNot so good - the first thing was there is no coffee maker in the room.  I appreciate that this is a high end hotel, but I have seen Nespresso's in everything from a Ritz, and Intercontinental and the Peninsula.  It is evident it is a money maker for the hotel.  Small pot of coffee and a latte was about $34.00 delivered and a 20 minute wait or so.   I used points to pay for three nights which was about 500,000 points.  When you check in, they ask if you are familiar with the resort fee but they don't say how much it is.  I believed this is what is typically called a destination fee that a lot of hotels charge daily for staying.  It did not indicate anywhere on the website during booking that there would be an additional charge for using points.  In fact, that is the purpose of using points - to avoid the cost.  At check out, I was handed a bill that reflected a $250.00 charge per night that was labeled point redemption charge.  This was added to the $50 daily usage charges and taxes.  So my free nights that I used points on ended up costing about $1,000.00 plus the points.  I appreciate that we got a great stay for what is arguably a low price, but for someone who may not be able to afford the money would really be put in a bad spot.  At the very least, when a person is redeeming points on the website, they should be told about the $250.00 point charge so they can make an informed decision before arriving at the hotel.  Seemed a bit shady to drop this at the end.\n\nFor anyone who stays here, if you need a quick and very good place to eat, I would recommend the Spanish place about a half a block of 55th.  Come out of the hotel, turn left, cross the street, and you will see it in the middle of the block on the right hand side next to Five Guys.  Food was excellent and authentic.  Definitely a great meal.  One other place would be the same route but about three blocks and on the right hand side of 55th, called Wagamama.  This is a ramen\/Asian restaurant that had some amazing food.\n\nAlso, do not use the concierge for arranging a driver to the airport.  A cab ride to JFK is about $75 now.  A car service is around $125-150.  Arranged through the hotel, they charge you $250.00 to your bill.  Better off arranging on your own.\n\nI would consider staying here again, but I want to see how the Plaza, Peninsula or Mandarin stack up first.  I have done both Intercontinental Hotels in NYC, the Sofitel,  and one Ritz and this would be about the same to me. It just wasn't the experience I was expecting from a hotel of this prestige.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"NONE"}

We all know things tend to go off track no matter how well you plan ahead. On check-in we already had luggage mix-up due to our own fault, and Michael was most helpful and courteous in handling that. George and the other butlers stayed on top of our requests throughout the weekend, everything from garment pressing to clearing out the mini-fridge for extra space late at night and last-minute shoe-shining.\n\nThe hotel is simply gorgeous.

The lobby has an overhead mural, copied from Michelangelo\u2019s painting of the ceiling in the Sistine Chapel in Rome.  The lobby has a brass, wall mounted mailbox, for the letters you will be writing on the hotel stationary in your room.\n\nTwo of the unique features that set the hotel apart are butler service and the house cars.  Every room has a butler, or at least part of one.  Our butler on the 16th floor introduced herself and asked how she could help.  We opted for their break French press coffee, which was promptly delivered.  Your butler will unpack and repack for you if you like.  The phone had a button labeled \u201cbutler.\u201d  You press it and they are summoned.  Our butler has worked at the hotel for 16 years, as I recall.  It might have been longer.\n\nThe house cars are available midday and in the evening.  If you want to go so where in about a ten block radius, the doorman will get one to take you.  The cars are usually lined up outside and are late model black Mercedes S class sedans \n\nThe hotel charges a $50\/day resort fee.  This can be spent in various ways including the Astor dining room, but not the King Cole Bar.  However, you can have cocktails in the Astor Dining a room, no problem.  FYI:  wine is about $22\/glass.  Popcorn is the least expensive item on the bar menu, priced at $16.\n\nAre there minuses?  The hotel is expensive, but it is overwhelmed by the pluses.

My friends and I visited St. Regis New York for 3 nights during the beginning of July. The experience upon check-in was not impressive. My husband and I are huge St. Regis fans, we have stayed at various St. Regis hotels around the globe and were very impressed with each of them. We thought the New York location would be the St. Regis of all St. Regis, but our expectations did not live up to reputation, at all. Being a Marriott Ambassador, I have communicated with my ambassador prior to arriving to the hotel our itinerary, special occasions and etc. Our ambassador confirmed the hotel received all the information requested and are looking forward to our arrival. Upon arrival, there was no door man, I had to carry my luggage up the steps, spin the spinning door by myself all in July heat. At this point, I am covered in sweat, front desk had no idea of my prior arrangements with my ambassador so I had to repeat everything over again. We requested dessert to be sent up to our room one night and our butler was so rude that he literally threw to food tray to us. We were here to celebrate two birthdays in two rooms, no acknowledgment of the celebration whatsoever. King Cole waiter was extremely rude. The most frustrating thing was that, my ambassador has already confirmed a late checkout for my friends room but during checkout day, our friends had to run back from Soho to pack because a late checkout was taken away. Our stay at the St. Regis New York was not a relaxing experience, if anything, it was a very stressful one! Way to go to ruin two birthday celebrations. The building is very nicely maintained, the rooms as well. However, the hotel lacks the service and experience a St. Regis truly represents.

I had checked in a day earlier and was great full that the room  was made available at 12 PM .  They  did tell us there was no view; I was okay with that  as we are in NY regularly and at this trip it was not a priority.  I haven\u2019t stayed at this hotel in a few years,  but remembered the excellent butler service and lovely accommodations,  and was looking forward to it.   The checkin felt like something one would expect at a  Highway motel.  No explanation of any services, no welcome drink,   no Butler introductions,  nobody accompanied you to the room or directed you to the elevator.\n\nThe room had the tiniest window,  with a curtain without a valance (# 1406) facing a wall a few feet away. No Natural light what so ever.  The leather head rest on the bed was ripped on a couple of spots. It had only one not very comfortable lounge chair in a fairly large king room.  So if you are a couple, you cannot even sit together for a cup of coffee.  In the past at checkin the butler would introduce themselves,  offer coffee , tea etc and make sure you were satisfied with the accommodations.  \n\nWe had ballet tickets for a matinee,  so initially decided to just go with the flow.  Went  for a quick lunch at the Astor, paid  around $170 for 2 ceaser salads, a bloody mary and  a glass of Duvel Leroy Champagne.  I have no problems paying premium prices  for value ,  but $28 for a Bloody Mary with a  celery stalk garnish and stoli vodka? They claimed to have invented it , but definitely not  worth the price. \n\nWhen we returned back from the ballet and returned to the room ,  it seemed really depressing.  They call it an interior room ,  but it could easily be in a windowless basement.  We requested a room change and requested to speak to a manager.  We were told the manager was downstairs and would call us back.  We were going to dinner,  so left the front desk our cell number.  The manager ever returned the call.  On our return when we requested a room change, we were told that they were completely sold out.  At this point we were exhausted an decided to just let it go and returned to our room for a  good nights sleep.  It was around 10:30 PM,  and there was a continuous loud rumbling sound.  When we called the front desk , we were told that the noise was from their service elevator which was being  used  a lot that night as 2 of their 4 passenger elevators had been broken for a couple of days.  They offered to now move us to another room.  So at 11 Pm we had to get dressed and pack up to move to another room.\n\nThe new room (1903), had a moldy smell.  Got up next morning with a back ache as the bed was not comfortable.  In the morning the moldy smell seems to have gotten even worse and I did  report that.  I was told it was because of air conditioning!  We called the butler for coffee in the morning.  The French press coffee arrived with cups saucers and milk.  You would expect at least some cookie or something to accompany the coffee ,  but they brought the bare minimum.  No little flower stem on the tray etc.  the butler said that he forgot the spoons for stirring and would bring one,  but never returned.  \n\nWe had breakfast at Astor court,  and here the service was good.  I forget the name of the lady who served us,  but she was excellent.  Brought some excellent grape  fruit concoctions before the main corse.  The eggs Benedict were also perfectly cooked.  She offered to pack the pastries for us that we hadn\u2019t touched without are asking.  The professional and sincere service she provided was our expectation from rest of the staff.\n\nThe elevators and the elevator banks at the hotel are not air conditioned and it can get very sweaty while waiting for the elevator on a hot day and especially when 2 of the 4 elevators are not working.  Their excuse for this  is that it is a very old hotel.  I have stayed in 5 star hotels older than this all over the world,  and they have invested in modern technology like air conditioned elevators,  electric curtains etc.   Not sure,  that because this is  now a Marriott franchise, and the focus is on short term quarterly profit and CEO bonus,  focus  is not on reinvestment in the property and attention to detail.   \n\nMy advise to anyone  paying  for a hotel at this rate is to consider the Four Seasons,  Carlyle,  Peninsula etc.   It appears a lot of  the clientele here are the Marriott point collectors,  who stay at regular Marriott for business and then use their  points  to book a stay here.   \n\nOverall this  was a very disappointing stay and I feel that the top management here  needs  thorough retraining  or be replaced.   It\u2019s a pity that this one time landmark luxury hotel is falling apart.   Just having crystal chandeliers in the room doesn\u2019t make  a hotel 5 star!","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I'd happily pay the $65 and the tax, but the idea of paying another 20% service charge for literally opening the mini bar.  Just BS.  Honestly, its not even the money, its the idea of it.  Tell me what you're going to charge and I can make a decision.  It's the BS hidden fees.  Never again.\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

(This and the StR San Francisco are my favorite city hotels in the USA.)\n\nThe St Regis New York just oozes Manhattan luxury to me. It\u2019s really hard for me to consider staying anywhere else in the city. But I always try to find weeks when rates are lower than usual to indulge.\n\nThe hotel kindly upgraded me from an entry level superior to a Grand Deluxe upon checking in via the app 2 days prior to arrival, and then upgraded me again to an Astor Suite the morning before my arrival. That would be a $7000 Ambassador upgrade value for those keeping score (on top of an already amazing $650 AAA rate for this hotel). \n#ambassadorstatusmatters #stregis #newyork #stregisnewyork #kingcolebar #billsalltimefavorites #suiteupgrades \n\nThe hotel offered me 4 pm late checkout, as well. \n\nThe suite was pre-cooled below 65 F as per my #prearrivalchecklist \u2014 but quickly went down to a lovely 60-61 F for the rest of my stay. WiFi was blazing fast at 120 Mbps. Shower pressure is always incredible here; despite the small shower stall, this remains one of my 3 favorite showers in the world. #amazingshower \n\nI had a lovely fruit bowl and chocolates welcome amenity arrive just after my arrival. \n\nThe fantastic concierge team helped in advance of my stay with dinner reservations at 3* Per Se, 2* Jungsik, 2* Gabriel Kreuther, 1* Cote. They also assisted with lunch at nearby Limani. \n\nWhile my King Cole bar stalwart, George, was out with a shoulder injury, the rest of the team always secured me a table \u2014 for myself or with friends. Drinks at the King Cole are part of my NYC ritual. \n\nButler morning coffee service was always prompt \u2014 though over the weekend the hotel operator was a little clumsy helping to arrange it. They don\u2019t normally include hot milk here, but they always do it for me when I ask. I only packed a carry on, so I never availed myself of butler unpacking and packing services (or shoe shining). \n\nI never actually asked about the breakfast benefit value for room service (which I did every morning but one) or at Astor Court, but I had assumed it was the same $140 value for up to two persons as it was during my stay last May. Regardless, all of my breakfast orders from $70-125 were removed from my bill at checkout. Breakfasts always were prompt, hot, and delicious. Service at Astor Court was a bit slower for Sunday brunch but otherwise was lovely. The strawberry cream French toast was divine. \n\nHousekeeping was flawless. Turndown service was great, as well. \n\nI had a minor but noticeable noise issue the last two mornings of my stay \u2014 as they were literally digging up the street direct outside the hotel below my window (12 stories below). A very short term issue, I\u2019m told. \n\nI also enjoyed a spa treatment at the Peninsula just across the street. Extremely convenient, indeed. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was pretty close \u2014 yet again. I tipped the butlers, concierge, housekeeping, and front desk very well, indeed. \n\nI\u2019m already looking forward to my next stay.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"NONE"}

We had a great time,\n\nThe hotel is expensive, but it fits into the category of ultra luxury grand hotels.  We paid using Marriott Bonvoy points. They have courtesy house cars that will take you places.  They have lots of staff.  Every room has butler service.  You push a button on your phone and they appear.  Someone will hail you a taxi and another someone will load your bags into the trunk.\n\nThe hotel rooms are huge compared to other hotels.  The bathrooms are marble.  The table lamps are controlled by a round disk you to turn them on off off.  The lighting system is sophisticated.  We have stayed here before and the best coffee we have ever tasted is the French press coffee brought by your butler at your request.\n\nBonvoy members at our level get breakfast included because there is no concierge lounge.  I am not sure if this is true for all bonvoy levels.  Breakfast can be served in your room or the Astor Dining Room.  The American breakfast runs $46.  Your included breakfast is either the American breakfast or a $46 credit towards other selections.\n\nThe level of service is amazing.  We packed a picnic, which we intended to enjoy in the room.  We asked our butler if they could provide plates, napkins and cutlery.  He asked what time we wanted to have our picnic.  At the appointed time, he rolled in an entire dining table with two places set on a white tablecloth complete with butter, rolls and a rose in a vase!\n\nThere are negatives.  The hotel has a $50\/day destination fee.  This can be used in the restaurant, but not the King Cole Bar.  We learned that on our previous visit.  We decided to have dinner in the restaurant.  The $50 fee was applied vs. the bill, which is a good thing.  However , you cannot combine and then apply the two $50 fees.  It\u2019s $50 that needs to be spent independently each day of your stay.\n\nThis is a grand hotel.  Tipping is part of the grand hotel experience.  In my opinion. You tip everyone you encounter who does something for you.  We tipped the butler when he collected the table, the person who cleaned our room, the bellman, the driver of the courtesy car and the doorman.  This included our restaurant server too.\n\nAs you can tell, we like the hotel.  It\u2019s an ideal place for celebrating a special event.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

A luxury experience.  Impeccable service. So when they fall short, I am not sure they should get a pass.\n\nThe room was lovely, giant by NYC standards. The turndown service  and butler service are among the best in the industry.  These far exceed what you will experience at a comparable Ritz or Four Season.\n\nThe service and dining left so much to be desired.  For example, I had confirmed an early check-in the day prior.  When we arrived, no room available.  The interaction with the front desk staff was terse, so much so, that upon walking away my daughter whispered that lady was such a Karen!  Hours later, we inquired if the room was ready by chat and by phone.  No one answered the chat.  No one answered the phone!  The phone rang in an endless loop before disconnecting.  This happened multiple times.  Finally, an hour after first trying to connect with them, someone answered that our room was ready!  Great joy but no one had contacted us as promised (contact info left with the front desk) so by that time we were across town.\n\nThe dining!  We ordered private dining twice and both experiences were on a TGIFridays level for food.  The exception: the shrimp cocktail.  WORTH IT. Beyond that, both times, items were forgotten and had to be brought later.  The french fries were unsalted (maybe the St. Regis cares deeply about my blood pressure) and bland.  Hear me when I say the lobster roll was the worst lobster roll on earth.  I struggle to describe the taste and texture of it but it was so disgusting.  If you have an enemy staying at the St. Regis order them the lobster roll, disgust guaranteed. Then breakfast...ugh.  The prices were out of control but that is expected.  The worst thing is I paid $36 for a cold Lender's bagel.  Surely the St. Regis could source better bagels in NYC!  Instead, you get a defrosted grocery store bagel.  Also, the pancakes...yikes.  \n\nWere my expectations high?  Yes!  It's the St. Regis!  It is a lovely place to stay but don't expect perfection.   ","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Only had a short period of time to spare and wanted to make the most of it.\nBooked the King suite through my Marriott account.  Received an email on the 26th for early checkin, so I did.\nArrived at the St. Regis after long travel, at 7am on the 27th.  Made the front desk aware of this early arrival and was told as soon as a room was available, we would receive one.\nChecked back with the front desk at 12pm to no avail.  Again at 2:30pm, while watching others checkin, I mean it's pretty crowded with other guests checking in at this point.\nOur room still wasn't available, so we were told that every effort was made to try and get us in a room sooner but a guarantee for 4pm worst case scenario.\n\nChecked back at 4:35 because the line was so long getting to the front desk.\nWas told that my room wasn't available because of the request \"if possible for queen beds, I will take it, but certainly not a must.\" But, we could upgrade to the Madison for additional $1000\/night b\/c it's usually $4k\/night.\nI stated that I would want the Madison but didn't agree with the additional charges due to my room not being ready anyway.\nAgain, checked in at 7am that morning for the first room available and at this point it's 5pm, we are exhausted from spending the time out on the streets while just wanting to take a shower, get settled in, change our clothes and go over our itinerary for our short stay.\nDuring our wait, we decided to have lunch at the restaurant inside of the hotel. WORST EXPERIENCE.  I was not able to get the name of the hostess that sat us but she was racist.  Did not make eye contact.  Nor, were we even greeted.  Sat us down without taking our bags or coats, while hanging the coats of those around us.  On top of the lack of decency, she never advised our waiter of our seating.  We waited and waited until I could no longer take it.  We didn't even have water in our glasses nearing an hour after being seated.  Got the restaurants manager involved in this situation.\n\nSo, we did not receive our room until almost 8pm that evening.  Even when we received our room, the wanted to discuss charging us the up charge for the Madison suite.  I requested to speak to the manager.  I was advised that ORVILLE, at the guest counter, would be coming up to my room that evening to discuss waiving the up charge.  It NEVER happened.\nBecause of the restaurant issue, I was told that my meals would be complimentary -- that didn't happen.\nNot one person throughout my stay called or came to my room to discuss charges.  It wasn't until my last day that they tried adding ALL of the fees that I was originally advised would be complimentary.  Once again, I had to spend the little bit of my vacation time discussing charged with the front desk, everyone acting oblivious over the mention of complimentary.  Them having to once again call out a manager for me to speak with.\nUpon speaking with the manager while trying to leave, I was able to get the up charge waived, but my room service fees for dining they still charged.\n\nThis was the worst trip I have had at the St. Regis.  I usually travel in February with my white husband for my birthday.  It's a totally different experience when I am with my white husband.  I rarely get this alone time with my girls so I wanted to show them a good time.  I did not expect to encounter the racism and the feeling of being overlooked and degraded.\n\nThe only people that had any type of decency were the servicemen.  The bellmen Hector was great!  The butler Juan took the time to ask if we needed anything.  David the bellman was also great!  Jessie, a waiter in the restaurant, is the most pleasant and hospitable. Eddie, the driver of the complimentary car was social and AMAZING!\n\nAfter finally getting settled in the room, our butler Flora was rude and called me a liar.  She said that she was just relaying a message from dining.  I was appalled by her behavior.  This was real upsetting.\n\nSt Regis, shame on you.  I really feel like I would not have had this experience if the color of my skin was white.\n\nMy daughter was able to spend one more day for vacation so I extended our stay.  I first checked with the Regis the morning of checkout to ask if we could stay another day in any room.  I was told \"no.\"  I booked online about a mile away at the Marriott Residence Inn.  We received our room right away.  No wait time and the staff was extremely pleasant.\n\nSo, knowing we lost a whole day of our short stay waiting on our room, Marriott allows late checkout for Platinum members.  I was told that couldn't be honored.  I was rushed out of the room.  They even sent the bellman Hector up to grab our bags saying that we called him, knowing damn well, we did not make that call quite yet ...\n\nI just don't know if I would like to continue my yearly routine of spending my bdays at the St Regis after this recent stay.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

It is usually to either praise exceptional service or make others aware of unexpectedly poor experiences.\n\nThe bottom line is this hotel is fine, but it is not a 5-star property in many ways, several of which I shall describe chronologically. \n\nOn arrival at the hotel in the evening at around 9:45 pm, there were no staff to be seen. Most 5-star properties in New York are famous for the ever-present doormen and bellboys to help with luggage and settling in. This left us with five large bags on the sidewalk with no one to assist. Eventually, someone appeared and was able to get a bellboy to assist. Similarly, on entering the reception it was deserted until a member of staff appeared from a nearby office. \n\nImmediately upon check-in, I asked what my options were if I wanted to extend my checkout time to 6 pm the following day and that if necessary I would pay any fees\/extra rates. Now, this is where I was reminded that I was not staying in a real 5-star hotel, but actually just a shinier Marriott. I was told that I could receive a late checkout at 2 pm, or pay a half-day rate to get a check-out at 4 pm, but to check out at 6 pm I would need to pay an entire extra night. As far as I could tell, a half-day normally means more than an additional two hours, but I said that was fine and I would pay for an extra night.\n\nThe receptionist at this point then disappeared into the office and returned to say that my room had been upgraded to a $10,000-a-night suite but I would have to leave at 2 pm. I explained I did not want an upgrade, but just a late checkout, even if it meant paying. She disappeared once more into the office and returned. She explained her manager was happy for me to leave at 6 pm the next day free of charge, but I would have to take a smaller room. I once again explained I did not mind the cost, I just wanted to check out at 6 pm. She disappeared for a third time into the office and came back to inform me that I could stay till 6 pm by paying for an extra night, but that I would need to make the booking online myself and then let them know, and that we would be able to stay in the $10,000 a night suite (that I didn't ask for at any point) the entire time at the cost of my original booking. Eventually, this was resolved, with what I asked for all along, which was an additional night on my booking which I was happy to pay for.\n\nWhat I found strangest about this entire experience, was that while the receptionist disappeared so many times to see her manager, the manager himself did not come out to speak to us  \u2013 even though, awkwardly, I could see him at his desk through the door each time she went away. Again, this is extremely unusual behaviour for a 5-star hotel, and it would not have been difficult for him to come and work through it directly and personally. The entire experience simply reminded me this is a property in a very large corporate chain.\n\nThe suite itself was fine \u2013 I would, however, be extremely disappointed if I was paying $10,000 a night as the receptionist said its rate was. The decor is confusing, with suede curtains and electric blinds that go up and down until they eventually fall. There is also a large decorative mirror balanced on the floor leaning against a wall.\n\nHaving been travelling all day, we ordered room service. The food took longer than expected, for which the waiter apologised without prompting, but it was also cold. Similarly, a couple of requested substitutions were ignored and other items were forgotten. \n\nOther minor quibbles include a lack of overnight laundry, again unusual among fellow five-star properties across the US and worldwide. \n\nI realise it appears I am playing one of the world's smallest violins to criticise the service of a hotel that costs thousands of dollars a night, but that is precisely the point of this review. For those who enjoy five-star hotels, or are using their points to stay in one, be aware that it is not what you should expect or deserve. \n\nI would instead recommend a property like the Four Seasons, the Peninsula, or the Rosewood Group.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

We stayed 5 nights in an Astor suite facing 55th street and it was lovely. The blackout curtains drowned out the light and noise from busy midtown and we slept like a dream. \n\nAdmittedly we booked a more basic room, used suite nights to upgrade to an enhanced room, and then were given a complimentary upgrade based on our Ambassador status. This obviously makes a difference to us because we did not pay full price, but we would return nonetheless. \n\nAs part of being elite status you can have $135 breakfast credit in your room or $115 at the restaurant. We did mostly room breakfasts. I recommend ordering the night before. Each time the staff was prompt and friendly and if they forgot anything they were quick to remedy the situation. \n\nWe had two items pressed in the morning and they were back in our room later that day. \n\nThe room was huge and we had two bathrooms. We didn't spend much time in the hotel as we were there on business, but each time we came back to our room it was clean. The TV's are comically small given that it's the year 2022, but it certainly adds to the charm. \n\nOne night we had dinner at the bar and it was delicious (and obviously expensive). I'll say the presence of escorts is a little on the nose, but they didn't bother us. \n\nOur only complaint is that the bar closes at 11pm. After a broadway show on friday night we hurried back hoping to grab a drink before it closed but they wouldn't let us in. I understand you have set hours and it's challenging to staff your hotels, but it's a little strange to be an internationally acclaimed hotel that closes its only bar at 11pm on a weekend night. There was no shortage of guests who wanted to be there; while we were turned away so were two other couples within seconds of us. \n\nThis wasn't unique to the St. Regis; the Polo Bar, Peninsula hotel, Whitby, plaza, the ritz, all close their bars between 10-11pm even on friday and saturday nights. It really makes you question if this is still the city that never sleeps!","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I'll also be writing to Marriott Bonvoy to express my concerns.\n\nChecked into St Regis for a long anticipated five night stay with my wife.   We had very high expectations of the hotel. \n\nAs a Gold Marriott member we paid for the room with Bonvoy points (around 495000 points or the equivalent of $1700 per night) After a long flight from London we arrived in the hotel around 10:30pm. We were told that no upgrades were available to our room as the hotel was \"fully booked\". As a gold member I would normally get these subject to availability - I don't expect them (however I was told  exactly the same thing back in 2018 when I last stayed at the property).  \n\nOn entering the room we discovered one very small window (overlooking a dirty concrete void - see photo) in a room that had clearly seen better days - with very tired scarlet decor.  It was also apparent that the room was next to the main elevator shaft.   We like a tub in our bathroom so were disappointed to only find a shower.\n\nWe went down to the front desk and asked to be moved to a room with at least one usable window and a bathtub, and away from lift noise.  We were informed that the hotel was fully booked and nothing was available for least 3 days  - however the duty manager at the time told us we could avail of food and drinks in the restaurant and bar (this was at around 11pm).  \n\nWe were really jet lagged but thought a drink might take the edge off our disappointment.  Of course when we tried to go to the bar it was closed (as was the restaurant).  What kind of offer is that?  \n\nDeeply unhappy now we went back to the room to find that the room safe was non-functional and toiletries in the bathroom had been used.  These were the last straws and we rebooked another hotel that evening for the rest of the stay.  \n\nThe following morning we spoke to hotel management whilst checking out who apologized and (too late) offered us an alternative room.  Suddenly something had become available !\n\nWe were not refunded our points balance for the night we stayed but were given a credit back of 25,000 points which, given that some people have obtained twice as much for poor butler service or cold beverages seems derisory.\n\nThis experience completely ruined the first part of our stay.  The hotel fell far behind the standards I would expect of such a property.  \n\nI have to also mention that they ought to be honest upfront and say that they will not upgrade under any circumstances.  I would not have a problem with that at all.    \n\nThe King Cole bar and its location are the only redeeming features of this hotel - there are far better value properties in the city.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The room itself was beautiful, location is impeccable, etc. but ultimately disappointing due to multitude of service mistakes that should not be happening at a hotel of this price range. To summarize: \n\n1. I pre-arranged with the concierge to have fresh flowers in the room upon check in. Our room was not ready when we initially arrived, and the front desk separately confirmed that the flowers would be in the room once it was ready. A few hours later we were informed that the room was ready and picked up our keys. The flowers were not in the room and did not arrive for several hours. \n\n2. Our butler never came by to introduce himself\/herself as is customary (and as the front desk indicated would happen) \n\n3. We ended up arriving at the room at around 3pm. The room was already set up in turn down service mode (towel, slippers, water by the bed). We had a rest and then went out for dinner +  a show and came back around midnight. The room was in the same condition as we left it with the bed unmade. When I talked to a service manager about this, it was indicated that because we already received turndown service that day (before check-in), the housekeeping team does not go back into the room. \n\n4. The next day I called for the butler to press my suit and return it in the afternoon by a certain time. I was assured this would be done. 30 minutes past the time I set there was no suit and I had to call down again to have the suit brought up. Apparently the previous butler's shift was over and never communicated to the new butler that my suit was to be delivered by a certain time. \n\n5. I talked to a service manager about these issues and was offered 50k Bonvoy points as compensation. I accepted as none of these issues were major. However, these points still have not been deposited in my account, now 2 months after my stay. \n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful and timeless. None of the above issues are a dealbreaker in and of themselves, but when a hotel is charging the rates that the NY St Regis is, a certain level of quality and consistency should be expected. As I experienced it, the service does not match the quality of the hotel.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

If you like old school luxury hotels, then you will be very pleased.  The rooms are stunning.  The wallpaper and the marble and the gold accents are simply stunning.  The bathtubs (and there were two in our suite!) are very comfortable.  I never wanted to leave our suite. \nThe two standout staff members are Christina at the Front Desk and Dolores, our butler.  Dolores has been with the St. Regis for 28 years and is superb.  She helped with pressing our clothes, bringing us coffee\/tea in the morning, coordinating with bell desk and housekeeping and pretty much anything else you would request.  \nBreakfast is included if you are an Elite Bonvoy member (platinum and above) up to $135 credit for two people either at Astor Court or room service.  This was a great value.  \nRoom service was surprisingly fast.  Never longer than half an hour.\nMy only complaint about this hotel is that it has ruined all other hotels for me, because nothing else can possibly compare to the NY St. Regis! \nThe hotel is pricey, but it was worth every penny for our special occasion.  \nI\u2019m already thinking about a return visit next time we have something to celebrate!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It\u2019s the very beginning of our trip and we expected a lot when we booked this. \n\nThe most frustrating issue was the front desk agent Jonathan failing to tell us about the daily destination credit, but instead of just informing us, he gaslighted us by saying we forgot because he has worked here for so long. I can absolutely assure you that is not the case since we arrived at the Hotel at 2PM, our room was not ready until 4:30PM and if you told me I had a credit to the bar\u2026 that\u2019s the first place I\u2019m going! \n\nAfter that, we had other issues:\n1) Paging the butler, but no one showed up or called back. No greeting by the butler at all. Some reviews say they unpack your clothes? \n2) No effort to make our stay above and beyond, we told Jonathan it was our honeymoon and zero recognition of that. For a 5 star resort, even a congratulation note would be nice. Here, no effort to do anything. Even more frustrating he could\u2019ve just sent us to the bar to use our credit\u2026. \n3) This one looking back just seems like a money grab so it\u2019s frustrating\u2026 as I said earlier we showed up at 2PM but was told our room wasn\u2019t ready until 4PM. We didn\u2019t get a call until late so we returned at 6:30PM. To my surprise our bags weren\u2019t brought up to our room. We had to call to get them to bring it up\u2026 just so we can tip the person. I already tipped when we came in, this just seems petty to me.

There is a uniformed butler who shows you around your room.  They will unpack your luggage and put things into various drawers.  They will press two garments per day free of charge.

Our butler did make contact once and did provide a complimentary tray of coffee in the morning on request (there\u2019s no tea or coffee facilities in the room but you can get it delivered free before noon). \n\nThere's no pool at the hotel. The gym is small but functional and quite busy in the mornings.\n\nBreakfast was cooked to order. As we had Elite status, the American Breakfast at $46 each was complimentary. However, the waiters were quite flexible and allowed us to swap out the standard breakfast for other items on the menu for no extra charge. The pancakes were excellent as was the coffee. \n\nWe tried the iconic King Cole bar, which was smaller and cosier than expected but very busy. The cocktails were quite good in the main although the signature red snapper cocktail was way too strong. The free snacks - wasabi peas and Bombay crackers - were dismal\u2026good quality nuts would be a far better accompaniment. \n\nAll things considered, we enjoyed our stay here but would have like to give it a try when staffing and service levels are back to normal.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93614,"title":"Moderate Service Improvements Would Help for StR Level","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-06-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I am aware that service standards in NYC are not what they are in Asia or in the Middle East so I try to judge by local standards, but nonetheless based on my stay at StR NYC I am not sure this StR was quite on par with the brand.    \n\nOur stay did not start on the right foot - first off there was no pre-arrival e-mail which would be an easy thing to do, then check-in was a bit chaotic because they chose 7pm as the appropriate time to vacuum the (small) reception area and I could barely hear the receptionist speaking to me from behind a glass wall. I suspect that in-room check-in is rare in NYC luxury hotels (unlike elsewhere in the world) but in those circumstances if there ever was a time where it would have been useful, this would be it. There was nobody to accompany us to our room after check-in either, and no mention of the butler - if I was not familiar with the brand I would have no idea there was supposed to be one. I am guessing they might be short staffed relative to guest count which is easier to accept for a select service hotel than a StR. \n\nAt this hotel the Suite Night Awards do not go higher than Grand Luxe which is not a suite so the \"S\" part of SNA is questionable consequently I did not use an SNA but ended up being upgraded to that room type anyway.\n\nThe best feature was that the room had excellent soundproofing from outside and within, unlike some newer hotels where we can hear traffic noise (especially in NYC) and people in the hallway.  However the room had some issues due to the building being old, for example we partially lost power twice during the stay and the cord for the blinds broke; consequently one day we did not have day light and after they fixed it was only temporary because the problem was simply reversed: we could not move them back down anymore with the cable still hanging on the floor. \n\nSince our check-in process was not the most thorough, the only discussion about breakfast was that we could order the American breakfast as the Platinum (or above) benefit but no mention of potential flexibility to order anything else (including something cheaper on the menu).  The American breakfast was 46 USD per person so for a couple it was close to 100 USD value \u2013 the issue is not that I believe the credit was stingy, the issue is more about offering alternatives and proactively mentioning it to guests upon check-in.  What stood out favorably was the ability to have breakfast as room service instead of limiting it to the restaurant.\n\nService was not stellar overall due to some issues mentioned above but in their defense some aspects were good.  For example any time I made a request in the chat (Marriott app) they were very responsive and housekeeping was done at the time we requested, and was done noticeably well compared to most other hotels.  I shipped some packages to the hotel before my arrival and they were left in our room upon arrival so the service on point in that regard as well, however they charged 11 USD per parcel which was not mentioned ahead of time.  Charging for this service seems more suitable for select service hotels than a St.Regis but it was a minor issue in the grand scheme of things.  \n\nI did not intend to \"complain\" since none of our issues were terrible and the most important is that we could sleep well. However by coincidence during our stay I e-mailed the Marriott Ambassador service for a request completely unrelated to StR NYC and they happened to ask me how my check-in went at StR. I never had a request for comments about the check-in process specifically so I thought it was odd, anyway I took the opportunity to point out some areas of improvement in my humble opinion. The ambassador agent forwarded my e-mail to the hotel and after I checked out a manager called to thank me for my feedback, we discussed some things which could have gone better. I appreciated that someone followed up so it improved my perception of the hotel and I could give them another chance later.\n\nTo conclude on service, one luxury aspect not found in many other hotels is the hotel car service within 10 blocks for guest use which is a feature I hope they will retain.\n\nOverall our stay was mixed with various potential areas of improvement but at least the ending was satisfactory and the hotel showed they were eager to listen and improve which keeps the door open for me to return, unlike some hotels which are tone deaf and clearly leave customer feedback way down their list of priorities.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

My mother\u2019s room also was upgraded to a Grand Luxe room. I tipped the front desk well at the end. FWIW those upgrades together were worth over $8K. Not bad for a $20K investment for Ambassador status.\n#AmbassadorStatusMatters \n#AmbassadorStatusMattersMoreAtNicerHotels \n#AmbassadorStatusInstTheSameAsTitanium\n\nThis all was on top of the hotel GM honoring my insanely good BRG rate from my 2020 intended stay that was canceled due to covid by extending a very generous comparable rate for both rooms for this stay. FWIW, that generosity saved me almost $5K alone. \n\nMy Ambassador pre-arrival checklist items were all handled. The suite was pre-cooled to 65 F. I asked the engineer to cool it down further and it got as cold as 61 F. Heavenly. I also had four bottles of water provided every day by housekeeping (even when they forgot), and had a fan by the bed. Shades and blinds made for blackout as requested. My welcome amenity of chocolate covered strawberries was delicious; my mother got those as well as a bottle of Prosecco. \n\nThe concierge team was as impressive as ever. Months and weeks before arrival, they helped get us bookings for 3* Le Bernardin, 1* Gramercy Tavern, 1* Marea, and The Grill. They also helped with several lunch recommendations \u2014 and for ordering flowers for my mother\u2019s room at the last minute. I tipped them well at the end.\n\nHousekeeping was very good. I never saw them, in fact. They did miss turndown the first night, but they got it every other night. They didn\u2019t always close all the curtains in the suite, and they occasionally forgot to bring my extra water bottles, but they usually promptly made up for it. I tipped them well at the end.\n\nButler service was very good. Unpacking was a bit clumsier than usual IIRC, but I was still grateful for the service. Shoe shine and pressing were great. Morning coffee service was always fast and gracious, and they always were willing to bring me more if I needed anything. They were just as good for my mother. I tipped them well at the end.\n\nThe St Regis New York shower also remains my favorite in the world, with the best but softest water pressure I\u2019ve ever enjoyed. It\u2019s incredible. The shower room is small, but that soft water pressure is so addictive.\n\nFood and beverage were extremely impressive. The elite status breakfast benefit is an impressive $135 credit for up to 2 persons per room, and I never hit it \u2014 whether via room service or at the Astor Court restaurant. I did room service breakfast for 3 of my mornings and Astor Court breakfast for the other 2. Room service was usually fast (less than 30 min) and with hot food, but one morning was a disaster where they obviously got it all wrong \u2014 and it took an hour and was only warm. They couldn\u2019t have been more apologetic, but since it was free and so generous I didn\u2019t worry more about it. \n\nThe one oddity of room service was having two different servers on two different occasions opening my suite door without my answering it while bringing up some extra items. It was a bit disconcerting, and the F&B manager mentioned his surprise and that more training was necessary. Clearly, a newer F&B staff training issue.\n\nI also had dinner one night with friends at Astor Court \u2014 and it was delicious. First time I\u2019ve ever had dinner at the hotel, but it measured up. It\u2019s no Lambs Club at the Chatwal Hotel, but it was still quite impressive. \n\nWe also met my brother and sister-in-law at the King Cole Bar to surprise my mother for her birthday. George, who had worked with us during our 2018 Table 55 experience, recognized me as I walked in and totally took care of us. George has worked at the King Cole for 30 years; he is is an absolute gem. He even got us a reserved table for the following night. This remains one of my favorite hotel bars in NYC.\n\nThe doormen were fab. They got us the house car (now a Mercedes S) that I\u2019d never used previously in order to pick up my mother from the train station. They also got us taxis and recs whenever we needed them and always offered a helping hand for my mother. I tipped them well each time.\n\nService overall was as impressive as I remember \u2014 which is particularly impressive knowing the staff supply issues and new training obviously endemic to all hotels. Staff throughout the hotel remembered us by name far more than I remember being common, more reminding me of an Aman stay.  Everyone was gracious and friendly and always eager to help.\n\nOverall, it was a 9.5 out of 10 for me and my mother. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was sublime. They made a few mistakes, but they totally took care of us in every way. The suite and my mother\u2019s room both were incredibly comfortable. The hotel completely exudes New York with a sense of place unmatched by almost any of the other top luxury hotels. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to return. Even as I don\u2019t love New York. The St Regis New York delivers in spades. Definitely one of the best. Definitely my second favorite city hotel in the USA. And definitely still one of #billsalltimefavorites.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Normally I get a free upgrade due to my high status and centurion membership, but it was \u201cnot available\u201d even though all the big suites were available online and the hotel was noticeably empty. Ok fine whatever, I got a lower grade room that was ready right away bc I didn\u2019t want to wait. \n\nThe service was friendly but slow, the butlers didn\u2019t have training in basic things like the room service menu or salon services which left me calling to figure things out on my own.

Was picked up but 90 mins later, still no shirt. I call to page the butler, no one comes. Had to call reception and them track the butler down, he finally came and apologized for the delay, it was apparent he was overworked and probably servicing multiple floors. Not excusable to be understaffed when paying $1800\/night, the revenue from one room could pay the annual salary for a fleet of butlers, let alone just one serving the whole floor. \n\nFinally got dressed up and ready to go, I wanted to take a few pictures as this was the first formal event I\u2019ve attended since before the pandemic, was promptly yelled at by a barrage of security (3 rude men) who swiftly started grilling me what I was doing, what room am I staying in, and that photography is strictly prohibiting and return to my room or leave. Really??? \n\nSuffice it to say I was 45 minutes late to my event mainly due to the hotel, but luckily I had such a good time this inconvenience was mostly forgotten. \n\nSome positive notes, the gym is recently redone and very nice, the King Cole bar is still a favorite watering hole, and the room service always arrived at the perfect temperature which is sometimes hard to do with eggs. \n\nAll in all the St Regis still feels like my home in New York, however given the service issues experienced, I might change up my routine next time and stay somewhere else.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

These guy will do literally anything at all, anything-  to make sure it's confusing, annoying, and in the end, they charged us all for breakfast, nothing got included, we lost the $50, and this involved about 20 minutes with the front desk people trying to understand it.  While up at the desk, we saw 3 other parties literally pulling their hair out, trying to understand about the breakfast, the $50, etc.   They have one company policy:  don't make it easy, don't give anything away, money is not interchangeable even between members of the SAME party, and utilize basically awful service.\n\nSorry:  if you want to be 5star, stop being so confusing, petty, and in love with overcharging and double charging and saying \"nothing is included\" to every question.

I can't comprehend why anyone would spend cash here, considering how awful the experience is. The property itself is okay, not quite my style, but I guess it may appeal to some. The butler service is a nice touch - our butler was great indeed. She has happily explained the service, delivered tea on a silver tray and picked up\/returned laundry. The restaurant is rather small, but perfectly fine and the service impeccable - probably the best I've experienced in any hotel restaurant in the US.\nThat's about it for the positives. When you arrive at St. Regis your poor experience begins with checkin. The reception area is tiny and quickly becomes crowded. We've arrived at 3:15pm and have been told in a patronising tone that we're free to leave the luggage behind and go elsewhere, while they get the room ready, as the checkin time is 4pm. That's fair enough, you don't need to be patronising about it.\nUpon return shortly after 4pm, I was told - again in a patronising way - that my room has been upgraded two categories. Well, I've paid for that upgrade with a SUA, so no favours were done. No offer of late checkout was extended, so if you stay here know your rights - I'm Marriott Titanium and as such I am eligible for 4pm checkout, which when requested was applied but, again, not offered proactively.\nThe $50 scam destination fee includes $50 credit for F&B (guess what - you can't use it on the day of departure!), $75 laundry credit (sufficient to wash and fold 2 pairs of undies, 2 pairs of socks and 2 polo shirts) and some credit for the hair salon. Museum tickets are no longer given.\nAs a Titanium member you get zero welcome amenity other than the choice of breakfast or 1000 points. Most hotels will leave you some chocolates, fruit bowl or some other token of appreciation for your custom, but penny-pinching here is quite obvious.\nThe Bentley house car which is so prominently advertised on the hotel website is not a Bentley at all. Also they would not let you take the car with luggage (for clarity, by luggage I mean a backpack and a carryon). Park Hyatt somehow didn't have a problem with that.\nOn the morning of departure I've found a letter pushed under the door: an offer of 25k Marriott points for giving up the guaranteed 4pm checkout and vacating the room at 12 noon. Quite an insult to second-top tier Bonvoy member in a hotel that charges >$1000 per night. Boy, they were desperate for that room. At 11:30am I've got a call from front desk to ask if I could check out by 12pm because they need the room and if I'd like to stay they'd offer me *another room* for 4 hours. I've never experienced anything like this. The offer went up to 30k points. I've settled at 40k, as I couldn't stand staying there any longer.\nCheckout is an experience too. The clerk dealing with me had difficulty comprehending some basic English. They didn't even bother asking how your stay was. They knew it was crap. My absolute favourite was when they said: \"you can stand there and wait until the bellman is done with that customer\". So five star!","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

The staff was very friendly and our room was very comfortable. And I just love the history of the hotel; you can almost feel it. The location is excellent. \n\nHowever, the St. Regis is costly and you definitely get what you pay for. We got just the standard room and once again it was toward the back of the hotel and overlooked a brick wall. The room was lovely but definitely had signs of aging. I was also disappointed that their famed Bentley was again not running and no real reason as to why. Last time it was \u201cin the shop\u201d. My kids were so disappointed! I was also disappointed that the long standing tradition of sabering champagne no longer happens. It did on our first stay and it was awesome. This time I guess they blamed COVID. But with the bar being packed, elbow to elbow, with paying customers, there didn\u2019t seem to be a health worry there! BTW I do like the King Cole Bar but it could be updated for sure.  \n\nRoom service was just ok. Kids wanted cookies and milk before bed and they were promptly delivered but they sent substitute cookies that my kids didn\u2019t like. In room coffee the next morning was enjoyable but came in at whopping $120 ( plus service charges) for a pot of coffee and two bagels. Lastly, We were going to the parade that day and asked for an extra hour to check out and were denied. Just an hour to refresh and relax. They are very stringent on their check in times too. \n\nDespite my modest concerns we did have a nice stay in an elegant and historic hotel. If there\u2019s a next time, I will have to see what the better rooms go for. But not sure I can justify $1,500+ a night.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Perhaps it was because we used points that they decided to put us in a back corner of the 7th floor in a suite that had certainly not been renovated. But the room was poorly kept and clearly dated (see photos fingerprints on mirrors, dirty walls, damaged furniture and there was no body wash until I found housekeeping in the hall). I also found myself needing to email the concierge 3 times in order to get information on vegan dining options. I get it, not everyone is vegan, but I asked both about the room service and local restaurants and the first response I received was a canned answer in the form of a pdf of local st. regis favs (including steak houses).

Butler service underwhelming.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-12-21","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"Normally I don\u2019t write reviews, but I had to write this one. I\u2019ve been staying at Marriott properties for a while, and I\u2019ve generally had really good experiences at them. This was my first time staying in St Regis, and honestly after spending over $1500 per night, I am underwhelmed by what this property has to offer. I chose this over the Ritz because of its butler service and the Bentley house car that is advertised right on their website. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the house car. It\u2019s not a Bentley anymore, and instead it\u2019s a Cadillac Escalade. They are not on the same level. If you don\u2019t have the Bentley anymore, you should not advertise it on your website and social media. The Bentley was one of the factors that lead me to pick this over the Ritz!\n\nSecond, the butler is not capable of doing much. All my butler did was bring me tea, and when I asked for desserts, he said that he simply can\u2019t do it. This kind of behavior cannot be accepted from a 5 star property. \n\nThird, I am a Marriott Bonvoy gold member plus I booked through the Amex Platinum card\u2019s FHR program, which entitles me to room upgrades, late checkouts and various other benefits. When I checked in, none of that was acknowledged, and I was given the most basic room even though they actually had upgraded rooms available right on Expedia that night. When I told staff about my Marriott Status and told them that I booked through the Amex Platinum\u2019s FHR program, they just said that there weren\u2019t any other upgraded rooms available\u2026. Which was a total lie. My friends who stayed at the Ritz that night had all their benefits printed right out the moment they checked in, and they got exactly what they were entitled to and paid for! I should not be asking for this stuff, it should already be given to me! \n\nI am also entitled to guaranteed 4PM checkout, which they honored\u2026 after I asked for it (normally other hotels automatically do it for you), however\u2026 they sent me a letter in my room the next morning saying that if I check out before 12 instead of 4, I can get 20k Marriott points. Someone who can spend this much money on a hotel does not care about 20k Marriott points. This was rude.\n\nAnd lastly, the \u201csuperior\u201d rooms are just small, dark and have tiny windows. It was quite depressing inside with the plain white walls. At first they put me in the 13th floor, and the room had the view of a brick wall, when I asked for a room with a better view, they put me on the 19th floor in another very plain and bland room with white walls and the view of another brick wall. \n\nI expected better from a hotel that charges $1500 (with tax) per night for their cheapest room. There are better hotels and rooms for this price, I hope this review helps people make better decisions.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

And despite its increasingly rundown nature with every passing year - I did so out of a sense of habit and familiarity. I'd frankly never had (and fortunately never needed to) interact with their staff since I'd basically come back to the hotel to sleep essentially. \n\nMy husband was joining me this particular trip for a celebratory weekend that included US Open finals, etc. and this hotel, and its bafflingly un-trained and just utterly classless staff came so close to ruining it (fortunately my husband had the wisdom to cancel the reservation and move us to Park Hyatt immediately).\n\nThe facts: I'd planned to check-in after we flew in and then go to meetings. 9\/11 security made all flights terribly late and I went straight to work while my husband went to the hotel with our bags. The room was booked on my Corp. rate and the hotel informed him extremely high-handedly (signal 1) that without my business card they will not honor the Corp. rate. (My husband obviously does not carry around my business card) so they told him that until I came around - they'll make him put his CC for the regular rack rate - which he promptly agreed to and signed off on. However, now that these feckless buffoons that the St. Regis NY calls its \"front desk\" had found themselves down the path of their pathetic puffery - they obviously felt the need to impress upon my husband their (non existent) superiority by throwing out phrases like \"Sir, hotel checkins are at 4 p.m. Don't you know?\" (yes, he'd made the heinous error of showing up at 3.45 pm). There was not a single area to sit and wait (their lobby belongs to a motel that rents room by the hour) - and after my husband STOOD uncomfortably on the side of a pillar for 10 minutes one of the attendants grudgingly let him sit in the restaurant area (which they gate off during the day). 4 pm came and went - no signs of a room - and when my husband finally went back to ask around 4.45 since he had a 5pm Zoom (by legal contract, the room should have been made available at 4) - he was talked down to by another unrefined character that offered no apology and added \"You'll get a room when we have one available\". That being the last straw, my husband cancelled the reservation and moved us to the Park Hyatt nearby.\n\nI was incensed when I learned about this ordeal around 7 pm when I finished work and called the hotel. My suspicions of the hotel's egregious incompetence were immediately confirmed when a manager called Zach answered and offered me gems such as \"I'm sorry you felt that way\". Seriously, what bottom barrel school of hospitality has this staff been scraped off of the floor of?! I get that it's impossible to hire good people right now, but if the hotel had any self-respect or regard for reputation, they'd close before subjecting guests to whatever they can hire (and not bother to train). The sad truth is that if you've not been around dignified or classy people before and are suddenly thrust in front of them haplessly, and without appropriate training  - you're deluded into thinking that being a service person at a somewhat elite NY hotel encompasses being (tactlessly) rude and (completely undeservingly) arrogant. Such a travesty - that's where your tips come from, dude.\n\n [I should call out that despite my clearly catty - although 100% accurate - review here, my husband is the most mild-mannered, kind person you'll meet so there's absolutely nothing he could've done to warrant this litany of insults. They behaved this way because they're untrained, fundamentally lack class and dignity about how to treat another human being (forget the fact that his patronage pays your bills!), and because obviously their management lets them get away with it].","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Check-in was an abysmal process with a front desk gentleman who was both disgruntled and aloof.  A manager was no where to be found; on the phone with a \"guest issue.\"  I laughed when the front desk agent gave a room key out to someone without verifying his ID and accused a woman of not being a guest.  He also explained to me and another guest that there are no amenities during this time (e.g. no room service, bar closed early, and that you could go outside to get a drink).  Upon entering the room, the \"butler\" knocked and when asked if we needed anything (water), he told us we already had water in our room.  The shower drained poorly.  The towels had makeup on them from a previous guest.  At least the bed was very comfortable and WiFi fast.  They also did accommodate a late check-out request, but had to laugh again when another bellman was on his phone at the front desk while checking out and didn't offer to help us with bags\/taxi\/directions.  It is a beautiful property and the rooms are very lush, but you're going to get better service at the Hampton Inn a couple blocks away and would strongly recommend you visit the Park Hyatt or Mandarin Oriental nearby or even the Four Seasons down near World Trade.

Not looking for free goodies, but a note or greeting would of been nice.\n- Was told we were \"upgraded\" to a better room, but going from a Grand Luxe to a Deluxe looks pretty equivalent.  As Marriott's website advertises, \"captivating views\" of the exterior were indeed that - staring out a window into the interior well of the building from the 7th floor certainly made the room seem more like a glamorous prison cell than being on top of the world.\n- Advertises extreme cleanliess...except for the cashews on the floor by the bed left from the previous occupant.  \n- Butler service has been reduced to only the suites, as I was informed.  Was able to get shoes shined, but no unpacking or pressing of garments anymore.  Was able to request an iron and ironing board, as they aren't normal room features.\n- No complimentary coffee or tea in the morning, and no fruit platter or snacks to welcome you in the room. Guests can fix themselves coffee or tea in the lobby if they desire.  On the food specifically, explanation was that COVID prevents them from having fruit (or food in general) in the open.  However, if you go to the fitness center, plenty of bananas and oranges sitting out in the open for guests - a bit of a disconnect.  Also, if you would like coffee or tea in the morning in the room, you can pay for it with room service.\n- The Bentley is not available, and won't be until at least the fall (and potentially winter) time frame.  Confirmed this with one of the drivers, the hotel stopped using the car during the pandemic and has not brought it back.  Mercedes is great alternative, but again, feels slightly deceptive to keep advertising that feature when its not available at all.\n\nLet the front desk know at check-out that the stay was underwhelming - could overlook a lot of things, but not everything.  Jonathon at the counter took down my name and number and assured me the manager would want to reach out.  Days later, nothing heard. *shrug*\n\nAll in all, it's a beautiful property and very fancy looking, but in terms of those luxurious touches the St Regis is known for.....  save your money and either go someplace else that has more of those amenities ready for patrons, or just go to a Residence Inn.  This property just doesn't seem ready yet for prime time.

She offered us a very spacious room. Butler Lynn Li (10th floor) introduced the amenities a few minutes after we got into the room and gave us excellent welcome fruit plates and Champagne. She took the extra mile to deliver a lovely turndown service with music. \nThe next day Christina from the front desk works hard to confirm a deluxe suite upgrade, which is impressive. Second room butler Dolores (6th floor) is also very friendly and attentive. She helped us with every request (suite has full butler service), like laundry, coffee\/tea service, amenities requests, and packing. It's hard to describe how outstanding a full butler service takes us, and we feel Dolores tries hard to make our stay better by addressing every detail. Dolores inspired us with her spirit and pride as a member representing St. Regis, and she is a star in hospitality. \nThe rooms and suites are gorgeous, but their service and design are legendary. After trying two different rooms, I feel that everyone in the hotel represents their highest brand standard. We look forward to coming back soon.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The short story is: it\u2019s quite average, and I don\u2019t know why one would stay here over the Mandarin Oriental other than location, especially considering the MO is usually 20-25% cheaper.\n\nAs a Marriott Titanium I was given an upgraded room, but what I would have preferred was a room when I arrived (at about 3.30pm), instead of not having one until 4.45pm (and then had to rush to a 5pm appointment). No one asked which would have been better, and the staff over promised and under delivered on the time it would be ready.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure what the butler service benefit is, and maybe it\u2019s still COVID reduced, but I never met or saw the butler, and when I paged the butler I didn\u2019t receive a call back for quite a while, and so instead just called the front desk for the issue I had (the link to the WSJ they were providing for guests didn\u2019t work). Despite raising the issue\u2014not a huge deal in the grand scheme\u2014I was somewhat surprised that no one went out and just bought a WSJ for me given the reviews I\u2019ve read of this place? But anyhow, they just apologized that they didn\u2019t have a way to provide any access for me.\n\nThe workout room was pretty nice, but again slightly underwhelming for the price of the hotel (one peloton machine that was in use by another guest for a full hour; an odd assortment of weight machines; a reasonable collection of dumb bells but oddly missing some weights, like the 45s).\n\nThe room service breakfast was very good, but I\u2019m glad it was included as an elite benefit, because $140 is quite steep for any breakfast (the EDITION has at least as good, if not better, breakfasts for about half that price by room service).\n\nAt any rate, at half the price, it would be a great hotel. At the price, I can\u2019t see staying here again; the service would have to be dramatically better.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was contacted by both phone and email several days prior to our arrival by the hotel manager (general manager was out on annual holiday leave) and concierge who helped arrange for flowers in our room for my wife's birthday welcome.\n\nI have been fortunate to stay at quite a few very highly rated hotels worldwide, and I am very happy to report that our time at St Regis was perfect in every way. \n\nIt is a grand old hotel and has been very well maintained. Agree it does not have many wide open spaces as another reviewer mentioned, but it is reflective of the era in which it was first built and provides and elegant and intimate effect.\n\nWe were warmly greeted on arrival around 1.30PM. I had planned on just dropping our bags and returning later in the afternoon, but I was very happy to learn our room was already available for check in right then.   \n\nFront desk check in staff was friendly and efficient.  I was greeted at the front desk a few moments into the checkin process by Laurie, who gave us a brief overview of the hotel and facilities, including the restaurant and King Cole bar.  Laurie then escorted us up to our room, which I expect at fine hotels but which does not happen as often these days. \n\nHotel was beautifully decorated for the holidays!\n\nWe were hoping for a suite upgrade per my Bonvoy Titanium status but given that we a.) booked this fairly late in December, and b.) we were staying over New Year's eve- one of the highest demand periods of the year for most any hotel in NYC, I was not surprised we did not get a suite.  We were however upgraded to a Grand Luxe King room and it was absolutely beautiful, and one of the largest non-suite rooms we have ever stayed in for any NYC property (photo posted here in the review). \n\nTo top off the perfect welcome to the property, the staff surprised us with a very nice plate of chocolate strawberries and a extremely generous gift of Perrier Jouet champagne, as well as two hand-written welcome\/happy-birthday cards.\n\nButler service by Tamara (16th floor) was impeccable and we were very glad to have been able to spend a few minutes speaker with her several times over the stay.  She is warm, and wonderful and a real asset to the St Regis.  \n\nWe found room service food to be excellent, especially for a late-night meal.  \n\nBed was incredibly fantastic, and bathroom was very well equipped with TV-in-Mirror, large tub, separate shower, double sinks, separate toilet area, and marble top to bottom.\n\nDoorstaff, and all other staff we encountered were all very friendly and accommodating.  The King Cole bar is much smaller than I expected but I very much liked the intimacy.  We were quite lucky to get a seat after only 5 minutes wait, but every day we did see people waiting much longer, so you should hope for the best but expect a wait.  Auston was very friendly behind the bar and look forward to our next visit to see him there at King Cole. \n\nI would also like to send a special thanks to Melanie in Rooms, Octavia, hotel manager, and Mr. Geray, GM, for following up with me to make sure everything was going well for us at various point in our stay.  I am a long time loyal Marriott patron, with some family ties back to the Marriott's through my grandfather and father, and it is high quality, friendly, and genuine service as we were shown at The St. Regis that will will continue to keep me loyal to the brand. \n\nI very much look forward to our next visit to the St Regis and would highly recommend it as a destination hotel for any special event you may have planned in NYC.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Most hotel employees I interacted were nice. However, I may not want to return for several reasons.\nOne, since we were going to stay in the hotel for a special occasion, I contacted the hotel via email about a week before my stay (the hotel never contacted me before my stay, as some other luxury hotels do to their guests). I sent email to stregisny.res@stregis.com (General) and newyork.concierge@stregis.com (Concierge), two and the only two email addresses listed in the Contact Us section of the hotel\u2019s website. However, the hotel has never replied to me.\n\nTwo, while it\u2019s our first stay in the hotel, I learned from my previous St. Regis stays that the brand was very proud of its \u201cFamily Traditions\u201d program. However, throughout our stay, our little one was never given any treatment from the program, null. I just quickly checked the hotel\u2019s website when writing this review. It says, among others, \u201cFamilies will delight in special welcome amenities and turndown rituals designed to showcase the uniqueness of each hotel or resort\u2019s destination, including delectable treats, child-sized robes, slippers, and a step stool for the little ones.\u201d Very disappointed, particularly given that our stay included the Christmas Day!\n\nThree, the room temperature was set at 72 in our first day, but we were waken feeling cold the next morning. I looked at the thermometer and apparently the temperature was lower than what\u2019s set to. So that evening I raised the temperature. That didn\u2019t improve the temperature at all, unfortunately \u2013 the next morning there was a seven degree difference between the goal and the real room temperature. I got cold because of that, and still have the running nose at this time. The low temperature itself is not a big issue. We should have contacted the hotel maintenance immediately, which might solve the issue. What made me sad was during the check-out, when I showed the agent a photo showing the seven degree difference in my room, all I received was \u201cwe will check it.\u201d No apology was ever offered. \n\nThere was also a billing issue. During the check-in, I was informed that as a Titanium Elite member, I was entitled two complimentary American breakfasts or the equal value for any items. I only needed to pay the extra if my order costed more than the allowance. The benefit also applied to in-room dining. We used breakfast in room in one morning, when I also ordered an additional item, smoky salmon. I was not given any bill when the food was delivered, even I asked. During the check-out, however, my bill included a close-to-$200 in room dining charge. The check-out agent didn\u2019t seem to be professional \u2013he first said I was only entitled to American breakfast, anything else, I had to pay. After talking to his colleague, he finally agreed that that\u2019s a billing error, but didn\u2019t know the amount of the allowance. After talking to his colleague again, finally he was able to deduct the allowance from the bill. The in room dining charge after deducting the allowance was more than $60, which I\u2019m still confused and don\u2019t think it\u2019s right. During the entire process, I was never offered to review the in-room dining charge details. Since there as a line behind me during my check-out, I didn\u2019t insist to ask. But I\u2019m still puzzled and think we might be over-charged.\n\nI heard nice words from my friends about the hotel. That\u2019s why I chose it for a special occasion of our family. But I left the hotel with being sick and a billing puzzle. Very disappointed. Maybe I set my expectation too high. If it were a three-star hotel, it would be a good stay. But it\u2019s not only a St. Regis but the St. Regis New York \u2026","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

What all the other reviewers have been saying was pretty much my experience. Awesome location, outstanding service, very well appointed rooms. I can easily end there really but if interested...will share a few additional thoughts...\n\n-I didn't care for the \"destination charge\" of roughly $100. Sure, you could apply it to food\/bevarage, dry cleaning and I think salon services so very easy to 'get your money back'. But just sort of tasteless in my opinion. \n\n-The hotel is 100+ years old and unfortunately their public spaces are very limited. No grand lobby here. In fact, nowhere really to even sit if you are waiting for someone. Would be awesome if the Astor Court restaurant could be moved somewhere and the existing space turned into a sitting area\/extension of the King Cole Bar.\n\n-The King Cole Bar is an institution. However, I think it needs some refurbishing. The bartender was surprisingly abrupt and as hotel guest I didn't really enjoy having to wait 25 minutes to get in. \n\n-Christmas decorations were disappointing. Not on par with the reputation\/expectations of the St. Regis.\n\n-Champagne sabering was great fun but wish it was slightly more ceremonial.\n\n-Unless I missed it in the basement, very odd there was no little sundry shop.\n\n-Our room was gorgeous\/very comfortable but unfortunately it was interior and both windows looked out onto brick walls.\n\nDespite my unfavorable observations...it was a really enjoyable stay.

Look at nearby Peninsula property instead. Also have heard the Chatwal is appealing as well.\n\nInconsistent\/disappointing service (except for Butler!), unusual room issues and nightly fee even for rewards bookings all don't add up to the usual St. Regis property expectations.\n\nCheck-In: 2.5\/5 - Below Average\n\nRoom: 3\/5 - Average\n\nLocation: 5\/5 - Excellent\n\nService: 2.5\/5 - Below Average\n\nOverall: 3.25\/5 - Slightly Below Average\n\n---\nCheck-in:\nI flew into LGA airport and arrived to the hotel around 3PM in the afternoon. I listed the arrival time in the reservation online as 3PM in hopes that I'd have a room ready before the hotel's usual check-in time of 4PM. When I arrived to the hotel, there wasn't much going on in the lobby, only a few people. I booked the Superior room on the Marriott app using Bonvoy rewards points for 3 nights (12\/23 to 12\/26) -- the redemption was 75K each for 1st and 2nd night, and 85K for 3rd night on Christmas. Before check-in, I noticed that the app showed me in a Grand Luxe room (two-room type upgrade from entry-level Superior room; rewards stays can only be booked into the entry-level Superior room). At check-in, the front desk asked if I have stayed before at the hotel (I have once a few months before this stay), and acknowledged my Ambassador Elite status. I tried applying 3 SNAs (Suite Night Awards), which were denied prior to check-in. The front desk agent acknowledged that my SNAs were denied but didn't give a reason as to why; The Marriott app still showed that 5 different suite types were available for sale at time of check-in. When I asked why my SNAs didn't clear, the front desk agent went into the back office and came back with the offer to upgrade me to one of the available suites (the 5th Avenue suite in particular) for an additional $1,000 per night. I declined this offer because I thought it wasn't a good value for me, considering I was originally trying to use 3 of my 10 Suite Night Awards. After I declined this offer, they said that my room wasn't yet available to check-in and told me to leave my things in the lobby and come back when they'd call me. I left my belongings checked with the front desk and they wrote my name and cell phone number on a little post-it. The front desk agent told me he'd call shortly. After walking around 5th Avenue & the neighboring area for about a hour without a phone call, I decided to walk back to the hotel and try my luck in person. By the time I arrived, a long line of guests going back to the elevator area were queued up to speak with either of the two check-in agents to get to their rooms. They promptly gave me keys and I was on my way to the room.\n\nMy main disappointment with check-in was the fact that my SNAs were denied without a reason, that even as their published top-tier elite I didn't have a room ready, & that I was offered a cash upgrade to a suite that indicated revenue management gamification (withholding upgrades and devaluing the rewards system entirely).\n\nDon't get me wrong - I'm very appreciative of the double-room type upgrade that came with the acknowledgment of my rewards status, but the differentiation presented between my last stay as a Gold (mid-tier) and now as a Ambassador (highest tier) elite member is negligible. \n\n---\nRoom Info:\n\nThe room was very nice and well-appointed - very large, only other luxury room similar to St. Regis room size in NYC is found at the next door Peninsula. Decor was very art deco\/glam\/old school and really liked it; Furniture was functional and very aesthetically pleasing. Most rooms (except designer suites) stick to a mix of bold cold velour\/velvets, mirrors, and gold accents. The rooms also have small control panels (one stationed next to bed and one on the desk) that allow lighting controls and temperature controls, as well as turning on privacy or housekeeping door lights (only lighting worked for me).\n\nThe A\/C unit showed an error on the control panel saying it had a network fault (didn't work with the smart panels), but still could be controlled manually. The A\/C control panel wasn't accurate and was about 3-4 degrees off from actual temperature. Had to set the A\/C fan on HIGH and turn it down to 66 degrees to get to desired temperature of 70. (Temperatures in Fahrenheit) \n\nThe bathroom did have significant wear and tear (see photos) & was unusually compact\/small (smaller than closet). Whenever you'd take a shower, half of the bathroom floor would be flooded and there were always completely sopping towels on the floor due to this. Water pressure is very high\/good, though. Plumbing for the sink had an issue where a high pitch whirring sound would start sporadically. Wallpaper falling off, visible grout\/humidity issues, and such can be seen in photos as well. \n\nThe room had two TVs -- Both rooms have a 40\" (or so) basic HD Samsung TV with the usual Marriott entertainment software. Watched about 20 min of background TV on the living room TV and shut it off after getting annoyed that the audio sounded muffled and the speakers sounding blown out. Not a big deal as not much time was spent in the room (more things to do in NYC than watch TV).\n\nThe room had two phones (one cordless, the other corded) -- the cordless phone's battery was old and needed replacement -- phone call \"shut off\" as I was speaking.\n---\nService:\n\nService didn't seem like a 5-star hotel, more like a normal Marriott. Front desk agents were a bit snobby, and service wasn't detail-oriented by any regard. The property seems to be a bit on the profit-maximizing side of things right now.\n\nThe $50 daily fee, which is applied to both paid and rewards bookings, is strange. You can use the fee amount toward a few different options including local museum tickets or F&B credit.\n\nI used the F&B credit for each night - a ginger ale & one fruit plate, final bill was $50.59. \n\nThe only exception to the less than average service -- the St. Regis butler assigned to my room block, Pavel. Pavel was amazing - I took advantage of the morning tea service twice. Pavel was very friendly and very prompt. His business card also explains that the hotel offers E-Butler service where you can email butlers; Haven't tried it, but seems interesting. \n\nDepends on which Butler you get if they tell you about the complimentary services - but if they don't tell you, you should know that every stay comes with free coffee\/tea service before noon daily, free packing and unpacking services, and free pressing of 2 garments.\n---\nLocation:\n\nExcellent location - right on 5th Avenue. Proximity to shopping, Central Park & Rockefeller is very convenient. \n---\nOther notes:\n- A few days before my stay, I called the front desk to confirm that the Bentley house car would be available during my stay. The front desk confirmed this and let me know it just came back from service (was in the shop) and would be available. Upon arrival, no Bentley. Asked doorman, said if house car was there... and then he told me the Bentley was still in the shop. They advertise the Bentley house car everywhere, and the front desk wasn't informed well. \n- Front desk check-in area seemed very overwhelmed during usual check-in times. Agents were hurried. \n- Christmas\/Holiday decorations in lobby were very nice, had gingerbread house and lights up\/trees above the check-in area. \n- The front desk says tips are included with breakfast benefit at Astor Court; Not true - be sure to tip waitstaff out of pocket. \n- 22% Mandatory Gratuity for in-room dining + $8 mandatory service fee","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel has a great attention to detail both in its design and customer service.  The location of the property was perfect for a visit mainly focused on Christmas attractions.  The room definitely had a luxe feel and was a comfortable place to relax.  I especially appreciated the TV integrated into the bathroom mirror, and the fruit and chocolates left in our room when we checked in.  For Marriott status, I received a one category upgrade from a Superior to a Deluxe room (I was offered a two category upgrade, but I declined due to a floor request).  For the most part, customer service was what I would expect of a 5-star property.  Julissa and Jesenia at the front desk were exceptional and made sure that anything we needed was taken care of, from check-in to check-out.  Prior to my stay, hotel employees were very responsive to inquiries about room requests and activities, and always responded in less than an hour.  The one department that could use some improvement is room service, as there were a handful of issues (an incorrect item, a forgotten item, and a billing issue post check-out).\n\nUnfortunately, the billing issue with room service soured my impression of St. Regis a bit.  On the day I checked out, I received an updated bill from St. Regis later in the evening reflecting a room service charge from that morning not included on the initial bill from check-out.  While I did order room service that morning, the amount charged was about double what I was anticipating.  Furthermore, the remaining portion of my $50 destination fee had not been applied.  I reached out to St. Regis first thing the next morning via email, and later in the day on the phone.  Considering how responsive hotel staff was prior to my stay, the lack of help in resolving the billing issue was disappointing, to say the least.  My email was never answered by an employee of St. Regis, and instead I received an email from a corporate Marriott employee two days later stating a request was \u201cfiled\u201d but not providing any further details. Four days later, I have yet to hear any follow-up.  When I called St. Regis about the issue, the operator just transferred me to an outsourced Corporate office who did not understand the problem.  In the meantime, the bill emailed to me from St. Regis and the bill on my Marriott account are reflecting different amounts.  Of course, my credit card was charged for the more expensive balance (the St. Regis\u2019s emailed bill).  While my destination fee was applied in full to the Marriott copy of the bill, the room service amount is still not correct and it now shows three room service orders, when I only had two.  Needless to say, it\u2019s incredibly frustrating when balances and charges keep changing and no one directly from St. Regis will address the issue.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

My first impression came when we stepped out of our taxi on arrival - the doorman\/bellman opened our car door and greeted us with a big smile. New Yorkers are not known for their easy smiles - this gentleman was welcoming and gracious - I wish I could remember his name. The location is wonderful: 55th Street at Fifth Avenue - an iconic address if there ever was one - world-class shopping - and window-shopping - is right out your door. Our room was big and elegant, with comfortable and sophisticated seating scattered around - with a crystal chandelier to top off the room.

The rooms have lots of lighting options - with button panels everywhere - so one can set a mood with good lighting. The lobby is small and very elegant - The Astor Court restaurant is an elegant spot with wonderful food - and my favorite bar in midtown: The King Cole Bar: warm and elegant. Careful: the cocktail munchie tray will ruin your dinner. Or it could BE your dinner. The Maxfield Parrish Old King Cole mural over the bar is fabulous - I could sit there all day and enjoy a cocktail. I keep using the word elegant - because that's what it is. I am excited to return.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I\u2019ve stayed roughly 140 nights this year in Marriott this year (which is sad), and despite being a Ambassador Elite Marriott member I\u2019ve never been treated this poorly. Took me 30+ minutes to check in, \u201chelping me find an upgrade room.\u201d He then tells me there\u2019s a deluxe room for upgrade, and when I say I will take it, he basically takes it back, saying just kidding and that it is just for 1 night. I said I am happy to take it just for 1 night, and he proceeds to say he prefers not to put me in the room if staying for 1 night. (1) How could he not even be slightly apologetic, and (2) Why would he even bring this up in the first place? At this point, we\u2019ve been standing at the reception for 25 minutes, without them offering us to sit or without any amenities. \nHe then comes out and gives me a normal standard room...no apologies. Just arrogantly says if you are not happy with this stay feel free to cancel and we\u2019ll charge you for the night for late cancellation. WHO SAYS THIS TO A GUEST, let alone an Ambassador??? This guy really do need to learn how to treat people better. I honestly felt so offended I was about to leave for another hotel and pay for the cancellation. \nWhen heading for the elevator, still no word or even slightest sense of apologies for making us wait out to dry. \nAdmittedly I\u2019m staying at a corporate rate where it restricts upgrades, but that said no one should be treated like this, especially if it\u2019s St. Regis that prides itself with service, especially with an Ambassador. \nWould give this 0\/5 stars if there is an option.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

My right knee is injured, so I was not able to carry my luggage up the stairs.  I had to look around for 5 minutes before I walked up to someone that appeared to work there and asked if this was the entrance.  He took my luggage upstairs.   The check-in process was a little confusing at first because I was not sure where to go or who could help.  It was busy and hectic.   One of the ladies at the guest services helped me, sorry I can\u2019t remember her name, she was friendly and helpful.  She did a great job of explaining the amenities the hotel offered, along with my benefits from reserving using Amex FHR. \nI was able to check-in early.  I requested\/asked if my room had a walk-in shower.  She checked and said yes, but the room did not.  It was a shower\/tub combo.  I did not raise a fuss because she mentioned the hotel was full and she was not able to offer me an upgrade (a benefit for Amex FHR).  I reviewed their website and the pictures displayed the shower\/tub combo for the room I chose.   It was an oversite on my part.  I will never give a \u201cSo call\u201d luxury hotel five stars that does not have a sperate shower and tub.  For the price you paid for this room, it is unacceptable not to have a walk-in shower.   It was hard for me to get in and out of the tub, I was afraid I would fall.  Using the handheld showerhead also made a mess and had water on the floor. For this along, I would not stay at this hotel again, unless I had a walk-in shower. \nA few other things to be mindful of, the butler service is ok, but we did not like having to call then wait for the butler to be paged and call me back.   We waited over 30 minutes for ice.   Also, there was an issue with the water backing up in the sink (rm 1829).  If you use one sink the other would back up, it was gross at times.  Most of the staff never spoke to us.  It was only one person after coming back from a basketball game that said have a good night, other then that we were never greeted.  If you reserve using Amex FHR, the bunch is not included as breakfast, we learned an expensive lesson.   \nI will finish with the positives.   The food was amazing in the Astor Court.  The drinks were great in The King Cole\u2019s bar.    It was busy at the bar Saturday around 5:30pm, but the hostess did an awesome job at controlling the crowed and getting us a seat.  We ordered room service and did in-room breakfast, which was great. Again, great food.  The bed, pillows, sheets and comforter were heaven.  We slept like babies, which was great after coming in town from a weeklong business trip in Connecticut.   The water press in the shower\/tub combo was excellent, I really did not like the combo.    The bath amenities, laundry services, gym, shoeshine and turndown services were top notch. \nI love New York and travel here at least 5 times a year for business and pleasure.  The city offers tons of hotels and Luxury hotels.  If you are ok with a shower\/tub combo then you would have a pleasant stay at St. Regis.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

When we arrived, we were told our room was not ready! After waiting 10 minutes, they offered us a suite instead (a very special one I would add), however the prior occupants had smoked in the room and they needed to air it out. We chose not to accept the smoky suite, and was instead given half of our points back via Bonvoy. Checked our bags with the valet and was told they would be transferred to our room prior to our return from the show. When we got back to the hotel at 12 AM, our room was ready, but our bags were not transferred. So now had to wait for them to be brought up (not long but at 12 AM it was frustrating). Room was lovely, except the TV was broken and completely nonfunctional (cable connection broken). REALLY? Honestly they should have comped our whole stay.  Other notes: ample closet space (rare for NYC), nice linens, bathroom, etc in the room. Check-out and Check- in too slow for NYC and had to wait nearly 30 min for the valet to retrieve our car.

We were greeted by our butler shortly after our arrival to the suite and our luggage arrived promptly as well. The suite was large, well maintained and very comfortable. The next morning we went to the Astor Court for breakfast and our server was Cesar. He had been with the St. Regis for many years and was not only an excellent server but very personable as well. The next morning when we went for breakfast and asked to be seated with him, he greeted us by name as we entered the dining room. The food at the Astor Court was very good. The hostess  Elena was very nice and helpful the entire time of our visit. We went to the King Cole Bar after a show one evening and it was packed. The manager was able to find us a couple of seats at a high top which was fine for a drink before retiring for the evening.

On closer inspection the wallpaper was coming away and there were a lot of marks and scrapes on the walls. I think a hotel such as the St Regis should have constant maintenance teams - as it wouldn\u2019t take much to tidy up the room.

I'm calling this year, \"My Year of Points\" ;).  I have friends that stay at the St. Regis in NYC and Aspen several times each year and decided that it would be good to try. \n\nI reserved connecting rooms as I was traveling with my mother and two daughters (tweens).  When we arrived (early) our room wasn't ready and we checked our bags.  My first impression wasn't great .. it's not a beautiful lobby and the greeting was not super friendly.  But we were ready to see the city and so we headed out.  I would like to add that subsequent to our first greeting every person at the hotel was incredibly gracious.\n\nDuring the day I received a notice that we'd been upgraded.  When I arrived at the hotel I inquired about the connecting room and was told that in the upgraded room it wasn't a possibility.  I then requested that they remove the upgrade and just put us back into the original reservation level as connecting rooms were necessary.  At this point they informed me that that wasn't possible immediately and so we went into ONE of our future rooms as the other was \"being cleaned\".  I told the gentleman at the front desk that we were fine and we would simply get the second room when we returned from dinner.  When we got back the room was still not available.  Not going to lie ... we took an 8 a.m. flight and this was 9:30 p.m. and we were ready for bed.  I was already composing my scathing trip advisor review ... when they came out and had the problem solved ... and we were put in a two bedroom suite.  The room was magnificent and \"interior\" is usually bad, but this room was beautiful and SILENT(a rarity in any city).  I wasn't just pleased because things worked out incredibly well, but also because they just did the RIGHT THING.\nEvery service at the hotel was amazing.  We had lunch in Astor Court which wasn't my favorite food but the service was outstanding ... we had drinks one night in the King Cole Bar and it was a lovely experience.

I had planned this stay 3 months prior, as during the stay I was planning on proposing to my girlfriend. \n\nService: When we finally arrived, the hotel was completely full so they weren\u2019t able to upgrade us to a suite, however because of my titanium status and the special occasion, Suehaiti worked to get us moved over to an Astor suite for our last two nights. Further, when I told her of the special occasion, she offered me her card to help coordinate champagne after the proposal. We also interacted with the concierges for dining and tips on things to do, and everyone was extremely helpful, and down to earth - specifically Robert who went above and beyond to take several photos for us and even called ahead to the restaurant to let them know of our special occasion. However, our favorite hotel employee, our butler Tamara, really made our trip special. Tamara worked on the 16th floor, and from our multiple interactions you could tell she was proud of her 22 years at the hotel, which really came across in her service. When I told her I was planning on proposing, she helped me brainstorm a few things, like rose petals on the bed and chocolate covered strawberries with champagne. She was constantly asking if she could do anything to make our stay better, and at the end upon leaving the hotel, it felt like we were saying goodbye to family. \n\nHotel hard product: While I generally would prefer modern decor in a hotel (like the Andaz Tokyo for example) I thought the hotel was very tastefully decorated. Everything was very elegant and felt fresh, without being tacky or gaudy in the least. The room felt like you had been transported back to the early 1900\u2019s, however it had all the modern amenities ( multiple tv\u2019s, Bluetooth Bose radio, tv in the mirrors) one could want. After sleeping in the bed for 5 nights, we are strongly considering purchasing a St. Regis bed and sheet set as they were both so great. The only thing I would change is the room didn\u2019t really have the greatest views, however that\u2019s understandable with the hotel\u2019s location and historic building. \n\nFood: Because of my aforementioned Marriott Titanium status, we were able to order room service breakfast ($140 credit in the room or a $103 credit for breakfast if eaten in the lobby). Everything we ordered was excellent, especially the pastries and freshly squeezed orange juice. We also tried the King Cole Bar, as this is where the Bloody Mary is rumored to have been invented, however this wasn\u2019t our favorite as it was loud and crowded, with drinks that weren\u2019t anything special (especially for the price, a Bloody Mary will set you back $25).\n\nLocation: The hotel had an excellent location, only a few blocks south of Central Park and walking distance to several subway lines and buses. Location wise, we were pretty happy with everything.\n\nOverall, we had an amazing stay at the St. Regis, and if we were to return we would choose this hotel again in a heartbeat.

Special shoutout to our butler Lynn and Javier in Astor Court, who were truly exemplary. Additionally, the concierge and bartenders we interacted with were also great.\n\nWe were provided with a double upgrade to a Deluxe King suite for our stay, which provided ample room. The second bathroom was especially useful for family members to use when getting ready. One of the greatest perks of The St. Regis is its location. The property is close to pretty much everything, and the Bentley service, which we used a few times during our stay, is a nice way to get around.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't hesitate to return to The St. Regis again.

I\u2019m telling her how great the Regis is ahead of time - then we get to our \u201chandi-room\u201d. The design of the room was so poorly setup we barely had room to open our suitcases (room service we ordered had to give us a hand off bc they had no room to set anything down).   We had tiny hall areas to slim windows.  But what ultimately was the kicker - the bathroom.   One small sink with no counter space. The toilet right behind it. And then the amazing 3 foot shower.  Yes you heard that correct- a shower head that was 3 feet high. We had to aim it straight up to try and take a shower...  needless to say - I won\u2019t be back anytime soon. Additionally for those thinking SPG or Marriott status matters - I\u2019m here to tell you it doesn\u2019t. I travel a lot and have great status with SPG... They wouldn\u2019t move rooms for me even when I offered to pay more (and for ~$700 night there are better spots).  All they said was - \u201cmaybe we can move you to a diff room for your last night or two if something opens up\u201d.

From check in to check out, service was flawless, polished and professional yet friendly as well.  We booked through Fine Hotels and Resorts for our first night and used points for our second.  I had assumed we were going to be treated \"less than\" as we were using points, but I was happily incorrect.  As this was a stay cation for us, we checked in exceedingly early.  Our room wasn't ready, but as we ran our errands I received a phone call letting us know when it became available, and that a small upgrade was given to us as well.  Our room was very large for NYC, with a comfy seating area.  The furnishings and fixtures were very well thought out.  As we love to indulge in Room Service, there was ample seating for the room service table, including a folding chair that was exactly the right height for the table.  Well done!\nAs for the Room Service itself, dinner was prepared with high quality ingredients, arrived at the correct temperature and was very tasty.  So much so that we stayed in on our second night as well.  The clay pot curry was yummy and the naan served with it was perfectly grilled.  \nI must also give credit to housekeeping.  Our room was immaculately clean and toiletries were replenished daily.\nBut what really set the hotel over the top was their acknowledgment of my birthday.  They had a special birthday dessert after our tea service and in our room a delicious plate of chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of Pinot Grigio welcomed us the first evening accompanied by a hand written note.  It was extremely thoughtful and more appreciated than I can say.\nOh, and they have a fabulous selection of TV channels.  Thank you for including Bravo in the lineup!\nI only have three negatives and they are minor - 1.  The breakfast from room service was not up to the same standard as dinner.  The juice, coffee and bacon were excellent, but the rest of the meal tasted like it was under a heating lamp for some time.  Also, I asked for no eggs on one of the plates but received eggs on both mornings.  Not the end of the world, except for the fact that I can't stand the smell of eggs and it permeated the rest of the items on the plate.  2.  The Astor Court does not have the old school glamour I remember.  It seems smaller and darker now, which is a shame as the remainder of the hotel is so bright and cheery.  Service though was consistent with the rest of the hotel.  3.  The Windows to our room needed to be cleaned.  Badly.\nOverall however we very much enjoyed our weekend.

We spent the two nights celebrating our anniversary and could not think of a better hotel to have spent it there. The only negative was the service at the King Cole Bar- I found the sole waiter to be rude and uninterested in helping all tables. It was clear from the onset that there were tables that he would wait and attend to at the drop of a hat, and others that required the guest to ask for service.

It was without a doubt, the finest hotel we've ever stayed. The check-in was extremely welcoming, easy and we received a requested upgrade for our stay. The room and BA was large & luxurious. While the shower and door small, the large shower head and water temperature cannot be beat. The butler service was very responsive for absolutely everything, 24 hour service, but when it came to ice, it was always delivered later than we would have liked. We even called ahead one afternoon asking for a delivery of ice to the room and it didn't come for 15 mins after we arrived. I was going to suggest they add ICE to their handy dandy APP where you can request many services without having to call, leave a msg and then get called back. Not a big deal, but we had B'way shows & dinner resys that don't wait, so that stuck in our craw a little. The breakfasts (which were included since we are Titanium Elite Marriott members) was fabulous and especially having it delivered to the room each morning was a real treat. Always on time, hot, fresh. We were able to utilize the Bentley car service just once during our 6 days there which was a real treat! Our chatty driver laughingly complained that the drivers seat of the Bentley must have been built for a Mexican because it was too small for him, hmmm? He also mentioned the Orange One without any provocation. Another hmmm.  ","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"NONE"}

We used points for the entire stay. Here\u2019s some information to let you know what to expect if you decide to stay here:\n\nMarriott Recognition - We received an upgrade to a Deluxe Room on the 15th floor. Although the room was not a suite, it was beautiful with a sitting area and a gorgeous bathroom. We opted for the free breakfast as our welcome gift. This allowed us to order the American Breakfast (two eggs, bacon\/ham, potatoes, toast, coffee and juice) off the menu for two, valued at $43 per person (we were responsible for the tip) in the hotel restaurant.\n\nCustomer Service - The customer service received at this hotel was OUTSTANDING! The bar service at the King Cole Bar was lacking on several of the visits with the exception of Angel, whose experience and attention to detail came through as the top bartender. Everyone was so attentive, accommodating, and kind. Jose was excellent checking us in, concierge services were amazing (they were able to get us reservations at Tiffany\u2019s Blue Box Restaurant), service at breakfast each morning was flawless (thank you Mohammad), and maid service was quick and impeccable. The hotel service we received was some of the best ever!\n\nThe $50 Additional Daily Fee - We found it odd that this fee is added to your daily rate, but enjoyed the amenities that came along with it. We used the $50 non-accumulating daily food and drink credit at the King Cole Bar (which amounted to two drinks). The bar service was spotty, but the beautiful atmosphere made up for it. We used the daily $20 laundry credit, which amounted to one piece of clothing dry cleaned. We also used the two free daily tickets to the Met. Unfortunately, the MOMA is currently closed for renovation through October 2019. \n\nOverall, our experience at the St. Regis was world class. It was one of the best hotel stays we have ever enjoyed in NYC. We highly recommend the hotel and thank you all who made our stay so enjoyable! ","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The TV in the mirror was a nice touch, especially when watching the NBA finals in our room.\nBiggest complaint about the room was the lack of windows.  Only one window, with no real view.  We could see people in the kitchen across the way (3rd floor).\nOn the other hand, our room was very quiet.\nTurn down service was nice, with new slippers every night.  Oh, and there were those yummy chocolates - dark and milk chocolate.  And fresh fruit and bottled water daily.\nWe ate at the restaurant twice, and it was very good, although not inexpensive.\nWe had drinks and sliders in the bar on our final day.  Also quite good.\nWe took the Bentley to the Colbert Show one night.  Very nice.\nWe were able to walk to the corner to see the Puerto Rico Day Parade, which was a lot of fun.

Our server at the bar was rude and front desk staff was not remotely welcoming.  I sustained an injury before our trip and was required to take an epsom soak 3x\/day as per my treatment plan.  When I requested more bath amenities to accommodate, I was left a voicemail saying that I could purchase extra amenities at the front desk.  We had also requested drip coffee instead of french press for our second morning, as the french press on our first morning was so full sediment that we barely drank it.  They would not accommodate that request either and said it would cost extra (even though it's a cheaper item on their IRD menu).  There were several instances like this where we just felt baffled by the service at this property.  It could have been so easy for them to bring the drip coffee, or bath salts without charging extra or making us feel uncomfortable for asking.

My husband is a Marriott Titanium elite, so when travelling with our child choose hotels with lounges for convenience. We literally paid over $30 for our daughter's kraft mac and cheese and a shirly temple. I am fine with paying a premium, but expect a premium product. So maybe homemade mac and cheese or maybe it had carrots as an appetizer to make it fun for her. Also, the house vodka was absolute. Completely horrified when I saw that on bill. I don't mind paying $25 for a martini, but again would expect at least kettle one etc. It wasn't even cold either--so not drinkable. I will say the location was great. Close to everything we went to.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We have stayed at several St. Regis properties in different parts of the world, and always raved about our experience, because to me a stay at St. Regis is typically an experience, not just a hotel stay.\n\nThis weekend we arrived at the hotel at 4pm, just in time for our check-in.  We were greeted by a very robotic young lady, who informed us that unfortunately our room was not ready on time, so we were told to leave our phone number, and we will be called when the room is ready.  We did have dinner reservations that evening, so we wanted to get in to our room asap to get ready, but it was fine for us to go and walk around the city for a while.\n\nWe finally got the call that our room was ready around 5:30pm, so we went back to the hotel with enough time to get ready for dinner.  When we got up to our room, the room was already turned down for the evening, which I found strange, and the view from our room was into a wall, with someone else's window. Again, this was fine.  We were here for 1 night, and barely had enough time to get ready anyway.  What I also found strange is that St. Regis prides itself in the butler service, but the butler did not stop by the room after our checkin to say hello. Also not an issue. \n\nThe rest of the stay was uneventful.  We checked out in the morning, and left.  Nothing special, nothing special about the room, no memorable moments, no memorable interactions with the staff, no memorable service, nothing to remember or cherish about our visit.  What a strange experience for a St. Regis.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Originally. my daughter and I were to stay there on the way back from London for Easter. However, I wound up having to fly to India on business, and made arrangements for my daughter to stay at the Saint Regis without me (note she is a legal adult, I am fairly confident such arrangements cannot be made for minors).  Once I realized the shift in plans would impact her stay, I immediately called the Saint Regis to make the appropriate arrangements. From the first phone call, the staff were extraordinary and helpful.  I spoke with the concierge, front desk, and then shift manager who all understood my desire to have a safe and comfortable experience for my daughter, as she would now be arriving alone. The concierge graciously helped me to arrange a car and driver to pick up my daughter from the exit of customs & immigration at JFK and bring her directly to the hotel; he went to great care to take all of her details and all of the information needed to ensure a seamless experience from airport to hotel. With her safety my number one concern, knowing a trusted hotel car and driver would provide the transportation gave me great peace of mind. The shift manager arranged for a warm welcome, and helped me get the billing straight, leaving my daughter to use her credit card for incidentals only. What we did not know is that she would arrive sick as a dog from a bug she'd caught towards the end of the London leg of the trip.  Checking in with what turned out to be a double ear infection, the Saint Regis staff leapt into action to help her recover quickly.  They sent tea, and arranged special ginger concoctions, and made sure she got swiftly into bed, while we made arrangements for a medical assessment and ensuing issuance of remedies. Throughout all the complexities of a sick youngster alone in a big city, the Saint Regis staff shone. Everyone was so nice and so kind, and very, very helpful.  24 hours laters, after a lot of ginger tea, soup, and now antibiotics, my daughter checked out feeling a world better than when she arrived.  As a parent, it's impossible not to worry about our children, no matter their age.  For my daughter to arrive so ill, and receive such wonderful treatment - all while I was on the subcontinent half a world away - was of tremendous comfort to me.  I really cannot thank the staff enough.  We will be back, and now St. Regis has made us a customer for our future visits to NYC (when hopefully everyone is fit and well!). By the way, the hotel is beautiful, the food excellent, and the rooms very comfortable too.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It lives in a category with only a few competitors and it's worth noting how it distinguishes itself from other properties such as the Peninsula, Mandarin, Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Plaza,etc... All these hotels have high-end rooms, fairly good attention to detail, amenities, location,etc..  So, how is the St Regis unique?\n\nThe rooms are massive  - especially for NYC standards.  And the possibility of an upgrade is likely.  High ceilings, high end electronic accoutrements, luxury bath products, perfect beds\/linens, silent windows are all there.  Suites , if lucky enough, are exceptional.  One distinguished feature is a butler attendant for each floor to address all your needs which is much more efficient and personal than typically seen even at 5 star properties.    The butler quickly provided coffee, pressing, toilet products,etc in an easy manner.  All so smooth.    The fitness room was full of high end equipment and well attended and cleaned continuously on the 19th floor with a view.  The King Cole Bar - is uniquely historic.  To be there is to be romanticized by the classic NY hotel bars of the early, mid 20th century.  Truly a stand out.   The Astor Court lounge for breakfast and lunch was well serviced and delicious.  The setting was  just exquitely luxurious, but never did I feel too out of place or stuffy.  They let you be as you are - on vacation or business, enjoying the food, drink and service.  The only negative is the lack of more seating in the lobby area as compared to the other hotels.  It does have many nooks and side rooms on 2 levels which lend a historic charm , but in a fantastically luxurious, manner.  This no Palm Court, Garden Area, Time Warner mall setting.  It's fits a private, secluded luxurious visit that just happens to sit right off 5th Avenue .  The Park is viewable from higher floor windows and a 4 minute walk.  The staff overall was extremely professional.   The St Regis does not have the busy-ness of a Four Seasons or Mandarin (though it lacks a top-flight destination restaurant (just take the Bentley they drive you around in to 11 Madison,etc...) in the hotel, but that may be a positive to avoid any extra non-residential people coming in and out of the hotel.  \n\nBottom line - the personal nature of the very high end professional service (butler and front desk) and the layout quaintness (though the Peninsula does have a better spa\/pool) makes this a perfect spot for a midtown oasis.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

As with the vast majority of hotels in NYC they tack on a \"destination\" fee, which was once a \"resort\" fee until they understood the ridiculous nature of that term in NYC. In this case its $50, which can be used for many things including your bar bill or food bill. In other words its a price increase, much like a baggage fee and its quite annoying. The $ 50 doesn't even cover the cost of 2 cocktails. i wish they would just give the all in price like foreign hotels and be done with the irritating, hidden prices. By the way try and get a cocktail around 5 PM and you will be hard pressed t o find any room in the bar.\n\nAs mentioned the service is top shelf, the location very central and you will get a good night of sleep.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were given some drink vouchers and made our way to the bar to wait. Once our room was ready, we went upstairs and immediately walked out. It absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke. There was no way we were staying in that room. We went back down and told the front desk. Our luggage was brought back down and then we had to wait for another hour for a different room. The next room was a handicapped room. Not only did we not want to take this room away from someone who would need it, these aren\u2019t exactly easy to be used. The toilets are way too high and the showers are even with the floor which makes the bathroom floor soaking wet. Back downstairs we went. We had to wait another hour for a king room, just so we would be sure to get a room and hope that three times would be the charm.\n\nOur room was very nice, clean, and comfortable. The butler service at the St. Regis is always a nice touch when you need coffee, tea, or pressing services.\n\nOverall, we had a good experience. However, it did not live up to the experience we expected, nor the service I have received at other St. Regis properties internationally.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The stay was for a surprise proposal to my girlfriend and i wanted to book a stay somewhere special. The ST Regis NYC is precisely that.\n\nPros:\n- Location is amazing. Walking distance to some of the most amazing spots in NYC.\n- Staff; the butlers, front staff, bar staff, and concierge services were amazing and make the experience that much better. I let them know I was proposing and they went out of their way to make our stay that much better.\n- Hotel condition; the property is classic and timeless. However, I\u2019ve stayed at many historic properties over the years that were not maintained. None have met the level of upkeep maintained here. The result is classic luxury defined. Even the ice buckets are fancy. No detail goes unnoticed here.\n- Marriott Platinum Recognition: I saved SNAs for the trip, although with the holiday I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d go through. I didn\u2019t receive a suite, but did get the next best option on a high floor with a beautiful room and view of Central Park. Free breakfast perk could be used for room service. The best breakfast experience I\u2019ve ever had at a hotel and provided an amazing value. Probably the best perk I\u2019ve received for being platinum level and makes the loyalty to the program feel worth it!\n- Romantic: all in all. This property is classy, luxury, and romantic. Perfect for special occasions. \n\nConcerns:\n- Pricing. The upper level for both cash and points rates. The experience justified the high cost IMO. But, be prepared going into to it. Expect $25 cocktails at the bar. $45 breakfasts etc.\n- Daily credit: they gave you a lot for the $50 fee. However, the confusion resulted in three different folios when trying to check out. Be sure to double check prior to checking out, because it\u2019s just confusing. Especially if you have multiple charges for laundry, bar, restaurant, and salon daily.\n- Some staff: the vast majority of staff define five star service. Professionalism defined. However, two were just plain rude and I don\u2019t really know why. The door staff and the hostess at the restaurant. New York I guess. But, still. They were thankfully the exception though to wonderful service that the St Regis is known for.\n- Updates needed: the bed was not five star level. I don\u2019t know if we had a bad mattress or what. But, the bed was sort of hard. No topper to provide a \u201ccloud\u201d like five star bed. Disappointing. We probably could of asked for a topper and it been provided. But, I didn\u2019t think of it while there. Some technology could be introduced to the property without losing the historic luxury aspect. Why no remotes for lighting and window drapes? Why aren\u2019t the luxurious towels heated if not the floor?\n- Never asked but also never saw the courtesy car. \n\nAll in all, the property is amazing. It provided a one of a kind experience for a very special occasion and one of the best hotel stays I\u2019ve ever had. The high cost is justified and worth it for special occasions due to the location, staff, upkeep, and luxury aspects it provides. While small improvements could be made, it is without a doubt a five star hotel and don\u2019t hesitate to book. Recommend using the daily fee credit for pressing services as soon as you get there, grabbing a Red Snapper Bloody Mary in the bar, and room service breakfast! If you\u2019re reading this review, you might be wondering if the hotel is worth it. It is! Do yourself a favor and go check it out.\n","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I appreciated them securing our luggage for our early arrival before our room was ready and after our check-out when we wanted to use our destination charge at the hotel restaurant (Astor Court - extremely overpriced). However, there were a few problems that should not have occurred at such an expensive hotel. We had requested early check-in (elite platinum member status) and not only were we not checked in early, our room was not ready for nearly 4 hours past the normal check-in time. Therefore, we only had about an hour before we had to leave for our dinner and show. We told our butler (everyone who stays at the St. Regis has a butler) that we needed a shirt ironed beforehand (complimentary service). Well, we tried paging her when we needed to leave for our plans and received no response. The shirt was not returned in time and we had to leave without it. There was never an apology for the late check-in or the late return of the shirt. To add to this disappointment, we received a letter at our door in the morning. At first glance, I thought they were offering us 12,000 points to compensate for the inconveniences. Instead, they were asking if we would check out at noon (instead of the 4pm late check-out guaranteed to platinum elite members) in exchange for 12,000 points. We were staying at the hotel for a special occasion and already lost at least 4 hours of enjoying it on the day we checked in. We were not about to cut our vacation any shorter. \n\nSummary: It is a beautiful hotel, but I was very disappointed by the way it treats platinum elite members - I can't imagine how other guests are treated!

I had high hopes since we were celebrating my wife's birthday and the St. Regis fell short in ever aspect. \n\n2 days prior to our stay I received an email that my SNA cleared and that's when the problems started. After receiving the email, I went into my Marriott account to attempt to see what room upgrade was granted and my reservation no longer existed. I called Marriott support and they couldn't find my reservation either. They called the St. Regis and the hotel confirmed my reservation was still on file and my SNA did clear for a Grand Suite which was an excellent surprise and would help make our celebration truly special. If only it were true.\n\nOn the day of arrival, I used the chat feature in the Marriott app to ask if\/when my room would be ready and they indicated that it would not be ready before 4pm. A little disappointing, but not surprising. Upon arriving at the hotel to check-in at 3:45 that is when the true St. Regis experience began. Check-in was chaotic and slow. The receptionist seemed irritated that I was trying to check-in, spent about 5 minutes at her computer and back in the managers office before telling me the room would not be available for a while. I asked her to confirm it was a Grand Suite which she found incredulous. She went back into the manager's office another 5 minutes or so, came out and told me almost all of their guests are platinum and have already checked-in so no upgrade was available. I explained to her that this was a SNA upgrade that had already cleared and showed her the email. She took my phone back to the managers office for another 5 minutes or so and eventually the manager came out and told me it was a system glitch and no, I would not be getting any upgrade. Very disappointed, I asked them to do what they could. We would have to wait another 30 minutes or so before the room was ready, but we could wait in the lounge. We proceeded to the King Cole Lounge which had a line out the door and a 30-45 minute wait to get in. We went to the Astor Court and received the same, nothing available. We were able to find a couple of seats in the common area and got drinks which were \"comped\" even though we had $50 in F&B credit so I don't know why they seemed they were doing us a favor comping us our drinks. At 4:45 our room was ready so we went up to quickly change before heading out for our evening plans. The room had a half eaten fruit plate and half empty soda bottle in the refrigerator, a large mold stain on the carpet, and long strands of hair in various spots in the bathroom. Clearly it was a rush job to get the room cleaned. I was somewhat disgusted, but still trying to celebrate my wife's birthday and have a good time. We went out and had a wonderful evening in NY and returned back tot he hotel late that evening. \n\nIn the morning, we were meeting friends for breakfast who didn't want to spend $100 for a simple breakfast at our hotel so we ate elsewhere so I can't speak to any kind of breakfast at the hotel, free or otherwise. I received my folio the day I checked out and everything seemed in order. The next day I received an updated folio with over $124 in honor bar charges which I'm still trying to get corrected. \n\nOverall, other than my entire experience with the St. Regis, we had a great time celebrating my wife's birthday in NY. I plan on never returning to the St. Regis, though. Their service was subpar, even for a standard hotel. The condition of the room was poor.

St. Regis should be ashamed to have this kind of people working of them. Working at a legendary place at this should bring absolute pride and joy, which clearly doesn\u2019t show through the actions of these butlers. I mean, how hard is it to check on a laundry?

It remained this way until we left on Sunday.  \nThe check in desk is tiny - only two people working. The woman was working hard, but the other person at the desk would disappear for at least five minutes in between helping guests (the check-in line was ~5 people long at 1:30 in the afternoon).

Our butler never stopped by our room to introduce herself, we met her the next day when we called for an iron (which was a frustrating experience - call the butler, then wait for them to call you back, then wait for the iron). \nDue to the lines at the bar being so long, we ended up using our $50 \"credit\" (not really a credit, since they charge you for it) to order drinks from room service. There are no wines by the glass listed in the room service menu and the waiter didn't bring a bill with our drinks, so we had literally no idea how much we had spent.\nThe room was really large, which was nice, but instead of taking that space to install a functional dresser, for example, the St Regis settled for putting a tiny dresser in the closet, which then meant that you couldn't hang anything long, as it would hit the top of the dresser (the rest of the closet was jammed with folded up chairs). \nThe bathroom was what I would expect from a St. Regis (I'm sure it was once the height of luxury, but now it just looks dated to me), which was fine - except that the outlets in the bathroom were extremely loose. The coverings were hanging off the wall and the outlet itself moved dramatically every time I plugged in my hair dryer.\nThe bed and the blanket on the bed were a highlight - it was really like sleeping in a cloud! Despite that, i wouldn't return. There are way better places to stay in NYC.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":93614,"title":"Rewards stay - underwhelming","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-12-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"As we were passing through New York for one night before embarking QM2 for a transatlantic crossing we decided redeem our Marriott Rewards points for a \"special\" stay at the St Regis. We arrived at 11.30 AM and, as it was a busy weekend (Veterans Day), our room was not ready. This was fine as were were booked for lunch elsewhere. The check-in associate told us that she would ring us before 2PM to let us know that our room was ready.  By 2.30 PM we had received no call so we went back to the hotel and were told that our room was still not ready. Other people were arriving and being allocated rooms immediately and being escorted to their rooms. Shortly after, however, we were given our room number and told that we had been allocated an upgraded room on the same higher floor as the gym. Having the room number we were able to visit the King Cole Bar to have a drink whilst waiting. After a 20 minute wait we finally obtained a very small table in a corner underneath a very cold air conditioning unit (the temperature outside was 36F so luckily we had our cold weather clothing - the experience was rather like being in an ice bar. The cocktails were just OK, nothing wonderful. Eventually (at 3.50) we received a phone call to let us know that our room was ready. Again other people were being checked in and being escorted to their rooms but we were just handed our key (to a completely different room to that which we had been allocated earlier) and directed to the lift. The room turned out to be on a much lower floor and looked into a internal well, so no view. From the pictures on the website it appears that the room we were allocated was just a standard room, so no upgrade for a Platinum Premier guest, despite the site showing availability of a number of better rooms. After a few minutes a porter arrived with our cases and quickly left - this may or may not have been the \"butler\" but since we never saw or heard from him again we were left wondering whether the \"butler service\" is not offered to guests staying on points. \nThe next morning we went down to breakfast, luckily we were quickly allocated to a table and the waiter informed us that as a platinum guest we could have the \"American Breakfast\" as our amenity or another item from the menu up to the same dollar value. We decided on our two items (scrambled egg and eggs Benedict), were given orange juice and, as I have  caffeine allergy, I ordered peppermint tea instead of the coffee. The food was fine but the tea lacked any peppermint taste (it tasted exactly like green tea). I called the waiter who summoned another waiter who lifted the pot lid and sniffed the tea (yes he really did that) and declared that it was peppermint tea. As someone who has drunk peppermint tea every day for more than 30 years (and even blends his own) I know that this was not what it was being presented as, but at St Regis NY it appears the customer is always wrong.\nWe checked out at 11AM and were surprised to discover that our supposedly complimentary breakfast actually cost us over $30 (plus taxes etc) - the orange juice and (non) peppermint tea were apparently \"extras\". Also included was a $57 \"destination charge\", which I expected because of reviews on Trip Advisor - but which was not mentioned anywhere on either my booking document or my confirmation document.\nAfter checking out we received the only piece of truly first class service that we experienced during our stay. As it was Veterans Day and there were numerous road closures, the road outside the hotel was gridlocked and there were no taxis available. We had a lot of luggage but the doormen very kindly walked us to the end of the block (more than 150 yards) and secured a taxi for us. \nOverall, we found our stay at St Regis NY to be very underwhelming, our expectations were far higher than the experience. In the past 12 months we have spent in excess of 100 nights in Starwood properties, including numerous stays at Luxury Collection properties - all of these stays delivered, or exceeded,  our expectations. It may well be that, because we were staying on points rather than cash, our expectations were too high at St Regis - but if this is the case then the hotel should publicise that this is the case so that such guests will not be disappointed.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

However, they said they could only provide one at an extra cost, so we would need to pay someone from the hotel to purchase one for us. This is quite ridiculous, considering it is after all The St Regis where you pay either over 1000$ a night or the maximum awarded points charged in any Marriott\/Starwood hotel.\n\nThe hotel room was very well appointed and they provided nice daily fruit, chocolates and waters. \nI would like to leave a commendation to our butlers Dolores, Pawel and Alex. They are great and they provided exceptional and sincere service throughout our stay. \n\nNo upgrade and\/or late check out was available even for Gold members. I understand this is subject to availability but if you decline a late check out request because you are at 100% at least block the same room types you are selling on the website. This way your guests don\u2019t see that you are selling rooms for the same day and that the hotel is not expecting to be full.\n\nBecause of the daily 50$ plus tax destination fee we used a few times the dining facilities to eat. The service at the bar was disappointing twice; the waiter didn\u2019t ask us for drinks nor did he bring bread to the table. The third time, we were served by Tharek (apologies if it\u2019s not spelled correctly) and he made us realise that the service could actually be very good. He proactively brought water and bread and was always very attentive. Last meal we had in the restaurant was also very good (waiter called Cesario?). This of course should be the standard service for this type of hotel and restaurants where everything is overpriced - but you shouldn\u2019t need to be lucky with your waiter. I would therefore not recommend this restaurant or bar for the amount you would pay. Staff is generally not attentive and not sincere and there is much better value in Michelin Starred restaurants nearby.\n\nWe ordered room service once and ordered a lobster roll that was priced at 32$, plus tax, plus 8$ tray charge and 22% gratuity that was \u201cadded to my convenience\u201d making the total 50.59$. The roll was ok and came with frozen French fries. Worth 50$? Even 32$? Unfortunately not to me. \n\nAfter 5nights staying in the hotel, we received the bill where it states that we have to pay the 50$ plus tax which is 57.38$ making the tax 14.75% which seems to be the % for hotel occupancy tax. How come then we pay accommodation tax on things that we already paid tax (8.875%) such Food and Beverage, Laundry and hair salon. To add to that, shouldn\u2019t internet be tax free as per the Internet Tax Freedom Act? Makes me wonder for what the money collected is actually used.\n\nFor the price you pay, I wouldn\u2019t recommend staying or dining in this hotel. The product is good ( and location is as good as it gets) but they are here solely for the purpose of making money and not to provide a proper five star service. \n\n","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Really couldn\u2019t get much more convenient to everything NY including 5th avenue shopping, Times Square, the Theatre District, Rockefeller Center and more.\n\nWhen we arrived (early), our room wasn\u2019t available yet but the check in desk offered to call us when it became open.  When that time came, we were pleasantly informed we were upgraded to a suite.  So nice, after our last hotel left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe room is very generous, even by \u201csuite\u201d standards.  The design and furnishings are beautiful and functional (more important to me even).  There are numerous power outlets and even USB ports in many locations\n\nThe bathroom, with both a large stand-up shower as well as a tub, has two sinks and plenty of space.\n\nModern lighting systems are a pet peeve of mine, but the switches in the room were intuitive and even though they are electronic and not a traditional switch, were easy to understand and operate.\n\nThe king size bed was very comfortable and featured high quality linens.\n\nThe room came with a nice fruit bowl, with grapes, oranges, bananas, and several kinds of apples.  A very nice touch.  Also, for those of us less health-conscious, was a bowl filled with dark and milk chocolate squares.\n\nNoise could not be heard from the hallway but some traffic sounds did get in (we were on the 7th floor), but nothing that caused an undue disturbance.\n\nService, as you\u2019d expect, was exceptional with prompt and courteous service from staff at the front desk, concierge, and \u201cbutler\u201d.  Only on one occasion did we have some issue contacting the buyer for coffee in the morning but was eventually resolved.\n\nBreakfast (room service) was nice and efficient and lunch at the \u201cAstor Court\u201d (reviewed separately) was very nice, with excellent food for a reasonable (by NY hotel standards) price.\n\nOne gripe I do have is the appearance of a \u201cresort fee\u201d (they call it something else), at the St Regis.  Coming to a whopping $50 per day, it included $50 per day of F&B (not accumulative), laundry credit, local and even international telephone calls, and some other benefits.  If you would normally use these services, it may not be a bad deal, but if you don\u2019t then it\u2019s just another cost.  Personally, I hate these charges.  Put it in the cost of the room and don\u2019t hide it in non-optional programs.  Despite our great stay, I will add this to the cost with no consideration of the benefits, when considering hotels for my stay next month.\n\nResort fees aside however, our stay at the St Regis was wonderful and real example of what a luxury hotel stay should be.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is one of the most expensive hotels in NYC, but I can't say there was anything that could justify its price. The butler service was nice, but not necessary. We expected the hotel entrance to be staffed at all times, especially at this price, but most of the time, we had to turn the doors ourselves. Not a big deal, but we certainly thought it would be staffed at all times. The other issue we had was with room service. We ordered the Fifth Avenue breakfast and according to the menu, it was supposed to have come with mixed berries, but there was no fruit on the plate. Any other hotel, this would not have been a big deal, but truly shocking for a hotel of this class to miss something like that. \n\nAgain, nothing at this hotel was bad, but for this price point and being a St. Regis, we expected more.

We actually live close by in CT, but like to do \"staycations\" in New York as a couple or with our young kids. The St. Regis is great for both given the excellent location and better than average service and room size. Yes, everything in the hotel is priced at a premium ($15 orange juice for breakfast, $25 cocktails at the bar), but this place is an institution and oozes New York elegance and grandeur. If that's what you are looking for, then look no further.\n\nOne criticism I've noticed over the last few stays is that all the rooms have a faint smell of cigarette smoke. Last year it was so bad we asked to move rooms. I understand there are a lot of international travelers that stay in the hotel, but it seems pervasive throughout. Maybe something with the ventilation system or that there really are that many international travelers who smoke? Also the mattresses seem to be getting a bit worn in. Time for replacements.\n\nOverall, another great stay. Hope to be back next year.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Okay, that's on us. But the front desk staff could not have been ruder in handling it. The first story was \"we are sold out, but let me see what we can do and we will contact you.\" This was 5 pm. No one ever got back to me so I called the front desk at 3 am. Why 3 am? Because I couldn't sleep due to the fact that I was sold a bill of goods at check-in. \"Oh sir we have upgraded you to a better room but it has two beds instead of a king.\" Little did I know the two beds were so small I couldn't sleep in one of them. If they offer you an upgrade make sure it truly is such. Also, the room I was given was connected to a suite and I could hear the casual conversation and the phone ringing next door. When I called the front desk at 3 am asking about the status of the second night, I was told in effect no way we are going to have a room for you and we don't have a clue why the front desk indicated anything but that when you checked in. No offer to help me find an alternative hotel.  Five minutes later they called back and said oh we can get you a room at the Ritz Carlton at $1,300 a night. Gee, thanks for your help. I could do that myself.  I realize the error in the reservation was on my side but a first class hotel should try and help their customers not tell them to go pound sand. At 6:30 am I decided to skip the $41 continental breakfast and go out to a local coffee shop. As I was walking down the hall a housekeeper wanted to know if I was checking out so she could turn the room. No, it's 6:30 am let me at least get a bit of a return on my super expensive, super not okay room. I hit the front desk and asked for a one hour delay to check out (I'm Marriott Gold). That was granted but when I came back to my room at 10 am housekeeping was in the room turning it over, despite the fact I had the privacy light on. The housekeeper was snippy when I asked her to leave. It seemed like the entire game was \"get you in and get you out\". Forget customer service. Never again will I stay at this so-called luxury hotel.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Our room (#538) at $1178 a night (plus $228.54 in taxes and fees PER night), overlooked a wall and electrical cords  that were hanging loosely on a metal grill that covered our windows.   We stay in NYC often and I understand the views can sometimes be bright and exciting and sometimes not as much.  There were no FHR upgrades available BUT I would have hoped that they would have have moved us (even within the room category) but to a room with a better or more open view?\n\nWe arrived @ midnight and like many places the menu is limited after midnight and we were appreciative that the kitchen prepared us a steak at that time (even though it went off the menu an hour earlier). The steak we ordered had no seasoning on it (not even salt or pepper... nothing), it was overcooked (beyond well done despite a medium request) and was almost inedible.   Breakfast was standard but they forgot things that they to return to retrieve.\n\nThe building, lobby and common areas are lovely (and historic),  the location is fabulous and the staff also was wonderful but, we won't be returning.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93614,"title":"Outstanding Hotel Service, Atrocious F&B Service","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-09-20","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We recently spent a Saturday night at the St Regis; this was our first experience with the hotel and also the first with the brand (we usually favor Ritz Carlton's). We were met by a friendly valet and were sent to the lobby to check in.  We were provided with an upgrade to a larger room (not a suite - we are Platinum Elite) and also a certificate for dessert in Astor Court as we were celebrating a milestone anniversary.  The concierge were phenomenal, providing many suggestions with a friendly smile and had no problem printing our theater tickets. \n\nAs we made our way upstairs, a butler met us at the door to our room and offered to unpack our suitcases (we declined). He also offered to take any items that we might need for pressing.  The St Regis has a $50 daily destination fee that includes: $50 F&B credit, $50 Laundry credit, $25 salon credit and 2 tickets to either MOMA or the Met (which are wonderful for out of state residents).  That was our one and only interaction with our Butler, but he was quite lovely.  \n\nOur room was BEAUTIFUL. Traditional, yet updated. It still held the grandeur of an old, gorgeous NY building, while bringing modern creature comforts. Our room was large by NYC standards and very clean.  The shower, although clean, was tiny (Clark Kent couldn't have changed in this telephone booth).\n\nIf not for F&B, I would have given this hotel a glowing 5* review.  But the St Regis falls down in EVERY aspect of F&B.  We returned from a show on Saturday night with the intention of having a lovely nightcap in the King Cole Bar.  There was an available table that hadn't been turned over yet they sat us there and simply removed the old glasses (didn't wipe down the visibly soiled table).  They threw menus at us and returned to take our order.  I did not care for the drink that I had ordered (it was awful) and asked for them to add simple syrup to help combat the bitterness. They complied but didn't ever return to see how the drink was (better, but still not drinkable). We were never offered water and a waiter did not return until he came with the bill - including my drink, that sat there, untouched.  We paid in full, realizing that they weren't going to fix the issue.  I did ask to speak with the manager - he blew me off, not offering to do anything to rectify the situation or offer any type of service recovery.  \n\nThe next morning we went back down to Astor Court for breakfast.  We \"lucked out\" and got a table before a rush of people arrived. Those same people were still waiting for a table 90 minutes later when we finally finished breakfast.  Our waiter came by initially and offered coffee, tea, juice, etc and took our order.  50 minutes later, we received our breakfasts (eggs and pancakes - not souffle). Not once did the waiter come by to refresh coffee, juice or offer any suggestions as to why breakfast was taking so long.  While the food was delicious, the service and timing were simply awful. \n\nFinally, we returned to Astor Court later that afternoon to order desserts to go.  There were three people in the restaurant.  After waiting for 31 minutes, the hostess asked if we had ordered something.  A moment later, our cheesecakes arrived.  Meanwhile, the same F&B manager who I had spoken with the evening before, stood there the entire time, knowing that a to go order of a prepared dessert was taking much too long.  \n\nF&B is a significant part of any hotel business.  The St Regis does NOT have this part down.  I am so disappointed as I truly believe that this could be our new go to in Manhattan as the hotel service truly is impeccable.  When management sees the issues and overlooks them, and frankly rudely dismisses their guests, then I begin to wonder about the culture of the leadership. Fortunately, I know that my choices in Manhattan are endless and that I don't have to settle for \"good enough.\"","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As such we seek out hotels, restaurants, and activities which enrich the visit rather than simply offering the same old thing in just another town.\n\nThe history in this hotel is well preserved however the management has not simply rested on their storied past and continue to push forward to remain updated while maintaining the old world charm and of course offering excellent service.\n\nThe hotel is set just two blocks from Central Park tucked into the vibrant city core of our nations largest city.\n\nThe hotel itself has its beginnings set in 1901 and may have been one of the first \u201czoning battles\u201d New York is now famous for. The original 18-story French Beaux-Arts style hotel, sat directly across from several prominent homes on 5th Avenue and was the tallest project of it\u2019s time. \u2028\nImmediately upon arrival we were greeted by quick acting classically uniformed doorman and bellmen who efficiently dealt with our arrival. The hotel exterior is beautiful rising gracefully from the street offering a historical ornament to this community.\n\nThe lobby transitions seamlessly from entry, to reception, with an intimate setting and a beautiful corridor connecting to the Astor Court restaurant with their old King Cole cocktail lounge hovering behind this area.\n\nCombined these bring back a time when lobbies were for entertaining, conducting business and socializing, rather than the modern plan where they have been reduced to just a way to enter and leave the property. From the time you enter the hotel you feel welcomed and in a world a bit nicer than the outside.\n\nCheck in was efficient and personal as one would expect. As we had arrived mid morning we knew it would be several hours before our room was available. The desk arranged storage of our luggage, taking our number to ring us when the room was prepared.\n\nThis freed us up to explore the city, enjoy lunch with friends and gain another day of experiences. As expected we received a call inviting us to our room where upon arrival we were greeted by the Butler who was both prompt and professional. Our closet was already arranged for the large number of extra hangers we needed, extra robes, while the butler brought us fresh fruit and offered their services 24 hrs a day. Each morning they brought us coffee and the paper, took out our sundry and arranged to keep my shoes shined. \u2028\nWe were upgraded to a beautiful 1 bedroom suite that fit our needs, giving us the space to live during our week long stay. The bathroom was well laid out and tastefully complemented the room. Our shower offered great water pressure while the tub was plenty large enough for two to soak.\n\nLocated on the 19th floor we had large windows looking out with nice city views.\n\nThe bed as expected was very comfortable, the linens crisp and we had plenty of space in the living room for relaxing with morning coffee and some light work. The living room was well appointed with two comfortable chairs and a couch.\n\u2028The HVAC was very well balanced keeping our room at the requested temperature day and night overcoming an issue many historical hotels struggle with. Another exemplary feature was the complete absence of street noise which is much appreciated by travelers such as ourselves who wish to be immersed by location in the city experience while still having our refuge in private.\n\u2028This trip was for several days giving us a great opportunity to experience housekeeping. Upon arrival the room was perfectly clean, missing nothing and each item was placed with obvious care as to how it would be received by the guest. Our daily service was excellent with the requested four extra bath towels each day. Turn down service was seamless as well. Overall not a single issue was missed during our stay by the butlers or housekeeping.\n\u2028We were especially pleased the staff observed our do not disturb request allowing us to sleep in late each day. This easy to coordinate touch, much appreciated by travelers, is often overlooked but not here. Great job.\n\u2028The hotel is located in the core of 5th Avenue. Convenient for shopping, dining, and of course recreational activities. While we did not use them the hotel offers on site conference facilities for meetings and a great gym.\n\nJust steps from Central Park and easy distances to literally everything we did. We did take advantage of the car service with the Hotels Bentley once.\n\nFrom the moment we entered the property we felt welcomed. The Valet and doormen were efficient, the desk cordial, and the butler service spot on.\n\nThe front desk as mentioned was efficient and courteous both to be expected. However they exceeded this greeting us with familiarity, expediting us through this business side of the stay. The efforts of the entire desk staff made us feel as if we were family or at least repeat guests even though this was in fact our first visit, but hopefully not our last.\n\u2028Internet worked well and as always was free for us as SPG Platinum members. For travelers that are not Platinum the charges would be on a per day basis.\n\nThe Bar and restaurant are both run by the hotel and served our needs well. We enjoyed a lite lunch in the Astor Court and some drinks at the old King Cole bar.\n\nKudos are in order for this fine property. I expected top notch service, rooms, and an escape from the hustle and bustle of Life.\n\nThe St Regis New York delivered this and much more with the excellent staff adding so much to this trip. Thanks from us to the management for their efforts to recruit and train staff that is genuinely interested in customer service. As mentioned earlier but worth repeating the entire staff made us feel as if we were long term or at least repeat guests, their personal attention was exemplary.\n\nIt's our hope that when we next visit New York we will be able to stay here. With so many stops worldwide each offering unique experiences to sample its not always easy for us to return but this property has made it worth the effort.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Since our arrival was late (around 10:45pm) I assumed there would be a bare-bones staff there to greet us. I was happily proved wrong when we were greeted by the doorman, bellhop, check-in staff and butler--each more kind and welcoming than the last. We booked the basic \"Superior\" guest room but were informed upon check-in that we had been upgraded to a \"Grand Luxe\" room. I personally couldn't tell the difference based on pictures from the website (maybe our room was slightly larger?) but I did appreciate the gesture. \n\nThe room was absolutely gorgeous, although I felt the mattress and pillows left a little to be desired for my taste. Our room was on the 12th floor, with a decent view and absolutely no noise from the street below. The butler was amazing, and brought us coffee each morning and handled the pressing of our garments before our show on Saturday. \n\nSaturday evening we had drinks in the King Cole Bar. The prices were outrageous, which I had expected. But what I did not expect was the terrible service we received from our waiter. If I'm paying $18 for a Tito's and soda water, I expect to at least be greeted warmly and not have to flag the waiter down every hour to ask for another round.\n\nWe were able to utilize the Bentley service, which was fabulous and very convenient.  We were also gifted 2 complimentary desserts in honor of our anniversary weekend. We choose to order those to-go and eat them in our room. Really delicious and a very nice gesture on the part of the St. Regis to offer us that. We also requested and received a 4 p.m. check out on Sunday, which really allowed us to enjoy the city and the hotel for a few more hours!\n\nOverall, we had an incredible stay, mainly due to the staff at the St. Regis.

The location is classic midtown.  The decor is classic and in good condition.  I particularly liked that the heating system didn't blow on us in the night - it's a good system that is quiet and comfortable.  Bathroom was very spacious - separate shower and tub and independent toilet as well as a seated vanity and a separate double sink.  Closet and dresser were about average for hotels I guess but they did bring us lots of extra hangars.  Overall we were very comfortable in the room and happy with our last minute choice.\n\nWe stayed here because my husband had back surgery - no one in the hotel seemed to notice or pay us much attention, even after the surgery when he needed a cane to get up and down the entrance stairs.  So don't expect any personal service touches unless you ask for them.  We didn't use the concierge.  The restaurant is offensively expensive and not worth its price tags - there are so many other choices nearby I guess they price it this way so that only the excessively lazy or unaware billionaires will sit down to eat.  This is true at all hours of the day.  But like I said, my husband had had surgery so we actually HAD to eat there a few times - the breakfast salad bowl was tasty, other than that, the rest was unmemorable.  We did spot a very famous celebrity having coffee there one morning which was strange.\n\nOne annoyance about this hotel is that the elevators are small and not sufficient for the number of floors - there is not much the hotel can do about this - it's an old hotel that wasn't designed for today's travelers.  If you are a super impatient person and you aren't aiming for a view you might want to request a lower floor and take the stairs because depending on time of day the elevator situation can be annoying.\n\nOverall I would not pay the outrageous cash prices they charge to stay here - there are other places in ny where your money will go farther but I didn't mind using my Starwood points one bit.  In most respects we were very satisfied.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had read some great reviews and we are looking for a new go-to hotel in New York that is always reliable good. After reading the NYT's article on the butler service we hoped this could be the one.\nFirstly, everyone was exceptionally friendly, all the staff were fabulous. It was mainly the room and the corporate,' don't color outside the lines' operation of the hotel that disappointed. We were greeted on our floor by the butler who was very nice but in a great hurry. When we realised our room was beside the lift, we asked if there was another room available as they are always the noisiest rooms. He rang reception but handed it to me and told me its on hold. I was told they was no other room available. I had to call after the butler and ask if its possible to get a cup of tea. No offer of unpacking etc was offered. The room was fine, quite dark and a bit cluttered. The small windows made it feel slight claustrophobic. Next morning we had complimentary breakfast and this is were we decided the hotel was not for us. I ordered coffee, oj, fruit and toast for 2. The gentleman told me I'd have to pay the difference as that came to $165!! When I suggested that the American breakfast which came with all those things except the fruit but had eggs, bacon, potatoes etc was only $41, he said we had ordered al a carte so it was more expensive. So I said I'd have the American breakfast, he asked how would you like your eggs, i said none thank you. He said well thats not and American breakfast then! At this stage my husband was making signs to bail and I would have but the gentleman was wonderful (he was very polite and gracious with my incredulousness) and really wanted to help.

We take a train from upstate NY down to NYC a couple times a year. This was our first time at the St Regis. We typically stay at the Westin in Times Square however it was our anniversary and we felt something special would be nice. We had requested a early check in of around 1PM. Sadly that could not be honored, they did however immediately give us a $50 credit at the King Cole Bar. Which I felt was unnecessary but gladly accepted. Previously working in this industry I know that a early check in request is exactly that a REQUEST. The wife and I ordered the Tuna Tartare appetizer to share and we each had a perfectly crafted alcoholic beverage. Everything including service was outstanding. Our room was ready by the time we were done with our meal and drinks. The room was gorgeous, the entire hotel is as well. Old warm charm, but plenty of modern amenities. The large tub and separate walk in shower is great. The TV inside the mirror is cool. someone brought us chocolate covered strawberries soon after arriving in the room. I was not hungry but really could not turn down free chocolate. I have absolutely no idea where this hotel gets there strawberries but they are absolutely amazing. I have hated every strawberry I have had ever since staying at this hotel.... We were meeting friends in the hotel lobby and my friend suggested we start our night at the bar in the hotel. I was not gonna argue as we enjoyed our time there an hour before. More excellent drinks this time as well and our server was awesome. He somehow heard in the distance our friends saying happy anniversary to us and he brought the whole table 2 desserts on the house to try. We got more drinks and left happy and tipped him well. Some how word got to the bellhop in front that it was our anniversary because when we had gone out there to wait for a UBER to haul us off to dinner off property they insisted they take us in the hotels Bentley for our anniversary. I really can\u2019t say enough nice thing about this place. They don\u2019t have a swimming pool however most older NYC hotels don\u2019t. Nothing could have been better with our 3 day stay. We liked the bed and pillows so much I ordered a king mattress and 4 pillows from the St Regis website when I got home... it was not cheap but it was my 10 year wedding anniversary gift to my wife. Oh and they gave us a 4PM check out on the day we left since we had a evening train.... Perfect all around!","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

She ordered the Lady Astor\u2019s Tea among others listed. It is said that Lady Caroline Astor, reigned as the social leader of the 1890\u2019s during what was known as the Gilded Age. If you were lucky enough to be a part of her group, \u201cThe 400\u201d also known as \u201cThe Patriarchs,\u201d you were considered what she called, \u201cThe Old New York.\u201d \nThe following are my thoughts of this pleasant experience. \nPros:\nWe were seated promptly but it took our server at least ten minutes to acknowledge us prior to taking our order.\nThe presentation of the meal was pleasing with a sense that there was plenty to eat.\nI tried the tropical oolong tea. It\u2019s light fruity flavor did not disappoint.\nWe were able to substitute the Scottish smoked salmon for more egg salad sandwiches which turned out to be very light and tasty. \nWith the raisin and traditional scones, I was delighted to find that double Devonshire cream and lemon curd were served. My sister loved the fruit preserve that accompanied our meal.\nRegarding the sweets, my favorites were the Lemon tartelette with toasted meringue and Dark chocolate mousse presented in edible cups.\nThe harpist added a refined, soft, musical background giving the experience more pleasure.\nCons:\nI was disappointed that our server was not more attentive. In most tea rooms that I\u2019ve attended, the hostess would explain the items that are presented on the tray to prepare you for your meal. Our server just placed the items on the table and off he went. Twice he stopped by after long intervals to see if we needed anything. By that time, it was too late because another server, Kenny, had already cared for our needs of more water for the tea and removal of dirty plates. It just felt like our server was there because he had to and couldn\u2019t wait to leave.\nThe area is one for dining and not just for afternoon tea. Others were having lunch which distracted from the mood of \u201c the afternoon tea.\u201d\nOverall: I would still suggest the St Regis for tea for it\u2019s food.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":93614,"title":"A Truly Underwhelming \"High Tea\"","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-05-06","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"**Just to be clear, this lackluster review is specific to my high tea experience in Astor Court at the St. Regis, NOT of the St. Regis itself.**\n\nYesterday, I treated a dear friend to a high tea at the St. Regis.  We live on separate coasts and only get together once or twice a year, so I was hoping to really deliver since it was my \"turn\" to plan the day.  Part of my plan for the day was an epic tea service. \n\nThe St. Regis offers two, delightfully-overpriced tea services--Lady Astor's Tea and Caroline's Tea--and rather than share a single service, I elected to splurge and order BOTH tea services.  I was happy to indulge in the experience, having enjoyed high tea services everywhere from The Savoy Hotel London to The BonBonerie in Cincinnati, Ohio (a rare and surprising treat if you get the right server!).  Given the hefty price tag that came along with ordering two, separate tea services, I was ready to be wowed!  \n\nWhat I was, however, was confused and disappointed.  \n\nOur server brought a single, tiered tea service to the table, said, \"enjoy\" and walked away.  I was confused to see a single tea service when I'd clearly ordered two, and my friend and I elected not to touch anything until we could get the server's attention for clarification.  In the meanwhile, we used the menu to review what was in front of us on the tea service, and we easily deduced both that there was a combination of tea menu items on the single tier, but there were a number of missing items.  I was truly confused, because I'd ordered two, separate tea services, and expected to receive two, separate (and completed) tiers of food.  Even my stunned friend said, \"That is NOT $150 worth of food.\"\n\nOur server eventually made his way back to our table, I inquired about the single tier, and it wasn't until I really pressed for an explanation that he (finally) explained that portions of both teas WERE on the same tier, and that there WERE, indeed, items missing.  It made absolutely no sense to me that we weren't informed of this when he first put the service on the table, AND that we were essentially waiting for the rest of our service items to come out.  Moreover, it appeared as if we were getting a single tea service with a few additional items on a side plate rather than two separate services.  There just happened to be a table near us with 4 people sharing a single tea service, and I could not help but notice we had the same amount of food.  I was truly confused.  Why didn't we just get the two (and complete), separate services like I'd ordered to eliminate confusion and avoid the appearance of impropriety?\n\nIn the end, it was a day out with my girl and I didn't want to ruin the vibe.  I smiled and said thanks when a side plate of missing items didn't arrive until we'd almost finished eating. And I said nothing when our server accidentally delivered our leftovers to a different table where I watched a surprised patron accept my food and put it into his own takeaway bag (the server realized his error as he approached our table WITH THE BILL but WITHOUT my food and had to go back to retrieve leftovers that I no longer wanted, quite frankly).  I even tipped...but poorly.\n\nIn all fairness, some of the treats were very tasty, we got some great photos, and the musical selections from the harpist were hilarious\/impressive.  If those were the things I'd paid for, I would have been more than satisfied with the experience. I paid for high tea, however, and for the amount of food that was actually present, the way it was ultimately presented, and the service, I can honestly say I was underwhelmed.\n\nIf it's ambiance you're looking for, a lot of these reviewers are right, this place offers endless photo ops of old-world glamour.  If, however, you're looking for a decadent, high tea experience that's well worth the money you pay, I would recommend going somewhere else.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Other than the same Butler I've had down at the Punta Mita Property for years now when I come stay, Ameena was the best!\n\nThe house car was a nice touch for quick jaunts around town.

The charge has amenities with it that may or may not be useful, depending on your interest and the length of stay, but the charge and the associated amenities were not revealed to us until check out - which means it was actually just a room rate that was $50 more than quoted when the room was booked. After visiting with the hotel front desk, and American Express (who booked my travel) a few charges were removed but the extra $ 50\/day charge remained. If Marriott wants to charge more for the room, then do it from the outset, and not as a hidden check out charge. One item was a $ 50 food and beverage credit, but my bill still had a food charge on it with the credit not applied. \nThere was also confusion by the hotel staff, who thought the $ 50 was an American Express charge, which it was not. \nFor a 5 star hotel, charge the room rate, supply the expected services and let the consumer choose the rest instead of 'providing' amenities that are actually padding the bill.

So, a few months late, but here you go.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by stellar service...\n\nWife and I spent a long weekend at the St. Regis for our anniversary.  I bought her a dress from her favorite designer in NY.  When I called the St. Regis, they not only arranged for a courier to have it delivered, but also held it until our arrival with a promise it would be waiting in our room.  Upon arrival, the front desk realized the bad had not been dropped, told us our room was not ready, and proceeded to walk us directly to the dining room for a complimentary drink.  One drink turned into two (each) and we decided to have a few appetizers.  At some point, I stepped aside to find a restroom and was intercepted by the concierge with a room key and a confirmation the dress was on the bed.  When the bill arrived, the total was $0.  \n\nThe rest of the weekend was more of the same.  Every time we returned from an outing, they quickly opened doors, helped with bags, etc.  The staff has a way of being both incredibly helpful AND non-existent.  They know when to step in and when to leave you alone.  I wish I could remember all of their names...they all deserve so much credit for the experience this hotel creates.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

To us, the renovation was quite successful in blending the classic Beaux Arts tradition of this legendary hotel with the more modern amenities and style of a contemporary luxury hotel. Still, having been to over a dozen different St. Regis properties throughout the world in recent years, the St. Regis New York still reveals a more formal atmosphere than most of its brand counterparts. We, however, are anything but formal in our manner--and we felt wonderfully comfortable and welcome throughout our stay.\n\nBecause we rarely get to New York, I decided to really splurge. I chose this weekend since I was able to get a very good $600 rate for an entry level room, which also made me optimistic for our chances for an upgrade using 2 Suite Night Awards; we were confirmed for the Astor Suite upgrade the Sunday before our Friday arrival.\n\nI also booked Table 55 in the St. Regis' legendary King Cole Bar for our Friday night dinner. The St Regis concierge team booked us famed Eleven Madison Park for our Saturday night dinner with friends, as well as a table at the nearby Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel for drinks before dinner. All in all, this weekend was to be a total splurge in food and beverage--and it was that and more!\n\nThe St. Regis New York is as decadent as its legendary past would suggest. Even after the renovation, the hotel's tradition is obvious in the lobby, while the Astor Court restaurant, King Cole Bar, and even hallways and our Astor Suite truly exuded the combination of classic with modern elegance that showcases the success of the renovation.\n\nOur Astor Suite was spacious, elegant, and extremely comfortable. Despite its 5th floor location, there was plentiful natural light--and the wall mirrors were used to excellent effect to further brighten the rooms and make them feel even more spacious. Only the small shower room was a slight negative to the suite. Water pressure was excellent, and the air con worked wonders, cooling it down to my preferred 65 F without any issue.\n\nThe Table 55 experience in the hotel's King Cole Bar was one of the most memorable dining experiences we've ever had. The food\/beverage at the Astor Court restaurant were very impressive, especially with breakfast. \n\nThe St Regis New York is one of our all-time best hotel stays in the world, joining other favorites like Amangiri, Amanjiwo, Singita Boulders, St Regis San Francisco, Hotel Imperial Vienna, Gritti Palace Venice, La Residence Franschhoek, etc. Amazing. We can't wait to return.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From time-to-time we make the run into \"The City\" for dinner, a show, etc.. For many years now, we stay exclusively at the St. Regis.\n\nThe primary reason to choose the St. Regis is the location. It's close to all the action--from Rockefeller Center and St. Patricks to the theater district and Times Square, Central Park, and the Trump buildings--but it's just a bit off 5th avenue. As a consequence, it feels more relaxed and secluded than some of the hotels that sit closer to, or in, Times Square. The staff is first-class, as is the facility and attention to detail. The restaurant and room service are excellent, although there are plenty of first-class options within a short walk from the hotel. \n\nIn short, it's everything you'd expect in a very nice, iconic Manhattan address. And you will pay for all that! It is quite expensive, and it will almost never compete strictly on price. If you're coming in from out of town for an extended stay, consider someplace else.

Not damp, but sopping wet. We called the front desk and eventually spoke with manager Natalie, who told us we couldn't move to another room as the hotel was full. It wasn't that late in the day, so I don't understand why we couldn't move and let them get the room ready for a later check-in. It should never have been put into service. She promised to refund half the points we used for the room (trying to burn points before SPG devalues them again), but refunded less than half. She sent housekeeping supervisor Alex up to look at the wet areas.\n\nAlex assured us the soaking carpet was the result of cleaning them. We hope he was correct and it wasn't some other fluid. He assured us the carpet would be dry when we returned from dinner. It wasn't. Still too wet to walk on without shoes the following day. So, we couldn't really use a good part of our room for 24 hours. He offered to send up a bottle of wine. Nice, except it didn't come. We finally called and asked them to hold it until a certain time as we wanted to nap without disruption. That time came and went, no wine. So we called again. We were finally rewarded with a bottle that probably cost them $10. Wow!\n\nEvery day we were there except the day we checked out, housekeeping would ring our bell in the morning and then immediately enter the room without waiting. One day, a second person just came into the room probably one minute after we told the other person to wait until later. No knocking, no ringing, just entered. Our bolt wasn't on because we had just had coffee service. This behavior is not acceptable in a luxury hotel.\n\nSo, not a good experience here. BTW, we found the lobby to be dark, cramped and chaotic.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Amenities are fairly limited---it's an old building, so don't expect a pool, spa, nice balconies, etc.  Service was inconsistent, and our experience in the restaurant (Astor Court) was abysmal.  \n\nCheck-in was smooth.  Limited SPG Platinum recognition, but there rarely is in NYC at peak times.  And they were very kind to our young children.      \n\nCleaning services were superb.  Twice-a-day and very thorough.\n\nButlers were mostly good.  Nestor, in particular, was fantastic, and elevated our entire experience with his geniality and attention to detail.  But a few times we called and no one responded or no one came.  On one occasion there was a burst pipe, so the no-show was probably excusable, but other occasions were head-scratchers.  And it's also mostly an excessively complicated method for getting, e.g., some coffee, water, or ice.  (And with weird restrictions---i.e., no coffee after noon.  I'd much rather just have an in-room Nespresso.)\n\nBreakfast in Astor Court was a two-hour ordeal that no one should endure.  We ate downstairs solely to enjoy their famous Bloody Marys.  The Bloody Mary was good (not great), but after getting our drinks, the entire staff vanished.  While delivering our drinks, we tried to order meal, but with a quick, \"excuse me,\" our waitress left to attend to a new table of (VIPs?) nearby.  The new table had their meals before we even saw someone again to take our order.  It took more than an hour to get our food---and the order was wrong.  Waffles with strawberries and cream for our daughter was waffles with raspberries and syrup.  Over-medium eggs were over-easy.  Our juice never came, and the coffee we got with our initial order was never refilled.  And we never saw another person.  After two hours, I took the kids upstairs (who very patiently sat through this nightmare!) and my wife waited for another coffee.  When she finally found someone, she just got the check.  We hoped we could at least get coffee in the room, only to hear that we were now past the noon-limit.  Some policy!  \n\nWe stayed at the Park Hyatt the same time last year, and this dramatically underperformed that experience.

You expect seamless service at this level, and there were a number of \"misses\" that disappointed; While SPG recognition is very strong, overall value-for-money doesn't get there. If you're staying on points, I'd suggest the Chatwal instead. If not, consider the Peninsula. \n\nPros: \n\n-Location: close to central park, midtown if staying for business, on 5th if you want to shop\n-Rooms: Stayed in the Madison Suite, and renovations showed well. Comfortable, somewhat modern while retaining the beaux arts, gilded heritage. Fili D'oro sheets and comfortable bedding. \n-SPG recognition: Granted early check in at noon, a suite upgrade (+ 1), and fresh fruit in the room (although, delivered quite late). \n-Service: Select butlers provided fantastic service, but it depends on who's working that day (see below)\n\nCons:\n\n-Front Desk: Found the reception short staffed - waited at least 5 minutes for someone to show up several times we needed something. Granted late check out but subsequently received a letter asking us to check out in exchange for 3k points. We obliged, but it felt unprofessional. \n-Valet Parking: They charge by time, not by night -- but they provide no warning as such. Given we showed up early, our parking time exceeded 24 hours, so we were charged the non-prorated $89 for an extra night. I've probably valet'd over 500 hotel nights, and I've never once had that issue. While this may be standard in the city, they should - at minimum - provide a warning. $89 for a few hours puts a bad taste in your mouth walking away. \n-Staff Miscommunication: I had requested a roll-away bed before we arrived, which we confirmed at check in. By 8 pm, the bed had not arrived; we mentioned it to the butler, and after arriving back from dinner, a bed had been placed in the room. Then ten minutes later, hospitality knocked at the door with a second roll-away -- which we turned away. \n-Hit-or-Miss Butlers: In general, I make sparse use of the service. However, at check-in, the butler is meant to take their time to explain the services (e.g., unpacking, coffee, pressing, etc) and ensure you are settled in. Ours whisked us into the room, offered coffee and then, walking out, only mentioned \"oh, and we can press your items, if you want.\"  We then realized only one of the bathrooms had bath salts, and after calling and asking him if they could re-stock it, he put the phone on hold, came back and simply said, \"no, sorry we're out.\" That said, the next two days we were assigned different individuals, and they were noticeably better.\n-Technology: I plugged my phone into the bed-side Bose to charge, only to realize the unit turns off with the lights, so my phone was on fumes when I woke up. Also, centralized controls are more limited\/antiquated than other StR properties.  \n-Views: This is the inheritance of an old New York building, but windows were small and sparse, so natural light was limited. \n\nBottom line, it's a beautiful hotel in an old building with a mix of phenomenal and sub-par service. At this price, consistency is key, and this property doesn't hold water.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We have stayed at several St Regis properties, and some, like Aspen, San Francisco, and Washington DC, many times. We\u2019ll be staying at the latter next week, then back at the St Regis San Francisco in a month.\n\nWe were informed that at the end of a long, two-continent trip, we needed to attend two formal events in NYC, before returning home. Because of its proximity to the event venues, and the brand, we chose the St Regis New York, and had a very nice, albeit short stay.\n\nFirst, in our experience, each St Regis property has been unique. There have been some similarities, such as many being in historical, and wonderfully remodeled buildings, excellent service and charming, lovely rooms, have kept us coming back to the brand. The St Regis New York continued in that vein.\n\nAs our flight was arriving at EWR at 2:05pm, we were going to have to hurry, to get into Manhattan, check in, unpack and then dress for the first event, at 6:30pm. Since we were traveling, before the side trip to NYC, we had shipped our formal attire to the resort that we were staying at, in the mountains of Tennessee. We swapped clothing, sending much back to Phoenix, and headed to NYC, knowing that we would need some pressing, before we were \u201cpresentable.\u201d\n\nWe arrived at the entrance to the St Regis, but because everything was behind scaffolding, it was difficult to see the building. The doorman was immediately at the car, and our luggage was secured, while we registered. This was very efficient, and we were assigned a small, but lovely suite, 722. While entering the room, our Valet met us in the hallway, and introduced himself. We explained that we had items, that required some \u201cvalet assistance,\u201d and he offered to return immediately, to take care of those. As soon as we had things unpacked, he returned, gathered up the formalwear, and, as promised, had everything back in the room, in plenty of time for our first event. This, for us, was a wonderful service, and we were so very glad that it was available. We would use our Valet a few more times, on this brief stay, though there was a \u201cchanging of the guard,\u201d during our stay. Still, both were excellent, and greatly appreciated.\n\nEvent 1 behind us, we had breakfast downstairs, at the lovely Astor Court. Later, we dropped into the King Cole Lounge, in the lobby, behind the Astor Court, but mostly for wine. With event 2 down, we had our Valet order breakfast in the room, and everything was perfect, from the timing, to the order.\n\nWe attempted to use the Bentley, for our dinner at Le Bernardin, but it was stuck in traffic, and we were likely to miss our reservation, so had the doorman summon a taxi. As we had a late flight the next day, we decided to do lunch at Aldo Sohm, next door to Le Bernardin, and owned by Chef Ripert\u2019s Sommelier. The Bentley was available, so we made our \u201cgrand entrance\u201d at the wine bar, beside Le Bernardin. In San Francisco, we have used that St Regis\u2019 Bentley a couple of times, and enjoyed the experience of having such a lovely \u201chouse car.\u201d\n\nOur suite was adequately spacious, and very well-appointed. We did not want for a thing, during our stay. The bedroom is separate, from the small living area, but essentially, we had a door between. They were separate rooms, but they felt more like one. Our King bed was very comfortable, and the blackout curtains worked well. Our room was very quiet, and we heard no noise from outside, or within the hotel. The bathroom, while small, had a single sink, with large vanity, so good horizontal storage, a nice soaking tub, and a walk-in shower. The toilet had a spray nozzle, so could function as a bidet. Our sitting area\/living room was very comfortable, and had enough space at the little table, for breakfast. By my count, there were 3 TV\u2019s: one each, large flat-screen in the livingroom, and the bedroom, and one built into the mirror in the bathroom. That unit had adequate contrast and brightness, which is often an issue with them. This one was \u201cbetter than most\u201d we have encountered. We had every amenity, that one would need, in the bathroom, and our Valet offered to get anything, that we might not have brought with us. The closet was adequate, even for our event clothes, but I was glad that we had done a swap in Tennessee, as a full 3 week\u2019s worth of clothing, would not have fit. Also, it had 3 narrow doors, which proved a bit awkward at times. One door covered a drawer unit, plus the safe. The one thing missing from our room was any sort of a view, but on this short stay, with all evenings filled, I have to say that we did not miss one.\n\nWe had a mini-bar, but only used a half-bottle of Chardonnay, plus the nice wine stems. I never bothered to check the prices of any of the items.\n\nWe also were able to attend the Sabering of the Champagne. We\u2019ve been able to enjoy that, at several properties \u2013 though, due to the days of our stays, have always missed it in San Francisco.\n\nNow, interaction with some of the staff, was a bit of a mixed bag. Our reservations agent was excellent, friendly, and quick with a welcome. Both of our Valets were perfect. We dealt with the Concierge, and she was also excellent. The same for all of the staff at the Astor Court, and King Cole Lounge. One doorman was great, while the other seemed to not wish to be bothered, unless one was a known guest. Then, while photographing in the lobby, one reservation agent (I assume, as she came from behind the desk) was quite cold, informing me that photographs were not allowed in the hotel. She demanded to know my name, and whether I was a guest, or not. Though I identified myself, and stated my room number. She raised her voice, and demanded again, to know if I was a guest, or \u201cjust off the street... ?\u201d Again, I gave her my room number, name, and showed my key card. She then told me \u201cwell, you can\u2019t take any pictures.\u201d So, mostly excellent interactions, with 1.5 exceptions.\n\nWhen checking in, I identified our Platinum status with Marriott (as our accounts have been merged SPG+Marriott). I was informed that the St Regis was not part of the Marriott program, but fortunately, we also had Platinum status with SPG, though my card indicated Gold \u2013 the agent pulled up my SPG account, but only made passing note of the \u201cdual status.\u201d Actually, my wife, and I are each Platinum with SPG, and with Marriott, plus Diamond with Hilton. Now, we did have a nice fruit bowl waiting for us, when we check into our room. That was appreciated.\n\nIn all, a very, very good stay, at a most lovely property, with just minor \u201chiccups.\u201d It appears that we will be back in May. I only hope that for the next stay, all of that scaffolding is gone... but it appeared that most of Manhattan was surrounded by scaffolding.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

As everyone who stays here knows, this is very expensive hotel with a reputation for being the best. I booked our stay through SPG and decided to upgrade to a \"Grand Lux Room\", with the promise of a bigger room and higher floor. Far from inexpensive but what the heck, you only live once!\n After a 2 hour flight and a 90 minute Uber ride from JFK, we arrived at the hotel around 2PM. The gentleman at the front desk was friendly enough as he explained our room was not ready just yet, fair enough as check-in is not until 4PM. He did double check my phone number and promised to call as soon as the room was ready. I had called ahead and requested the highest floor possible and let the front desk  know this stay was in celebration of my wife's birthday. I thought SPG gold might help getting a better room, sadly I was wrong.  3 o'clock and then 4 o'clock both came and went with no call from the hotel. We were done shopping and ready to unwind in the room. Back to the front desk we went.\n I was greeted by a young woman who explained in a cold and condescending tone that we had requested a high floor and the room wasn't ready yet, even though it was well past check-in time. Somehow, because I had asked for a higher floor, this delay had become our fault. She then offered a Grand Lux on a lower floor. I again mentioned the birthday celebration and asked if it a nice room and she replied \"yes, it's an excellent room\". Also she said there was NO estimated wait time on the higher floor room, so we decided to accept the lower floor (4th) room. We went to the room and discovered a very nice, spacious mini suite type room....with a interior view of the adjacent building's kitchen and what looked like a employee's lunch room. See attached picture. I returned to the front desk and spoke to the same woman about the horrendous view and was told in an escalated condescending tone we ASKED for this room and it was the only room available.  I requested to speak to a manager, very quickly Susan L. approached me and de-escalated the situation by actually caring about our situation. She promised to make things right by moving us to a better suite tomorrow as none were available today. She also asked if there was anything else she could do to make our stay better. Susan was very kind and truly wanted to help.\nI returned to the room and was soon met by the bellman who was delivering someone else's luggage to our room. When we said it wasn't our bags, he actually asked if we were sure!  The correct bags were delivered soon after.\nWe decided to stay in the 4th floor room as it didn't seem worth it to move for the second night, even though Susan offered to move our belongings for us. Very nice of her.\nOn check out day, we encountered multiple issues with the \"final\" bill.  Food requests and charges for in-room massages that we didn't order or get to enjoy were included on our bill. Susan was off and I had to deal with the unfriendly front desk to get this corrected. After a few phone calls and a weak explanation, the charges were removed. The next day we received via email another \"final folio\" that included charges from the honor bar. We didn't use anything from the honor bar. I called the hotel and was told it wouldn't be reviewed until Monday. That charge was eventually removed.\nThis is a hotel rich in history and it was on our bucket list for quite awhile. The positives for this trip included the opportunity to stay in Manhattan when the tree is up at Rockefeller Center and the location of the hotel. Our room, minus the view, was very nice. We got the opportunity to use the house Bentley for a ride to dinner, the driver was very friendly and engaging. Unfortunately the misses were too numerous for this level establishment. Susan L. really saved our stay by caring about us and our experience. Too bad some of her fellow associates didn't follow her lead.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

SR Fail,","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-12-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"This is a long review but this time of year with so many people travelling with family and children I felt it was worth going over all elements of our recent St. Regis NYC stay. Touching on disappointments in general experience due to lack of customer service and attention to detail. As well as lack of children's amenities for those traveling with littles this holiday season.\n\nSurprised my mother and 6 year old daughter with their first trip to NYC to take in all of the Christmas magic the city has to offer. The dates I had to come were not available at SR so we were only able to stay 2 of our 5 nights there. Since it was such a special trip I decided to go big and wanted mom and daughter to have top notch experience so opted for Sr NYC as I had not stayed at this SR before. I wanted everything throughout the stay to be absolutely perfect and make it an unforgettable trip for mom and daughter.\n\nArrival - Upon check-in, I was struggling to get all of our luggage out of the uber while a few doorman chatted amongst themselves. After I had the bags onto the sidewalk it was 5 minutes before someone walked over and offered to help. For a first impression, it was less than ideal as I had read countless reviews on the top notch customer service and attention to detail. I travel frequently and have stayed at countless hotels on all ends of the spectrum including other SR properties. Wasn\u2019t impressed as a woman carrying 10 bags and suitcases with a child as I\u2019d guess I would have been a prime candidate to offer help to.\n\nCheck-in \u2013 It was around 4:30pm and we waited about 10 minutes in line behind 5-6 other guests checking in. Once we were up. I should note that it is Christmastime and there was very quiet music faintly playing but it was not holiday themed.\n\n Experience - While waiting we entered the sugar plum pop up shop. Gal sitting at the register looked at us yet didn\u2019t greet us, offer assistance etc. Simply looked at us and went back to what she was doing.\n\nI should note that I emailed 3 times leading up to our arrival sharing that I was trying to make this a very special, memorable trip and wanted my daughter to feel like she was in a Christmas dream. I emailed the e-butler once and the concierge twice inquiring on what, if any, welcome amenities were available for children. If I could order something special to have in the room waiting for her etc (for example The Peninsula across the street leaves a stuffed bear in room for kids with a candy tray with their name spelled out in candy and a welcome card, and has a candy shop they let the kids go into and select candy from). \n\nI did NOT receive a single reply back, and still haven\u2019t received a reply a week after my stay.\n\nI asked again at check-in if there were any amenities for children and was given a junky coloring set and a st regist hat. Although I appreciated it, not the caliber you\u2019d expect at a luxury property. Especially during the holidays were families are often travelling with their children in tow.\n\nOnce we were in the room and our bags brought up, a gentleman came by and informed us that our butler would be reaching out to introduce themselves and ensure we had everything that we needed. We were thirsty and requested 3 water bottles.  The gentleman told us he doesn\u2019t do water but that he would let our butler who would be by shortly to introduce themselves to us to bring it right away. 1 hour and 45 minutes later no water, no butler had reached out to us. Possibly one of the biggest and most disgusting surprises was the fruit tray left in our room. While I appreciate the gesture of SR leaving us a small fruit tray as a snack. Our apple was visibly bruised and mushy and the grapes on the top (impossible to miss) were literally rotten (see pics below). Not acceptable quality and again, a big miss on attention to detail. Someone either saw the grapes and made the terrible decision to leave them for us anyway, or didn\u2019t see them at all\u2026a quality control issue that needs addressed.\n\nOne thing that bothered me is that 3 guests were registered to the room yet when offered turn down service and we took it, there were 3 of us there but they only left 2 bottles of water. Again, a missed detail I wouldn\u2019t expect for the price the hotel goes for. I will add, that I was redeeming points but that is obsolete as I was charged 37,700pts per night and the level of service should be the same regardless. That is a ton of points to be charged to not be greeted, not get water, be left with literally a rotting fruit tray and to not even be contacted by our alleged butler.\n\nRoom was fine, beds were fine (not overly confortable but not miserable) did not blow us away but there were 2 pros highlighted below. The bedside light on one of the beds was broken and hanging on the wall. Which I found off-putting since again, for the level of hotel maintenance should be kept up.\n\nThe two things we appreciated and the biggest PRO\u2019s of the SR were 1) the room was very quiet and  2) the bathroom and tub are much more spacious than your average NYC hotel. Staying at competitor hotels on the highest floor you can still hear significant noise that was not heard on the 16th floor of the SR.\n\nOrdered coffee from the butler we allegedly had (still hadn\u2019t heard from them by day 2). Requested a hot chocolate for the child in the room. Was told we could only get 1 cup of coffee or tea per person (strange and cheap to announce this to us when we were only attempting to order a drink per person) and that if we wanted anything other than coffee or tea we\u2019d have to order it via room service. Obviously, the hotel has milk (is served with coffee and tea) and chocolate syrup as they offer chocolate milk downstairs.  The idea that they wouldn\u2019t offer a morning amenity for a child when they have all of the tools and ingredients at their disposal is a complete joke. This would be a very simple tweak to offer a child friendly drink as part of  the beverage service. It\u2019s not as if we couldn\u2019t go to a coffee shop and get chocolate milk. the principle, and yet another disappointing experience at a hotel touted for excellence. So far we had seen nothing near excellent that would merit $800-$1500 a night rate or 37.5k points. \n\nDining \u2013 Dined at Astor Court for lunch one day.  We were seated for 45 minutes and had already had rolls, had placed our lunch entr\u00e9e order and an appetizer had been dying on the table for 20 minutes before I finally asked for a second time if our empty water glasses could be filled.  I asked 15-20 minutes into lunch as my daughter sat with nothing to drink when I was served my bloody mary. The tuna tartar was bland and swimming in whatever sauce it was served with. So much so that it sat on the table the entire meal. I would\u2019ve shared this had I have been asked how it was. I opted to remain quiet out of sheer surprise that a service staff wouldn\u2019t pick up on the fact that we were obviously displeased. I should add I spent 5 years working in one of the top fine dining restaurants in the city and work in sales interacting with a variety of hospitality and dining venues, high end properties, upscale restaurants and hotels regularly so I am very familiar with expectations, service etiquette, the importance of reading guest satisfaction etc. Salads were both bland with zero flavor of any kind but mom and I ate them because we were starving. Had Bloody Mary & a glass of champagne, both were as expected. The only thing that was good at lunch was daughter\u2019s grilled cheese and the rolls, which were a good variety and served warm with soft butter. A+ on the bread-basket. \n - Aside from the water situation and the food being underwhelming, our busser and server Tony were attentive.\n\nRoom Service \u2013 ordered room service for dinner, entrees were cold and we sadly weren\u2019t surprised based on all of the other food we had tasted. \n\nConcierge \u2013 We did not have any major concierge needs as I had already planned our entire itinerary but I did stop at the concierge desk twice with questions and both times the gal with short dark hair was friendly and helpful.\n\nTakeaways \u2013 \n\n-\tIf travelling with children I absolutely do not recommend staying at St. Regis NYC. Zero amenities for children and their two competitor hotels both very close by, The Peninsular & The Plaza, have numerous darling amenities and packages for purchase for kids that are a total blast. My 6 year old daughter felt like a queen at both competitor properties as they both go out of their way to ensure kids feel included and have fun. I know that not every property aims to attract children and maybe SR just prefers to minimize small guests. That may be the case though the Plaza and Peninsula have both found successful models to capture all audiences both single travelers and those with families and guests and staff seemed genuinely happy\/enjoying their time at both of these properties while we were there. There is a lot to be said for having a luxury experience that is also fun for the kids = more families spend time and money on the convenience without compromising quality = more $$$$ for hotel.\n\n-\tDo NOT waste your time or money dining at SR. Food is lackluster at the very best.\n\n-\tFor the price and the points we found it to be absolutely NOT worth it and consider it a SR Fail. The quiet, large bathroom and bread basket were great but the overall attention to detail and customer service need major attention to be competitive with other NYC luxury hotels. I felt completely ripped off on points  and wished I could do it over again and get them back. Wasting almost $400 on food over 2 terrible meals only added insult to injury.  (I have heard Chatwal is great and will stay there next time).\n\n-   I will also add that though it is Christmas time the SR was one of the least Christmassy hotels we visited. This isn't a con for some people just noting it for those seeking a heavy holiday experience, Christmas music being played etc.\n\n-\tThe fruit tray situation was disturbing mostly because my daughter was eating the grapes before I noticed the rotten ones staring up at me. The thought of her eating moldy grapes is not ideal obviously.\n\n-\tHighlight of the hotel was King Cole Bar. Angel was AWESOME as a bartender. On top of service, friendly, engaging even though they were very busy. I can see why there are so many regulars at the bar with Angel behind it. He was one of the only staff we saw smile the entire stay (the other was the concierge gal mentioned above). I will absolutely stop back into King Cole bar for drinks on future visits as I am in NYC about once a month. Stay elsewhere and pop into King Cole for drinks.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

To celebrate becoming SPG Platinum for life I booked the iconic St Regis Hotel to celebrate this achievement  I have never stayed at this hotel and was looking forward staying at such a celebrated and iconic NYC hotel.\n\nThe location is hard to beat if you want to access shopping and stores. Tiffany's is a 10 second walk away as well as all the other high end brands. Bergdorf Goodman dept store is located right across the street. Central Park,The  Plaza hotel located only 2 blocks away.  If you want to walk to St Patricks Cathedral, go to Rockefeller Center to see the tree its only 5 blocks away.\nGreat location for all of this.\n\nAs we pulled up the bellman took our bags and asked our last name and said dont worry abt the bags well take care of them. (no luggage check) but it was no big deal as I had complete faith my bags would be brought to the room.\n\nI arrived around noon so i was very early for check in.  The hotel was built in 1904 and has a very understated luxury to it. The lobby was not huge but was elegant and showed off the period details. Take a look at the Grandfather clock and mail box that have been at the hotel since 1904. There was no line at check in which I was surprised since it was noon Saturday Dec4th. The hotel was sold out and I was trying to use my Suite Night Award (these are awarded to Platinum members who stay 50 nights a year with SPG) for an upgrade but it did not clear.  I totally understand since it was the holiday season and the hotel was fulled booked and NYC was packed with people.\n\nI came up to the front desk and Hugo Hidalgo, the front desk agent and his partner Shelumie helped me out.\nHugo was EXTREMELY professional and HELPFUL. Hugo welcomed me and thanked me for my loyalty to SPG. As Hugo was looking up my reservation he said the room was not ready but he would take my number and call me when it was serviced by housekeeping. BUT to my SURPRISE he said there was an upgrade available!! I was in complete state of bliss!! Thank you HUGO for looking after a very loyal SPG member and thank you for going the extra mile to see if any upgrades were available without me even asking. I figured the room would be ready by 3pm or so. So my wife and our 2 young nieces decided to explore the hotel and soak in the history. As we made our way to Astor Court (the restaurant) to take a picture by the Christmas tree a waitress came over and asked if we wanted a group photo by the tree. Wow thank you..so far so awesome. Service has been excellent and we haven't even checked into the room yet!\n\nWithin 1\/2hr I got a call saying our room was ready! This was awesome. As I made my way back to Hugo to check in he said we had been upgraded to the St.Regis Suite. I could of not been more thankful. I did not tell my wife or our nieces about the upgrade and wanted to surprise them. As we made our way to the room the girls were shocked when we walked in. They couldnt believe how nice and spacious the room was.  They were so excited and in awe. As you walked into the room there was a hallway with heated marble floors, to the left was a full bath, again with heated marble floors and the bedroom. There was a closet located just outside this bathroom.  To the right as you walked in was ANOTHER full bath with heated marble floors with a closet located outside of it as well as the living room. Fresh flowers in the bathrooms and TV's both in the living room and bedroom. The lights can be controlled by the Creston system. There is a minibar with 2 comp. bottles of water.\n\nThe room was very historic with big chandeliers in the living room and bedroom. There was period molding along the ceiling and the St Regis logo built into the vents. Our bags arrived shortly after we got to the room .There is turn down service and they left a nice fruit bowl in the room for us.We did not a chance to use the St Regis butler service on this trip.  The next morning we had breakfast in Astor Court. It was nice to sit in such a historic dining room with the gold leaf and sky painted ceiling. The service was excellent,food was excellent but it was expensive.. For the 4 of us it was $240 including tip. We were lucky enough to check out the mural at the King Cole Bar next door where a service member allowed us in for pictures and he explained the history of the mural behind the bar (its pretty funny, I wont spoil it).\n\nOverall an excellent stay and its prob. in the top 3 of all my SPG stays and for my wife it was her #1 stay!! Our nieces loved the rain shower with the handheld and couldnt stop saying how it was the best shower they ever had.\nThe location is great, the hotel is historic and iconic, the room was AWESOME and SPACIOUS but the best part was really the service.  \nThe servers in Astor Court, the bellman and of course the front desk people, Hugo and Shelumie.  \n\nThanks again for the upgrade and taking care of ALL of us. It was an awesome stay and we look forward to coming back\n","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The property is gorgeous, lots of marble, high ceilings, and real crystal in the chandeliers! It is beautiful in a classical way. The bed is comfy, and there is some free bottled water and fruit! Loved the grapes. There is a Butler on the floor who will shine your shoes and press your dress pants, and bring you more fruit. But, this is the most expensive hotel in NYC. What are you getting for all those extra dollars?\nWell, I got some dirty ladies underwear left by the previous occupant. YEAH!!  Gross. They were entwined with the legs of the collapsible suitcase stand. Well, I called for the Butler to show her . . .  and expected her to remove them from the room . . .  which she did NOT!  (She was wearing gloves)  Was I supposed to call housekeeping?  Don't know, if it wasn't in the job title of the Butler to remove dirty knickers then she should have called the knicker-removal-specialists! \n\nLater in the evening, my husband & I both tried to turn on the TV, but with no luck. We called the Butler. She came in and tried a couple times, no luck. She then removed the back of the remote control and took out the batteries and rubbed the copper ends and installed them back in the remote. YEAH the TV now worked.  But, every time we tried to turn it on, we had to go thru the same battery rubbing operation.  She couldn't just bring us new batteries?  Or a remote that works???  At $1,000 a night for the cheapest room, this is what the Butler is doing for us???\n\nThe bathroom was very nice, lots of marble. But my cookie-cutter production home in the suburbs has lots of marble too. There was a nice frosted heavy glass door for the shower - my bathroom as that too. And my bathroom has a larger tub, and radiant heat underneath the marble floor so my tootsies are warm and toastie all the time!  No radiant heat here. The only thing this bath had that mine doesn't is the TV within the mirror.  But mine has a fireplace next to the tub.  What am I getting for my dollars here??\n\nThe St. Regis requires all guests to use a card key to activate the elevators. It doesn't work as easily as one might like, and I noticed all the guests waving the card over & over in front of the sensor to get it to work, so it wasn't just me. That's a nice safety precaution. No stranger off the street can just come in and go up to your floor! Makes me feel secure until I see the original marble circular stairs next to the bank of elevators. One could just walk up the stairs to any floor. Which I did - it goes up to the roof. \nFinally, the St. Regis does provide a cool Bentley 4-door for you to use. The first trip is free but only within a 10 block area. We took advantage of this offer and totally enjoyed the ride! It is the most luxurious ride ever. This was a very nice perk to staying at the St. Regis Hotel.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

As soon as I got off the elevator, I was greeted by my butler. Yes, the butler. He showed me my room which was a little unnecessary.  It was all pretty self explanatory. However, impressive.\n\nThe room itself was very nice. The little tablet thing that controls the lights was very helpful. The bathroom was incredible and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. I had read other horror stories about how you could hear traffic and all but I didn't hear a peep. \n\nBut, a couple of issues. I could not make the sound work on the TV. There is a secret yellow button on the remote that you have to push to turn it on. They need to have a sign on the tv that tells you that but I am sure they won't do that. \n\nAlso, I am a very early riser. I woke up at 530 and wanted a cup of coffee. There is no coffee pot in the room. I went downstairs and was told that the restaurant opened at 7 but that I should call my butler to bring me coffee. There is no way on earth I was calling anyone at 530 am to bring me coffee. So I went outside searching for a diner which they say is down the street. Instead, there was a lady in a street cart right across the street selling coffee for $1. \n\nI would certainly recommend the coffee lady across the street. I did however disturb my butler around 7 for additional coffee which was nice. \n\nOverall the hotel is extremely nice but just a bit over the top for what I am used to.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room was spacious and clean but we were disappointed to see there wasn't a coffee pot in the room.

The next morning, we dial the number to order our coffee but the number was perpetually busy.  Of course, all the other guests are ordering coffee as well which drives home the point that a coffee pot in the room is quite necessary.  At some point, we gave up, as we were scrambling to get to our event.  That evening, we wanted to make a cocktail and hubby grabbed the ice bucket to locate the ice.  He met the butler.  Incidentally, our ice bucket is the size of a large mug.  We joked about dumping the alcohol right in the tiny bucket.  The butler admonished him as she informed us that we must call the number.  We both find it easier to dash out, grab the ice than to have to pick up a telephone and make the call.  Same thing happened the next morning for coffee..... busy signal.   Incidentally, we were told after the second time that we were \"supposed\" to call the second number which is the front desk if we encounter a busy signal; basically two phone calls for your coffee.  He later goes out to get more ice and the butler loomed over him, \"Sir.....you just aren't getting it!\"  He explained that he's capable of getting our ice.  Not a big deal.  One evening, we had little time to pick up our things so I suggested we put the \"DO NOT DISTURB\" light on for the room.  No cleaning.  We know this to be a rule that should be regarded a very serious request....to NOT go in our room with our dirty things laying about.  When we returned our dirty things were picked up and folded on top of the commode.  Wow.  Ewww.  That was the cherry on top.

Was it stuffy? Yes, but the staff was so accommodating it didn't bother me. Our butlers were great, as was concierge.  Check in was a little bumpy, as the room wasn't ready until 4 pm on the dot, even though our arrival time was communicated well in advance.  The Astor Court was nice, but seemed to cater to more the international \"jet set\" than me and my family.  Room was impeccably clean and over the top opulent.  Although it was loud at night for this Midwestern suburban mom. The curtains were not true \"black outs\", but I did get used to that. \nOverall,  we loved our stay but the last day kinda ruined it. Apparently Mike Pence was in town. (Gasp..) He had a St Regis speaking engagement.  Anyways, the secret service and lovely police (ha!) Descended on the hotel and made sure to make everyone else's visit less than swell. We waited over 20 minutes to get an elevator because they shut some down for him. When we arrived in the lobby (with our 1 year old and stroller in tow), we went towards the elevator that took us to the street (we had been doing this routine for several days now). However,  the secret service (I think) stopped us and said we couldn't use the elevator.  They then proceeded to say \"figure it out\" on how we would get out with a baby and stroller through the revolving door and stairs. I was so fired up I didn't even enjoy the musuem we went to afterwards.  On our way back the same day to check out, the entire hotel was blocked off. I went up to a NYPD officer who said no one gets in! I asked her how long...she said \"I don't know, you'll just have to wait.\" (As I think she rolled her eyes at me). After about 25 minutes of standing on the street (still a baby in tow who was getting fussy), we were allowed back in. Upon check out I expressed my concerns.  I told them I realized it was not the hotel but the hotel allowed the event to occur, thus allowing various law enforcement to treat the paying customers like dirt. The response I got was an apology  (thank you) and a \"next time you stay we will make your stay is really nice\". \nI am not an international traveler. I saved money to be able to stay here. I didn't plan on coming back even before the unfortunate events occurred.  However,  I am not sure that was the best response given the nature of complaint. Hope it's better next time...basically? \nSo that's the St Regis nyc.  Nice, but just pray no one \"important \" is staying there when you are!","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I'll start by saying I\"ve stayed here and the Mandarin Oriental each over 50 times, I'm always unsure which I love better.  I used to be friends with the hotel manager (Alexander Kellerman) at the St. Regis, and he was great to me, I got to know him, it made the St. Regis better.  Both can obviously have off days.  This wasn't terrible this time, but just off.   \n\nThe good:  It's still of course a gorgeous hotel.  It's immaculate, hotel beautiful, gym is actually nicely upgraded.   Service is generally terrific, rooms and bathrooms incredible.  It still was this time.  Breakfast was incredible this time too.  Bed and blackout shades top notch.  Shower perfect.  \n\nThis visit the not-so-good:   Well, I got there at around 12pm, and through the years, I've gotten lucky almost always, or rather they accommodate me very often.  This time, I heard \"unfortunately\" about 50 times in the next few hours.  Room's not ready.  OK, no problem.  But they said I was getting a \"huge upgrade\", which is really nice, especially since it's a nice occasion and I'm Starwood Gold and stayed there SO much.  But, they couldn't tell me (rules) what type of room.  Also:  \"unfortunately\" it wouldn't be ready until after 7pm, people were staying in them late, nothing they could do.  That is, 7pm at the EARLIEST.    Now, I'm staying there for 1 night, leaving 8am in morning.  That's is not a favor to get a huge upgrade but have a room for under 12 hours.  So getting this \"huge\" upgrade after 8pm?  Sorry but that's ridiculous.  \n\nNext, when could I get a room?  I actually paid (even though I never do this, because I always am luckily given upgrades), I paid for a suite.  They said I could get a downgrade if I wanted a room on time.  I was seriously told this.  They said if I was lucky, and they'd try their absolute best, I could get a suite of any kind by 4pm hopefully.   Then I realized:  \"wait, that's not a favor to get the room I paid for at the absolute latest check-in time\".  They did realize this and said yes, true.  OK, I'd get the bare minimum room that I paid for at 4pm, no earlier, no upgrades, they'd do their best to do that.  \n\nSo I didn't get this upgrade to the Madison Suite (after 8pm for 1 night is so absurd why did they even offer it), and for 1 night it was very hard to get into anything before 4pm even though I begged emailed ahead, did everything.  I could only get a downgrade if I wanted that.  I ended up getting a suite that is no more or no less than what I paid for at 3pm, not on a high floor that I wanted really.  And the hallway smelled like smoke, it had air filtration machines in the hall all day\/night to clean it.  I'm allergic to smoke.  There was a guy sitting outside of a suite at the end of the hall, probably security for a high-end guest.  He was shouting on his cell phone all afternoon\/night in what sounded like Arabic, kept us up till about 12pm, heard him again at 7am.  \n\nAlso when I got my keys, it said the price right on the white key holder, $1250 written right on there in pen so my wife had to see it-  was a gift for her.   \n\nWe weren't given a favor by getting the room I paid for on a smokey hallway, loud with a guy shouting all day, at 4pm (though in fairness we finally got in at 3pm).  But I had to plead with someone for a long time at the front desk.  The \"upgrade\" couldn't happen, supposedly not ready till 8pm.  At 5pm when I asked if I could switch to that suite since our room smelled like smoke and it was loud, at 5pm they said that suite was given away already!    \n\nSorry-   not a good experience this time.  But I did have a first:  I got offered a downgrade if I wanted to get into a room by 4pm, the absolute latest check-in time.   The whole thing left an awful feeling.  Couldn't just give me any other upgraded suite to placate us?  \n\nI'd stay here again, I usually love it here.  But I drew a bad hand this time somehow.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The day of my birthday we woke up to great coffee by our butler (we especially loved the Butler Service bringing us coffee in the morning.  That was the hardest to leave behind) walked to the Boat house in Central Park ,a day of shopping on 5th Avenue and the day ended by walking to see Bette Midler in Hello Dolly.

The service throughout our stay was near flawless, some of the best we have experienced anywhere. Our butler was readily available and introduced herself within minutes of entering our room. We had drinks at the King Cole Bar which was a great experience, and breakfast in the Astor Court was very nice as well. We were also celebrating a birthday while here, and the hotel brought a personalized note and a sweet treat to recognize the occasion, which was very kind and much appreciated.

What's annoying though we were told upon arrival that via the butler service all coffee and tea was complimentary. Imagine my shock when we were charged  about $155 for 8 espressos (extortion) having complained at checkout I was told that policy was complimentary regular coffe but espresso was extra ,why????anyway they sent me a revised invoice which still showed coffee charge but in addition a minibar bill for $120 which we didn't consume . It's now been over 2 weeks and still not resolved. The st Regis brand generally is a guarantee but New York falls well below expectations in terms of standards . To be fair rooms are nice and the young lady in gym who unfortunately we don't remember her name was exquisite. Whilst New York is expensive they seem to want to be even more expensive, the cheapest glass of wine $19 without service\/tip which was haphazard at best.my previous trip to New York was at the Westin Times Square which was better and that's saying something.

This is not the case for the St Regis New York.\n\nI have stayed in New York a number of time, from modern hotels in the noisy and chaotic Times square area, just too noisy and very busy. The Plaza Hotel by central park, an overrated, dirty rundown hotel that I would never stay in again even if it was free. The Peninsula Hotel, where the staff were rude and cold on multiple occasions. That said The St Regis made us feel very welcome from the second we exited our taxi from the airport, from the doorman, the bellmen and receptions staff. After check in we experienced our first wow. As we arrived on our floor (18th floor) we were greeted by our butler, yes our butler who escorted us to our room and demonstrated and showed us our room facilities. The room a Grand Luxe Room (1821) was our next wow. A well appointed spectacular, air conditioned room with a full lounge and large bedroom, walk in wardrobe, and delightful bathroom, oh and their base free WiFi was brilliant and reliable. \n\nPawel our butler then brought us some water and a tray of fresh coffee and biscuits. Our butler's. chamber maids, room service staff, reception, bellmen and concierge were all very warm and welcoming, and most importantly never made you feel out of place despite our holiday attire (shorts and T shirts) due to above average very hot weather for July.\n\nMy only observation is the staff  in the King Cole bar were not as accepting and warm as the rest of the staff. This could have been our attire but we were never made to feel awkward.\n\nWe experienced great room service, a lovely meal in the restaurant and coffee in Astor Court. We found our \"New York Hotel\" a beautiful hotel in the perfect location, midtown on 55th Street, steps away from 5th Avenue.

I must say what a beautiful hotel which is kept in immaculate condition and the King Cole bar was fantastic but it was just the main restaurant which lacked any kind of atmosphere. I work in a very high end 5* hotel in Mayfair, London so I understand how it all works. One major thing that irritated me was the fact that me and my fianc\u00e9 do not eat fish, so we told the waiter (who was miserable, lifeless and rude) so instead of replacing the fish sandwich with an alternative they simply removed it from the plate to which there was still evidence of that on the plate! $70 each, includes a glass of brut champagne, a few sandwiches, scone and pastries. Extremely disappointed, especially as we were on holiday from London, celebrating both of our birthdays.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Never again will I go back. \n\nAfter a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar).  I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day.  \n\nLiterally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a \"No Laptop Policy\" after 4pm.  Seriously??  I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property?  I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal.  He looked annoyed but then retreated.\n\nFast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through.  That's when the F&B manager then approaches me.  He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive.  Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting.  I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive??  One would think an F&B manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop.  When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not \"fitting in\" to the bar scene.  Unbelievable.  He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work.  I am at this point just dumbfounded.  It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter.  Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel.  \n\nAnd just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave.  Crystal clear for me now...","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I called the hotel and reminded them of our booking and that if possible and as we had booked through the Centurion travel service that we would like a quiet room with the customary upgrade offered through AMEX. The hotel was full when we arrived and we were given a very nice room on a lower floor with an offer to upgrade us the following day. I have no problem with this but don't waste my time with an upgrade if the room you are moving us to is NO BETTER than the one we had! we spent the afternoon coming back to our room, moving at 6pm which was just prior to our guests arriving for a drink, just to find our new room had a bigger entrance hall...yes that was it, smaller bathroom, higher floor and a few extra metres but all in a place that was unusable. \n\nMy major issue with this hotel is that there is no lobby to sit around in and do a little waiting and NYC people watching (think Mandarin Oriental, The Plaza) and the truly outrageous prices in the very small and unimpressive restaurant where breakfast is served. Sorry guys but $15 plus taxes (USD for a Canadian) for juice and $12 for toast (how many loaves of bread is that?) is just extortion. Add to that the coffee being equivalent to the quality you would get in a diner. We sent it back three times and then were charged for the more expensive coffee that we only ordered due to the other being of such poor quality. \n\nAnyone who reads my reviews knows that while I put myself in the category of \"luxury traveller\" (#gratefulformylife) I have earned my own money so the money i spend has to be rewarded with value. I do not feel that the St Regis provides value for money for anyone but the very wealthy who don't care about what they are spending. \n\nI think there are much nicer hotels to stay at in NYC having stayed in the past few years at the Plaza (loved it), Mandarin Oriental (read my review), The London (in the days before I was on trip advisor but loved it), The Pierre (loved it) The Four Seasons (ditto), The Westin, The Belvedere years ago with my daughter....so have tasted my fair share of NY hotels.

We got a deluxe grand room; no upgrade due to 100% occupancy. The room was quite nice and roomy and is elegantly decorated, but felt warm at night even though the thermostat was set at 68 degrees. There was a birthday card with some chocolate strawberries. The hotel doesn't have many facilities other than a decent gym on a top floor. I heard the spa is being renovated. We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant in the atrium. I found the space crowded both meals and the hotel definitely needs more fine dining space. Food here is inconsistent and deserves detailed review: Dinner was decent but not great -- the signature risotto dish was awful, tasted like a bunch of rice and cream. Desserts and the salad were very good; fish entree was OK but a piece of fish on a plate with some salad on the side for $48 ought to be better. No petite fours and the bread plate was just OK and different tables got different items. Breakfast was OK but not great -- pastry dish was tired, the cream of wheat was awful and had to be sent back as it had sat and hardened (can't believe they tried to serve it). Breakfast prices are ridiculous -- $15 for a juice and $17 for a pastry dish served cold and boring. Our breakfast waiter had a problem with English and it took him several attempts till he got us what we wanted. You are paying top dollar here and you are almost elbow to elbow with other diners and some of the food was just poor. It may also have been a bad day at the hotel; the lobby restaurant seemed overwhelmed at 100% occupancy. Nevertheless, there are many better places you could go in this city for food and lodging. As a flagship for St. Regis this hotel runs through its paces but there is just no wow at all to it and the property doesn't have amenities that make it a first choice. For instance, when we got to our room there were some St. Regis bedside-type chocolates and some fruit which was nice to have but it was plain vanilla stuff that had no wow to it where they could have made some kind of impression. There are some service issues too -- check-in was slow for both me and my wife who arrived separately, and there was no communication between the butler and housekeeping. The butler came to see us for no reason and we told him they could send turndown in 15 minutes when we'd go to dinner and 2 minutes later the turndown person shows up. When we checked in, we were standing in line and someone asked if I wanted water or a drink. Actually, I wanted someone to go to an empty station at the front desk and check me in. You could get a lot more facilities across the street at the Peninsula, for instance. I found that hotel also to be disappointing, but there are others in NY that are good. I can certainly vouch for Asiate restaurant at the Mandarin Oriental. Both dinner and breakfast there are excellent and there are plenty of on-site amenities for health and fitness. Columbus Circle is also a better point to get to lots of subways than 55th and 5th Avenue and you have the whole Time Warner center right downstairs.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

If you need a button sewn on or a reservation for a great meal, all you need to do is ask, and voila, it is done. \n\nThe concierge team lead by Maria Wittorp and Harald Mootz is absolutely the best.

My wife and I spent three days at the St. Regis after we were married in the late 1970s. On our most recent visit, we hardly recognized the place. My fondest memory of our first visit was being awakened at 6 o'clock on a Sunday morning by the sound of a fife and drum, then looking out the window onto Fifth Avenue and seeing three men marching up the street in Revolutionary War costumes, one with a drum, one with a fife and one carrying an American flag. Welcome to New York City, I said to myself. John Jacob Astor IV opened the St. Regis in 1904. In 1932, the iconic \"Old King Cole\" painting by Maxfield Parish, which had been created for Astor's defunct Knickerbocker Hotel, was moved to the St. Regis and made the centerpiece of a new bar, the King Cole Bar, which has remained a New York institution ever since. In 1934, the year after Prohibition ended, bartender Fernand Petiot invented a drink he called the \"Red Snapper,\" which since has become known as the \"Bloody Mary.\" In 1998, Starwood Hotel bought the St. Regis from Sheraton and made it the flagship of a new line of St. Regis Hotels and Resorts. Today, the St. Regis is a Forbes 5-star and AAA 5-Diamond hotel with 20 floors, 171 rooms, 67 suites and two restaurants. In 2006, the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th floors were converted to private residences. In 2013, the entire hotel was renovated for $90 million. You can still get a grand view of Fifth Avenue and the Midtown Manhattan area. Our 450-square-foot DeLuxe Guest Room with a king-sized bed, Italian marble bathroom with double sinks, fully stocked mini-bar, complimentary high speed Internet access, 24-hour butler service, 24-hour room service and a fresh fruit basket was what you'd expect from one of the world's finest hotels.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I've stayed at this property multiple times in the past with very mixed results, ranging from great (upgraded to a suite with a platter of fruit in the room on arrival) to the opposite of great (tried checking in at 5pm and had to wait until almost 9pm until a room was ready?!).    This stay solidified my opinion to not return.\n\nThere wasn't a single major problem in this case but more of an accumulation of several small annoyances that when taken together, add up to a very negative opinion.\n\nFor starters, I was booked into a 1-night stay but had a last minute travel change that required me being in NYC for 2 nights.  I called the property to inquire about adding an extra night and was told they were \"sold out\" and could not accommodate.  However, all third party travel sites (Kayak, Hotels.com, etc etc) showed availability, their own website showed availability and when I called SPG's reservation center they also confirmed that not only was there still availability but that at least three different room types were available.  \n\nNext, upon check-in, I was told I would not receive any Platinum benefits because I was booked on a corporate rate.   I average close to 200 nights across hotel brands (giving me the highest tier status in 3 different major loyalty programs) and have never had a single property anywhere else in the world at any of these brands deny benefits because of a corporate rate.\n\nAfter checking out, I realized I had left something in the room and called the property to ask if they could check the room for the item.  The first time I called I was told someone would check and call me back.  30 minutes later and no call, I called again and was told by the person I was speaking with that they were on their way to the room as we were talking and I'd receive a call back in 5 minutes.  Another 20 minutes and no call, I called a 3rd time and was told no one had checked and they weren't sure who I had spoken with the previous two times as they didn't have record of a request.\n\nAt this price point, you can stay anywhere in NYC and that's exactly what I'd recommend - stay at ANY of them over this place.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Bartop was a mess and many tables were marked \"reserved.\"  We stood around waiting for someone to clean up the bar, but when it looked like that was not happening, we took a seat at a table marked \"reserved\" because it was the only open table.  We were told to move from there by the waiter because the section was closed and to move to the bar.  We pointed out to the waiter that the bar needed to be cleaned off.  He proceeded to do so, only to be chastised by the bartender that the bar area was closed.  So here we are patrons and guests of the hotel, there are other customers seated both at the bar and at tables, and we are standing around while the waiters and bartenders discuss which areas are closed.  We finally sat at the bar but only to hear commentary from the bartenders that the door should be closed and no one else allowed in.  This was at midnight and the bar supposedly closed at 1.  It was bizarre.  Also, as far as the bulters assigned to the rooms- I'm still not sure what their function is.  We called for an ironing board and iron so we could quickly press some pants as we had no time to send them out and we had dinner reservations and it took 45 minutes to come up.  \n\nStill love the St. Regis though.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

First impressions were great. The concierge surprised us by giving us \"Platinum for a day\" guest status, which meant free breakfast in practice. Although we were still given a standard room, it was on the top floor, which is considered an upgrade of sorts, although I already have Gold status anyway. The room is quite large for Manhattan, with a lovely sitting area across from the gigantic bed. Our butler quickly introduced herself, bringing us coffee and tea service, even offering our friends who were visiting us for a couple hours. For dinner, we headed out to Le Bernadin, which the concierge helped us secure. Unfortunately, the Bentley was taken (not surprising), so we walked a couple blocks instead. \n\nOn returning, we noticed a huge refill of chocolates, with proper turndown service, and the most comfortable bedding I have ever experienced at a hotel. It was truly delightful. The shower pressure was strong, and I liked the European feel of the shower setup. \n\nI do have mixed feelings though, considering the caliber of the hotel as a flagship. I was expecting separate shower and bathtub, as well as WC, but it was a conventional bathroom setup, albeit with double sinks. The TV in the bathroom did not work. The bedroom was clean, but some of the furniture was a little beat up. And the design was walking the fine line between bold and gaudy. I would say it was still on the side of bold, but I didn't find it very elegant. \n\nThe biggest disappointment was with breakfast, where we waited a long time to be seated, and an even longer time to be served. The entire dining room seemed to be in disarray, although it was clear something was backed up in the kitchen, as there were plenty of servers. When the breakfast finally did come out, it was fine, nothing out of the ordinary. Now, I understand how a kitchen may be backed up at 10AM, but I do think the servers could have made things better by providing pastries and coffee\/tea service to those waiting, instead of rushing in and out of the kitchen while diners were left frustrated. \n\nI brought this up to the front desk when checking out, and they apologized profusely, and offered me a truly generous number of SPG points as an apology. This was an appropriate gesture that I appreciated and accepted. \n\nSo the front desk and housekeeping\/butler service was outstanding. I couldn't have been more pleased. But the physical plant was not impressive by ultra luxury standards, even a tad disappointing, and breakfast service was a disaster. And that's why I have mixed feelings.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

But we ended up leaving after just three days.  There were many reasons, but the main reason was that I ended up having a major allergic reaction to their sheets.  I broke out in a rash all over the first morning we were there and went to the hospital.  I got steroid pills and a steroid shot which was supposed to calm everything down.  But it only got worse.  So we switched hotels after three days and thank goodness the hives started going away.  I suspect it's all the chemicals they spray everywhere.  The very first time we stepped into the lobby I thought some old lady sprayed on too much perfume but as time went on I realized they spray something to make it smell like that.  \n\nAs I wasn't feeling great, we ordered a lot of room service.  One morning, I ordered some congee and I was really enjoying it when I chewed on a piece of plastic, and a sizable one at that.  It was about 2 inches long or so.  We immediately called someone to take it away as I had lost my appetite.  To be fair they did comp the entire breakfast and I am assuming one of the managers called and left a message apologizing and they also sent us a bottle of wine with some fruit.  All nice gestures, but the fact is this should never even have happened.  \n\nThe last thing that was disappointing about this hotel was that there was never really anyone accommodating people in the lobby and when there was, they were really unfriendly.  We would often comment on how there is nobody pushing the revolving doors which is not a big deal but surprising for a four star hotel.  And I've encountered someone (not sure what their job was) but they would just stand in the middle of the lobby and they would just have this sour look on their face.  I thought for a second they were a guest at the hotel but they had a uniform on.  Are people not trained at this hotel to greet the guests, even with a simple hello or a smile?  \n\nWith no shortage of luxurious hotels in the city, I think it's a pity that this one relies too much on their name.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon arrival the staff was very helpful in unloading my vehicle and placing everything on a cart. I was early for my checkin, which was fine. The hotel was able to hold my luggage until the room was ready. Of course, when the room was ready, the bags were delivered to my room and I was ready to enjoy my week in NYC. I was very satisfied with my room and the attention to detail put into all of the furnishings.\n\nHowever, I must note in hope management views these reviews that I express some concern regarding the hotel restaurant (Not Old King Cole).  Before the room was ready a friend and I decided to dine in the restaurant at the hotel. The food at lunch was lovely however the time that it took just to receive drinks and food was astronomical. Thankfully we did not have anywhere to be that afternoon. I also want to mention that the waiter we received in the restaurant was terrible as he was extremely unhelpful in terms of responding to questions about the menu. He seemed very disinterested or unhappy to be working which unfortunately was reflected in his tip. I certainly hope management takes note and fixes this issue with wait times and the staffs attitude in the restaurant. However that is the only complaint I had during my stay. \n\nThe King Cole Bar was super fun in the evening and since I stayed for a week I was able to become familiar with the really nice bar staff.

I prefer the location of the St. Regis, and probably the rooms as well.  I suppose views are the big thing at the Mandarin.   Anyway, my stay-\n\nI checked in, and to be fair I did email Octavia (manager) ahead of time, because I was checking in late, and it was a special occasion.  I didn't really specify in the email, just said if a special room was available, then great.  Well, the front desk woman was AMAZING, so warm and nice, gracious, accommodating, absolutely perfect.  In the past, I've had some surly, cold check-in people (as many others have occasionally commented on-  though i think it's just an air of being almost too professional, and getting beaten down by people asking for upgrades all day).  Anyway, we got a big upgrade, we had a 2 room suite, and it was absolutely amazing, perfect, beautiful.  Service incredible all around-  from the housekeepers\/cleaning people, the staff working the hallways, just perfect.  Of course the upgrade helped me feel totally happy, and the 2 coupons for drinks- but still, they went above and beyond.   This was the trip I decided they are just better than the Mandarin Oriental-  it's just a fact.  Mandarin has a few things, like checking to see your room key all the time (St. Regis just remembers you I think), they always charge you a set amount for little upgrades, etc.   The St. Regis was just plain better.\n\nSpecifics:  the bed was incredible, the thermostat totally perfect- drops way down in temp for sleeping immediately, the room is perfectly dark, soundproof, and really gorgeous.  There was a hot chocolate bar in the afternoons, a reasonable gym, and wonderful amenities.  \n\nA slight negative (so slight it's still 5+++ stars):  The house car:  This is basically non existent and maybe shouldn't even be advertised.  The guys at the front just stare at you blankly and tell you it's not available.  I've stayed there many times before, I know the car with the St. Regis license plate is the house car.  They don't tell you where or when it'll be back, if you could take it later, or whatever, just \"no.\"   Maybe something like it's out now, perhaps back in 10 minutes... or something like that.  The two annoying things are a flat out \"No\", no information about when you may be able to take the house car, and it's sitting right there in front of you, and when I got refused, we stayed and saw it sitting there for 20 minutes.   An odd inconsistency   \n\nOtherwise a spectacular stay.  Octavia:  you did a spectacular job, the hotel is amazing.  Our experience was superb, far better than the Mandarin this time.  Total 5 Stars, Luxury all the way.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The fact that it snowed during our stay, only added to the festive ambience.  We booked through American Express Platinum  and despite our late arrival, and the fact that the hotel was at capacity, we were upgraded to a lovely room on the 16th floor. The room was equipped with meticulously maintained antique furniture, marble clad bathroom, crystal chandelier, and sumptuous bed. The hotel's location on 5th Ave. afforded us easy access to most shopping and tourist experiences. The King Cole Bar was literally overflowing with revelers  each day, beginning about noon.  Fortunately, because we were guests of the hotel,  we were provided with comfortable seating within the confines of the bar, and not required to stand in line like other patrons attempting to access the bar. Each staff member in all capacities was exceedingly courteous and accommodating. In fact, my husband and I decided to explore the lower level of the hotel, where we unexpectedly met Octavia Marginean, the hotel manager, who gave us  a personal review of the hotel's historical artifacts and provided us with a verbal history of the St. Regis. If we needed to be critical, the only aspect of this experience that could use improvement,  is the Astor Court restaurant, but I will rate that experience independent of this review. Overall, staying at the St Regis is costly, and the cost may be prohibitive to some.  However, considering the exquisite d\u00e9cor, the outstanding level of service, and the prime location of the facility, the money it costs is well spent.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Rather a mixed experience and not the magical one we were expecting.  \n\nI'll try to be honest and balanced in this review as I still love the hotel and we will be giving it another chance next year.\n\nMy wife an I are regular visitors to NYC.  We tend to book our hotels well in advance.  We stayed in the Langham Place last year and decided this year to try the St Regis - I am a SPG Gold Member.  We booked a \"Deluxe\" category room.  Overall the hotel is a lovely \"classic\" New York property.\n\nNegatives\n\nCheck in was handled disappointingly by a rather officious counter clerk.  Whilst one can never count on this, we have always been previously upgraded whilst staying in Starwood properties.  This was the first time <ever> that we haven't been.  Upon asking we were told that the property was full (the fact that we even had to ask speaks volumes - it should have been explained on check in).  We were offered use of the gym whilst room was being prepared (rather odd given that we had just come off a plane from London UK)  - the amenity offered - one drink or 250 SPG points seemed rather feeble in the circumstances (Jumeirah hotels offer a drink every night for example).  \n\nWe opted to wonder down 5th Ave and the hotel assured us that they would call us when a room was ready.  They didn't.  We came back around 3:45 pm and the room was made available (we were given two choices - one \"external\" facing room on 3rd fl, and one \"internal\" facing room on 7th fl.)  We chose the 3rd floor room.\n\nI guess it was our problem (as we selected the room) but the third floor room was very noisy facing 55th street.  We were woken most nights by garbage collection trucks and construction work starting very early in the morning.  One night there was a drunken argument outside our hotel room door, lots of shouting and people falling over in the corridor.\n\nThe marvellous King Cole bar (one of the reasons we booked the hotel) was very busy and initially we found it very difficult to get in (the hotel does not prioritise guests staying in the property over walk in customers) - although to be fair we managed it later on during our stay.    I think the admission policy of the bar needs to be amended to reflect the very considerable investment guests are making in staying at the property.\n\nAgain, not the problem of the hotel, but the chaos caused by the President-Elect (Trump Tower is on the next block on 5th) meant that invariably there were traffic jams around the hotel.\n\nThe Positives\n\nThe hotel is beautiful, location generally is spot on\n\nThe room (apart from the occasional noise issues) was beautiful, bed very comfortable.\n\nKing Cole Bar is my favourite bar in NYC\n\nOur butler was wonderfully attentive - service generally was fantastic\n\nWe were given a generous late check out with no quibbles.\n\nThe doormen were great at sourcing taxis in very difficult circumstances (given the chaos caused by Mr Trump). \n\nThe check-out clerk (Hugo) was very professional and sympathetic to our concerns.\n\nOn balance (and on this occasion) the hotel did not offer particularly good value for money (given the very competitive choice at the super-lux end in NYC) and when compared with the Langham - however I can see that it would be much better in quieter times. As I said, we will be back next year to give it another chance.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The butler service with morning coffee is great.  The hot chocolate bar by the elevators in the evening is a cute touch.  This is an older hotel, but has lots of style.

I felt that the service was second to none, from the friendly doorman to the front desk and room service, all were superb!  It's crazy trying to pick a place to stay in NY so staying here felt like a little retreat from all the craziness and business just steps outside the hotel! The room was beautiful and again felt like a step back to a time of grandeur. I wish I had more time to enjoy it but with a million things to see and do in NY.....The location is great and I walked about 10 minutes to St Patricks Cathedral.  All the shopping along 5th Ave was just around the corner! I think the main thing to figure out in NY is what you are planning to see and do and pick your hotel based on that.  I did take the subway, but I'm not crazy about it as I come from a small town.  Taxi's aren't my thing either and they seemed to be hard to flag down, so I always rely on what I can see and do on foot around the hotel.

We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay?!  My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker.  We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps\/stairs.....\n\nIn stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the \"King Cole Bar and Salon\" next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney!  There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!\n\nSt. Regis is an \"one of a kind\" classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a \"wow\" factor; the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience; and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. \n\nThe shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the \"hang-over rack\" was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble\/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. \n\nAmong those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and\/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

As an SPG Gold member, I was a bit disappointed upon arrival that no upgrade was provided, especially as when I asked about it they said it couldn't be done but I could pay for an upgrade to the next room category!\n\nOur Grand Luxe room was quite spacious and the decor was very opulent. It had a classic design but it had been redone recently so everything felt very new. The bathroom was similarly opulent with gold taps and even gold drainage pipes under the sinks! I liked their electrics, all lights were dimmable and could be controlled from a digital console near the bed. The room had a few USB ports as well. Bottled water, fruits and a bowl of chocolates in the room were replenished daily.\n\nWe tried out breakfast downstairs one day, and found the atmosphere was a bit stuffy. Portions were generous, and the food was decent. The bill came to around $150 including service. The famous King Cole bar is tiny and was rammed on a Friday afternoon. Service was slow and the atmosphere felt a bit chaotic. It wasn\u2019t at all what I expected.\n\nConcierge were extremely helpful in pre-trip correspondence. In contrast, staff onsite were a bit mixed. Some showed genuine hospitality while others seemed a bit snooty. It didn\u2019t really stack up to the Four Seasons we stayed at a few days earlier.\n\nLaundry prices were over the top - for example, $8 for a pair of socks. My wife actually went out and bought new ones instead! It was a similar story for room service \u2013 it\u2019s one thing to include a 22% service charge, but is it really necessary to add on another $8 per person tray charge on top of that? Combining the two, a food order for $100 would end up with 38% worth of service charges! This seemed quite excessive, even if considering the calibre of the hotel. \n\nTheir house car distance allowance of 10 blocks (around 1 mile) is fairly modest. This may suit some business travellers, but as tourists spending our days sightseeing, we found that hardly anything was within house car distance, and for those that were it actually made more sense to walk it. On the one occasion we did request the house car, it wasn't available but I did notice they were using a Merc rather than the widely advertised Bentley.\n\nThere was no hot water on our last evening as well as the morning we departed due to emergency external repairs (the entire street was affected). We received an apology email a few hours after checking out, and they offered to comp a room service breakfast plus they threw in some SPG points. This was a nice gesture I thought, given that the hotel wasn\u2019t at fault for this incident.\n\nOverall, we did enjoy our stay here. The highlight was the room, which was truly luxurious. Staff were generally very good, although a bit stuck up at times. However, I didn\u2019t like the feeling that you were being fleeced on incidentals. This was a stay on points, but I\u2019d have to think twice if I was paying the cash rate of $1.4k\/night quoted for my dates. This is at least twice as high as comparable hotels in London (or numerous other major cities I\u2019ve visited). Perhaps I\u2019m just not used to New York hotel prices! On the plus side, from an SPG points to USD saved ratio, this was the best deal I\u2019ve ever come across in many years in the program.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC.  Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York.  This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures.  The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating.  We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view.  What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below.  Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts.  Couldn't have asked for better.\n\nThe Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before.  Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end.  This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly.  And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.\n\nMinor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer \"Butler Service,\" a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904.  We found the service a little awkward to use.  When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine.  We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through.  A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests.  But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services.  \n\nWe also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit.  At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help.  The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.\n\nThe King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling.  The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed; the food a little hit-and-miss.  Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay.  \n\nAgain, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe.  Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. \n\nThat frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available.

That's not to say there weren't wonderful things about the hotel.  The staff are well-trained and for the most part do not have that \"I'm working at a nice hotel so I'm better than you\" attitude that workers at other (less luxurious) hotels (Yes W hotels I'm talking about you) have.  I always felt welcomed if not pampered.  Check in was problematic with the hotel front desk telling me they'd call me when my room was ready.  I was more than fine with that as I was early.  The problem was: they never called me when the room was ready.  I had to chase them down to find out (well after 5pm) that the room had in fact been ready for some time.  Again, not a huge deal but certainly not 5 star hotel service.  The butler service was nice and our evening butler (never met the daytime butler) was extremely friendly and provided prompt service.  Then again, I didn't need much service.  The hotel gym is embarrassing for a 5 star hotel.  Extremely small.  Co-ed locker room with few amenities.  No steam room.  Again, quite embarrassing for a 5 star hotel.  My standard room was very large and you could definitely feel the the ghosts of a different era (in a good way) despite the room being completely upgraded.  Whether or not the style (which walks right up to gaudy without crossing the line) is your taste depends on what you like.  Many of the guest rooms have minimal to no view which adds a feel of seclusion from the city.  Again this may be a pro or a con depending on your level of love for NYC.  The famous on site bar had impeccable service although I was always there at \"off\" times when few people were there.  But in the end, it's a small bar with a great painting serving the same drinks you could get at a fraction of the price elsewhere.  Like the hotel, I'm glad I went but was left thinking: is that all there is?  The hotel restaurant feels very open and is not the greatest of places for a romantic meal.  The afternoon tea was (for this hotel) bargain priced but the scones were a bit dry and the sandwiches lacking in flavor. The Bentley car service was a definite plus if you need a luxury ride within a few blocks of the hotel and have your own means of transportation back to the hotel (sorry no return service).  Perhaps I'm a less stuffy hotel lover or perhaps the kind of amenities this luxury property had just didn't meet my needs.  I'd rather have a great gym than a Bentley.  I'd rather have a great view than a butler.  In the end, I can see why others may love the St. Regis NYC but she and I weren't a perfect match.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Since we were in town for Hamilton and the UN General Assembly, we had to pay Daniela a visit and try out the property she'd been telling us about.\n\nDaniela greeted us warmly and walked us to our rooms and introduced us to our efficient butler, Dolores. Everything we wanted or ever needed would appear just as we hung up the phone! \n\nEvery staff member we passed in the hallway or we encountered was friendly, professional and courteous. Not one showed any hint of an attitude. Loved that. \n\nOur upgraded suite was breathtaking. It was sparkly, glamorous and huge. Not a thing out of place. A perfect bowl of fruit, an addictive bowl of chocolate, classical music playing, and all the chandeliers turned on welcomed us to our perfect home for the next few days. We couldn't be happier. We were in room 507. Not even the barely-noticeable street noise could dampen our mood! We loved our gorgeous room. \n\nOur bathroom was sparkly and glamorous too. It was filled with all the lovely Remede spa products I adore. The tub, which my daughter enjoyed, came with a book stand, a special pouch filled with crystals and salts to drop in the bath, a beautiful back brush and soap. I personally loved the shower stall. Water pressure was perfect. \n\nOur second favorite person, after dear Daniela, had to be McKinley Winston. He's the concierge extraordinaire. If you needed anything, he could make magic happen. His knowledge of everything (!) astounded my daughter and me. He's interesting just shooting the breeze with.  Thank you, McKinley!\n\nDespite us staying during the busiest time and the hotel being home to some UN delegates, the hotel had extra staff that managed everything. We ALWAYS felt safe and so well taken care of. \n\nThe complimentary SPG breakfast wasn't anything to sneeze at. It wasn't a cheap affair like at some places. This was a carefully prepared meal from FRESH juices, teas\/coffees to eggs to meats, potatoes, breads, etc.. All cooked to order. Room service breakfast we had was always fast and efficient. Items would arrive hot. No complaints! The people that brought our breakfast were perfectly dressed, courteous and chirpy in the morning. \n\nThere is NO WAY to improve on the place or the people. This is perfection. We had the perfect weekend with our daughter and are looking forward to returning with my mom from Singapore this time. \n\nThank you for incredible hospitality, Daniela!

The butler took my suit and shoes and came back with a complimentary cup of tea. There was no need to fill out any forms or to wait for 40 minutes for someone to come. After I came back from dinner, my suit and shirt and shoes were waiting for me in the room. The hotel lobby and the rooms have undergone a recent renovation and are in an excellent shape.

Upon arrival, you feel as though you are royalty (waited on hand and foot). From the doorman, to the bellhop, to the concierge, to the personal butler service, each offered service with a smile (at all times I might add!) At the door inside the lobby, Arturo was a delight to talk with each day. Extra thanks must be given to Jonathan Adler, the concierge who helped us with all of our local transportation needs weeks in advance. Kudos to both Jonathan Adler and McKinley Winston for their superb restaurant recommendations as well. Finally, regarding the top-of-the-line service, there is always more than one person working at the concierge desk. We never experienced any kind of wait or a line to speak with anyone at the concierge desk at any time of the day or night.\n\nAs one reviewer mentioned, the high vaulted fresco painted ceilings give the lobby a feel of old Europe. There are gorgeous chandeliers at every turn. Much attention to detail has been given to the lobby, the restaurant, the hallways, and of course, the guestrooms.\n\nOur guestroom included the comfiest beds we've ever slept on. Everything in our room appeared to be newly refurbished (television in the bathroom mirror). Even though our room was an \"inside\" room with no view, we heard no hallway noise or street noise. We were also very close to an elevator and never heard any sound from it whatsoever.\n\nThe location of the hotel couldn't have been any more convenient to shopping, St. Patrick's Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, the MOMA, and it was close enough to Broadway without it being in all of the tourist frenzy.\n\nWe had a magnificent five-night stay at the St. Regis New York. We were even fortunate enough to ride in the Bentley provided by the hotel on our last evening there. This was the trip-of-a-lifetime for us. If we are fortunate enough to go back to NYC again, you can be sure that we will be staying at the St. Regis New York for all of the \"wow\" factor it has to offer.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Outright, probably my best stay experience for a NYC hotel.\n\nFirstly, on check-in, although the room wasn't ready, but they treated us to wait at their restaurant and to enjoy their menu at their compliments, which I thought was great. Then, they gave us a super upgrade to their Madison suite, which was even better and unexpected on my part (but I was awarded this because I have SPG Platinum benefits) - but I expected their 1-up upgrade only. A spacious room (with living room, almost 1000 sqft) makes a huge difference to the comfort and peace of a frenetic and intense city such as NY. \n\nMorning breakfast service - as you wake up, you can request for morning coffee from their butler service. Then, you could have breakfast provided for in-room also, at no further charge. I wish other luxury hotels will take this initiative also. \n\nIn terms of 'value', this was amongst the best deliveries I have received from SPG over the years. The attention to detail in their rooms is simply amazing - I could probably compare this to the Ritz Carlton properties. Each day I return from town, it's so peaceful. It is so centrally located, in NYC (just off 5th Ave).\n\nUltimately, this brand\/property defends it's reputation very well. If there were 6* rating to offer, they deserve it.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room was so quiet - I slept like a baby! St. Regis hotels are known for their butler service - and they really do work so hard. I was given a full tour of my room (by the way I was upgraded to a Grand Luxe room) - and also brought some green tea. They bring tea\/coffee and biscuits daily with your wakeup call if that's what you want. I had a breakfast inclusive rate, and there was a fantastic selection to choose from.

You enter into a foyer area with a spacious closet  The bathroom is all marble with his-and-her sinks. Ours had a soaking tub, separate shower, toilet room. There is a lighted shaving mirror attached to the wall which is always a plus.  There is a television in the main bathroom mirror which personally I don\u2019t understand - it\u2019s exactly where I would prefer looking in the mirror but that is no big deal. \nThe main room has plenty of seating including a couch and 2 chairs.\nThere is also a large desk and chair.\nWe were glad they moved the TV from the foot of the bed where it used to come up by remote control. Now it is out on a dresser along the wall on a swivel.\nThe fresh fruit was replenished daily along with free bottled water. Of course, Internet is fast.     You do need to remind housekeeping when you want turn down service. Turning on the request light outside your room was not reliable for us.\nThe King Cole Bar is worth at least one visit since it is considered legendary. According to legend, it was the first place in the country to serve a Bloody Mary, here called the Red Snapper. You will actually enjoy it enough to warrant the charge of  $25 .The bar is intimate and does also serve some food items. We visited twice and both times it was rather busy but we were lucky enough to get a table. The large mural behind the bar is by Maxfield Parrish supposed to be Old King Cole. The story we were told on our visit was that John Jacob Astor IV requested Mayfield Parrish for the painting although they did not really get along very well. The face of the King is said to be the sour likeness of Astor himself, and his courtiers, suppressing laughter all around him, have just heard him fart. Sadly, Astor drown in the Titanic disaster but this story lives on along with his magnificent St Regis. (Interesting facts about him \u2026 He was the richest passenger aboard the Titanic and was thought to be among the richest people in the world at that time, with a net worth of nearly $87 million when he died - he was a great-grandson of the immensely wealthy fur-trader John Jacob Astor)","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Overall this stay was nice, but things could have been a lot better. The staff tried very hard to make the guests happy but for many reasons this did not measure up to our Four Seasons\/Peninsula Hotel experiences.  \n\nOverall, check in wasn't that great an experience.  Our room location preferences our travel agent had previously sent to the hotel were not received.  We asked for a higher floor away from the elevator.  They had us booked into the lowest floor. After some discussion that was verging on stressful, we did get a lovely room and a substantial upgrade. We would have been happier with our original category, in a quiet location, and a lot less hassle.   \n\nCheck in was right at 4 p.m. and not any sooner, which was tiring after a day of travel. And there is no place to wait for the room in the hotel except two small chairs weirdly positioned in the small lobby area. For that reason, the lobby isn't inviting and we feel this is a big detriment to the hotel. We sat in the cafe area for about an hour, and not one staff member came to ask if we wanted drinks or service. \n\nAstor Court breakfasts\/lunches were not very good. Incorrect eggs, warm breakfast smoothies, day old muffins, overcooked shrimp salad for $40.00.  I don't mind spending money if you get quality, but this felt like the opposite of that. The service was great and personable, and the staff mostly handled the very small dining area well.  Astor court is too small to accommodate many breakfast guests and most mornings we had a bit of a wait, but since we were on vacation we weren't too worried by it.  \n\nThe room was really lovely with two washrooms, and a nice upgrade from our original category of room we had reserved. The room had super comfortable bed\/linens, lovely towels, etc. No recognition of my partner's birthday, which was surprising given we had mentioned it during our reservation and check in.  My birthday the previous month we spent at a hotel a third the price and they recognized it with several things including a bottle of champagne. What turned out to be a curse for this room upgrade was two things: 1) there was a smoker in the room next to us 2) the service elevator for the hotel staff was directly across the hall. \n\nThe service elevator noise was present 24\/7 and was always a little constant rumbling noise in the background that was irritating to say the least.  The smoking neighbor was really unpleasant.  The first night the smoke started to pour into our room at around 11 p.m. Fortunately the guests checked out the next afternoon, however, in my opinion, the hotel staff, including the general manager, truly take a \"this isn't our fault\" approach to the smoking situation.  I disagree on that point.  They could remind people upon check in of the penalties for smoking, and when someone calls and complains they can investigate and ask the people to stop.  They were reluctant to bother the smokers late at night, and instead put an air purifier outside our room.  Since the smoke was coming from the bathroom vent area, this didn't really do much.  In the morning we moved the purifier into our room and it helped.  By the end of the day the smell was almost completely gone, and then the next morning the housekeeping staff sprayed the most toxic smelling room deodorizer which took another day to dissipate. You can\u2019t open the windows and the room is carpeted.  For someone with asthma or allergies, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.  The smoke smell was noticed in the hallways throughout our stay, fortunately coming from other areas on our floor.  To give them acknowledgment, they did give us a credit for a half night\u2019s stay. But, I think they generally take a light approach to smokers, and I\u2019m sure I will be contradicted by the hotel staff in their reply to my review but this was our experience. \n\nTo summarize, great staff, lovely rooms. Smoking policy is weak at best, and Astor court is busy and below average food experience.  Would we return? Probably not.  Our travel agent convinced us of this hotel explaining they had a good relationship with this location. Considering no recognition of birthday or room preferences, we will try another hotel for our next visit to NYC.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Butlers were always kind, considerate and helpful. For instance, I forgot my hair curling iron. So on a lark I called the butler to see if the hotel just might have one. They did but we're in use. So they went out and bought me one, no charge. The room service was quick and food kept warm. We got tons of fruit and bottled water. On our first day we also got a very expensive bottle of champagne, which we kept for a few days to share with our best friends who were coming into the city to go out to dinner with us. They upgraded us to a larger suite when I told them I was unhappy with our view on the 19th floor overlooking air conditioning units on ugly roof tops. They moved us to another suite with a more pleasant view. The costs are comparable to the Ritz or the Plaza but the service is over the top. Oh we also were driven to our dinners reservation in The Bentley!!!","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

First, I have to take exception to the L.A. reviewer who found the furnishings less than superb.  At what hotel were you staying?  Certainly not the St. Regis because physically, the hotel is unparalleled and old word class and charm never go out of style.\n\nBut the best part of the St. Regis experience are the people who work there.  Everyone from the doorman to reception to the butlers have a genuine devotion to providing the highest quality service.  I can smell attitude and phoniness from a mile away and these people were warm, helpful and friendly.  Special recognition goes to Israel and Tamara. \n\nOh, did I mention that we were using Starwood points for this visit?  You wouldn't know by our treatment that we were not paying cash.  Next time we will be paying guests and I can bet that our experience will be the same.  I've had the pleasure of staying at some great hotels like the original Mandarin in Hong Kong and the Danieli in Venice and the St. Regis ranks right up there at the top.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

But the best was yet to come, we were told that we were being super upgraded, and got to a massive corner suite with a master bedroom and a living room fit with two massive closets and two massive bathrooms which were completely in marble. The design of the bedroom and the living room were classic with tall ceilings and beautiful sconces, molding, and crystal chandeliers but still all had the modern touches. We were met in the suite by a lovely bottle of champagne waiting on ice and a personalized and hand-written letter from the manager of the hotel, Octavia Marginean.

Nestled between 54th and 55th Streets and 5th and 6th Avenues, the St Regis is probably located in the prime spot for shopping in midtown New York City. Rooms are opulent and spotlessly clean, staff are polite, welcoming and attentive. The bar is somewhat small for a hotel of this size, but there are tables with waiter service. The bar offers a reasonable menu of light meals. My group had a sampling of different foods, and all were very well prepared and reasonably priced. I also ate breakfast at the St Regis, which was a bit chaotic I must say and service was not particularly impressive, owing to the fact the restaurant was packed. In fact, I had a hard time finding a table and had to wait a good 15 minutes before I was seated. It seems the St Regis is a good breakfast place for local business people. My advice is to book a table the night before. I organized a business meeting at the hotel and was afforded every kind of help, especially with the technical set-up. For the meeting, we ordered hors d'oeuvres and an open bar, all of which were managed, operated and served with exceptional professionalism.  (I had forgotten my Apple adapter, and the staff found one for me to borrow.) \nIf you are looking for sheer luxury from a hotel and staff that really understands what that means, then the St Regis is for you. Highly recommended.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Wish I could give it 6 stars!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-06-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"My wife and I recently returned from a week-long trip to NYC to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary and \"babymoon\" and were so fortunate to be able to call The St. Regis New York our \"home away from home.\" This property is a true gem in the heart of the concrete jungle of Manhattan and offers unpretentious luxury and refinement in a boutique setting. The service was beyond amazing and all started with email correspondence from the extraordinarily personable and engaging Molly Deutscher, Rooms Control Manager, who was relentless in her genuine desire to make our stay a memorable one. As this would likely be our last vacation before our son arrives, Molly understood the importance of her team delivering a WOW experience for us, a boy did they ever! Molly found the perfect suite for us on the 18th floor with amazing views of 5th Avenue from the living room, and the serenity of an interior-facing bedroom. It was so incredibly quiet at times that we had to remind ourselves we were staying in the middle of Manhattan! Our butlers and housekeepers made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay and we could not have asked for more perfect accommodations. The bed was so inviting and enveloping that we found ourselves sleeping-in late every morning (the automated drapes and black-out shades help keep the room very dark). The gorgeous marble bathroom had every amenity one could ever wish for from the magnifying shaving mirror to a TV in the vanity mirror, and even a radiant heat floor!    \n\nMolly and the entire St. Regis team did a spectacular job making us feel like family and with every personal encounter, we were left more and more impressed by how passionate they were to serve their guests. I would also like to recognize a few other staff members for their concerted efforts to make our stay so memorable.  It starts with the very affable doormen who were the first to greet us when we arrived - they were always helpful with directions and procuring transportation. Speaking of transportation, the house Bentley was readily available and provided on-demand transportation within 10 blocks of the hotel (Mo and Michael, the drivers, were very nice guys to get to know). Gus, the gentleman at the front desk who checked us in, took the time to get to know us while we were waiting for our room. After learning we were there to celebrate an anniversary and babymoon, he showed us pictures of his young son and offered some great advice to this soon-to-be first-time Dad. For the remainder of our stay, Gus would always engage us by name and was quick to ask if we needed anything. These personalized touches made us feel like we were the only guests in the entire hotel! We also appreciated the staff members (like Alexandre) who would engage guests as they stepped out of the elevator or re-entered the hotel. This ensured you never had to wait in-line to have a question answered or make a service request - the entire team was always happy to oblige.  \n\nShelomie, another member of the front desk staff came to my wife's rescue one late-night. At around 3AM, my wife was suffering from pregnancy-induced heartburn and could not sleep. She was in search of milk to help counter her discomfort and went down to the front desk hoping to be pointed to the nearest Duane Reade 24-hour pharmacy\/convenience store. As soon as Shelomie saw the baby bump, she told my wife to have a seat and she personally went to the restaurant kitchen and brought my wife a tall glass of cold milk - this is just one of many examples of the remarkable staff of The St. Regis going above and beyond to take care of their guests.\n\nTo commemorate our anniversary, Molly and her team at The St. Regis surprised my wife with chocolate-covered strawberries and a rose pedal turndown service that covered the bed and extended to the large jacuzzi tub - again, these are just the small gestures that made this stay so memorable for us, and will definitely have us returning!\n\nI obviously cannot say enough about The St. Regis New York - their culture of service is clearly evident and they most certainly set the bar for other high-end properties in NYC. Kudos to the team for delivering exemplary service and having us feel like our permanent address was 2 East 55th Street...sadly, it is not our address, though we look forward to returning soon!","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I wasn't lucky enough to get an upgrade through my SPG gold status so I was placed on a lower floor with a room with no view. No biggie, since I was in Manhattan and had no delusions that I'd be doing much of anything in room except sleeping and showering. But, unfortunately for me and almost everyone else on our floor, there was a serious smoking problem. The whole hallway reeked and it was even worse in my room since the smoke was going right from the hallway returns to the register in my room. It literally felt like I was rooming in a NYC bar circa 1930's. The smell was awful, and I'll give the staff credit for doing there best by putting an air filter in the hallway, but it was pointless. \n   So, I guess if you luck out with a great room on a floor where there isn't any smoking 3 packs a day in their rooms, this is a great hotel.

The lobby, relatively small by today's standards, is beautiful marble and always has a wonderful aroma from the copious amounts of flowers or burning candles (or both).  The bellmen and reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  Riding the elevators confirms that you are in a century old hotel.  The hallways to the room were nicer, cleaner and better appointed than some other hotels rooms where I have previously stayed.  This only increased the anticipation for the room itself.  It did not disappoint.  The rooms are beautiful and quite large, especially by New York standards.  I would recommend an upper floor room facing outward.  The room had a small couch, chairs and coffee table with the rear wall completely mirrored.  The bed was incredibly soft and relaxing, which was appreciated after full days of sightseeing.  The bathroom was large and comfortable.  It was nice being able to watch the television in the mirror while taking a shower.  We had room service and ate in the restaurant and both times the food was very good.  You cannot stay in the St. Regis without visiting the King Cole Bar.  It was a great place to unwind after a long day of site-seeing and\/or shopping or for a drink prior to dinner and a show.  Each time we visited, it was extremely crowded.  However, the staff was always able to find us a table.  It was not until after a few visits that we realized that the staff knew that we were guests and always made room for us.  The drinks are top-notch, but the bar itself is worth the visit.  The mural is extremely captivating.  As it is within walking distance of Times Square, Broadway shows, Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Bergdorf Goodman, the hotel location on East 55th street is ideal.  All around, the St. Regis was an incredible experience for which I cannot more highly recommend.","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were very happy with the stay, considering it was points not cash, but were we paying the stated rates I would probably have been a bit concerned about the value for what you pay. \n\nPros of staying there:\n- Location is great - within blocks of some of the greatest shopping in the country, and walkable to other areas (Central Park, Times Square if you are in comfortable shoes, etc.). Reasonably easy subway access as well.\n- Service was excellent, and in-room amenities were what you would expect for the SR (toiletries, bottled water, etc.).\n- King Cole Bar is a classic destination and we enjoyed many delicious cocktails and snacks there (recommend the sliders!).\n\nCons of staying there:\n- The hotel lobby is old fashioned (part of its charm) but it lacks the \"wow\" factor of the Mandarin Oriental or others in the same price class.\n- There is no noteworthy dining here...Astor Court is fine for breakfast, but not worth spending the money for dinner. Other hotels in this class have a restaurant in house that is much more memorable and there is an advantage to staying there w.r.t. getting access to that restaurant.\n- We reached out to the concierge in advance to see if they could help us get dinner reservations, and they did respond with a reservation, but they did not offer any options of what they would recommend \/ could get us, and what they booked for us was something easily bookable via OpenTable (one of those restaurants that has every timeslot available). We ended up booking something more special via OT ourselves, but definitely did not benefit from any special \"in\" the concierge in theory might have.\n- Our room was pretty small -- maybe it was because we were there on points, but again I would have been disappointed if I had paid full freight and ended up with such a small space.\n\nNet, net -- great if you can stay there on points, probably only good if you are paying yourselves.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were shown swiftly to our room on the 4th floor and it was charming.  My reputation within my family is that I seldom accept the first room shown to me, and they're right.  I honestly believe that a huge number of hoteliers still try and shift their worst rooms first and, having spent aeons staying in places round the world, I know that to be the case. Still, on this occasion, the St Regis were totally without fault.  We had a spacious and delightfully decorated room with a very good bathroom and lots of excellent lighting.  \n\nStarwood, the owners of this brand, have a rather curious arrangement and refer to the Room Service operatives as 'Butlers' and they, men and women alike, are tricked out as if they've just come off the set of Downton Abbey in waistcoats, tails etc.  Bit odd.  The restaurant was fine but when in New York why eat in a hotel?  There are so many varied and great places to eat that are more interesting.  Having stayed in quite a few places in this city on the Upper East Side and further down town, we found the location of the St Regis pretty good.  It's right on 5th Avenue and an easy walk uptown to the Frick and Central Park.  MOMA, Times Square and the Lincoln Center are a spit away, and the newly-minted St Patrick's Cathedral is round the corner.  We'll be back.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We did complain about our first room given however. While beyond spacious it only really had one window that looked at the parking garage and was quite dark. It felt like a jewel box in a basement. Plus it had some ugly wires hanging from the bathroom sink. To top it off the molding in front of the busiest seat in the room (if you get my drift) had the worst patch repair job ever. Just a huge glob of really bad caulking that was about 1.5\" high. Just a cheesy cheap repair job. Between the wiring and the caulking we did not feel like we were in a 5 star hotel. The next day our room was changed and while smaller, it was brighter and there were no wires or nasty molding repair. This room was also along the street, and we were not bothered by any traffic noise whatsoever. We saw the butler once when my hubby requested coffee. So really can't comment on service. The check in area was always quite crowded as there's only 2 people right in the middle of things, which isn't the most convenient.

This was my 4th visit to this hotel but the last time was about 4 years ago.  New York has many great hotels including the Peninsula, Pierre, Trump, Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental.  I have stayed at all but the Mandarin, and ever since completing itsremodel, the St. Regis is my hands down favorite.  \n\nWhile each of the hotels above offers certain pros and cons, the location at 5th Ave and 55th, the newly designed rooms,the large size of rooms, the butler service and the fantastic breakfast (and dining room), and bar make it my preferred choice.  Its unique and interesting history is also part of the flavor, which the hotel keeps very much alive. \n\nI am a Platinum SPG member, and they treated me accordingly by upgrading me to a suite that was plush and huge.  This suite (the Madison Suite) alone would motivate me to return.  \n\nMy teenage son wants to go into the hotel business, and when Paulina (a manager) learned of this she offered to tour my son through the hotel's designer suites.  Though we ended up not having a spare 30 minutes to do so, I will long remember that meaningful gesture.  \n\nIt goes without saying that the concierges were great.  A very cool and unique feature that the hotel has is a complimentary chauffeur driven Bentley for any guest traveling within 10 blocks of the hotel.  My only complaint is that in the dozen times we asked the doorman for the car, it was never available, and he made no gesture to ever try and procure it for us.  At the risk of sounding crass, I have a RR so it's not a big deal that it didn't happen but it would have been cool if that service could have ever been made good upon.\n\nIf you are in the mood for impeccable service, amazing design,large rooms, great food, elegance and class, and a good dose of aristocratic history, the St. Regis is a sure thing.  Definitely reach out to the concierge team to help plan your trip as they are full of great tips, ideas and \"ins\".\n\nLastly, I just proof read my review and realize that it sounds like a plant from an insider (not that the St. Regis would ever do that.)  In any event and for what it is worth, please know that this is a 100% genuine review.  It just sounds a bit fake only because the St. Regis is that good.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They put me on the lowest floor without an upgrade, although they did have a suite available but wanted to charge me an upcharge for it. I recently stayed at a sister St Regis in Houston and the service there was excellent. Maybe they should take a trip out there and see how it is run because my experiences between staying at the 2 properties were night and day. I stayed at 4 hotels in the last month and 3 of the experiences were so good that thinking back to this one leaves me very disappointed, considering my status as platinum and I am a repeat guest at this property.

In general, the St. Regis is a great and romantic hotel in a prime location. But, if you are not satisfied with your assigned room, ask for the room you want.

The butlers were great and very helpful. The Astor suite was comfy and immaculate. The bathroom was small but sufficiently large for two people to be able to get ready at the same time -- an important comfort feature for me. The bed was divine -- just like home. Best of all this glorious comfort was located on a floor that was blessedly silent. Not banging doors, no noise at all. It\u2019s what I expect of rooms at my 5 star hotels. The bar was comfortable and mercifully had no television in it. I just don\u2019t get the TV thing in high end bars. I\u2019m there to enjoy the drink and talk with friends. Unfortunately some things were not up to the same standards as say, my favorite Ritz Carlton in Moscow. For example, we came back from the theater and a short distance from our suite there were what looked like two roll away beds in the hallway which stayed there until the next afternoon. Seriously? This would not happen at the RC.  Aside from the aesthetics, they blocked the corridor, and that could not have been safe. Also, I was less than thrilled at the service at breakfast. The maitre d was pretentious and cold. Fellow, don\u2019t look down your nose at me. I\u2019m the guest here. The staff was plentiful but not well trained. Example? The entree I ordered had toasted bread that needed a sharp knife to cut. They knew this feature of the bread, as the waiter apologized and said he should have gotten one for me without my having to ask. Then it took him 7 minutes to get the knife. Repeated again the next morning. Had to ask for a sharp knife again. Twice. \nThese kinds of details make this a lovely option.

Each January I hold a special dinner in NYC for a precious group of friends, followed by a night at the theatre, to celebrate my son and daughter-in-law's and my January birthdays. This year we decided to bring their 5-year-old and 7-year-old children and spend the night at the St. Regis, where my WWII-era Mother and Father got engaged and where my son and his wife also became engaged 8 years ago. Anne, in the Front Hall greeted my two grandchildren with such a warm, happy welcome, and your brilliant Shelomie [--] at the Front Desk checked us into our adjoining rooms easily. Our wonderful butler, Delores Romero surprised the children with cookies and milk, so of course, they fell in love with her immediately. \n\nOur visit was made even more memorable by the blizzard, and we are so grateful to Shelomie for finding a way for us to stay an extra night in our beautiful rooms! The weather must have created great hardship for the entire staff, but you would never know it. Service remained exquisite and the food, especially the healthy and clean options on the breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus were outstanding. Our waiters, especially Javier and Kenny and Isimat, were so kind and made the children feel very special. A hero's medal needs to go to Head Doorman Patrick and his crew who worked 24\/7 to keep the sidewalks clear during the 24+ hours of the blizzard. I will treasure forever the sight of my son and his wife and their two children walking down an empty Fifth Avenue at the height of the blizzard and also their delight at our extravagant afternoon tea! Regardless of the blizzard, the chef and kitchen crew prepared everything beautifully. Our afternoon tea was right out of a fairy tale and the children were enchanted. \n\nAlso I must thank the indoor door attendants, the two Michaels and Rick and also a huge thank you goes to Desiree and Lydia who cleaned our rooms and turned down our beds. Special thanks too to the wonderful concierges McKinley and Maria who were so helpful to us. Stacey and Maria, the massage therapists, made my and my daughter-in-law's snowed-in day even more perfect. They are fantastic!

The property is just beautiful.  They have done a great job of capturing the historical significance while also incorporating the latest creature comforts.\n\nLocation could not be better.  You are right on 5th avenue and only a short walk to Times Square.  Never had to wait more than a few minutes for an uber when needed.\n\nOur room was upgraded to an Astor Suite which was simply magnificent.  A half-bathroom in the foyer with a grand, full-bathroom attached to the bedroom.  Pocket doors separate the bedroom and the large living room.  There was no real view from our room although the view inside more than made up for it.\n\nAt first the details and the scale are almost overwhelming.  The chandeliers and the expansive crown molding seem almost unreasonable.  The wall coverings are silk.  The TV's -like all the technology- is completely updated.\n\nI also have to mention the shower which was one of the more invigorating showers I have used.  It just puts out a LOT of water.\n\nWe were celebrating my birthday and were surprised with a note from the manager and some chocolate covered strawberries one evening.  \n\nThe reason I am docking one star is because the house Bentley's were not available during our stay.  That was THE reason we booked here and not other places.  It was on my bucket list to ride around NYC in a Bentley so we chose the St Regis to check that off the list.  They even advertised the Bentley's on Twitter a day or two before we came.  No real reason was given.  One person said they heard the leases were up.  Another said they were being detailed.  Either way we didn't get to enjoy the one thing I was most excited about staying here for.  I felt a little \"bait-and-switch\"ed since they had got my hopes up even more with the advertising.\n\nAnother thing to point out is that the beds are a little on the firm side.  That may be your preference but I enjoy more of a pillowy soft bed.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"NONE"}

It was delicious, but only a few set meals were actually included, anything else you would have to pay the difference\n- early check-in, as well as late check-out plus a drink in the King Cole Bar were granted for being a Gold member in their loayalty program\n- free Bentley shuttle within 10 blockes if a car is available - this is a great service!\n\nNegative:\n- King Cole Bar is so crowded by external people that it is impossible to grap a seat... We decided to stay just outside of the bar to have a drink - \"thanks\" to St Regis at this point, as they granted a free drink even to my wife due to this fact even though having only 1 voucher as loyalty member...\n- Butler service: Nice to have, but not really helpful. They won't answer the phone directly, but they will see your number on their screen and call you back (after a few seconds or some minutes... you never know). They will serve you some tea or coffee at arrival and in the morning - but they won't do it throughout the day, which really is a pitty as you don't have any tea or coffee making facilities in your room. The butler will offer you to order soem tea or coffee from inroom dinding service at charge. This really is anoying and other St. Regis hotels definitely have a different understanding of service\n- bathtub: yes, in the Grand Deluxe Room you will have one - but you won't have any bath salt or bath essence to use it. Quite poor for a luxury hotel, we asked the butler to bring some more sower gel and we used this instead\n- airport transfer: tremendously overpriced! We organized a limousine car by ourselves and paid less than half of the price St. Regis would have charged\n\nIt was a very luxury stay, but for \"normal\" people it really is overpriced, especially as nearly all tiny wishes you might have will cause additional charges.

The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.\n\n- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed \"for health and safety reasons\". Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.\n\n- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.\n\n- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual \"one-category if available\" upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.\n\n- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check \"round the back\" as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth $1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a \"triple\" room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx $200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of \"available\" and \"category\" and these do not equate to \"available for sale on their website\" and \"category of room as listed on their website\" - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.\n\n- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself \"in a couple of minutes\". One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea & cookies\/milk.\n\n- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an $8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping $24 in addition to mandatory 20% gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays\/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.\n\n- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. \n\n- Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.\n\n- \"Included complimentary breakfast\" worth $41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. \n\n- On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were \"Mr __, here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again.\" No \"how was your stay\" or anything similar.\n\nWhen paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}
