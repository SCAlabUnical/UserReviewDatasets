The location was terrific, just a few steps from the Port Authority and a short walk to Times Square and Garment district restaurants and shops as well as Hudson Yards, where the High Line starts.  The warmth, consideration and friendliness of the staff was amazing -one of the best experiences we\u2019ve had in NYC.  Jorge, who greeted us at reception welcomed us with an upgrade and said, \u201cwelcome home.\u201d  The 24-hour free espresso and coffee machine in the lobby was a great touch and I loved having our own Nespresso machine in our room.  I appreciated that staff took time to explain exactly what was included in the resort fee - as far as what items we could take without charge from the minibar.  We felt like VIPS when we got to the room. Not only did we have a complementary large bottle of water, but someone left us a handwritten welcome note with a cute soccer ball drawstring bag (aka Christiano Ronaldo).  The room was immaculate and the bed was very comfortable.  The size was small but just right for resting between NYC adventures with clever spaces under the bed and hooks, etc for luggage.  My only difficulty was the shower.  Beware that when you turn on the water, it may shoot right out of the open door onto the bathroom floor!  But the water pressure was great and there was plenty of hot water, just a little cosy (think telephone booth - if you\u2019re old enough to remember!).

Firstly so easy to get to from the subway at 42nd St or Port Authority bus terminal. Foyer was clean and modern, warm and welcoming. Reception staff had my details to hand making checking in straightforward. Staff very friendly and helpfull. The lifts to the rooms required the door keycards to operate which although slightly inconvenient is a very worthwhile security measure. As a solo traveller the room was an adequate size, easily chilled or warmed with the AC unit below the window. The bed comfortable with ample pillows. Bathroom well stocked with towels and toiletries. Shower excellent. Mini fridge available. Large TV on the wall should it be required. I did select the cheapest room, if I had been travelling with someone. I think the next tariff up would have been required. Foyer had chilled water and hot non alcoholic drinks available as a courtesy 24hr a day. Also bagels and croissants provided early in the morning. Apples available the rest of the time. A simple yet appreciated gesture. The location is fabulous as a base when touring Manhattan no matter your chosen mode of transport. I walked and its central location was ideal. Would I go back ? Absolutely, already planning for later this year, this time with my wife.

This was due to it being within close proximity to Port Authority Bus Terminal, which it was and was brilliant in that regard. \nMy observations are as follows:\n\n1) The hotel is more like a hostel than it is a hotel. The reception area is small and constantly filled with young people on laptops. There isn\u2019t a bar or vending machines that I could see, and the only drinks available at the reception was water\/coffee. \n2) The room is very small. Very dated. Lots of chips in the furniture, exposed wood. Privacy blinds that let in light as soon as sunrise comes. Corridors are small, lifts take forever and using the keycard system for it takes a while especially with luggage. The room wasn\u2019t to my usual standard I would expect. The room was freezing, and only on the last night did I ask about heating it. When it was heated I was faced with a choice of either icy and silent to fall asleep or warm with a massive hairdryer like sound constantly. \n3) The room I had was opposite another building around 50 yards across. And from 6am workmen were drilling, hammering and erecting scaffolding. The noise was deafening and woke me up, as well as the sunlight and the fact I had no blackout curtains. \n4) Water pressure in the shower is low, don\u2019t go here expecting a power shower! \n5) The reception staff are lovely, I never had a problem with any even though some didn\u2019t have English as their first language. They all helped with any queries and I couldn\u2019t fault them.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

The staff were the most friendly and helpful people. I didn\u2019t eat in the hotel as there are many dining options close by. There are plenty of shops mins away to buy snacks, alcohol. The room has the most comfortable beds and a huge tv. I also loved the little coffee machine in the room. The bathroom was small but had lovely products. If you are a larger person, it would be difficult to get in and out of the bathroom as the door opening is very small. I didn\u2019t require daily room cleaning and the staff always knocked and asked if I needed anything. The storage underneath the beds for the suitcases is really useful and keeps the place tidy. There was never any wait for the elevators.\nThe area around the hotel has many homeless and vagrants which does bring the area down but it didn\u2019t feel too unsafe to me.

De kamer was uitmuntend schoon gemaakt en de bedden waren geweldig.

Voldoende opberg mogelijkheden en de koffer kan onder het bed geschoven worden. Er staat een espresso apparaat op de kamer en ook krijg je een grote fles water. Koffie en fruit kan je iedere middag in de lobby ophalen. Wat me ook opviel is dat het zo heerlijk rustig is op de kamer, je hoort er bijna niks, dat is wel fijn na een drukke dag in het hectische New York!

My room was clean and the bed very comfortable.  Housekeeping staff very nice.  Lobby is cute and spacious with comfy sofas. It has some fun Christiano Ronaldo items like soccer balls and jerseys on the wall. \nCons- My shower was so leaky! The seal on the shower door did not seal around the edges. This caused a huge puddle on the floor after every shower. There was no way to prevent it from happening. The shower head was fixed and you can\u2019t adjust it. The shower stall was tiny and no room to move in there- or really even turn around. \nMy room faced another building with construction going on. There was a loud drilling noise each morning at 8 am. My room had no view at all and no natural light coming in. It set a bit of a depressing mood. I reserved this hotel using a third party app (Hotel Tonight) I think I was placed in one of the worst rooms because of this. If I ever return I will book direct and pay more for a larger room in a different part of the building.  \nUpon check-out I told the front desk agent about the shower.

There wasn't much hanging space but there was lots of storage space under the bed and we did have a steamer for our clothes which was a great added bonus.  \n\nThere was complimentary coffee although we did have to ask for it to be restocked and we stored things in the mini-bar fridge without any issue.\n\nThe air conditioning was great - not too noisy - and the black out blinds were useful.  \n\nWe didn't have much of a view - we were at the front of the hotel - but we didn't come to NYC to look out of the window!! \n\nWe didn't make use of the complimentary fruit and bagels which they served in the reception area each morning but it did look a popular choice and a lot of guests took advantage.\n\nThe staff were really friendly and helpful and greeted us with a smile every time we left and came back.  It made such a difference to our stay.\n\nOnly negative point was the building work going on across the street.  Not the hotels fault but it did mean that we were woken up at 730am on weekdays.  \n\nIf we every visit NYC again, we would definitely stay at the Pestana.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

You'll be in the absolute middle of it all - walking distance to so many places, especially perfect for Broadway visits. And yet, the street the Pestana is on is kind of not too loud. Windows are new (as is the whole place) and so the noise is not a problem here. Beds are very good (variety of pillows), even though as a European I can really only advise the US to change their ideas about \"blankets\". ;-) Many have mentioned it and I must agree - the solutions this hotel finds for storing in the room are excellent. Your suitcase will be out of sight, you have space for hanging stuff and 2 big drawers under the bed. I had no space problems and I stayed 11 days. Oh and I \"just\" had the normal room category. Only tiny thing I would criticize: floors weren't really clean, not when I arrived and never after.\nHair-dryer, steamer for clothes and nice shower amenities are in the room (no cotton pads or other amenities though, bring your own).\nFree bagels\/croissants are offered in the morning, coffee\/tea\/water all day.\nBest thing about this place: their staff. Friendly way above average, helpful and fun. I wanna point out David and Marilyn especially, but all of them were great.\nI'll be back!","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

I had booked two nights, 4\/12-4\/14, with the hotel. My flight from Fort Lauderdale that left at 4pm 4\/12, was delayed 8 times and cancelled indefinitely on the 2 attempt due to a storm cell that covered the area that brought 20 inches of rain to the runway. This eventually caused the airport to shut down for 12 hours, leaving us stuck in the airport. I called the hotel the night of 4\/12 to advise that I was going to be arriving late, not knowing that my flight was going to be cancelled. I called the hotel again the next day after the airport reopened, 4\/13, to advise them of the situation and they told me to call back the vendor that I booked with. I did and they contacted the hotel with the hotel's response being that they could not honor a refund as there was no contact made. I can accept that I would have to pay for one night but not the second as I called the next day and was pushed away by the hotel.\n\nVery disappointed on this, was hopeful to stay at this hotel and content with the hotels review. Mostly because my boyfriend also booked the following two night and received a refund. Of course his circumstance was better as he was not going through a natural disaster on the check in date.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":23510531,"title":"Perfect location and great staff","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-01-23","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"The Pestana Cr7 is my new favourite New York Hotel.\n\nLocated on 38th Street between 8th and 9th avenues, the pestana is perfectly situated for exploring Midtown Manhattan and beyond.\n\nJust a few blocks walk from Penn Station (34th Street) and Port Authority subway and bus stations ( and close to a range of convenience stores such as 7\/11 ) the Pestana CR7 felt like a safe option for travelling as a solo female for a long weekend. \n\nOn arrival very late at night, after a delayed flight I couldn't gave wished for a warner welcome from the front desk staff. The bubbly and super attentive Mikaela came to meet me at the door, to help me with my luggage and Harvey, the other checkin assistant on duty was attentive, friendly and personable when checking me in.\n\nThe decor of the property is warm, inviting and fresh. The lobby is clean, bright and airy, with football decor as a theme, and lots of chairs, making it a comfortable place to wait throughout your stay.\n\nRooms in NYC are notoriously space saving but the Pestana makes the most of the space available. The room that I was given ( a comfort double ) offered more than enough space in addition to 2 comfortable double beds;( with medium pillows and a firm mattress ).  \n\nMy room also came with complimentary bathroom toiletries ( shower gel, conditioner, shampoo), a complimentary  bottle of water and what felt like an endless supply of towels.\n\nThe room amenities met all my needs.Although there is no wardrobe there are three hooks on a wall for hanging stuff up.  The room also comes with under bed storage and a safe and the wide-screen TV attached to the wall was perfectly placed for some late night viewing and the mini bar stocked fridge was perfect for storing my supersize meal leftovers. \n\nThe bathroom ( which has a walk in shower with a semi fixed shower head ) has the most perfect bright lighting, and held a hairdryer and handheld steamer. Although the rooms don't come with an iron as default one quick request at reception had an ironing board and iron in my room in minutes. \n\nElevators in some hotels can be frustrating slow, however, the 2 elevators in the Pestana Cr7 were very speedy at all times to\/from my 12th floor room.\n\nOften in New York (and I can confidently say this as a frequent traveller back and forth from the city), rooms are literally room only, with very few extras so the lack of a wardrobe or hanging space on my room felt acceptable, however, little touches like the mini breakfast offered to guests from 7am each day was a lovely gesture.  The complimentary  fresh bagels\ud83e\udd6f (accompanied by grape jelly and cream cheese ) & croissants helped to get my day started off right, along with a refreshing glass of ice water and\/or cup of tea\/coffee.\n\nAll in all, this hotel was wonderful and gains top marks from me for customer service and attention to detail.Nothing was too much trouble ( the team were very supportive in helping me arrange last minute late checkout) and without a doubt Harvey, Mikaela, Victor,  Danielle and the rest of the team should be so proud of the positive look that they bring to this brand, making it feel like a great value for money investment so, thanks again to the whole team for making my stay amazing!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Non c\u2019\u00e8 un vero e proprio armadio, ma questi cassettoni sotto il letto che contengono tranquillamente il quantitativo invernale di una valigia (25kg \ud83d\ude02). Presenza di un appendiabiti e di cassaforte.\nSotto il lavandino in bagno c\u2019\u00e8 lo spazio per riporre le varie trousse da viaggio. Letto comodissimo, tv con intrattenimento ove spesso su YouTube mettevamo film in italiano. \nPulizia ottima, sempre 3 asciugamani per persona e shampoo\/bagno schiuma con dispenser anche in doccia. Phone per capelli non a muro, ma normale, quindi \u201cpotente\u201d.\nNon abbiamo mai usufruito della colazione offerta perch\u00e9 volevamo provare le varie colazioni fuori, per\u00f2 devo dire che sicuramente non \u00e8 da tutti gli hotel (soprattutto a NY) offrire brioche, pane, caff\u00e8\/the; ed altra cosa non indifferente sempre a disposizione il dispenser dell\u2019acqua da poter bere o riempire le proprie bottiglie. In parte ad esso, in diverse ore vedevo anche della frutta da poter prendere.\nPersonale molto educato, sorridente e disponibile (pi\u00f9 i maschi che le femmine \ud83d\ude05).\nVicinanza a tutte le attrazioni e punti principali ottima.

The hotel is situated very close to Times Square, under a 10 minute walk. It was around a 20-25 minute walk to Central Park & similar to the Empire State Building. We did not need to use the subway at all as we seemed to be in walking distance to most things which was great. On one day we did get the Big Bus Tour to downtown to see world trade centre, Statue of Liberty but on another day we walked from the hotel and did the high line to Chelsea Market. The hotel staff were all fantastic. Every time we entered the reception area they were so polite, friendly and helpful. The reception area was very fresh, modern and clean. There was always icy cold water for free available by the bar with paper cups which was a nice gesture, we always took a cup of water up to the room each once our bottle of water included in the service charge ran out. The room itself was small, like most city hotels but was very clean, modern and the bed was very comfy and the shower was great. Just what we needed at the end of a busy walking day around the city. The hotel offer pastries such as crossiants etc in the morning and this is served in the bar area and a first come first served basis from 7am. They don\u2019t advertise this as \u2018breakfast\u2019 but is plentiful for most people. We never made use of this as we always went out for breakfast but often we would leave the room between 8-9am and there was always crossiants left! We took the air train from the airport to Jamaica and then took the Long Island rail road from Jamaica to Penn station and then walked to the hotel from there. This was cheap and relatively straight forward with Google maps on my phone. We took an Uber from the hotel to the airport in the morning as we left the hotel at 4am.

It's the first time I've stayed in a hotel for a whole week and it took about 5 hours of research and bookmarking and comparing the numerous options in Manhattan before landing on Pestana. And holy wow it didn't disappoint. \nThe staff were smiling, friendly, shout out to Marilyn who is an absolute angel, but also to her coworkers who always greeted us with a smile and sincere pleasantries. It felt like returning home after a long day of working\/conference hopping.\nThe perfume of the lobby was a great first impression, as well as the decor. It felt bright and modern, with TV screens playing games\/news. The gym was clean, with freshly rolled towels and to our surprise some Peloton machines. The elevator never took more than a minute to arrive (which is something I read about in the other Manhattan hotels).The room was lovely. It was smartly laid out, great lighting and view from the window. It's really difficult these days to find a hotel with an opening window for actual fresh air!! Shower was spacious and constant working hot water. The air con worked very fast and well. The desk was more than enough space for our early 4am remote working hours (an important request for a desk that was honoured by the staff) The nespresso machine was a saviour (although, we ended up buying some more pods from Macy's to mix it up a bit). The cleaning staff did great, and we wanted to leave a note but forgot to so please pass on our thanks. The bed was HUGE and comfortable, which has given us bed envy now that we're home to our normal one. The location is so central that coming back at 2am from Brooklyn felt like an easy task and it was right near the conference so it was a really stress-free time. \nAll in all, 5 stars and will be back next time without hesitation.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The staff was, in general, accommodating and friendly. The location is fantastic and within walking distance of many attractions. We would seriously consider staying here again, albeit with some additional planning to compensate for the lack of amenities.\n\nWe booked the basic \"Comfort\" room for a week-long stay in Manhattan for ComicCon. We requested an ADA compliant room for the larger bathroom after reading some reviews that complained about its tiny size and unintuitive shower door. The front desk staff were very accommodating upon check-in and explained the process of using our room keys to operate the elevator. By the way, this place doesn't have door handles at the main entrance. It took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize I needed to wave my hand in front of the wheelchair button on the wall to even get in the lobby.\n\nWhen we entered the room, we were pleasantly surprised by the size because, again, we had read reviews that said the room was very small. Our fortune may have been due to the ADA compliance, so take this with a grain of salt. Our room had very little street noise because we were located on the 14th floor, so your experience on lower floors may be different.\n\nWhen we inspected the room, everything appeared clean and fresh. However, there was a notable lack of basic amenities. No refrigerator, no microwave, no desk to sit at. There was a mini bar, but we never even opened the door. After settling in, we found out there were also no ice machines. We enjoy our beverages ice cold, so calling down to the front desk for ice quickly became a nuisance, both for us and apparently for the staff. They started forgetting about our requests after a couple of days, so we went down to the bar and requested ice in person. The bartender was always very kind to us.\n\nThe ADA compliant bathroom was spacious enough and stocked with shampoo, body wash, and hand soap. The shower was fully functional with a handheld shower head, a regular shower head, and a shower seat. There was, however, a strange lack of towel racks and toilet paper holders. Generally speaking, the entire room felt unfinished, not \"understated\".\n\nAside from the stark absence of amenities, our stay was relaxing and enjoyable. Food deliveries were quick and easy as long as you wait in the lobby for your order. Almost everything you could want to see in Manhattan is a stone's throw away and, if you avoid the Lincoln Tunnel end of 39th, you won't see too many sketchy individuals.\n\nIf Pestana CR7 were to include basic amenities, I could find no reason to stay anywhere else when visiting Manhattan. It's very tempting to come back, but we will be shopping around for complete amenity satisfaction before booking here again.\n\nPersonal note: The front desk staff were an acceptable level of nice as a whole, although they still subscribe to traditional, gendered greetings (Mr., Ms., etc.). I was referred to as both during my stay from various staff members, and although I don't mind being misgendered due to my androgynous presentation and gender non-conformity, I would highly advise the staff here to not use gendered greetings. Someone who is transitioning or simply not conforming to gender norms can be especially sensitive to being misgendered, and it can cause a whole host of emotional responses. ComicCon attracts people from all walks of life, and being more inclusive can really set a business apart from its competition.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

(Please note, this is on top of a resort fee). The facility fee included all the items you\u2019d expect in a basic hotel stay; wifi, gym and coffee. I scoured the booking website before booking and could not find mention of this anywhere. I cannot believe we had to pay this and have never been charged this whilst staying at a hotel in New York before. The staff were rude and blunt when dealing with this. \n\nThe second and biggest issue was the street this hotel was unfortunately located on. Please do some research on the opioid crisis especially in New York City. This hotel is on one of the worst streets for drug addicts in the whole city. During our 5 night stay, we saw someone inject drugs, a group of people smoke crack outside the hotel entrance, and a drug deal taking place. Maybe it\u2019s because we aren\u2019t used to this in England, but we were all really shocked and scared walking to our hotel, especially after dark. We ended up getting an Uber back if it was late as we didn\u2019t feel safe.\n\nMy final negative is relating to the lighting. It is SO dark in the rooms.

Luckily it did exist and it was new and clean and beautiful. The staff was wonderfully friendly and accommodating, they offered a discounted rate at a nearby garage, hot coffee, cold water, a clean and quiet room. It was absolutely wonderful. I would absolutely stay again and look for this hotel in other cities we travel to. What a lucky find.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I had read some reviews where guests were unhappy that the room charge was different from the charge when booking as the facility fees\/taxes etc were not included when booking, but I checked with hotel before arrival how much the total would be including all fees, so there were no surprises when I handed over my card.\n\nThe rooms are nice, clean, with comfortable beds. We got two Comfort Double rooms (2 double beds in each room) which were tight and left little space to walk around the beds. But they were fine. The bathroom\/shower is compact, but modern and very good. The only downsides  were the extremely noisy aircon units, they are like having a diesel car in the room. If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs.\n\nThe hotel is situated within a 5 min walk of Time Square, and 10 mins to Macy\u2019s. There is good shopping close by and a really good pub across the street called The Joyce, the food there is excellent, But, brace yourself for the amount of drug addicts who congregate on 39th and surrounding streets, this part of the city from Time Square to Penn Station has a rep for drug dealing, and unfortunately it is all too visible at all times of the day\/night.\n\nOverall we enjoyed our stay at the Pestana CR7, I would recommend this hotel, but the area leaves a bit to be desired.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms were really small (it's New York so that's pretty much the norm everywhere), but it lacked certain things you'd hope to see in a hotel room. The fridge was super small and never got very cold and there wasn't a microwave which I would have liked to see. Also there are no ice machines on premise and you have to call for someone to bring you some. Another odd thing is that we couldn't get any of the outlets to charge our phones with multiple known good power supplies and charging cables. I'd plug in and go to bed with it at 30% for example and wake up six hours later and it was only at 38% charged. \n\nThe staff in the lobby were always very friendly and welcoming and the few times we needed to have anyone come bring us something they were nice and accommodating. My main issue is that we had to call to have someone up to service our room. Yes, there were days when we had the door tag set to no, but we would set some garbage outside the door yet when they'd come to clean other rooms on our floor they never took it away. When we did have the tag set to yes no one ever came in to clean while we were out and about. Again, we had to call down and ask for someone to come in to clean and restock the towels.\n\nThe hotel states they have a restaurant that offers breakfast (not included and you'd have to pay) and bar for guests, but this alleged restaurant was non-existent and all they offered were some free day old bagels and croissants each morning. Also the bar was only open on the weekends and we never really utilized it as we'd be out doing other stuff and they closed rather early.\n\nThere was a gym with a Peloton bike in the basement which we were stoked to see (we both drink the Kool-Aid and were excited to be able to get in our daily workouts), but it needs to be recalibrated badly as it is very off. The basement area where the gym is at also has a weird smell to it. It looked clean, but just had this off putting smell to it. Musky bleach would be the best way to describe it.\n\nAll in all, like I said for the price and the location I am not going to nitpick and gripe too much, but I am sure with some more research there are other options around their price point that are much better.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Gym is clean and with modern and working equipment (treadmill, Peloton bike, elliptical, free weights). \n\nCons:\n- Inefficient reservation protocol. I booked a room directly through their website and needed to change to upgrade to a bigger room. I called the hotel directly and was told to call a number in Portugal that handles the reservations. No luck, noone was answering for more than an hour. I emailed and did not get a response. I used the chat link in the site and had to wait for more than 20 minutes before I can reach someone. But was also disconnected. Reached out through IG and finally had a success there. \n- The hairdryer in our room was not working. It took an hour before we can get our hands on a working hairdryer (calling the reception twice and going down to the reception twice as well). \n- There is a coffee pot in the common room but the 3 days I was there, I did not managed to get a hot coffee. It is either empty or cold.  \n- Rooms are small, hard to open up multiple suitcases. Also, there isn't enough light in the room.

I also don't think the facility fee really offers anything significant for the price, especially for tourists. Tea\/coffee in the room and wifi are basic hotel amenities that should be included in the price - the fitness facility is fine but not something that interested us and yet we had to pay for it - maybe this should be an optional extra cost? $25 a night on top of the hundreds of dollars we had already paid just seems excessive.Overall, despite a fairly positive experience,  the facility fees and what they offer mean we wouldn't stay with this specific hotel again","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

When we first got to the hotel the woman working could not find our reservation. Then after a long time of searching and a very slow pace she found it but told us we could not pay in cash, which we thought was weird. Our cards were not working because of international blockage and she would not take cash only credit. Finally our card worked and additionally we had to leave a $200 deposit. She said we would be refunded on our card and could pay in cash at checkout. However when we got to check out we were told the the payment was already processed and we could not pay with cash like we were told and the staff didn\u2019t even offer a compensation for lying to us. Not only did we have this horrible experience checking in and checking out, but the room was dirty, the carpet was not vacuumed, the towels were stained and we even found a pair of a previous customers socks, which shows that this room was not thoroughly cleaned. We didn\u2019t inspect much more but I\u2019m sure we would\u2019ve found more disgusting things. Overall I do not recommend this hotel at all.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":23510531,"title":"Great stay!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-06-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I booked this hotel for a work trip before I started reading the reviews and got REALLY nervous after the recent negative comments. However, I was pleasantly surprised with my stay. \n\nHere are a list of things I think some of the other reviewers got wrong:\n\n1. I\u2019m going to guess that some of the past reviewers did not read the details. I booked through hotels.com AND skimmed through the amenities on the website. I found the information to be pretty straightforward, including the amenities fees. And the hotel sends you daily emails leading up to the trip confirming and reconfirming any costs and updates for your trip. \n----Any trip you plan, you have a set of non-negotiables, you do your research, and adjust your expectations. Just read the details. If you read something that you know you won\u2019t tolerate, then look for other options. \u2028\n\n2. I truly believe you are not going to find spacious accommodations in NYC unless you are willing to pay extra for that kind of space. With that being said, the hallways are small and you may hear people get on or off the elevator\u2014 like most hotels in major cities. If you want something quiet, then you\u2019re better off gambling with Airbnb or booking a place in Jersey City or Hoboken. But even during my stay, I did not experience much noise in the hallways, and my room was directly across from the elevators. \u2028\n\n3. Customer service was amazing. I did not experience any of the negative things that past reviewers wrote. I believe the staff is truly listening and working to address the recent reviews. But I\u2019m also sure if you treat the employees like the human beings they are, then maybe you will see that they ARE trying to help you but it can be hard to tell when you are yelling at them for things that could be out of their control bc they have management to answer to and if you ever worked in the service industry, you would know this. Everyone was great. Including Emily, Destiny, Marilyn, Ryan, and whoever made me an iced americano one morning even though it was not on the menu. \n------ And even well before the trip, I would call and ask a few one off questions (like the cost of incidentals=$100\/day and etc\u2026). The phone was ALWAYS answered after 1-2 rings by a real employee and I was never put on hold.  During my stay, I felt comfortable walking up to the front desk bc they never made me feel like I was bothering them. \u2028\n\n4. The nespresso machine was one of the reasons I booked this hotel. I loved it!\n\nSome things to note:\n- Not all rooms have a desk. I knew the rooms were going to be small after reading reviews, but I was surprised that I did not have one in my room. It ended up being fine because it just forced me to get out of the hotel and enjoy the city. There are plenty of coffeeshops around with wifi and a great working set up in the lobby. Most of the time, you will find others working in the lobby as well, so it is really quiet for a public space. \n\n- My room did not have a microwave so if you are hoping to \u201ceat in\u201d then this might not be the place for you. But there was plenty of fridge space even with the pre-stocked minibar \n\nOverall my stay was great.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We arrived 24 hours late, exhausted from our horrendous flight trauma of having to go from a direct flight to two flights. Turning up at 16.30pm 24 hours later to be told our room wasn't ready. It's 16.30 and it's not ready? I get they can't hold our room as our flight was cancelled but not to be ready when we informed them that we would arrive (24 hours later) I think is terrible. (we also wasn't given a refund for the night we wasn't there, which I get) \nWe paid for a superior king room, yet the room is tiny and at the back of the building, when we questioned this the answer we got was its new york. Ey? Ive stayed in new york before and paid for a three star standard room and it was a lot bigger. Don't be so condescending with the answer of its New York! We said it's a comfort plus looking at your photos on your website and it states that all comfort plus are situated at the back of building. Yet we are at the back of the building and told we're In a superior king?\nYou get one bottle of water for the entire stay (1 bottle per room) \nTea bags don't get refilled, when asked at reception if they get refilled we got a reply of I'm not sure? Yes we was then given a box of tea to choose from but only had one breakfast tea bag. Shower had a long black hair on the tiles when we turned up, on our last night this is still here, near the top of the shower head, also a piece of skin is on the carpet!  (vile) and still not been vacuumed. The shower head was hanging out that we had to put back ourselves. \nThis superior king that you pay extra for is in the corner at the back behind the lift, therefore all night and morning you hear the arrival \"ding\" noise.\nIf you stay here don't pay for superior, pay for comfort room as the same room.\nGood luck","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Hyatt takes stealing seriously.. unfortunately, Pestana does not. after waiting 4 hours for them to check, they could not find our shopping bag. it just seems so shady that not only did they charge me for an item that i did not take in the hotel room, but they also somehow can't find my bag full of newly purchased items? they said that it was likely thrown away... which makes no sense especially since the items in there were clearly not garbage.\n\ni definitely won't be back at this location or any other Pestana hotels.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
