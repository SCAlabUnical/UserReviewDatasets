My King Studio was outstanding with it's wall of windows that afforded an abundance of natural light and stunning views of the cityscape. Wood floors, beige palette, blue popping fabrics, working desk area and let's not forget the wild & crazy mural over the headboard. The spa-like bath was outfitted with rain shower and heated floors. The 23 Grand is a geometry of spaces, an urban oasis with a collage of indoor\/outdoor areas designed for communal dining activities. The Grand componentry is structured with a glass-enclosed dining room, a luxe lounge with an accompanying terrace, several outdoor elevated areas and a private event space. This eatery serves international flavors with a Mediterranean twist and the menu displays items such as : Tuna Carpaccio, Cauliflower Steak, Breaded Tile Fish and more......I selected a delicious duo of Butternut Squash Soup and Pappardelle. 18 floors up is the Jimmy,  a rooftop space featuring an outdoor pool deck and is surrounded by large windows for a panoramic view while sipping cocktails. The Jumping Jack is an eatery serving all day parts, configured in a coffee-cum-cocktail  lounge format. There isn't a spa but other wellness perks include a state-of-the-art gym. The sensational Aire Ancient Baths (& spa) is a quick 5 minute walk from the hotel.\nSo, if you are looking for a hotel that is remarkably different from any other one in NYC...........then try the......... Modernhaus Soho..........a vibe that sets it apart.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

The problem is that the hotel has a thin veneer of quality - and when something breaks down, it appears that the system doesn't manage it well.  The first night we checked in, the room was insanely hot - no wonder, because the thermostat was set at 90 degrees!  So we opened our windows and rushed out to our dinner reservations, getting back late.  We got ready for bed, closed the windows (the traffic noise was extremely loud even on the 5th floor), turned the thermostat back on at a nice 68, settled into sleep, and I was awake 30 minutes later because the temps had soared back up to 82 - and were continuing to increase.  OK, so it was 1 AM, my 18 year-old daughter was sleeping through all of this, what to do?  According to the front desk the next morning, who chided me for not calling for maintenance immediately, I was supposed to - I don't know, get dressed, wake up my kid and get her dressed, and then wait for a maintenance person to show up... hopefully...to fix our thermostat in the wee hours of the morning.  Instead, I lost a whole night of sleep because our options were: 1) open windows and open curtains for cool air flow, with major NYC traffic noise from the busy intersection below (why must everyone honk constantly???) and bright lights flooding in, or 2) windows shut and quiet, but 90 degrees.  We did call for maintenance at 7:30 AM using the very helpful texting approach, and the repair was done some time after 1 PM, so that was nice.  We also got a $14 refund on a $600+ charge for that first night.  The room was basically useless to me, but I paid well for the privilege.  Oh, and the place is seriously in need of sprucing up.  Our room was clean, but my note above about the thin veneer wasn't just a metaphor (see photos).  I got much better sleep my second night, so when this place works as it's supposed to, it's perfectly fine.            ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My mom and I were greeted by Andrew who had the best energy the second we walked in. He went above and beyond for us and by the end of the trip he felt like a close friend who we did not want to leave! We initially had only planned on staying at ModernHaus SoHo for a night (because we wanted to explore other hotels and neighborhoods) but we ended up staying an extra night because of how much we enjoyed Andrew and the entire hotel and its amenities. We would have stayed a third night if they had availability, but they were all sold out and for a good reason. The hotel itself is MAGIC. The rooftop pool and bar was one of the most beautiful and trendy places I\u2019ve ever been. We went up there for sunset and got some amazing photos of the skyline and a delicious watermelon spicy margarita. We danced a little and loved the crowd because it was a mix of younger and older people. Music was great. Then there\u2019s the restaurant bar Twenty Three Grand where I had truly the most delicious spicy skinny margarita I have ever had. The restaurant itself has the coolest decor and the best curried spinach dip that we ended up getting twice because it was so good. The rooms are PHENOMENAL for the price and size. They are a bit small but ended up feeling so big because of the glass bathroom walls (there\u2019s a curtain that goes up and down for privacy). Andrew checked in on us throughout the day via text which I love and was so convenient. We will be retiring to ModernHaus in the future 1000% will be bringing my boyfriend back with me. And they are dog friendly! So I\u2019ll be bringing my dog next time too. I can\u2019t say enough amazing things about this place I did not want to leave. Oh and it\u2019s in a good safe place that feels open and clean. And there\u2019s a great bakery across the street and just a short walk from West Village for shopping and food. 20\/10 recommend.

Unfortunately, we did not get a chance to dine at Twenty-Three Grand, the adjoining restaurant at the hotel. \n\nAs they say, first impressions go a LONG WAY and I want to especially call-out three individuals on Modernhaus\u2019 Guest Services Team: Kristi, Andrew, and Eric. I\u2019ll begin with Eric because when our Uber dropped us off in front of the hotel (from the airport), he immediately recognized that we had a TON of luggage and met us out in the middle of the street to help us unload and get everything situated during the check-in process. \n\nNext, big shout outs to Andrew and Kristi! \n\nWe were genuinely greeted upon crossing the threshold of the hotel and they made us feel like VIPs and old friends at the same time. As a result of this, I immediately felt at home and was super excited about our extended stay. This, and one of our other friends was due to join us and also stay at Modernhaus - in her own room - and Andrew went out of his way to make sure she got everything she needed because we were also in possession of some of her luggage. Andrew was masterful at helping manage some of the many \u201cmoving pieces\u201d between dealing with us and our soon-to-check-in friend. This, and Andrew hooked her up with some of the hotel\u2019s special and delicious cookies! \n\nWe were fortunate enough to see Kristi throughout most of our stay at Modernhaus, and where do I start? She was super helpful and informative on where to eat in SoHo\/Tribeca, plus she pointed us to the hotel\u2019s published list of food recommendations. In addition, Kristi satisfied my request for the hotel\u2019s special cookies, not once, but twice because I have a MASSIVE sweet tooth. Every time we saw Kristi, me and my wife often walked away smiling and feeling GOOD. \n\nAlso, Kristi was always spot on with her recommendations. For example, when we wanted a drink at the hotel\u2019s adjoining restaurant on-property - Twenty-Three Grand - Kristi recommended we try the Mai Tai. I opted to have not one, but two Mai Tai drinks\u2026and they were both outstanding!! When we needed an iron and some extra hangars, Kristi made sure we got them\u2026and they arrived with minutes of being requested. No question ever seemed too simple, or need felt minor, Kristi was ON IT! Most important, what\u2019s not to like about a member of Guest Services giving you an initial tour of the hotel and walking you to your room upon check in? Kristi definitely made Modernhaus feel like home, and she is a shining example of an entire team of people at Modernhaus - who\u2019s names I did not get or capture - who exuded top notch professionalism and service. \n\nWell done and I shall return the next time work & pleasure brings me to New York. Thank you, THANK YOU!! \n\n\u2028\u2028PS: The music played in this hotel was on point! From Jumpin\u2019 Jacks to the elevators, to Twenty-Three Grand, to Jimmy\u2019s. ALL GOOD!!

The floors and the bathroom seem quite old. The lighting in the bathroom is terrible. Perhaps the worst part of the room is the air conditioning system which is either on full blast and freezing or is off. The breakfast, which was included in our room, was very good.

This property is strategically positioned around the corner from artist's lofts, art galleries, designer shops and more of the spirit of Soho. The Modern pays tribute to the neighborhood by showcasing numerous and extravagant artworks on it's premises.\n\nI enjoyed my generously sized, nicely appointed Horizon weighing in at over 650 sq. ft. It featured a spacious sitting room, L-configured couch, mounted TV and 2 walls of floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a vast panorama of Soho. The room was equipped with high-tech appliances like blinds that went up and down automatically. The bathroom was fitted with a walk-in rainfall shower, separate bath and all the accoutrements.\n\nThe Modern sports 3 dining options that cater to every taste and occasion. The principle restaurant, the Veranda, serves up a dining experience under the stars amid breathtaking views. This eatery boasts a modern American menu with super food inventions from the efforts of Michelin-starred chef George Mendes and his crew. For starters I  had some of the best sourdough bread I have tasted. A choice of mixed Chicken Confit was a tasty homerun. My sweet tooth was amply satisfied by the Strawberry & Rhubarb dessert concoction and my Pomegranate  Moscow Mule cocktail kicked like a mule. Jimmy's, a rooftop pool deck is a perfect place for handcrafted cocktails (seasonal) while Jumping Jacks acts as the hotels art-filled gathering hole. There is a modern gym equipped with Peleton bikes that were ideal for my exercise regime.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a hotel that  embraces the spirit of Soho as well as a museum full of artwork and Michelin caliber epicurean delights..............then try the ..........................

All arrows pointed to ModernHaus Soho. In fact, I learned about MHS from an article in Architectural Digest and compared\/contrasted with similar properties\u2026the large size of the rooms and rave reviews are what won me over. \n\nI came in with high expectations but what I didn\u2019t expect was warm, friendly service and an exceptional restaurant. True to the reviews, MHS is located in the heart of Hipster Heaven featuring endless shopping and culinary options but more importantly, it\u2019s situated next door to a 24 hr Boar\u2019s Head deli\/convenience store that supplies of your needs and across the street from a well-rated coffee shop.  \n\nThe clean, contemporary rooms, featuring floor to ceiling windows and Le Labo Santal 33 products, are LARGE by NYC standards. The King Studio w\/ View was 380sq ft compared to the average of 150-200sq ft for a similar room at hotels of the same caliber yet pricing was the same. \n\nHotel guests are treated to drink tickets at one of their 2 bars. I highly suggest redeeming yours at their fine dining restaurant Veranda. The lighting is epic, the decor is sumptuous, the drinks are lavish, and the bartenders are engaging. \n\nThe front desk team and bellmen were outstanding! They were accommodating to our request for a higher floor, kept our bags for hours after our checkout, made fantastic recommendations and were super friendly. Brayden suggested we go to nearby lounge Butterfly at SixtySoho for a nightcap and we had a quintessential NY experience!

Kristy Maynard, in particular, went out of her way to ensure that our needs were not only met, but far exceeded.

The property itself was very clean, modern, had fantastic art on display, and was in the perfect location for us to wander SoHo and to further explore the West Village, Greenwich Village, Chelsea, LES, TriBeCa, and Battery Park.  It was easy enough to pop up to MOMA to take in some art and over to Al Hirschfeld to catch a matin\u00e9e, but nice to return to a much quieter, cleaner part of the city afterwards.

I was staying there during Fashion Week, which means that a lot of downtown hotels were particularly full - but also means that, with taxes and fees, my very very basic hotel room was close to $800\/night.  \n\nSize-wise, it's about average for NYC (i.e., tiny) - about the exact same size and layout as a standard room at the Public Hotel (where I usually stay), under 300 square feet but well laid out.  The bed and pillows are comfortable, the shower is decent, and the blackout curtains are very effective.  Rooms are clean and well-maintained, and maid service is quick and effective.  The location is good, too, on the southern edge of Soho near Tribeca.\n\nIt is also near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which is the problem - that location means that you get a constant symphony of horns 24\/7.  I was on the 3d floor, and I'm guessing the traffic noise was less obtrusive on higher floors.  However, when I was in the lobby waiting for an Uber my last day, two guests came down to the front desk complaining that the noise from the rooftop bar made it impossible for them to sleep (the front desk ended up moving them to a lower floor).  So it seems like noise presents a no-win situation - lower floors get you noise from the Holland Tunnel, upper floors get you noise from the bar.  \n\nI would say the noise from other rooms and the hallway were very minimal, and that a certain amount of street noise is common in NYC hotels.  But the Public Hotel and the Bowery Hotel, for example, tend to be quieter, and for $800\/night I'd expect the most extreme noiseproofing possible.  So I probably won't be coming back here, unless I can get a much better rate (and bring good earplugs).","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Having read the reviews, we were very excited for our few days at ModernHaus Soho. The hotel itself is beautifully designed, our bedroom was perfect (queen modern room) with an amazing view of the city and the Le Labo soaps were a great addition! Overall it was great stay, although I would point out a few things - it is a party hotel (we were woken up one our last night by guests smoking weed, and the smell filling out our room. Not something we had planned for\/ wanted given the price of the hotel per night); \nthe rooftop bar\/ pool is run by separate management to the hotel - it closes early to hotel guests and then reopens to the public. I would advise checking on the times before your stay to avoid any let downs or surprises; \nAnother point to mention is the cafe\/ restaurant, Jumpin Jacks. We had breakfast included, which had very limited options and there seemed to be a disconnect with hotel staff and the Jumpin Jacks staff as to what was included.\n\nThe rooftop also turns very much into a club at night, so avoid having a room near the top floor, which other reviews also point out. Our room was on floor 15 and I brought this up at check-in, but  we were assured that we would not be affected by the rooftop noise, however on our last night, the music was unbearably loud at 1-2am. Thankfully the night team were very accommodating and moved us to a lower level (floor 7), where we couldn\u2019t hear the music or noise at all. As we were moving rooms  (after 1am) a group of drunk people were sat by the elevators on our floor making lots of noise too. Also, before relocating to the 7th floor, The night team kindly offered a room on the 5th floor to begin with, which wasn\u2019t impacted by the rooftop music etc, but the next door room was blasting their own music (at around 1am or so), so they gave us the room on the 7th floor. \n Again a reflection of this hotel being very much a place for those who want to party. \nDespite all of this, the hotel staff were extremely empathetic and dealt with this professionally and without any issues. A big shout out to Gisella and Sheffi for all their help and understanding. They really turned our trip back around and couldn\u2019t be more appreciative to them.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1785018,"title":"Disappointed","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-06-08","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"Let\u2019s start with Check In, we were looked after by Christy who was lovely and friendly. She asked if we were planning on visiting the rooftop bar and we said most likely. She excitedly provided us with some drink cards and said to have a cocktail and mentioned we definitely should go up there during sunset as it\u2019s beautiful. We thanked her for the drinks cards. I enquired about the rooftop pool and checked if it was reopening on Saturday 21st as per the booking.com website and she mentioned that it won\u2019t be opening until Memorial day weekend. When I found this out, I was very disappointed as I had planned to stay at ModernHaus to utilise the rooftop pool in the mornings over the weekend. I even messaged via Booking.com to ask about the rooftop pool a couple weeks prior to check in and no one replied to my message.\n\n \n\nAfter coming back to the room after our first night out, we noticed there was a leak in the bathroom from the ceiling. It had soaked the bath mat. As it was in the early hours of the morning we left it. When we woke up the leak had stopped, but I still alerted Christy at the front desk. I showed her the video and she said she will get someone to come up and have a look at it. No one came up to have a look.\n\n \n\nWe alerted Christy again on Sunday to let her know the leak was still happening and it had kept my partner up because of it. She apologised and thought because she didn\u2019t hear from us everything was all good. She moved us to the same room on the level below and gave us two more drink cards. After a day of exploring NYC we thought we could finally use those drink cards we received at the rooftop bar and watch the sunset before going out to dinner. We get to the door and was told there was a private event on and it will reopen to the public at 9pm. To our disappointment we then opted to go for a drink at Jumping Jacks. I asked for a mocktail and was told they didn\u2019t have any and they could make me a lemonade instead. Once again disappointed but accepted a lemonade.\n\n \n\nOn our last night in NYC we made sure we made time to go up to the rooftop bar for drinks to watch the sunset and to use the two drink cards. We ordered our drinks and provided the drink cards and the bartender said these can\u2019t be redeemed here. We were certain that Christy gave us these drink cards to be used at the rooftop bar as we only spoke about the rooftop bar during check in. Once again very disappointed.\n\n \n\nAlso, our bottled water was not replenished daily and had to call concierge more than once to organise.\n\n \n\nAfter extensive research on where to stay in NYC I opted for ModernHaus and was very excited. But after our stay, I must say we were very underwhelmed and did not enjoy our experience at ModernHaus.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was very nice (they provide you a lock so you can stop during you ride).

Nevertheless the food is good (the pancakes are HUGE) and they provide you vouchers for free coffee at jumpin jacks in addition to expresso machines in the room.\n\nThe rooftop is a bit crowded in the evening because of Jimmy's bar and i recommand to use it during the day (when the pool is open and reserved for guest only). \n\nThanks again to all the staff of Modernhaus Soho, i will visit you again in august !:)\n\nNicolas","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

But there are serious issues. Our rate included breakfast and the breakfast venue was serviced by servers who did not know what the included breakfast was so we chose the wrong items all three mornings we were there. We would have had to pay out of pocket for these items but they were comped when I explained the situation to the desk clerk. On the third morning, no one (apparently) was scheduled to work so a lone, harassed woman had to hold down the fort while we waited and waited for breakfast. She was lovely, the situation was not. The room itself was fine, no temperature or noise issues but the mattress was a disaster. As an older person with back issues, it meant very poor sleep for the whole stay due to back pain. If you are sensitive to too-soft mattresses with poor support, I would stay away. Since it seems most of the clientele consists of the young and hip, perhaps this doesn't matter for most but I would approach this hotel cautiously if you are not in that demographic. A minor issue was that, while there was adequate closet space, there was no chest or other location for non-hanging clothes, meaning you have to live out of your suitcase. We did eat in the restaurant for dinner and enjoyed it but probably will not stay here again.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

And a few of the staff are capable of providing great customer service. But that is where it ends.\n\nFirst off, our flight home was cancelled and we had to stay in NYC an extra day. 2 weeks out, I tried calling them to see if we could extend our stay by a day. I was told that there wasn't any availability, but that they'd have someone from the front desk call me in the next 24 hours to see if there was something they could do. I waited. No call back.\n\nCalled again, got the exact same message from them. And the exact same result. No call back.\n\nI gave up and just booked the TWA Hotel for one night (which was so much fun...). Unlike this place.\n\nRather than write an essay, I'll just summarize:\n- There is no place outside the room to just hang out that isn't a bar. You can't go anywhere near the great sculpture on the terrace or up to the roof top unless it is open for business. The only way I was able to take my teenage kids up to see the view was to sneak them up there and then get in trouble.\n- We said we had 4 people staying (my wife, myself, and our 2 kids). Yet they were surprised when I asked why there wasn't bedding for the pull out couch.\n- WiFi is HORRIBLE. Ended up getting constantly kicked off and when it worked it was slower than a 3G connection. Complained multiple times with standard \"try again\" with no changes what so ever.\n- In room lighting is task lighting only. So, if you're trying to get ready to go out, good luck locating items in your bags or checking how you look in the mirror.\n- HVAC in the room inconsistent. Constantly freezing or boiling no matter what we did.\n- Flooring is incredibly slippery. Getting up at night to tend to something always led to me slipping and falling on my ass.\n\nNot recommended.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

For some reason, on my most recent trip  I decided to stay in a different part of the city and I'm so glad I did.  Not only for the great vibe of Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods (Little Italy, Chinatown, the West Village, etc.) but for the experience of staying at Modernhaus.  \nNow, \"experience\" is a slightly overused word in the hotel and the restaurant industry but in the case of Modernhaus that word is not hyperbole.  You're getting more than a hotel room to return to after a long day of exploring the city.  With its beautifully designed  public spaces and fabulous art collection throughout the building, you're inspired from the moment you entire the hotel by the obvious passion and creativity of the folks who designed this unique property.\nThe staff carry out the mission of the hotel's developers by providing the type of genuine warmth and hospitality not often found in NYC.  Mike at the front desk was incredibly welcoming and helpful during my stay.  The doormen were great guys, always helpful with directions and a quick chat whether I was coming or going.  The staff at Jumping Jacks and JIMMY were very professional and attentive.  My only regret is that I never had an opportunity to dine or have a cocktail at Veranda.  I did walk around the restaurant one morning before they opened and it was an absolutely beautiful space.  The Kaws sculpture featured in Veranda is incredibly unique and a real \"I don't think we're in Kansas, anymore\" moment when you first spot it. \nI don't want to gloss over the restaurant and bar outlets without mentioning the chef.  Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but based on the meals I enjoyed during my stay, he is clearly very talented.  I had his version of a Portuguese custard tart (I forget the exact menu name)  one morning at breakfast which was simply outstanding.    \nI'm sure many other reviews will mention the rooftop lounge and pool area.  Needless to say the views are remarkable.  On the evening we were up there, a storm had just passed through and we got to watch the residual lighting show to the west over North Jersey.  It was spectacular!\nLooking forward to my next trip to NYC and will definitely be staying at Modernhaus again.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

I love the swanky, sexy art-deco style balanced with a clean, modern look. The rooms were clean and had nice extras such as a Nespresso machine, thrice filtered water in glass bottles, robes, slippers, and a full-size mirror in the closet door. Everyone at the hotel is so kind, and I truly felt like a valued guest. We were given a complementary upgrade to a better view and 2 free drink credits at any bar except the rooftop club. The drinks at the Veranda were awesome, and the vibe there was perfect for couples. I was a bit disappointed by the pool. First of all, the pool deck was tiny. There were a dozen chairs (or less), and everything was very close together. Second, the hours aren't great. The pool closes at 2PM on weekends and 4PM on weekdays. For a 3PM check-in, that guarantees you won't be able to enjoy the pool on your first night. On top of that, the bar opens at 1:30. I think that enjoying a drink with lunch is perfectly reasonable, especially while sunbathing on an NYC rooftop. It was hot! The only frozen drink that they had was a fros\u00e9, but I think that they should extend that to daiquiris, frozen margaritas, or pi\u00f1a coladas for summer pool drinks. It gets very, very hot up there and if they're charging a resort fee, they should have resort drinks. Breakfast was pretty good. I got the avocado toast, which was great, but my boyfriend didn't love his eggs. There's a really nice backgammon table in the breakfast lounge and club chairs for people looking to do work. This is definitely not a hotel for families, but I loved my experience on a romantic vacation. It would also be a great choice for business travelers looking for some fun at the bars and club within the hotel. The ACE 123 lines are a couple of minutes from the hotel, and the 456 NWR DF trains are about a 10 minute walk.

What we found at Modernhaus was just the opposite.  Every staff member (almost!...see below) that we interacted with was friendly, accommodating and just a pleasure to deal with.  After an early check-in, we headed to our room which, on the 16th floor had great city and river views.  The room was small, but modern and nicely furnished.  The bathroom and shower setup were great and the bed comfortable.   \n\nWe changed into bathing suits and headed up to the rooftop pool.   The rooftop and pool are tiny but just perfect.  With only about 15 people up there, they were \"at capacity\" but, Max, the lifeguard\/attendant was fantastic and got us some stools and said he'd move us once some chairs freed up.   All the other guests were so nice and everyone was chatting and having a good time.  It was not a stuffy vibe at all.   After a few minutes, we secured some chairs and ordered a bottle of wine and some lunch.  Getting the food and drink was a bit slow but the food was delicious.  \n\nThe pool was cold which was amazing for this 100 degree day and we spent the next few hours lounging, reading, sipping wine and taking the occasional dip in the pool to cool off.   The pool closes at 4 to then reopen to the public as a lounge at night.  \n\nDinner at Veranda was fantastic and again the service was exemplary.  There's a ton of restaurants in the neighborhood, but if you're staying in the hotel, I highly recommend a meal there.  Drinks, appetizers and main courses were all above expectations.   It's a diverse menu with Portugese flair.  It was raining and lightning throughout our entire meal and the all glass ceiling made for an interesting sideshow while we ate. \n\nThe next morning we went up to the roof around 8am to ensure that we got a lounge chair, but it never really got filled up. We had requested a late checkout so we can lounge for a few hours.  Unlike the day before, the lifeguard\/attendant was less than stellar barely acknowledging guests, not being particularly helpful and not hustling at all like Max was the day before. \n\nAll in all, it was an excellent stay in a great neighborhood with friendly, impeccable service.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Unfortunately, inept staff put a big damper on our stay.\n\nFirst, the positives: having just opened in April 2021, the renovations are apparent. The Bauhaus aesthetic is a welcome departure from the previous worn and overly minimalist look. Throughout the hotel, from the rooms to the restaurants, there's fun art paired with clean lines and warm interior decor. We quite enjoyed our Skyline King Studio with views of Manhattan and we'll always have a soft spot for the Jimmy rooftop, where we took engagement photos years ago.\n\nOn to the service: three months after opening, it's hard to believe there are still so many hiccups. When I asked a staff member to clarify the names of the hotel bars, he had no clue. When I asked another staff member whether I could have a drink at The Back Bar, I was told you need reservations; he assured me that he made a reservation on my behalf but when I tried to be seated, I was informed that there was a private party. It took three calls to get through to room service, and yet another follow-up call for our order (a hummus plate and bottle of champagne) to get to our room -- nearly an hour later. Breakfast service at the Jumpin Jacks restaurant was similarly slow. And the bartender at the rooftop was atrocious.\n\nAll in all, an incredibly disappointing stay, with service far below what we were expecting.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

The rooms are nice and the location is great but for the price that includes a sneaky 45$ \"service charge\", and ironically we were disappointed in the service. The service charge has \"perks\" that we found to be not worth it (wine and cheese for one hour which was cheap wine, cut up cheddar, and crackers as an example). The room service is overpriced as room service often is but then on top of that there is gratuity and a $10 service fee built it, making it around $32 for a BLT. If we are paying a $45 a night service charge, why do we need to pay yet more money just to actually get service in the hotel? On top of that, when the time came when we actually needed service as an incident at the hotel caused damage to our belongings, no one apologized or tried to make the situation better, only doing the bare minimum when we asked for help. I had to throw out some of my belongings and actually lost money as a result of their poor service. We followed up via e-mail and we still have not gotten a response more than a week later. Where is this service charge coming in hand now? Also the bed was uncomfortable and the room was loud. The glass windows, location, and shower were very nice and the most redeeming quality but also comparable to other places we have stayed in NYC.\n\nBottom line, if you want luxury you won't get it from here despite paying luxury prices, and their whole concept of \"service\" can create a bad vibe for your NYC vacation.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

To begin, my online reservation, although confirmed on the website, was not found upon check-in. The receptionist was kind enough to help and sort things out, and luckily a room similar to what I reserved was available for the 7 days we were to spend in New York. The room, although advertised as a corner studio, implying some form of spaciousness, was surprisingly small, measuring at around 300 square feet. While the view from the room was pleasing, and the presence of floor-to-ceiling windows helped, the room still felt cramped, especially with two suitcases around. The hotel's day-to-day housekeeping was carried out without a hitch, however any other services beyond that were frustrating. Orders for water bottles and in-room dining took long to be brought up, sometimes requiring more than one follow-up call. Not to mention the very limited in-room dining options, which disappear after 11 PM, requiring you to order food from outside. As for the available amenities, there aren't many. The hotel lobby is relatively small, with a few couches, at which you can have complimentary thermos coffee in a paper cup and scones in the morning, and complimentary bottled wine, saltine crackers, and one kind of cheese in the evening - which feels somewhat cheap. The only redeeming factor for The James SOHO is its amazing location, which puts you at walking distance from most interesting attractions in lower Manhattan, the east village and west village, in addition to its vibrant rooftop lounge.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

En effet, la r\u00e9ponse de l'h\u00f4tel semble m\u00eame indiquer que les d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ments de leurs clients leur importent peu. Leur objectif est de surpasser les attentes de leurs clients mais ce n'est qu'une phrase \u00e9crite en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation n\u00e9gative. La strat\u00e9gie est celle du one shot dans une ville o\u00f9 ils peuvent se le permettre. Alors ne tombez pas dans leur pi\u00e8ge et lisez mon avis.\nCertes, une belle vue (si vous prenez une chambre co\u00fbteuse comme la mienne) et un emplacement pratique mais rien ne vaut un service 4 \u00e9toiles que vous n'aurez pas dans cet h\u00f4tel. En arrivant, mauvaise communication de mon offre Booking o\u00f9 ils allaient facturer 2 fois mon petit-d\u00e9jeuner. J'ai d'ailleurs d\u00fb expliquer plusieurs fois pendant le s\u00e9jour que cela ne devait pas \u00eatre factur\u00e9 car leur organisation est complexe (la gestion de la cuisine qui reste allum\u00e9e et cerise sur le g\u00e2teau, un ing\u00e9nieur qui ne r\u00e9sout pas les probl\u00e8mes. L'h\u00f4tel est v\u00e9tuste et son \u00e9tat s'aggravera probablement avec le temps et les r\u00e9parations n\u00e9glig\u00e9es. Des clients m'ont permis de d\u00e9couvrir que New York a son propre Spring Break en hiver (Winter Break peut-\u00eatre ? ) car des clients ont r\u00e9serv\u00e9 plusieurs chambres \u00e0 mon \u00e9tage et ont fait la f\u00eate pendant de heures la nuit, dans leur chambre et le couloir. Mes diff\u00e9rents appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques n'ont pas pu motiver la r\u00e9ception \u00e0 faire un suivi professionnel de ces clients sans aucun respect. Pas de restaurant \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel donc le petit-d\u00e9jeuner doit se prendre dans la chambre ou \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de l'h\u00f4tel. Un soir, la TV ne fonctionnait pas: inutile de vois dire que l'ing\u00e9nieur n'a rien r\u00e9gl\u00e9 ce soir-l\u00e0. Enfin, les r\u00e9ductions promises pendant le s\u00e9jour (et bien faibles par rapport aux d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ments occasionn\u00e9s) n'\u00e9taient pas prises en compte sur la note de checkout. En conclusion, un h\u00f4tel dont le prix et les \u00e9toiles ne sont pas du tout en rapport avec l'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9elle et encore moins avec leur objectif de surpasser les attentes de leurs clients.

To kick of the weekend festivities we headed to the bar Jimmy on the 17th floor only to find out it was closed for a private party (wait, shouldn't paying guests of the hotel have access to the only bar? Closed by outsiders?) headed to the attached restaurant for plan B only to find it too was closed for a private party. it was raining like mad and our only option was to slog down the street to Il Mulino for a drink (where they were incredibly friendly and welcoming!). When we got back to the hotel after dinner looking for an after dinner drink , everything was still closed for a private party. I complained to management and they brought a container of cranberry juice and some limes. I tried to order drinks for in room delivery but apparently they only have beer and wine. Big disappointment all around--not a cheap room--over $850 per night.

He offered us scones and coffee as we relaxed for a while, we were exhausted from the previous days travels.  Another associate named Kenny was just awesome.  He recommended several places we could eat breakfast that morning and for the rest of our trip.  He gave a variety of recommendations and they were all great.  Many places didn't open up for an hour or longer, but he suggested we went downstairs to a local deli that serves food 24 hours a day. In fact, he walked us downstairs, out of the hotel, and into the deli.  He introduced us to the staff and said once our food was ready, to come back into the hotel and enjoy it there.  The food was solid, service was great, both guys were very nice.  Shefi was able to get us our room hours before we had expected.  It made the trip for us, couldn't imagine if we weren't able to get that power nap in, could've made for an exhausting Saturday.  Kenny was generous enough to gift us a couple of drink coupons to the rooftop bar, we used them the following evening.  The room was clean, had a lovely view, and everything we could've asked or.

When I checked in there was some chips on the floor. I appreciate that the cleaning ladies can do mistakes but this was very surprising and unpleasant. The room looks quite old. The bathroom seemed clean though. I am staying on the 16th floor so used stairs to go to the gym on the 17th - but the stairs are extreely dirty, with some fruits and insects. This was disgusting \n2. I suffered from strong headache (not the hotel fault unfortunately) and the permanent noise during the day, in the corridor was just too much. I called the reception several times but nothing happened.

For the significantly high price point per night, I did not get the experience I would have imagined. I will say, the staff is friendly, and that was were the positives end. I stayed here on business for 3 nights. Upon check in, our 3 rooms were not ready. When we finally were able to get into the rooms, they seem very cool from the looks of it, but functionality-wise were super inefficient. The water guage on both the shower and the sink were inconsistent - upon turning on the water would always be boiling hot and took long while to cool down. I ended up having to brush my teeth with bottled water as I did not have time to wait for the water to become a normal temperature. The light switches did not make sense and seemed to not be connected with anything. There were little outlets - only 1 surge protector\/power strip on the floor (with little give). The elevators always took forever. And then to top it off, we were transporting extremely expensive equipment. When we (finally) found the bellman and asked if he can watch our cart of gear for 5 minutes while we grabbed a coffee across the street, we come back to our gear with no one around. No one watching it. We simply carted out our gear on our own, which wasnt a problem, but it could have been anyone who took the gear out of the hotel as no one was watching it. \n\nI stay in a lot of hotels that are much cheaper than this, especially in New York, and expect a higher level of service and amenities than I received.

So we decided to stay in NYC for 5 more days but switch from busy Times Square to the calmer Soho area and we booked at the James Hotel.\nThe hotel design wise is amazing. Lots of lights come in through huge windows at the reception area and in the rooms. From the rooftop bar you can enjoy breathtaking views on different parts of New York. We personally were on the 10th floor and therefore didn\u2019t hear any music in our room at night. However it does get busy up there on weekends. We felt that the cocktails were over overpriced (+-22 dollars incl tax), this is even more than what we pay here in Switzerland for a cocktail. Waiters get rude when you don\u2019t tip them.\n\nHowever, the big plus of this Hotel is the staff (excluding barmen). The lobby guys are fantastic. Kenny greeted us and was extremely friendly, kind, proactive and helpful. The James Hotel can be (very) lucky to have a guy like him.. hard to find such friendly people nowadays in the hospitality branch.\nThe reception team was amazing as well and was very helpful the few times we reached out to them.\nAll in all I would give 4 stars - but thanks to the reception team and Kenny, I have no choice than to give a solid 5 star review.\n\nSee you soon James Hotel!","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Kenny made up for the front desk\u2019s initial mistake which impressed me.  Not only was Kenny a rockstar but Eric, also at the entry doors, gave great service.

From 5 pm the vibe of the hotel changed completely with all these bouncers everywhere who came across as quite intimidating.  \n\nThis applies to the downstairs bar areas too. I don\u2019t mind an edgy vibe but unfortunately, this was more seedy than edgy.\n\nWith regards to the rest of the facilities, as I said room was nice.

The hotel was clean on first impressions and although when we got in the lift to go to our room there were two slightly intoxicated guys inside who had mad their way down from the rooftop bar they were swiftly escorted out by staff with no fuss at all. we were on a high floor quite close to the bar and I only heard any noise when in the lift which was to be expected. I was greeted by some wine in my room as a birthday gift and the views were AMAZING. the room was stylish and clean and the bed was so so comfy! I went to the pool next day and it was clean and the beds were lovely. I stayed there for a few hours and it didn't get overly busy! the lifts were fine to use also even in the evening, I didn't find any guests of the bar were prioritised over hotel guests, infact I found they made sure hotel guests got good use of the elevators in amongst the bar crowd. The staff were continuously helpful and very very friendly always making sure we were being well catered for. the hotel location is excellent with a metro to most places right outside. watching sunrise and sunset from my window over downtown new York was amazing.

Great location. They do not nickel and dime.

No biggie, just for $20 a drink , i would\u2019ve expected some wait service.  Other than that,  an amazing perk to have in the summer. \n\nThe only tip would be - avoid the noise on the 17th floor due to the workers setting up for the club upstairs. If you are adverse to noise, skip the 17th. \n\nCorner king was amazing (1708) but I assume there is not a bad room in the house. \n\nOverall, fantastic stay, pleasantly surprised.

First off, I reserved for two other couples and myself and got charged the first night for all three rooms, before we even left home.  Even though rooms were identified by my friends names. Really nice apology by front desk person upon check in, then he proceeded to charge my friends full stay on my card! While she was standing there holding her credit card! \nNice apology by manager, though. Now I have about $4,000 in charges on my credit card for 3-5 days while they reverse it. \nIf you\u2019re wanting your room to be cleaned around 5:00 pm, no matter what time you leave in the morning, this is the hotel for you! Oh, front desk says to ask for someone to come earlier in the day...every day! Guess there\u2019s no guest notes or preferences. \nNice coffee amenity in the morning in lobby but it\u2019s usually empty. Nice wine amenity in lobby at 5:00 pm but there are no glasses and bottles are mostly already empty. \nIf you want breakfast in hotel, it has to be room service because there is NO restaurant here. \nPillows are like rocks.

However, for ~$500\/night for a weekend night it was just not worth it, especially because we couldn't even enjoy the pool the one night we were there (we did enjoy it in the AM although the water was a little cloudy) and our room view was not that great either. We came back to the hotel late that night and wanted to go up and just enjoy the view, but the bouncer wouldn't let us up as it was 1:45am and I guess it closes at 2am. We were hoping to at least be able to sit in the restaurant\/bar area to enjoy the view at night for a few minutes. Oh well. The location is nice and walking distance to some good food and shopping, but I probably wouldn't stay here again unless the price came down. ","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Uninhabitable on the inside.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-07-09","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I regret not reading through other reviews outside of five-stars lucky enough to receive night-and-day service from what we felt was very absent service, and terrible value.\n\nAs others have noted experiencing, our main issues were: sound, price, value, and issues with guest staff.\n\nWe looked forward to having a great time at the pool and bar, especially since we paid the SoHo fee they said enabled them to provide complimentary cocktails. No one we spoke to could give us a straight answer on how to get them. One gentleman (we'll call him G, since providing names isn't one of James Hotel's strong suits) said we'd have to purchase a platter. Nothing in the booking said we had to purchase anything to receive the free welcome cocktail. In fact, the $40\/night fee was paired with them saying we'd get a few things in return (that we never did).\nFunnily, G was standing right next to another person (manager?) after we brought it (and other items) to their intention. The manager said we were misinformed. When we noted the person standing right next to him literally just told us about the required pre-purchase, G just looked away and shrugged his shoulders.\n\nFor the price, the room is very small even by NYC standards. While it notes floor to ceiling windows, they mean feet-above-the-floor-to-ceiling. Which is probably a good thing, considering they have the worst sound insulation (if any) of any place in NYC.  The old surge protector on the night stand and randomly unplugged devices (lamp, iHome) were a nice touch. Do not go by what you see in the pictures.\n\nWe were excited about the idea of hitting the pool. Maybe we accidentally booked on a birthday for teenagers, but it was hardly possible when even getting to our *room* was met with battling the crowds of teens \/ kids? on the elevators. There was a female apparently trying to operate the elevators, and she let us on eventually when the pool party attendants were set. So nice of them to let guests into their rooms!\nHad hoped for a more mature, fun bar pool setting versus what felt like an open pool in the middle of the day for teenagers, but that's not necessarily the hotel's fault. I understand that the pool\/ bar area aren't the responsibility of the hotel (they made that abundantly clear when we addressed some of the issues with them). \n\nUltimately, the noise became unbearable. We tolerated the first night because we checked in so late. The noise was especially intense late evening. We recorded what sounds like grinding and shifting. The second night added sounds of glasses dropping and scratching. Hoping it was just from construction or the bar and would fade, it actually woke us up the next morning.\n\nWhen we brought some of the issues we had in the evening, the manager said he was sorry, that they couldn't control what happened with the bar or other noise. During construction, hotels usually provide earplugs or a warning. At the James, it's apparently just not their issue. To the manager's credit, he did offer to upgrade us when we said we planned to leave (we were scheduled to stay for 3 additional days). But at that point, the noise was only one of a variety of issues. We checked out first thing the next morning (thanks, early AM noises, for making sure of that!).\n\nI almost raised the review to two-stars, because our last experience with the hotel was with a doorman we hadn't seen at that point, who was polite, prompt, and helpfully opened the doors for us and assisted with our luggage as we left. We told him that alone was night and day from everything else we'd received.\n\nThe total cost for two nights was almost $1000. For that much, we could have stayed on Park Ave. with better food, better bars, no kids, no noise, and better entertainment. In fact, we got all of that at the next hotel for (much) less near Park Ave!\n\nIf it weren't for the room making such a terrible first impression, and various staff (especially G) giving us the runaround, we might have stayed through our scheduled booking. Of course there will be weekends where noise and non-guests will be a factor in any hotel, especially one that's open to the public. But the cost, lack of ownership by (most, not all) of the staff, and lack of amenities just don't add up.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Don\u2019t stay for anything more.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-06-10","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"We travel to NYC with some frequency and love to stay in the SoHo area, so thought we would give The James a try.  It is in an excellent location, has amazing rooftop views, the beds are very comfortable and the heated bathroom floor is a definite bonus.  We had a 6th floor corner king, so, while the sunlight was great, we weren\u2019t able to take in the views the higher floors offer.  (We requested a higher floor but none were available.).  The wine and cheese are a nice touch and the cookies and scones are amazing!!!!   \n\nUnfortunately, this is where the greatness seems to end.   For a 4-5 star hotel, they miss the mark on service.  The hotel is VERY focused on the rooftop bar and almost seems to let the hotel and hotel guests take a back seat.  After 5 pm it is near impossible to take an elevator to your room - especially if trying to catch one on the lobby (2nd floor).  You are better to go to the ground floor to go up and hope you aren\u2019t pushed out of the way by rooftop patrons.  The hotel seems very understaffed with one person working the lobby area\/registration desks, rarely a doorman or concierge to be found.  The room was small, but to be expected in NYC.  We had a very slow sink drain that was finally repaired after repeated requests - on the third of a four day stay.  Worse, housekeeping never cleaned the residue from the slow drain.  Walls are scuffed, curtain stained and a lot of dust and dirt build up on floor boards.   There was a nice floor lamp - if you wanted to plug\/unplug as needed.  We could hear the guests above us every time they walked across the floor. tv would occasionally lose cable\/satellite connection and you couldn\u2019t access guest services etc.\n\nUnfortunately, this one did not live up to our expectations.  Perhaps they were too high given the website and our past experiences with James hotels?  Go for the location\/views\/rooftop party.  Don\u2019t stay for the attention to detail of a finer hotel or to expect top notch service.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

You can walk to the West Village, Greenwich village, Downtown, Lower East Side, and many subway stops. My wife and I are walkers so the location was a huge plus for us. If you want to shop till you drop, there are many many places nearby to spend $$$$. \n\nThe hotel: Enjoyed the views from the rooftop. There\u2019s a bar, indoor seating area, wading pool, and outdoor seating as well. Hallways and public areas look well maintained and clean. Large windows surround the lobby which brings in a lot of light. The design throughout the hotel is definitely modern but there are lots of warm tones that add a \u201chomey\u201d feeling to the spaces. \n\nService: The door guys are really helpful. When we checked in they held our bags until our room was ready. Every time we needed a cab, they got one for us in a jiffy. Need an umbrella? They can also get those for you. Front desk staff were quick, efficient, and friendly. They gave us complimentary drink tickets so we went up to the rooftop bar and had some drinks while we waited for our room. We didn\u2019t do room service or needed a valet so I can\u2019t speak to those services. \n\nThe room: We booked a suite with a separate living area and bedroom. It was very spacious and well appointed. The view from the 16th floor was stunning. Although we enjoyed our stay, there\u2019s definitely room for improvement. On arrival, there were several issues with the room (housekeeping and engineering related). I won\u2019t list them here because it was properly dealt with. I would say the room could use a refresh - couch pillows look worn, the bed was too lumpy and soft, and power strips behind the side tables are not efficient (don\u2019t like reaching behind to plug things in!)\n\nOverall we really enjoyed our stay but we did encounter various issues with the room (which were acknowledged and resolved by the hotel staff).","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is not quite as good as it was before, and needs refreshing in several respects, but it is still very good.  The good touches are the scones, fruit, cheese and biscuits in the lounge at different times of day; and the corner rooms are very pleasant indeed. Now the poor aspects of which there are far too many. I don't think that there are enough staff: when I arrived, the doorman was nowhere to be seen and so I had to lug my luggage up to the Reception.  I was early for check in and so the desk staff told me that they would call me when my room was ready - but they didn't.  One had often to ask the staff to replenish the coffee or the cheese and biscuits in the lounge area.- they tended to ignore it.  The windows of my room were dirty, which spoiled one of the views.  The outside terrace was not particularly inviting: they should have prepared it already for Spring. There is a roof top bar which attracts lots of younger people - not a bad thing but it meant that the lifts were irritatingly slow in the evenings.  But worst of all was that I received an email on my very first evening from management inviting my comments - and despite the fact that I responded with some of the above, they never condescended either to acknowledge my email or to provide me with a substantive reply.  That tells one something about the general approach in the hotel.  So, a long list of irritations (above) but, fundamentally, still a very good hotel. Yet far short of how good it used to be.

Upon arriving we were given an upgraded room as well as a bottle of wine and 2 complimentary drinks to celebrate our anniversary! So nice! Our room was spacious and the bathroom was big as well, great windows and view of the city. So many hotels give you a view of another brick building or a courtyard, this was a nice treat. $10 per day to use in the mini bar, that was cool too! Our first night was rainy and cold so we tried to go downstairs (w\/o reservations) to Gitano, and unfortunately they were booked, it was a cool trendy place, I would have made reservations had I known. Our second night was beautiful weather, so before dinner we figured we'd head to their rooftop The Jimmy for our free drinks, before we got into the elevator we could hear loud music coming down the shaft, the elevator going up was packed, once we got up there, we realized we were at a pretty popular rooftop w\/ a DJ etc. at 6:30 pm. It took a bit to get our drinks, but the view and sunset was gorgeous for our short stay before dinner. We had ordered room service breakfast and that was probably the most disappointing- waffles were too cold and rubbery for butter to melt . Not a huge deal, but for $70 just get ready and go out some place near by in soho or tribeca. Also if you want a late checkout, call early, they couldn't accommodate us because they had given out too many already that morning. Otherwise awesome stay and location!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Starting with the positives:\n\n- Rooms and bathrooms are clean, light and well appointed. House keeping did an excellent job each day. Bed was very comfy\n- Receptionists and those on the desk on the ground floor were all very friendly\n- Free wine each evening was very nice\n- Great location, close to main Soho and easy access to Subway\n- Good value for NYC\n- Views from Rooftop bar were stunning\n\nThe not so good:\n\n- Requested a quiet room but was told the only room available was close to lifts ( this was after check in time). I said I would take it as I didn't want to wait for another room to become available. The lift noise was fine - however the noise from Jimmys was unbelievably loud on the Saturday evening and this wasn't mentioned to me at check in.\n- Welcome cocktails are only given if you book dinner at the restaurant . We didn't want to eat at the hotel as we had already made reservations for our stay so we didn't get these drinks. As your welcome drinks are supposedly included in your resort fee they should be included regardless of whether you have dinner or not\n- There is free coffee and biscuits provided each morning. They should provide tea for any non coffee drinkers. Personally I think mini croissants or something similar would be more popular than the biscuits as there seemed to be a heap of them left over each morning\n- There is 10 dollars credit for the minibar each day of your stay. There was no price list in my room so I had to ask at reception. Items that I took weren't replaced - is this to make you buy the items that cost more that 10dollars?\n- Staff at Jimmys were not friendly at all with the exception of the girls that did table service. \n\nOverall, I would stay here again as I loved the views, the bedrooms and the location is great.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

What you need to know when making reservations--If you want a view, I suggest you call the hotel to define what they consider a \"view\". Rooms that claim \"city\" views I believe are the 1-7 floor (I may have the floor incorrect). You'll be looking into the buildings across the street. Skyline views are on the upper floors. City view refers to \"tribeca\" while skyline is of NYC. \n\nWe stayed on a corner king on the 10th floor. Which has skyline views out both windows. The room is small, typical room size for a NYC hotel. The little bench seating and table make it fine for two people.\n\nThe customer service was what you would want from a 4-star hotel. \n\nThe only down side to the hotel is that the lobby, which is cute has what feels like \"older\" furnishings. Would be great if they upgraded.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The James came to us with a solid recommendation and with so many choices for places to stay, we hoped that we'd picked a winner. Let's just say we were less than impressed. The property is tired and not especially clean. Elevators had fingerprints all over them and debris on the floors. Room itself was tired, a little banged up, lights that were dirty and hardwood floors that were noisy (especially when our neighbours above arrived home at 1AM in the morning). Seating in the room itself was a wire chair with some fabric on it and a bench against the wall. The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor. Terrible pump bottles for soap and shampoo did not fit properly in their holders. Staff seemed more interested in their computer screens than their guests. The one exception was Paul who was at the front door when we arrived - friendly, helpful and had a great smile. The bar that seems to be part of the hotel and rocks the weekend evenings can make for an unsavoury welcome back to the property with an entrance full of rowdy party people and noisy music. The complementary drink that we had as part of our package could only be claimed if you made a dinner reservation at a restaurant attached to the hotel. A \"designer\" hotel that does not have the guest's comfort in mind and only seeks to attain an aesthetic. And it's a tired \"designer\" hotel which makes it even less attractive.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had a dinner in SoHo and a work meeting the next day.  All I needed was a place to leave my belongings while I went to dinner, a quiet place to sleep, and work for a few hours the next morning.  To their credit I was upgraded from a queen room to a king room upon check in.  \n\nI would never book this hotel again.  Once I was in my room the first low point was no desk.  But rather a tiny little circular table.  Beyond that the room layout was hip\/modern.  Only problem was that a few of the light switched were broken.  \n\nThen the sounds started.  I have no clue what was going on but at 6pm in the evening it sounded like a bucket of marbles was being dumped over my room every 3-4 minutes for about an hour.  I literally have no clue what it was:  Weird guest up above or, what seemed more likely, elevator noises echoing through air duct systems.  Anyway, I left, went to dinner, and upon my return did not hear these noises.  \n\nBut then at precisely 6am it literally sounded like a tea kettle was whistling \/ screeching in the hallway.  I figured it had to be outside of my room but after it persisted for over 5 minutes I crawled out of bed and closer to the door to investigate.  It was screaming in directly from the vent in the ceiling of my bathroom.  Clueless as to what caused this.  Hot water early morning showers and old pipes and water heaters?  But it was LOUD.  15 minutes later it stopped. \n\n45 minutes after that it was the sound of footsteps on hardwood in the room above me.  At first I dismissed it as \"this has to be above me\" but actually had to look around to make sure there was nobody in my room.  It was that loud (and yes, I realize that at this point a reader of this review could possible ask \"maybe this reviewer is nuts and is hearing things?\".\n\nBottom line, spent a sizable chunk of cash for a small room, with some broken fixtures, and the craziest sounds I've ever heard in a hotel which stopped me from sleeping.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1785018,"title":"Appalling experience","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-01-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"The James New York - SoHo is the first place I have ever reviewed. However, I just saw J4506KUnickl's one-star review from Nov 15, describing almost the same experience. For me, I am so appalled at the James and the behavior of the manager that I had to share with others.\n\nIn November, a surprise snow storm hit NYC. I spent hours in a taxi trying to get to the airport when my flight was finally cancelled. With so many flights being cancelled, hotel rooms were selling out fast throughout NYC. I booked a room at the James on Hotels.com for the night, and arrived about 30 minutes later. However, when I did arrive, reception claimed they did not have my reservation (even though I showed them my confirmation number). The manager came out and said there was no way I could have booked a room in the last half hour as the hotel had been sold out for several hours. From the other review, it appears that about 40 customers were told the same due to a \"computer glitch.\" However, I was the only one in the lobby trying to check in at this point, so wasn't aware this was a larger issue at the hotel. So, with no other options, I booked another room on Hotels Tonight. (As a side note, Hotels.com showed no rooms available in all of Manhattan at this point!).\n\nFast forward a month and I see a charge on my bill for over $500 at the James New York - SoHo. I tried to resolve with Hotels.com to no avail. And here is the rub -- they called the manager who was on duty that night at the James. Even though he spoke to me in person and said they had no rooms, he told Hotels.com that I never showed up for my reservation, and so they billed me as a no-show! I have my booking confirmations, I have Uber reciepts showing I was dropped off at the James and picked up again 20 minutes later (to go to my eventual hotel that night), etc. And now, there is a comment from the manager confirming this was happening for many customers in response to J4506KUnickl's review! And yet, the manager continues to tell Hotels.com that I was a no-show. I'm still in the midst of resolving the bill with Hotels.com (another disappointment after years of being a loyal and frequent customer), but remain appalled that this hotel will fabricate stories in order to secure billings, all at the expense of the customer. Be cautious before booking a room here.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We used Chase credit card points to book this place\u2014had many options but chose this place based on location, reviews which honestly were mixed. But they exceeded expectations by long shot. Why? First tip\u2014utilize your concierge services. (As former concierge, I know this) my NYC friend couldn\u2019t get reservation at Italian place she liked. But one call to Leidy at The James and she nailed it. I talked with her, told her our desires and she called me back next day with reservation no one else in NYC could get. Win! \n\nThat was just the start. Then Terrell helped us-on my terms- get to Times Square for theatre tickets on time. He texted me how to most efficiently get there with step-by-step instructions via subway to avoid traffic vs taxi\/Lyft\/Uber. We easily arrived with time to spare. Lovely. Some other places say \u201cI can write down instructions or just look up\u201d. He accommodated my last-minute request with ease, sent me text with info. Perfect, lovely accommodating guest in mode I wanted vs \u201chow I was told or how we do it\u201d. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f \n\nThen, when we needed to shift reservation for meal at Union Square Cafe (my fav restaurant in NYC) and husband could not get reso when we wanted, Leidy, once again called and worked her magic to get us a reservation that more accommodated our needs. And proactively called us to let us know. \n\nThe room\u2014amazingly big for Manhattan standards with lovely view. Heated floors in bathroom is biggest thing that comes to mind, along with view. Attention to detail in the room re: shading, heat, privacy, etc.  Didn\u2019t have ton of ammeneities but if you ask\u2014they will bring makeup mirror, extra mint tea, toothpaste.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1785018,"title":"Great location and cozy rooms","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-11-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I stayed in The James for almost a week as a first time NYC visitor. First things first, the hotel was not cheap and certainly amongst the top 10% or so in the city. Therefore I did have high expectations and for me, a great hotel is very important when I'm on holiday. Overall my stay was very good but i'll summarise all the details below.\n\nMy resort fee was included in the package I booked with my travel provider but I would have felt VERY hard done by if I had to shell out the $48 daily otherwise. I have read that only a small selection of NYC hotels charge this and it's a ruse to advertise a lower room rate, it's completely unjustified. It covers local\/national calls, use of the gym, some minor amenities like free water\/wine\/occasional snacks in the lobby as well as a $10 daily minibar credit. To be honest, that daily credit barely covered one bottle of water or a chocolate bar. Perhaps I shouldn't moan as my fee was waived with the deal but most will have to pay this and it's extortionate for amenities that should be included as an absolute basic in a luxury hotel. Covering some phone calls, a gym which any decent hotel should have etc, for $48 daily?!\n\nWhen arriving the first notable thing was the amazing location. Super easy to get to from the subway, particularly useful for a total stranger to the area, it's literally surrounded by all the different lines for Canal Street. As I got to know the area it was even more evident that it was excellently located, great restaurants, places for breakfast and world class shops very close by, all in a very safe feeling neighbourhood.\n\nMy room was pretty high up with an amazing view, I was exhausted so didn't take too much notice of the room. However, by the morning I did notice some real basics were missing-no hand soap, no glasses by the sink, the electric privacy blind between the bathroom and bedroom didn't just not work, it didn't actually exist-it must have been removed. Some of the lighting didn't work either and I just didn't think this was good enough. To their credit, without me even drawing a breath to explain the individual problems, the staff immediately offered a replacement when I asked the next morning. My belongings were moved over and the new room was great.\n\nThe rooms themselves (I was in a king size room) are surprisingly small but not overly so. There is plenty of storage, great floor to ceiling views too. The bathroom is very good, luxuriously decked out, great shower and I loved the Appelles toiletries provided-this luxurious touch made a real difference. The bed was one of the best I've ever stayed in, very comfortable and they also offered a pillow menu so I got a few extras to my taste. I would not recommend going unless you're either by yourself or in a couple, the rooms are intimate and the 'privacy blinds' in the bathroom probably aren't fully effective.\n\nThe housekeepers were super friendly and did a great job daily. I did notice though that some basics were missed, I cannot fault them and would not personally blame them as I fully expect they have very sharp turnaround times and will not be earning mega bucks. However, amenities weren't replaced properly-if I used a product it just wasn't replaced and I also had to use the same dirty soap bar all week. The sink was left a bit dirty daily. When I used the minibar (although extortionately priced I had a $10 daily credit as above), the items were never replaced-so I soon ran out of water and other snacks. Was this a ruse to get me to start using the other products in there? Saying that, you did get a large daily bottle of free filtered water so it wasn't like I was desperate.\n\nThe only real downside of the room is the noise-mainly from above and the surroundings. With wooden floors and less than ideal soundproofing, I had to use very sturdy earplugs each night. Additionally, the huge windows were badly soundproofed and even from the equivalent of probably 15 or more floors up (the whole hotel is above an elevated lobby) I could easily hear traffic noise.\n\nTV was good and could be controlled via an app to make it easier. Also noticed a bluetooth speaker\/alarm clock which was handy.\n\nTried the gym once and it was perfectly good with state of the art cardio machines, also amazing views in there. Small though but I doubt many people use it. Didn't use the pool as it was November...\n\nThe James has a rooftop bar and it seems to be privately owned, so many members of the public would be wandering into the hotel all evening. They would also use the lifts to get there (it's top floor) which I didn't think was that secure for guests, nor did it make me feel that special-more like we're just getting in the way of customers trying to get to a swanky bar. Having to wait for lifts because of random external guests was frustrating.\n\nThe building itself was nice, I think it's about 7-8 years old. Very nice lobby but my weird personal view of the hotel itself is from the outside it looks pretty awful, no interesting architecture apart from the aforementioned lobby (and rooftop) and it could be a holiday inn from the outside, not a luxury hotel.\n\nStaff were always very helpful so no complaints at all there.\n\nTried the David Burke kitchen a few times, once for breakfast which was fine but nothing that special, once for lunch which was a very well cooked meal but very expensive indeed for what it was (I'm talking about $40+ for a chicken breast and french fries). Loads and loads of decent alternatives only moments away, you do get a 10% discount at the DB Kitchen apparently but they never actually honoured it for me! I didn't take this any further.\n\nAll in all I would recommend it and the location is spot on, especially nice to get away from the really crowded areas after a busy day. I did get a decent package but paying the full advertised rates I definitely wouldn't be doing. I feel like they could add a few more luxury touches to make guests feel special, even if really basic-how about chocolates or a little treat left in your room daily? How about a special deal with some local restaurants? What else can they think of to make guests feel more special? I'm only being really fussy based on the prices they charge but that's a good thing as there's not many negative things to say!","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

They even verified our rate was through a third party and the resort fee was included. But here, take 2 drink vouchers that can be used at our outside garden bar at your convenience too. What lovely treatment! As we got to the elevator, we wondered if they were going to chase us down to say they had us confused with another guest. But no! The room was small, as expected since this is NYC, but very hip and modern, with crisp white linens, full length draperies, large expansive windows and a small sitting and coffee area. And the view was out of this world! You could see all the way to the to the river and beyond to New Jersey. There were no other buildings blocking this 16th story view. The nicely appointed dark tiled bathroom was actually a glass walled room, with a functional tree patterned screen for privacy. Pretty funky! What a wonderful place.

It has a fantastic location in SoHo, and our room was really nice and modern with an amazing comfy bed. The view was superb as well. You're located by so many great restaurants, bars and shops, and Chinatown is a short walk away as well. The staff here are beyond friendly and professional, and they accommodated our early check in and took care of getting us a black car when we were ready to leave to JFK.\n\nThis place gets a lot of exposure for the rooftop bar and pool, and we did go up to check that out. That was pretty freaky. First, I thought it was strange that the pool closes at 2 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Well, we found out why. We went up to check it out, and the elevator doors open to a super loud club DJ and a packed bar and swimming pool area. There were a couple of bikini girls in the pool, and lots of fancy Jersey Shore-dressed types of people packing the perimeter so you couldn't really get to enjoy the view from the roof. the bar was crowded too, so we didn't try to get a drink. It was way too much for such a tiny space. And at night, they have a velvet rope bouncer entry process, so if you want to go up there at night you have to pass muster there.\n\nAll that said, it didn't negatively impact our stay. We thought that was pretty funny, and I'm glad we went up there to see what it was to see we weren't missing anything. We just went to other spots out in the neighborhood and had a great long weekend stay. But hey, if you are into that rooftop scene, maybe you'll like the hotel even more.

Rooms are too bright, the moment the sun comes up, you're going to wake up (unless you don't mind sunlight)\n2. Housekeeping is good, but it's a bit like housekeeping at home; if you don't follow up and remind them to refill certain amenities\/ mini bar, they might not. If you don't inform them that you're leaving, they may forget to make the room (happened a couple times).\n3. Concierge service is friendly, but don't expect to get that \"impossible booking\" through your hotel, might as well book yourself.\n4. If you're in a room that's close to the elevator, expect to hear every single time the elevator moves - very annoying.\n\nIn terms of location, probably the best (for me) in NYC, and their AC system in the room is pretty good (if you like to sleep in a cold room, you'll love theirs).\nThey also have coffee and muffins in the morning (complimentary) as well as wine and cheese in the evening; though the fact that they moved it down to the restaurant as opposed to the lobby is a bit of an annoyance; particularly in the morning.\n\nNext time I visit NYC, I would hesitate to go back, not necessarily from any shortcomings on this side, but if you're like me and you enjoy being spoilt rotten on a vacation, this may not be the place for you - if you like things simple and to the point, they do that very well.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I love modern architecture, but, this building is a failure in both form & function from the lobby and elevators to the rooftop \"pool\".  We booked a corner room which was decent sized, on the bigger side for NYC. The bathroom is definitely larger than average, well designed with a good shower and for a hotel that's 8 years old, I give credit to the designer for being ahead of the curve. Also, the bed has good linens and is very comfortable. Aside from that, the layout and common areas of this hotel were a disappointment. We made sure to spend as much time out and about to avoid doing anything but sleep there, which isn't hard to do in Manhattan. I suggest spending less if just want a bed and you're planning to be working or sightseeing most of your stay OR spend a little more (or even less in some cases!) if you want more of a luxury or edgy city hotel experience that\u2019s memorable for good reasons. The James Soho staff were polite, but, from what I experienced, the hotel is obviously understaffed to the point of the person at the front desk might be the same person delivering your ice. \n\nLook elsewhere if you\u2019re hoping to have some amazing rooftop pool or experience or you just want a nice rooftop bar like The Standard High Line (nice rooms, no pool, but great atmosphere). The James Soho rooftop pool is more like the size of a large hot tub. Forget about relaxing by this pool since by 9am guests and non guests (I wasn't sure if they have some sort or membership for locals or people just showed up) are jockeying for sun chairs on the roof. There\u2019s supposed to be a separate entrance and elevator for rooftop bar patrons but we shared plenty of elevators with people from morning into night who snuck in as well. At night, we ended up using the stairs instead of the elevator because we got tired of the elevator doors opening to reveal a packed group of bar patrons.\n\nBTW if you didn't catch it when you booked your reservation or maybe they mentioned it during check in, The James Soho adds their own $40 nightly \u201cresort fee\u201d which isn't uncommon with hotels with actual amenities, but, here, what resort? For random wine in the lobby in the afternoon? For \u201cuse of the pool\u201d which is a joke since they'd rented out the pool area for an entire day which not only denied us access to the pool and bar but created a line for elevators? \n\nWe enjoyed shopping and dining in the neighborhood, but, next time we'll be staying elsewhere.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My first was 4 years ago, and I remember before that seeing the hotel being built from the ground up.  The hotel has some age spots and lost lustre, but is still a good choice for SoHo lodging.  The location is hard to beat--at the southwest corner of SoHo, easily walkable to all the shops, restaurants and lounges in SoHo and Tribeca as well.  Plus the Canal St. subway stops for the A,C,E and 1 lines are a block away.  The A train links you with the AirTrain from JFK airport, while the A,C and E trains go to Penn Station, where you can link with NY Transit and the AirTrain to Newark airport.\n\nEven though I'd stayed here before, the lower level floors were still a bit confusing.  The entrance lobby has a desk that seemed unstaffed, although there is a doorman and sometimes a bellman.  The glass elevator takes you to the Sky Lobby where the reception desk is, a lovely space overlooking the hotel's urban garden and seasonal outdoor restaurant.  A separate bank of 2 elevators extends from the urban garden level to the Sky Lobby up to the rooms and the rooftop pool and lounge.  Stairs must be taken to access the entrance level from these elevators, although they do go down to the partially subterranean restaurant  (David Burke Kitchen) level.  The outdoor urban garden itself has multiple levels.  \n\nReception desk service was friendly but sometimes bumbling.  I checked in early before a room was ready, but the receptionist ran out of luggage tags and it took quite awhile for the bellman to bring more.  And when I got my room keys later in the day, the key to the luggage storage room could not be found, and it took another while for the luggage to be delivered to the room.  And of course the front desk never called me to tell me the room was ready, even though they had my mobile number.  \n\nThis stay was booked via a non-opaque, pay-in-advance, non-refundable flash sale on a favourite website of mine.  The reservation was for the hotel's least expensive room, a queen.  I knew from past experience that one is never upgraded on bookings from this website, so I got my designated room on the 5th floor.  The majority of the James' rooms face west looking towards the Hudson River, but some, including mine, face east onto SoHo, with glimpses of the East River bridges from higher floors such as the 17th floor fitness centre or the rooftop pool.\nThe room was perfectly fine, compact but not cramped, full of light from the full wall of windows (a James' highlight).  Lighting was great at night also.  There was a built-in settee with storage drawers beneath it, a small round table\/desk and a chair.  The minibar and fridge were well-stocked.  Rather that offer plastic bottled water, the James offers filtered water in refillable glass bottles.  The bathroom had a full window looking into the bedroom with a shade for privacy if desired.  The shower had rain and hand-held fixtures and pump dispensers for shampoo, conditioner and bath gel (loved the fragrance).  I liked the zori-style terrycloth slippers. The A\/C was super effective during my hot and humid stay.  Niggles: no electrical outlets by the bed, no luggage rack and no alarm clock.  For my previous stay, I was in one of the one-bedroom apartments.  It was of course more spacious (only the penthouse suite is larger), but this queen room was no less comfortable.  \n\nAlthough it was waived for my pre-paid booking, there is usually a $40 per night Hotel Facility Fee, noted on the hotel's website.  Although some of the things included with the fee are things one would expect\/hope to be complimentary (WiFi, concierge services, fitness centre access, newspapers, in-room coffee\/tea), there were some additional features such as a $10 daily minibar credit (kind of tricky to gauge cost because there was no minibar menu with prices), 10% restaurant discount, welcome cocktail in the restaurant, morning coffee\/tea\/scones, early evening wine, evening cookies.  \n\nThe rooftop pool is really a pool-ette but does offer wonderful views west, south and east.  It's seasonal, of course, but opens early for guests.  There is pool-side meditation and yoga on Thursdays.  The pool also closes early-ish in the afternoon, when the pool deck becomes part of lounge Jimmy.  Guests have access to Jimmy until later in the evening, when there is a roped entrance from the street.  The service elevator becomes Jimmy's elevator.  I was surprised that Jimmy was still so popular, given its age and non-remodeled decor, but this was perhaps because I stayed over the July 4 week.  I should add if you are over 30 years old, Jimmy may not be for you; look instead for a bingo game at a nearby senior citizen's centre.\n\nMore popular than Jimmy is the seaonal pop-up Tulum-inspired Mexican restaurant\/bar Gitano across the street from the James on a vacant lot.  Since my visit, it was closed temporarily by the Health Department for violations including bathroom and potable water issues.\n\nI've always wanted to try the James' outdoor Garden at David Burke restaurant, but it was just too hot and humid for me this visit.  The space is lovely, however, with ample foliage and situated above sidewalk level so passersby can't stare at you and the traffic heading towards the Holland Tunnel is not seen, although possible heard.  \nAlthough I've eaten at David Burke Kitchen in the past, I skipped it this time.  For late post-theatre food, I went more than once to the bodega on the corner of Grand and Thompson next to the hotel, which offers made-to-order hot food plus prepared cold foods and groceries.  They actually have 2 stores across Thompson from each other. \n\nAfter  my stay here at the James, I transferred to the Beekman Hotel near City Hall.  The Beekman trumps the James for service, but the James' location is preferred.  Design\/decor are vastly different, renovated\/old vs. contemporary--I loved them both, and would stay again at both.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It is modern and attractive and everything was clean. \nThere is a $40 a day 'facilities fee'. From what we understand this allows you coffee in the morning, wine at a wine hour in the evening and access to the rooftop pool - however as others have mentioned this is only specifically for hotel guests during very limited daytime hours and the crowds and queues really put us off. I have seen mentioned online by the hotel that this facilities fee offers a discount and a drink at the restaurant but we were certainly not told about this - nor were we told about the fee until we were presented with the bill which was particularly galling as we had not used any of the 'facilities' it covered. Perhaps it may be worth mentioning this fee on check in.\nDoormen were great, reception staff were hopeless and bordering on rude.\nThe room was lovely and absolutely spotless, although you could hear other guests in the corridors very easily. Why on earth anyone would want an unfrosted glass wall between the toilet and bed is beyond me, and we do wish the blind we kept putting down had been left that way.\nIt was fine as a mid range hotel, but it certainly bills itself as something better than that.

The room was large for ny hotels and plenty of  draw space and a wardrobe. Bathroom was large with rainfall shower. All in all very nice but the only downside was that it was in dier need of decorating  as there were chips and marks . The view was amazing - u could see the freedom tower.\nBreakfast was $22 but the varierty etc did not warrant this and i have had better at other hotels - they do offer free coffe and scones every morning which is lovely and far  better - there are numerous cafes nearby if u require more.\nThe outside restaurant was very nice and a good menu with plenty of seating and shade. On the LOBBY level which is reception there is plenty of comfortable seating\nand water and fruit is available all day.\nRebecca and the guys that front the reception desk were really helpful and always smiling and nothing was too much trouble.\nThe rooftop bar and pool over a weekend is far too busy and packed with youngsters\nbut during the week it is calmer and it is nice to sit out and admire the fantastic view\/\nu can get snacks inside the bar area if required. I found the elevators ok and did not have to wait long. The area is great and it takes about 10 mins to walk to BROADWAY with all the amazing shops - try to walk thru  prince street. Little Italy is not too far and all in all u can walk to most places to explore this fantastic area. I usually stay midtown but think i prefer Soho and the surrounding areas.\nI would stay at The  JAMES HOTEL again especially is they redo their bedrooms.\nAll staff were very friendly and helpful and the cleanliness was exceptional especially in the bedroom and bathroom.\nALL IN ALL A VERY LOVELY STAY.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

I am basing my experience of this hotel for a 2-night stay during the festive Fourth of July period (wed-thurs night). The main attraction that got me to book this hotel was it's rooftop swimming pool, which I thought would be a great place to enjoy the Forth of July! It turns out that hotel guests, like me, who pay close to $400 per night plus an additional $45 pool access fee, are actually only able to use the pool for a short,limited time period during the day. Unfortunately, I only learned about this policy at the time of check-in that the situation arises because the rooftop pool opens up to the public, and the rooftop becomes an arguably \u2018Wild\u2019  party scene, complete with a DJ, full-bar at 5pm on weekdays! On the Forth of July, the pool closed to guests at 2pm, just after my check-in to make arrangements for the Big 4th of July bash complete with a DJ etc.... As a guest, I was actually precluded from even getting to the rooftop during the party because the party was filled to capacity by 6pm. more worrying is that I observed numerous folks roaming the halls and stairways over the course of the early and late evening, making my guest experience in this hotel feel absolutely  unnerving. Further, the elevator wait times at any time of day or night are remarkably slow, which may be due in part to the hoards of public who are waiting to get to the rooftop. On my last day, the pool was actually closed to all hotel guests, due to 'weather', which included light rain sprinkles. It's understandable to shut the pool down if there were thunder storms, but the kind of weather that I observed, was a very light rain. Fortunately, I was able to leave this hotel before my trip ended and found myself enjoying an absolutely glamorous 5-Star hotel with privacy, elegance and class.  I have never stayed in 5-star hotels that expose their guests to the kind of nonsense that hotel guest must endure at the James! I rounded down to one point because I would give the hotel a half of a star because the lovely manager graciously removed one of the $45 daily fees once realizing that my experience fell below expectations.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The main toilet room near the showers had a door that would not close and the lights did not even work. In addition, the speaker system also did not work, and when I asked the hotel staff for help they just simply said \"it did not work\" and made no attempt to alleviate the issue or suggest any alternative solutions. In addition, the space was not that clean -- the sofa was dusty and the \"leather\" chair was full of wrinkles and was almost tearing at the seams. The floor was also not particularly clean either. \n\nThe complimentary wine was a nice touch, but that is expected given that it is around ~$1,500 per night. I am profoundly disappointed to have spent such a large amount for a special occasion that was largely ruined by technical failures and poor condition of the space -- not to mention the other inherent problems of the hotel (such as slow elevators and loudness of the rooftop bar) that I have not even explored in this review. \n\nI guess the final straw was when I expressed these issues at check-out, the receptionist just simply acknowledged the problem nonchalantly and said that she would get it \"checked-out\" with no offer for any remedy whatsoever.

My daughter and I arrived on Saturday afternoon about 12:30. As we entered the very understated (not in a bad way) entrance on the ground floor, we were not greeted, or offered help with our bags.  The doorman stood at his desk, and just gave an eyebrow raise from his cell phone.  No \"welcome\"...no nothing.  We had to figure out our way up to the next floor lobby.  Here there was a very luke warm smile, with a forced \"hello\" from the one person standing at the desk.  It was a pleasant surprise to see our room was ready upon arrival. We made our way up to the 6th floor King Corner room.  It was a decent room with a decent view.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The room had quite a bit of dust accumulated on the night stands on each side of the bed, as well as the baseboards throughout.  It just never felt \"clean\"  We had to request extra towels as there were only two, and an extra robe as there was only one.  Ordered room service for coffee two mornings.  One morning it never came, so I had to call and request a pot.  It was promptly brought up with two plastic high ball glasses. Maybe they ran out of proper coffee cups? It was 9am. The next day they only sent hot chocolate. A call quickly fixed the situation though, and they did not charge us for the coffee.  The \"Jimmy\" bar upstairs had a great view and vibe, but would not let you order a drink to bring back to room. If you wanted ice in your room, you had to call guest services and get it by special request.\nOverall it was an underwhelming experience.  We felt like a bother if we requested anything, and had to laugh at times at the lack of service and attention to detail. Just not what we were used to at this price point and this hotel chain.\nOn a bright note, our last day there a new doorman was working and was extremely engaged and helpful.  As we checked out the person at desk said he would e-mail my final bill and receipt.  I have yet to see it.\nWe would not recommend this hotel to friends or family.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

However, returning for New Years it was a different story. I had a multiple night stay which would end New Year's Day. They did not clean our room on time once this entire stay. I would leave for hours to come back around 6-8 pm with my room still disheveled, no refilled waters, no new towels. They didn't have our room on file when we went to check in and check in took 30 minutes+ because of that, their response was a flaw in their new booking system (I get it things happen). Our keys kept getting deactivated which meant I had to get it reactiviated multiple times through my stay when the key was in my wallet so it's not like my phone deactivated it. After all of this I took the step to speak to the manager and he said he would take care of it. He removed one night off our bill for our stay and gave a $50 drink ticket for the rooftop which made me think changes would be made and I truly thought that was kind of him. But not at all nothing changed. Once again the very next day they still didn't clean the room when we had the clean the room sign out there. He claimed after my frustration for this going on the entire stay that \"maybe I shouldn't have a room here.\" That sounds like luxurious service to me having a manager speak that way to someone staying at this facility. I am displeased by this whole experience at The James Hotel. Their subpar service and bad managerial skills made a place that I once enjoyed a place I will never give my money to again. The supervisor kept apologizing emensly and is truly a kind guy but kindness doesn't replace going to a 4-star \"luxurious\" hotel to only be met with subpar motel service.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The $75.00 payment should have allowed us to check in at 11:00 am. Despite my due diligence, when we arrived at around 12:30 pm (cancelled flight caused a delay coming in), the front desk (same person who I exchanged e-mails with) had no record of my request and the room was not ready yet. This was a disappointing start, even though the hotel ended up not charging me for early check-in. The room was ready a few hours later. Although I had requested a higher floor when I booked the room, we were given a room on the 4th floor and told they were fully booked. Another request that was not fulfilled.\n\nAlthough the room itself was clean and well appointed, it was not in the condition that I would expect from a 5-star hotel. The faucet in the shower came right off and the button to activate the rain shower head did not work. We had to use the shower handle instead. It is not acceptable that a hotel of The James' caliber should exhibit such a poor level of maintenance.\n\nThe lobby is very tiny with a small sitting area and very basic amenities. The complimentary coffee was not refilled promptly in the mornings and the staff seemed to not want to be bothered to do so. The same went for the nightly wine and cheese. Despite showing up in the lobby only 30 minutes after the wine service began, there was no food left and it was not refilled until much later. Again, the staff seemed standoffish and not interested in going out of their way to deliver 5-star service.\n\nFinally, upon checkout, early Sunday morning, there was no staff to be found in the front and I had to go looking for them in a back room to check out, only to be told by the staff (who didn't even leave the back room to greet us or thank us for staying) that we didn't need to do anything to check out.\n\nThe high notes: the location is very good and easily accessible by car service, taxi and train stations nearby. Also, the Jimmy (rooftop bar) was a lot of fun, with great views of the city, excellent music with live DJ and good drinks (be prepared to pay around $20\/drink). There is also a great little market (Soho's Finest) right beside the hotel entrance which had great Panini sandwiches, snacks, drinks, water bottles, fresh salads, desserts and much more!\n\nOverall, we were a little disappointed in The James and would probably opt to stay at a different hotel in the area on our next visit to the great city of New York.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This hotel is a modern, boutique hotel in Soho. Initially after booking on line I had to call the hotel and make an adjustment to my reservation that I couldn\u2019t rectify online. I spoke with Johnathan, a front desk manager, and he kindly made the correction, as well as arranged for an upgraded room when I told him it was our 25th Anniversary and that we were coming in from Long Island for a few days to celebrate rather than go out of town. We had a lovely corner king room, with a large bathroom, well laid out and spacious by nyc standards. After entering returning to our room the first evening, we were surprised by a bottle of Proseco and chocolate covered strawberries with a lovely card from The James, wishing us a happiness on the special occasion.  Just a classy, unexpected gesture. The front desk\/ guest services staff was helpful throughout our stay.  We enjoyed the complimentary cheese and crackers and wine in the lobby in the evening, and the delicious scones and coffee in the morning. The outdoor seating area was very pretty as well, although we didn\u2019t spend time there this trip due to the colder weather.  The hotel is within walking distance to many good restaurants including Little Italy, and to the World Trade Center area as well. The only negatives I can offer are that I wasn\u2019t crazy about how close we were situated to the sights and sounds of the Holland tunnel traffic. And that there was an erroneous room charge from the JIMMY hotel bar on our bill at checkout. All in all, I\u2019d gladly return. \n\n","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They also have the larger in-shower formats for shampoo\/conditioner, which means less plastic polluting our oceans.\nThe service, from the valet welcome at street level, to the reception lobby, to room service is friendly and professional. \nThe hotel pays a lot of attention to design details, is careful of the environment and serves early morning coffee in the lobby with fresh scones. \nI just wished that the breakfast menu had included oatmeal without sugar based toppings. I always wonder why I can't choose a selection of toppings to my taste. It would be so easy to offer a choice of 3 toppings.\nHowever, what really impressed me is the staff.  The morning that I checked out, I forgot a bracelet that I had just received for my wedding anniversary.
