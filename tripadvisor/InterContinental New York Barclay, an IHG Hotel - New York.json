We were wished Happy Anniversary by several members of staff too which was a really nice touch. \nThis hotel is in a fabulous location-close enough to walk to everything but a nice distance away from the loudness, hustle and bustle of NY city.\nOur room was spacious, clean & comfortable but was right next to the lift so a little noisy. We asked concierge if we could change rooms, all we had to do was pack up our stuff and when we returned later in the day our suitcases had been moved into a quieter room. Excellent service. \nThe breakfast buffet is probably one of the best we\u2019ve ever had. Plenty of choice, hot buffet, continental breakfast, fruits, cereals, pastries, fresh juice, tea, coffee etc.\nWe had drinks in the bar every night to use half of the daily tourism tax. This is another NY tax-nothing g to do with the hotel. The bar is on the main foyer and stocked with plenty of branded spirits. I would say they\u2019re double shots as definitely much stronger than anything in the uk, \nOur only negative would be the breakdown of any additional extras is confusing. You can view it on your tv but it\u2019s not broken down into specifics so you really need to keep an eye on it. Ours was incorrect but it\u2019s was sorted out easily at the front desk and corrected. \nI would highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again if we return to NY.\nSpecial thanks to Sofia and her excellent team for looking after us so well.","travelDate":"2024-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We last stayed September last year and found the Property and its employees excellent. This visit, I was at first surprised to find some of those employees no longer with the property but if anything the level of service , hospitality and attention to detail under GM Sofia (thanks for the upgrade and goodies) has increased with the addition of Hotel Manager Matthias Kaiser . Mr Kaiser was on top of everything and stated in constant touch with us and this was the first time all the benefits afforded an Ambassador with the facility fee were explained in great detail for us to fully utilize those benefits during our stay.\n\nOn checking in Sunday (early so I should not be complaining) my room wasn't ready and I later found out that it was an Ambassador guest who had on-lined checked out but continued to stay in his room for the late check-out accorded their status. I am also an Ambassador but know when I on-line check out or settle my bill earlier than check-out, I notify the front desk so they know not to notify housekeeping to start cleaning the room for the next guest. To my fellow guests, try and remember that in your visits so other guests aren't waiting around. And one more reminder to my fellow guests, I saw most guests at The Parlour leave nothing on the table when they left. These service employees work really hard to provide a great experience. Remember to leave a gratuity. I could tell by my Housekeeper's reaction to us every day that not many leave a gratuity every day. These are the same guests who gripe on social media about rates being added by Hotels and lack of service. Not in this Property.\n\nDespite the room situation, Mr Kaiser sent me to guest relations and this is where I was fortunate to meet Sanela M who was amazing. First she explained the issue, then found me another room and then also arranged for our accompanying relative with 2 small daughters to have their luggage out of the room assigned to one on our floor. All of this on a Sunday when staff would not have been as heavy as a weekday. She was simply amazing and kept in touch with Mr Kaiser (who was off BTW) until we were all settled. Kudos Sanela\n\nOur upgrade was awesome, Housekeeping was great and this visit made use of The Parlour restaurant and while it may look small at first glance, have tables all around so that guests did not have to wait very long for seating. The buffet is full of everything one would need, from fruit, to breads, cereals, a hot breakfast and with Easter coming up had special cookies for guests. The bar at night looks like a movie scene. Check it out before you leave (using your daily credit)\n\nThe Bellmen staff were also excellent with moving, storing and packing luggage.\n\nBTW one of the vouchers provided is for Ole and Steen next door. You must try their pastries all day, lunch and evening items (all with a 10% off)\n\nAnother tip. Parking can be found 1 block from the hotel and using ParkWhiz (no in\/out) found a rate under $35 a day, unheard off.\n\nLocated on the East side, it's easy to find an Uber and getting around is a breeze (as long as you don't have to go to the West side). Lots of restaurants around and easy to find shopping, it's an awesome location. \n\nWhile there try visiting the upgraded Grand Central with its amazing food hall\n\nKudos again to GM Sofia for running one of the best InterContinental's we have stayed at. I was glad to Meet Manager Kaiser on our last day to thank him personally and to send our regards to the GM for a wonderful experience.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Business stay and literally the closest hotel to my meeting. Room was large and comfortable. Quiet - for New York City - and very modern + new appearing. Good sized closet and bathroom. Appears to be a lobby bar - restaurant, but did not use. Front desk personnel personable, helpful, pleasant. For the value of the room, the actual room charge for a mid-town Manhattan hotel was very reasonable. However, the ridiculous New York City, State taxes are...ridiculous. Literally added over $100 to room charge. There is actually a charge for the Jacob Javits Center, which is nowhere near this hotel and which I certainly was not using. To be clear, these charges are NOT the fault of the hotel. They ARE the fault of the people of New York City and New York State who continually elect politicians who have no concept of a financial budget. Not sure how any tourists can afford to visit New York. Also not sure why they would want to in the current condition of the city. If traveling on business, and your meeting is in the Grand Central Terminal area, this is a great spot.

It was nice but not perhaps up to the standard of some of the 5* hotels in other cities we have stayed in. Positives - the concierge, reception & door staff couldn't have been more helpful & gave us helpful advice when we asked. Some of the bar & waiting staff were lovely while others were a bit lacklustre. I agree with other reviews that the rooms were small but the hotel is generally elegant & pretty. Negatives -  (i) the safes need to be re-designed - they hang so that things have to be piled up on top of each other rather than the usual position of pushing things to the back. This means that delicate items such as cameras might be on top of each other. (ii) more vegetarian\/vegan options on the menu please. I might have been tempted to eat here more than once during our stay if there had been more suitable choices. (iii) please get rid of the barmy system of charging someone for a bottle of water each time they open the fridge door, which is apparently what happened with our bill. We didn't take anything from our mini-bar fridge but 3 bottles of water were added to our final bill! People use their fridge for all sorts of things - medications, toiletries, water etc, so they shouldn't do this.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The exceptional service began right at the entrance, where the door manager greeted me with such warmth and professionalism, instantly making me feel welcome. This level of personalized service seamlessly continued at the reception, where the staff went above and beyond to ensure my check-in process was smooth and pleasant. \n\nBut the hospitality didn't stop there; the room service was equally impressive. Every request was met with promptness and a smile, adding so much to my overall stay. The attention to detail, from the impeccably clean and well-appointed rooms to the thoughtful amenities, truly made my experience memorable.\n\nAs I find myself on the eve of my return to the Intercontinental New York Barclay, my excitement is palpable. I cannot wait to see all the wonderful staff again and to experience that exceptional service that left such a lasting impression on me. It feels like coming back to a place where I am valued and cared for, a rare find in the bustling city of New York.\n\nTo the entire team at the Intercontinental New York Barclay, thank you for making my previous visit so remarkable.

I was welcomed back as a platinum member and thanked for my loyalty with a welcome drink (nice touch). \n\nOur family trip meant two rooms and Kevin helped to ensure rooms were on the same floor, this was a great help. \n\nOur King Classic (High Floor) offered everything we needed for a five night trip - coffee machine and the usual in room facilities.

Though we haven\u2019t been to the Barclay in over 10 years we have come back to experience the unparalleled warmth and hospitality of three members of the Ambassador team. Sanela, Ann Mara and Leslie. That they have been here for so many years speaks to their dedication to providing the finest service and also to the special nature of the Barclay hotel. It is clearly a hotel that values loyalty and impeccable service!  Sanela arranged a lovely upgrade for us. And they  each greeted us as if we had only seen each other last week! We also had a spectacular breakfast each morning. Drinks in the beautiful bar. Excellent recommendations by chief concierge Uri. And most kindly a dessert sent up for a birthday we were celebrating from the GM Sofia. This is a group who not only demonstrate loyalty but inspire it!

Recently I stayed at The Barclay for my second visit, the first being almost 50 years ago. If memory serves, this stay became my 15th InterContinental visit. Charming blend of tradition and luxury. \n\nSpecial appreciation to Bianca and Paulette in InterContinental Club, both of whom went out of their way to make me feel welcome. My heart warmed as I watched them provide special touches to their various guests, such as the young couple with two adorable young children whose taste buds might not be satisfied with some of the impressive-at-least-for adult-palates offerings, and the gentleman who apparently spoke little or no English yet they managed to communicate with him and resolve whatever was concerning him.\n\nThe (upgraded) corner room, combined with IC Club, provided much of what I needed to be productive over the three days. Even the energetic enthusiasm of the guest next door was fairly though not totally quiet in my room. The only significant concern with the room was the HVAC. On the evening of my arrival, I went back to the reception desk to alert the hotel to how cold the room was, despite turning up the thermostat. At check-out three days later, I again reported the problem, as there was no apparently improvement during my stay. Fortunately, I packed a few sweaters, so there was an adequate work-around.\n\nAnd Marioara, what an awesome ambassador for The Barclay. At check-in, the staffer politely asked me to wait a moment, and there came Marioara back to the desk with him. (Sorry, he did not have on a name-tag and I did not think to ask his name. He was quite friendly and professional.) We chatted for a few minutes. Obviously Marioara had paid attention to the pre-arrival messages exchange between Sofia (General Manager) and me. And to top it off, I've been to Europe and worked with some developer Clients on projects in Romania. Then we ran into each other over the course of my stay a few times at the IC Club. \n\nThank you, also, Sofia, for the thoughtful welcome note and chocolates. You and your team sure know how to make your guest feel welcome and special.\n\nEven watching the paint crew taking such good care of this beautiful, \"old\" building. For one of the younger guys in particular to keep focus on the job at hand while also establishing eye contact and a huge smile - clearly they had either fine training or well-honed instincts or some combination. Along with the servers behind the bar, so gracious and helpful.\n\nTo the staff - multumesc foarte mult, merci beaucoup; adieu, ramas bun.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

When I mentioned that I wasn't best pleased about the fee the person who checked me in just shrugged his shoulders as he'd probably heard it all before....  That combo is why I have rated it this way.\n\nIf it hadn't been for that amenity fee, I'd have rated it highly.  The Club Lounge and in particular their staff in there are just wonderful.  It's a great selection of food in the evening and for breakfast and, as I said, just warm and helpful staff.  The two ladies that were there when I stayed (one of whom I recognised from a previous trip and she remembered me!) just above and beyond.\n\nRoom itself was lovely, clean and pretty big for NYC.  Their heated floor in the bathroom didn't seem to be working but the room itself was warm so not a huge issue.\n\nNot too bad a gym either for those of you wanting to use that.....having said that I think both their cross-trainers need some maintenance as the resistance buttons on either machine made no difference whatever number you typed in.\n\nThe location is also superb.  It is a short walk up the street and you can easily access the new terminal to the LIRR at Grand Central.  Very convenient. \n\nAll in all, you'll not go far wrong with the Barclay in terms of the room and\/or the Club Lounge.   The amenity fee might not be something that bothers you but, sadly, I'll not be staying at the the Barclay next time I'm in NYC as I felt as if they were gouging.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This time as my husband is staying on business we decided to stay here.  I am used to a big effusive welcome in an Intercontinental, to be treated like long lost family but you will not get that here.\nSome examples - at breakfast being ignored by waiters even though they visited next door tables with coffee but ignored me, so had to chase them down for re-fills - our room being serviced but dirty coffee cups and wine glasses left in the room - having to move rooms at midnight because the sound proofing was so bad you could clearly hear a normal conversation in the room next door - beware room 1201.  What surprised us was that management at no time got in touch to apologise, or check our new room was ok.\nDuring my husbands last stay in New York he also stayed at the InterContinental in Washington and got the usual good service we have come to know and love, so it seems this hotel is perhaps lacking effective management and the staff certainly do not seem happy, with the exception of housekeeping who were endlessly bright happy and chatty. \nI would not choose to stay here again either on holiday or for business, loyalty to the brand clearly means nothing at this hotel.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We first noticed several big holes in the top pillow, then stains on the pillow underneath. Food debris on carpet in several places, even a piece of jewellery, and crumbs on the coffee table. Stains up the wall near entrance to the bedroom, dried urine on toilet pedestal, no slippers or bottled water. \n\nA call to complain was met with really bad attitude, and no apology. A few minutes later a guy knocked on the door saying he was told to collect trash? After further explanation he returned with two clean pillowcases for us to change ourselves. A few minutes later a female member of staff arrived also to collect trash? Noise from the other side of the interconnecting door was the last straw, and resulted in me asking from the duty manager to visit the room.\n\nHe was quite shocked to see so many cleaning issues, and the lack of willing to rectify or apologise. He suggested we go out and he'd arrange to clean the room. After explaining we wanted showers and bed he offered to find another room, and 40 minutes later we had what we should have had....a clean room! Not a great start to a surprise anniversary trip. \n\nIt was a battle, and it shouldn't have been. It's basic hospitality to provide a clean room, and service recovery if things go wrong.\n\nClub Lounge staff, as part of their welcome show you where to place used plates and glasses. Yes, they encourage you to perform self service in a 5 star hotel. Probably because they're too busy socialising with each other, which I observed regularly around the hotel. Never before have I seen staff using a Club Lounge toilet, which they did regularly, never before have I seen management cut up a guest forcing the guest to stop in their tracks. I overheard a guest ask for ketchup one morning, 5 minutes before the breakfast area opened up, he was barked at and told to wait. Never have I been to a 5 star hotel and witnessed so many guests being treated like an inconvenience.  \n\nThis hotel has serious service issues. If you're used to InterContinental standards, you will not find them here. It's borderline brand damaging.\n\nI emailed Sofia the General Manager at the start of my 6 night stay, and haven't (6 days later) had the courtesy of a reply. \n\nReturning here after a 3 night break at another NYC hotel, let's see if it is just as bad! \n\nClub Lounge food, is plentiful and very varied it must be said.

The lobby area was really nice, adorned with Christmas trees, etc. The room maids were really good and tidied the room to perfection. I hear all the previous comments re drink prices, etc but I sort of expected this as it's a five star hotel.\nThe only negative is the dreaded 'amenity fee'. Now, I don't know whether this is a New York thing but when I was checking in I was 'stung' for a $40\/night plus taxes per room, per night amenity fee. This is charged whether you use any of the listed amenities or not. For me it came to just shy of $500. For me, that's quite a sizable chunk and it knocked me for six a bit as u wasn't expecting it. Why doesn't the hotel add it to their nightly rate so at least you know what the costs are up front..?\nAnyway, we had a great time and would definitely return.

It\u2019s a nice hotel in a great location: we walked to most places and really enjoyed taking in all-things New York. \n\nI was a little underwhelmed with some aspects of the hotel:\n1) Checking out from one of ours rooms at 9am, which must be one of the most common times to check out, there was only one person at the Reception desk and she sounded quite inexperienced as I kept hearing her say to someone \u201cof if I haven\u2019t done this before\u201d and she took a very long time dealing with the person. Eventually someone came to sort her out and they were then able to start processing other customers. When I checked out of our other room some hours later, the same person was still at the desk and again it took a very long time with everyone. I appreciate we all start somewhere but perhaps peak hours on their own is not the best. \n\n2) As has been mentioned by most reviewers: the soundproofing in the building is non existent. This is really not up to the standard one expects from a hotel that claims to be five star. \n\n3) Service at the bar was very slow at times.

This is a good quality hotel in terms of its building, rooms and decoration. It feels like it combines a traditional New York hotel, with a modern feel. In general the service was good, although note the point below. \n\nThe things that stop it being a 5 for me are a few things that could be improved:\n\n1. We arrived quite late from a long flight and the time to serve us and check us in was simply too long. There was only 1 member of staff on the desk and he was spending an over the top amount of time giving elaborate information to the guest in front of us. Either, he should have got another team member to help, or respected that other people were waiting and he should have managed the situation with more emotional intelligence. It felt like he was trying so hard to give \u201cgreat service\u201d to one guest, he ignored that this would impact others. We were tired, with kids, it was late. \n\n2. The price for soft drinks is simply unreasonable. I don\u2019t care if New York is expensive, $44 for 4 cans of coke is frankly obscene. You are ripping people off. We also had a room service breakfast, which was good quality (although there were a couple of mistakes), but again the cost felt excessive ($250+). \n\n3. The last point I\u2019ll make probably can\u2019t be helped, but the sound proofing in the rooms is not brilliant, so I\u2019d recommend ear plugs. It\u2019s a city hotel I guess, so a country quiet location is not to be expected. \n\nThe above points are easily addressable, although I sincerely doubt they will review the prices.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

As someone who values convenience and doesn't hesitate to pay for it, whether it's valet parking or generous tipping, I was shocked by the prices at this hotel. Typically, I don't scrutinize price, but the costs here were impossible to ignore. \n\nFor instance, a soda can was priced at $11, with an added 20% service charge. The mini-bar's weight-sensitive setup meant even a mere inspection led to potential charges, prompting an unnecessary call to the front desk to clarify we hadn't consumed anything.\n\nThe room service charges were equally absurd. A simple order of three eggs was priced at $22, excluding tax, and subjected to a $9 delivery fee plus a 23% service charge. It felt as though the hotel management was testing the limits of what they could charge for the most basic items. These observations aren't from someone who usually pays attention to prices, but the excessive rates here were hard to overlook.\n\nMy frequent visits to various 4-5 star hotels in NYC have acquainted me with the city's pricing standards, but the charges at this hotel were unlike anything I've experienced, not just in New York, but anywhere.\n","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have Diamond Elite Ambassador status with IHG.  There is only one good thing about the hotel service: the room cleaners were hard-working and first class!  I congratulate them.  However because the walls in this hotel are so thin, the cleaners arrive in hallways quite early and bang and crash and talk loudly--so much so that one should not expect to sleep well after 830 am.  The Club Lounge has limited food offerings and far, far too much fried food; healthy options are minimal. Unlike Club Lounges in more up market IHG hotels no cocktails are offered.  And be prepared to  be expected to take your plates back to the counter after eating\/drinking. Does that sound like a canteen?  It certainly feels like one.  I tried to use my  Food and Beverage Rewards held on account with IHG. Warning: these rewards have to be applied by the Ambassador desk and cannot be dealt with by the front desk at checkout of before checkout day.  When you have to queue for extended periods of time  to get these rewards applied to your bill it becomes very frustrating.  The same goes for trying to re-boot your room key if it suddenly fails.  I waited more than 30mins in a long queue just to get the room key re-booted when it failed on two occasions.  No slippers in the room. Now that is just a symptom of \"very average\".  If you are a traveller who has experienced IHG hotels on Oceania\/Asia then you will soon realize that this is a very average place. Avoid.  Realize that you are in New York where prices are high and hotel service is poor especially in \"average\" hotels like this one relative to excellent Intercontinental hotels in the IHG group Asia\/Oceania, and parts of the EU.

Check-in was quick, friendly and I got a very nice room. As I had requested, they gave me a room on a higher floor, the 14th floor (room 1443). \n\nThe room had a good view of Lexington Avenue with an art deco building in front and a thin glass skyscraper to the left. It was a good-size room with a beautiful and large lit and framed panoramic mural of a river with sailboats. The room was tastefully decorated and had a flat screen TV with a welcoming image of a Barclay Hotel. My name was shown as I put the TV on. The room also featured a small rest area. The bathroom was high-end,  classic and included all that you needed. This room was very comfortable, especially the bed and its pillows. This was a repeat visit partly because the rooms at this hotel are so enjoyable. \n\nIn general, the entire hotel was high-end and the inviting lobby bar-restaurant was just so nice early in the evening. The hotel offers a $25 dollar credit on hotel services such as the bar or the restaurant as part of a small $40 daily amenity fee. This way of doing things encourages people to take advantage of all the hotel has to offer. Drinks are especially good and the manager there was friendly and service was outstanding.\n\nThe room was also made up quickly in the morning, was very clean and service was again perfect. Concierge and Staff on the main level were nice, really helpful, and efficient. I got really great advice on new New York attractions I wanted to see (the Highline, Hudson Yards, Little Island, etc.). \n\nThe hotel is just steps from Park Avenue, One Vanderbilt and three blocks from Rockefeller Center. This made it easy to visit midtown and Central Park. Subway access was close in order to get to Lower Manhattan using Grand Central Terminal or an even closer subway access.\n\nThe entire stay at the New York Barclay was so perfect. After great days of sightseeing, of walking in different parks, of admiring the impressive New York Skyline and of going out to Lower Manhattan to see One WTC or take a city cruise, you knew you were coming back afterwards to a beautiful and relaxing room. New York remains my favorite city and this hotel helped make it a memorable summer vacation. \n\nI highly recommend this hotel for its location, easy access to transportation, nice staff and comfortable accommodations. This hotel offers great service and amenities that make a stay there again truly memorable.\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

I always look at the Barclay as my home from home when staying in NYC whether be on business or a private trip.  What makes any hotel are the staff and you will most certainly not be disappointed by the staff - a special mention should be made to Leslie, Sanella, Paulette, Silvia in the Club Lounge and Ambassador check-in area and also the concierge team of Yuri and Lillian.

It turned out that IHG is a tournament sponsor so there were some added amenities and excitement, like neat tennis themed displays plus players, coaches and US Open Staff on site, during our stay. We also leveraged a tennis tour provider for easy shuttle rides to & from the US Open in Flushing NY.  The #7 subway line is another easy option to and from US Open Tennis. \n\nThe hotel is very nice and conveniently located  in Midtown so easy access to restaurants and not too long an Uber or Taxi ride or walk to and from the Theater District and Times Square and other attractions. The area around the hotel felt safe.\n\nOnce all the taxes and fees hit the all in hotel rate is pricey but it seems like good value, especially for a higher end property in Midtown. The hotel staff is super nice (shout out to Kevin at the Front Desk and Faysel at Breakfast). The Concierge Desk is also very helpful with resturant, club and tour ideas. The hotel also has a Bell Station to help with luggage and taxis and they will hold your bags if killing some time after checkout. We booked the breakfast package with our room rate which is a good deal compared to the menu prices. The breakfast buffet is very nice so it works out well if you plan to dine at the hotel in the morning - plus it\u2019s served till 11 am which allows a sleep in if overly enjoying the nightlife (or if the tennis eve matches run into the wee hours of the morning). The buffet is also well maintained and the staff working the area seems to take a lot of pride in the food quality, presentation and general cleanliness of the serving area. There is also a nice cafe around the corner if you prefer to just go offsite to grab a quick cup of coffee and a bite for breakfast. The front desk will provide a card for a 15% discount at that nice corner cafe. The lobby bar is nice, well staffed, and stays open till 11:30. \n\nThe hotel itself seems very well maintained, safe and clean. \n\nOur biggest takeaway was how nice the staff was. I tend to chat up folks and found that there were some employees who had been at the property for many years (one nearly 40) which speaks volumes about a positive work environment which translates to a well managed operation.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Barclay is a far cry from the 4\/5 star it advertises.\n\nThe advice to manage the situation had been to keep showers short or take a bath (with no bath tub in the room...) and my experience was that this is entirely impractical and basically a careless response.

There is a certain level of service that we've learned to expect at an IHG property. Barclays is a beautiful property in a great location but an exception in terms of service and staff. I\u2019m writing this review to document the unprofessional service we experienced at this property by the night staff.\n\nWe checked into the property at about 10pm. We had a reservation for a premier king room (high floor) for 4 nights. Upon entry into the room we immediately realized that we were downgraded. We went back to the front desk and were connected with Anthony (the night manager) and Kay (front desk). Both refused to acknowledge the miss. When we pushed further, Anthony repeatedly stated that there were no available rooms and that our only option was to accept what they had assigned us. We contested the response and after about 30mins, the only solution presented was to switch to another room starting the next day. Given that it was already 11pm in the night, this was acceptable to us until we asked, that Anthony confirm that we would be moved to the room category that we had paid for, to which Anthony responded that there aren't any guarantees that can be made.\n\nOur substandard interaction with Anthony continued as now he had started bashing on Expedia and Hotels.com, claiming that there is no such category as 'premier king room (high floor)' at the IHG Barclay and that our booking isn't what's shown on their internal \u201csystem\u201d. When we showed him the \u201cpremier king room (high floor)\u201d on IHG Barclay's official website. He confidently claimed their own hotel website was also wrong. All while conveniently refusing to show us what their internal \"system\" stated as proof.\n\nThis was no longer about the room, we understand that stuff happens and sometimes hotels (just like flights) oversell on bookings. This was now about the absolute refusal to acknowledge a mistake, followed by zero effort to fix anything, and mostly egregiously, the blatant and incessant lying and putting the blame on the customer. If we had not realized and raised the issue we would have pre-paid a premium rate for a classic room. The entire experience left us feeling cheated and unappreciated. A truly terrible start to a vacation.\n\nThe next day we worked with the Day manager who acknowledged and fixed the issue for us.

It would have been great if the concierge had taken the initiative to inform me about this fee during check-in and the various entitlements that comes with it, especially since I had specifically inquired about any additional charges. This oversight on my part could have been avoided with better communication from the hotel's staff. \n\nWhat's worst of all was when I queried about the Amenity Fee with the Front desk, I was told that \"the Amenity Fee is actually for all IHG properties and not just the Barclay\", which was outright a lie to shut me off. (see screenshot)\n\nSpeaking of check-in and check-out, the process was quite slow due to the limited number of staff available. With only one or two people at the front desk, there was always a long queue of guests waiting to complete the formalities. Each time I had to wait for about 10-15 minutes, which was a bit tiresome after a long journey.\n\nOn a positive note, the room itself was lovely and exuded a classy ambiance. The bed was comfortable, ensuring a good night's sleep after a day of exploring the city. However, I was surprised to find that the hotel didn't offer complimentary bottled water in the room, and it was instead available at an additional charge. Such amenities are usually expected at a hotel of this caliber, and their absence was surprising.\n\nThe most disheartening part of my stay was the experience with the concierge call. I called to request a fork, and the lady who attended to the call was incredibly rude and impatient. Her tone suggested a lack of interest in assisting guests, and it almost seemed like she was forced to do the job. Sadly, it took a whole 40 minutes for a simple request for a fork to be fulfilled by the team, which was not only frustrating but also quite surprising for a hotel of this caliber.\n\nI believe that with some attention to these areas, the hotel can truly shine and continue to be a sought-after destination for travelers like myself.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

Hopefully, people would see it and not get scammed by this property or the paid high rating they get through Priceline.\nWe experienced a disappointing service throughout our whole stay. No one expects that when paying for a highly rated hotel with international high standards. (Take your money somewhere else where they will appreciate you as a guest)\nWe arrived to our room after a long trip and I found the room is not cleaned since the last guest left. Of course, the staff acted surprised and they challenged me. After they confirmed, it is true, they apologized and changed the room to a better one as they claimed. (after wasting an hour)\nAfter that, I was assigned another room hoping I could enjoy my weekend but unfortunately the AC broke and started leaking in front of my room. (as you can see in the picture) instead of fixing it, they put a bucket. (Is this what they do in well respected hotel? I don\u2019t think so?) The room started smelling like mold which is a health hazard. \nOut of their generosity they again switched my room. I\u2019m being sarcastic here because they kept repeating that the reason they could not serve me well because I booked through 3rd party (Priceline) with a condescending tone, it felt like they were giving me charity.\nNothing was working in the room, and good luck finding someone to pick up the phone. I decided to demand what is agreed on in my stay. It took them 2 hours to replace a hair dryer. That is when I stopped asking for my amenities, because I\u2019m probably asking for too much. (Having functioning machines in my room).\nIn this hotel they charge amenities fees, which I don\u2019t mind at all if I\u2019m getting my money\u2019s worth. However, they will charge you and provide no service whether you like it or not. Also, good luck with room service because either they won\u2019t pick up the call till you complain or never pick up. So I think they should just stop offering a service that they cannot support. \nMy final observation for my fellow Arabs, I know we enjoy staying in nice places. However, they hate your guts here, they are racist. I overheard the staff talking about how stupid Arabs are and how they scam them out of their money. It was very disappointing to hear that. So my advice is to go somewhere else where they appreciate you as a guest. NYC has many other hotels with much better staff and service. \nI am shocked by the lack of service provided at this hotel and the condescending tone from the personnel. This is not what they claim (high standards the Intercontinental claims to uphold)\n\nPS. I have wrote an email to the managers of the property. Sofia Vandaele and Lucien Bance.

Bathroom was nice, and appeared newly renovated.  We had enough towels and toiletries. \n We were only there 2 days, so did not use maid service.  We slept well, with no noise issues.  Check-in process was not a good first impression. I waited in a very long line to check in  on a Friday evening, with not even one person at the reception desk.  There were 3 hotel employees chit chatting at the bellman's desk.  Finally, after waiting a significant amount of time, 2 receptionists showed up and the line began to move. This hotel charges a $40 a day amenity fee, which becomes $50 after taxes.  It gives you a $25 a day credit in the restaurant or bar, which charge double what all the surrounding bars and restaurants charge.  In a nutshell, it is just a con to get an extra $50 a night on the room. It feels like being cheated, which doesn't leave a great impression.  The quality of drinks at the lobby bar was disappointing, especially considering the high price. Drinks were typically $25.  Surrounding businesses in the area charged around $12.  Neighborhood was pretty good. We saw nothing to be concerned about.  Can walk to Broadway shows and several restaurants.  Check out process was quick and efficient.

The room was a good size for New York, and although the bathroom didn't have a bathtub, there was everything you need for a comfortable stay. The bed was nice, and everything was very clean. \n\nIt's a grand old hotel and you really feel the history.  The d\u00e9cor was traditional but modern with a huge television, and an automatic mini-bar with a tiny space 'for you own items' \u2013 you could probably fit a can of cola in there but not much else. Which brings me to one of the issues \u2013 the prices! Room service and mini-bar prices are ridiculously, extortionately, unbelievably, crazily expensive. I know fancy hotels are always pricey, but these ones were laughable, and that's before they add various taxes and fees on top of the prices which have already made your eyes water.  \n\nThe amenity fee charged by the hotel does give you $25 room service credit per day, but I doubt that would be enough to buy you a glass of water delivered to your room. There's no complimentary water provided, which is pretty standard in good hotels these days.\n\nDidn't encounter any of the check-in\/out queues other people have mentioned however the room was only cleaned two days of my four. Location is a little out of the way from the main sights but its  a short walk to 5th Avenue and Times Square. I don't think this hotel is up to the luxury standards of other Intercontinental hotels but it's perfectly fine.  ","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

We experienced delays at the reception desk every day. There were plenty of desks, but only usually 1 or perhaps 2 people working there.\n\nOur room was booked as part of a package deal with British Airways. We weren't impressed to find some dirty underwear of a previous occupant on the floor in the closet. The closet was also extremely dusty.\n\nWe complained to the duty manager who promise us a new, upgraded room, which he would personally inspect himself. He also agreed to waive the amenity fee. We went off to grab some food and get our bearings, and came back to our new room. It was apparently an upgrade, but we struggled to see how it was any different to our original room whatsoever.\n\nOur 2nd room was also dirty. The top of the headboard had thick, thick dirt on it. Not just a bit dusty, this had clearly not been cleaned in a long while. The skirting boards were thick with dust, as was the mirror, as were the bathroom toiletries, as were numerous other areas.\n\nI went down to Guest Services, with photos and videos, and was accused of \"looking for things to complain about\". The previous manager was nowhere to be seen, and we got a half hearted apology, and offer of some more cleaning from someone. We were exhausted, so opted to sleep and deal with it the next day.\n\nWith full credit to British Airways, I emailed their duty desk in the morning, who called the hotel within 10 minutes. They emailed me to say the hotel informed them the matter had been dealt with and we were happy with the outcome. WHAT?! I wouldn't have sent the email if we were happy.\n\nOff I went, again, back downstairs to find a member of the management team. She told me she thought we were happy in our 3rd bedroom, as that's what had been handed over to her. We were only in our 2nd room, not 3rd, and we did not feel the matter was resolved to our satisfaction. \n\nEventually, they agreed to a free night as compensation. But the whole experience was unnecessary and poorly dealt with. As for being accused of looking for things to complain about.... there are no words.\n\nOn the positive side, the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! And the pillows and linens first class.\n\nThe doormen were a fabulous, and Eddie the Bell Hop was an absolute treasure. The barman was delightful, although the price of food and drink was above average.\n\nThe decor was lovely, and the fresh orchids in the foyer were beautiful.\n\nAll in all, we wouldn't stay here again though. The attitude of some staff was extremely questionable for any establishment, let alone a 5 star hotel. And finding dirty underwear in the closet was inexcusable.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

However as someone who has stayed in IHG Hotels since 1997 I have to say this was one experience to forget. \nYou pay an amenity fee of $45 per day of which you get to spend $25 at the bar which covered one drink. You pay $54 a day in taxes ( I know that's a city tax but you should be forewarned). So you are $99 a day on top of your room rate. If you get a parcel delivered you are charged $12.50 handling fee. So the contents were $6 and the hotel handling fee $12.50. So no customer service there.\nFor the total you pay you would expect great service. Not here it isn't. \nOur room had one bathrobe and one set of slippers. When we asked for a second set we were told one set is normal however a second set would be sent up. Never came.\nAnother day we asked for some more milk for our coffee as 2 small containers  was not enough. Be right up they said. Never came.\nThey use paper cups for the room coffee which tastes of wax and are disposable. To save washing China cups I expect. One day the cleaner left her washing rag in the bathroom. In the sink to be precise \nThis hotel stops at nothing to monetise your experience and the service is nowhere near what I would expect from an IHG hotel. They are nowhere near IHG Brand standards. \nA five night stay averaged $400 per night and we did not eat here or have breakfast. \nI will continue to stay at IHG hotels as normally the rooms and service are impeccable.\nJust not at this one.\n","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Hotel itself is nicely furnished, clean, has larger than average rooms, and it conveniently located. Where it falls short is in service and it's misleading ads and billing. For starters, the check-in is horrendous and took almost 30 minutes on a Friday night at 9 PM. Even people who checked in online were forced to wait to just get their keys. And judging from the best constant line during our stay the long check in lines look to be the norm. In terms of misleading ads, the hotel offers rooms with a city view. These come at a premium to other rooms of the same size. Don't fall for this. Our city view room was on the 3rd floor sand overlooked a noisy street corner and building under construction. I raised this with the desk upon check in and they first said that this was in fact a city view and then rambled on about being overbooked. After already having waited 30+ minutes to check in were let it go. The other issue we had was in the price going practice of a $39 amenity fee which you can get a portion back if you decide to buy overpriced coffee or get God's from the minibar which automatically bills you if you simply move something.

We were visiting from the UK & bought it as a package with our flights & paid in advance for breakfast.\nThough there are cheaper hotels we thoroughly appreciated the comfort and luxury of this historic 1920s hotel.\nLocation was great and there was even an entrance to the Grand central station 1 minute from the hotel and Times Square was a 10 minute walk away, Central park 25 min walk. \n\nWe were so glad when we saw all the lights & noise of Times Square that the Barclay is on a quiet road and we were never disturbed by traffic noise (nor by any noise from other guests.)\nThe beds were very comfortable and our room was a good size. I requested a bath not just a shower but I think most rooms just have showers. Breakfast was delicious- lovely fresh fruit, smoothies, overnight oats, hot food such as scrambled eggs and saut\u00e9ed asparagus and lovely donuts and gold topped \u00e9clairs, bagels and bread to toast. I was glad we\u2019d paid for breakfast as the hotel charged $108 for breakfast for 2. Mir served us attentively at breakfast and we appreciated him (sadly we saw some guests not being respectful to him.) \nDaily room charge was around $43 dollars but that included $25 credit each day to spend in the hotel so we bought drinks in the elegant bar area and enjoyed the tasty salads from the menu.\n\nOne consideration for the management- not environmentally friendly to only give paper cups and no mugs at all in the room. \nI take my British Tetley tea bags with me when I travel and having requested a kettle in my room was able to make myself the vital morning tea, but did not like drinking it from a paper cup. Ironic as even the cheapest bed and breakfast hotel in the UK has china cups.\n\nThe staff who cleaned our rooms greeted us pleasantly on the corridor and kept the rooms very clean. It was my husband\u2019s 50th birthday and we were very pleased to receive a bottle of red wine and a card signed by the management. \n\nIt was an expensive holiday for us (NYC is so expensive!) but we loved it!","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Housekeeping were cheerful and helpful when asked and did a great job in cleaning the room. Coffee machine was fine, only green tea provided. The mini bar water was not replenished. When I called to ask they said the mini bar would not be replenished (even though I was staying for 5 days) but that someone from food and beverage would call me (!) - I never received any call and obviously bought my own water in Walgreens. Very limited tv channels, no pay tv. Room service only accessible through website. I ordered room service three times and on each occasion there were multiple mistakes. When I called to correct it each time the person argued that I got my order wrong rather than offering to correct it, apart from the waiter noticed there was no coffee and brought me the pot.

I checked into room 457 (on the 4th Floor), unpacked my bags and left the hotel. When I returned 4 1\/2 hours later, someone else was in my room eating a room service meal. Thinking I had possibly made a mistake, I went to the front desk. \n\nThe front desk told me I had the wrong room and my room was on the 14th floor. I informed them that was not possible and that I had unpacked all of my belongings in my room on the 4th floor. The front desk attendant insisted I was wrong and argued with me before agreeing to let me speak with a manager, who took 15 minutes to come speak with me. The manager informed me that there had been a plumbing issue in my room and they were forced to remove my belongings on an emergency basis. This seemed unlikely as I had not reported any plumbing issue and I was only gone from the room for 4 1\/2 hours (during which time someone other than me would have had to report a plumbing issue in my room, the hotel would have had to find an after-hours plumber, the plumber would have had to resolve the issue and repair any damage, the hotel\u2019s housekeeping crew would have had to remove my items and clean the room and then have time for another guest to check in and that guest had time to order room service). \n\nI asked why the hotel did not contact me to inform me of the issue and the manager replied that none of my contact details were stored on the hotel\u2019s reservation system, which was blatantly untrue as all of my information was included on the booking, as confirmed by multiple subsequent managers and my travel agent. I was also traveling as part of a conference and a number of the conference administrators' contact details were also listed on the booking. \n\nAt this point, a bellman stepped in front of my face and began yelling at me. At first, he yelled \"Do you want to argue with the computer?\" I said that was ridiculous and he yelled \"I don't care who you think you are. Shut the [blank] up!\" The shift manager did nothing. The security guard did nothing. Instead of trying to assist, the manager and security guard let the bellman yell at me some more until they finally took me to the bell desk storage room, where my belongings had been put in plastic laundry bags like trash and left on a luggage rack. At this point, I felt physically threatened and in imminent physical danger. \n\nIn the storage room, the bellman continued to yell at me and said I should collect my own belongings. When I started to push the luggage cart out of the storage area, the security guard stopped me and finally asked another bellman to assist with my items.\n\nIn sum, the staff yelled at me, cursed at me and made me feel physically threatened. The staff lied to me multiple times (and have since admitted that there was no plumbing issue and that they had my contact information). They did not move my belongings to another room but instead dumped them in plastic bags. I had to speak with 3 different shift managers before the general manager bothered to contact me, even though I had made multiple requests to speak with the GM and she had been on shift for many hours. To make it up to me, the 2nd shift manager offered to buy me a cup of hot chocolate!!\n\nI was unable to sleep due to concern for my safety and absolute fury at my treatment at the hands of the staff. I was even more appalled when the staff manager informed me that the threatening bellman may be on duty when I return because he was a union employee and there was nothing they could do to remove him.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Room was spacious, comfortable and beautifully decorated, it looked like it had been recently refurbished. Plenty of storage for our clothes and stuff. Room amenities included a coffee\/tea maker and minibar. Breakfast (included with our room) was good and varied, they kept changing the hot food options every day. Check-in was quick with no queue when we arrived (mid afternoon). Staff were mostly friendly and helpful. Room service food (2 dinners) was good.\n\nThe not-so-good\nMinibar was automated (the \u201ctouch that coke can and we\u2019ll charge you $11\u201d type) and coffee\/tea maker was pod-type. Just 2 black tea pods on arrival that were replaced by 2 green tea pods (because hey, tea is tea and it\u2019s all the same, right?). No proper mini-fridge meant no chance of buying a salad or yogurts for a light dinner and keep it in the room. Bathroom had just a shower and no bath. No way to know all this in advance, as the website includes zero information about room amenities (room details for our \u201cKing Premium High Floor\u201d are listed as \u201cNon smoking\u201d, \u201c1 King Bed\u201d, \u201cPremium\u201d and \u201cHigh Floor\u201d - duh!).\nWe knew in advance about the \u201camenities fee\u201d as our booking listed $360 for \u201cadditional charges\u201d. In return, hotel offers some perks including a 10% discount at the caf\u00e9 next door (saves you $3, tops), a 15% discount at Bloomingdale\u2019s that excluded 2 of 3 things we bought there, and a daily $25 discount on hotel food that doesn\u2019t get you far considering the prices.\n\nThe just plain weird\nThe in-room hair dryer was old, dirty and dodgy-looking. It did work, but sounded like it was about to perish and take me with it if it could, so I didn\u2019t dare use it. The contrast between the tatty hair dryer and the plush room decor was bizarre.\nOur room included a fancy huge Google TV that offered the same as any old TV set: no hotel bill viewing, no option to cast video content from our devices and no online services, not even YouTube. The options were there, just didn\u2019t work.\nBreakfast experience was hit and miss. First day we were made to wait until a group of two finished as we were told there were no free tables, however we saw two empty tables that were set up for four. The following days we saw groups of two being sat at tables for four. Also on the first day one of the waiters insisted on letting us know how the couple sitting behind us, who had just left, had been rude to him\u2026 We found this unprofessional. I wonder what he said of us to the next guys after we left!\nConcierge hours are odd. On our second morning we tried to buy some hop-on hop-off bus tickets and were told the concierge wouldn\u2019t arrive until 11am. Waiting meant losing the morning, so we just left.\nThe hotel appears to have a \u201cvirtual valet\u201c called Perle that kept texting me suggesting I join them for live music events. It asked for comments on our experience and I wrote some of the remarks above, but it never replied and nobody got in touch.\n\nAll in all, our stay was nice enough and we might consider going back next time we visit NYC, but we\u2019ll look at other, similar hotels in Manhattan first.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":93462,"title":"Excellent choice for Diamond Ambassador Members","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-04-15","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"We are Diamond Ambassador IHG One members, and I used the annual free weekend night certificate for our stay. To maximize the benefit, I booked a club-level room, to which we added a third night at a significantly reduced AAA rate. As great as the savings were, I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of taxes and fees. Even though the second night was \u201cfree,\u201d I was still charged double the taxes and fees, including taxes and fees for the club lounge, something I\u2019ve never even seen before, so this may be a uniquely NYC tax. I was also charged amenity fees, including for the \u201cfree\u201d night,\u201d even though I was never informed what amenities were included in this fee at check-in. I still don\u2019t know what they were, only that I didn\u2019t benefit from any of them. My tip for future guests: Even if you are exhausted by a late-night check-in and long line to be helped, ask about taxes, fees, and amenity charges so that you won\u2019t be surprised upon check-out.\n\nPrior to check-in, I had communicated by e-mail with the hotel\u2019s manager, Sofia Vandaele (Sofia.Vandaele@ihg.com) and requested an upgrade to a suite, which was one category above the room that I had booked. She confirmed the upgrade the day before our check-in.\n\nWe arrived to the hotel around 11 PM, and there was only one employee at the check-in counter and a line three-people deep upon our arrival. There is a dedicated counter for Ambassador members, but it is not staffed at night. As Diamond members, I asked about the difference between breakfast at the restaurant or at the lounge, which the employee referred to repeatedly as the \u201cVIP\u201d lounge instead of the club lounge. He claimed that the food selections would be the same, so I should choose the VIP lounge of the hotel\u2019s restaurant. From pictures I\u2019ve seen of the breakfast buffet in the restaurant and reading the menu, I was surprised and impressed that in fact the club lounge buffet is even nicer than the hotel\u2019s restaurant in that the buffet display is more elegant, and the rooms are private, whereas the restaurant spills out into the lobby. Outside of a Ritz Carlton, it was the nicest breakfast buffet that I have seen in a domestic club lounge. Certainly no Marriot or Westin that I\u2019ve ever visited could compare. An especially nice touch is that there were some different food items each of the three days instead of identical offerings, which could have gotten old by the third day.\n\nThe suite was elegant and felt like we were staying in a posh, upper-east-side apartment. The hotel provided a delightful welcome amenity of a taxi created out of white chocolate with chocolate-dipped cookies inside as well as a strawberry dipped in white chocolate. The bed was comfortable and had soft pillows. The bathroom did not have a tub but had a heated floor. While there was no bidet, there was a bidet-like wand next to the toilet which was both tricky to figure out how to use and ended up being unwieldy. The mini-bar was one of those where you can\u2019t move anything without getting charged, but it had a small section where you could put your own food or drinks.\n\nMy only complaint were the televisions, which had no capacity for allowing guests to view the bill, use Chromecast, or even provide a selection of streaming platforms to use. While we didn\u2019t end up spending much time in the room in any case, these features would have come in handy, and the manager did tell me that the televisions were due to be upgraded by the end of the second quarter, whenever that is.\n\nBecause there was no way to view my folio, I had to go to the ambassador desk twice to look at it. I was charged an upgraded internet fee for one day which the employee removed but only after scolding me for not using an access code, even though I explained to her that nobody had informed me about an access code. This employee turned out to be the only rude person at the hotel, whose staff were otherwise exceptionally friendly and helpful. Each time that I tipped the housekeeper, she demonstrated a genuine appreciation, so let me put in a plug here to please tip the housekeepers. They did a terrific job keeping the room tidy during their twice-daily visits, something that almost seems obsolete in this day-and-age. The turn-down service included a collection of Neuhaus chocolate eggs on Easter.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s location was ideal. In debating between the Barclay or Times Square locations, the latter of which would have been cheaper, we decided on the Barclay for its history (according to the lobby museum, Hemingway put his final touches on For Whom the Bell Tolls while a guest) and its quiet, yet convenient, location. We definitely felt like we had made the right choice. This is a property that knows how to treat its Diamond Ambassador guests.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As IHG \u2018Diamond Ambassador\u2019 I previously always received the guaranteed upgrade that is part of this paid membership level. Not this time. \nThe app had shown an upgrade of the room the evening before my arrival, so I didn\u2019t bother asking. And I checked in quickly at night so as to not hold up other people after waiting in the queue for more than 15 minutes like me. Note, there is no ambassador\/member counter anymore. \nTo my surprise when I got to the room it was not an upgraded one, and in the app it also showed the booked category. When I called the reception, they plainly said I got what I booked. After being *that guy* and politely explaining the ambassador \u201cguaranteed upgrade\u201d concept, they said that no higher categories were available. A quick check in the app proved that wrong. They said a manager would call me back. I just worked a bit in the room and called them again 30 minutes later. Again, a manager would call me back. After another 30 minutes I was done with my work, unplugged the phone and went to sleep. \n\nIn summary, they if you are an IC ambassador member and think you should be getting what you paid for, I cannot recommend this hotel. Also, if you think your politely communicated concerns should at least be acknowledged, I also cannot recommend this hotel. ","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

There is a display by the lifts telling the story.\nWe had a 2 x double room for a family of four. The \u2018double beds\u2019 however were more the size of a 3\/4 bed and very soft. My back ached throughout our stay but our daughters surprisingly managed to share a 3\/4 bed without too many arguments.\nBreakfast wasn\u2019t included and cost a fortune at the hotel so we got up early and walked to nearby eateries for breakfast. My favourite was New York Luncheonette on E 50th two blocks away. We tried to be there by 8am and only once had to queue for a table. They served quintessential New York breakfast fare such as pancakes, bacon and maple syrup, waffles and fruit etc as well as healthier options. The staff were very welcoming. This breakfast really set us up for the day. One morning we tried Ole & Steen, a bakery which is on the corner and part of the hotel building. There was quite a long queue for danishes and coffee at the counter, and not a lot of choice of juices for the children, and finding seating was difficult. The staff here were not as pleasant and one in particular was quite rude.\nThe hotel gave a $25 per room per day credit in the bar as an enticement, however $25 didn\u2019t go far at this bar so expensive were the prices, which meant we had to spend more for drinks for the four of us. Therefore we only went once.\nA block south on Lexington Av is a pharmacy  where it was much cheaper to buy bottles of water etc than the minibar in the room. This was actually a tip we got from the bellboy.\nWe tried Toscana 49 on E 49th for dinner one evening. Booking online was easy and we were warmly welcomed, but it was slightly expensive, especially the wine. Patsy\u2019s Pizzeria on 2nd Av was more reasonably priced and while we were there there were NYPD cops eating there which made it feel very authentic.\nGrand Central Terminal is really close to the hotel giving access by subway to the whole city. 51st Station is nearer to the hotel but didn\u2019t have as many journey options.\nTimes Sq and Bryant Park was within walking distance as well as Central Park.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The way I describe it is a hotel that is confused on whether it wants to be 5 star hotel or a 4 star hotel.  Why do I say this?  To argue for 5 stars, it's a historic building in a premium Park Ave almost location. The rooms are recently renovated to a very good standard with great bedding, nice bathrooms and the hotel has beautiful common areas.  It's well staffed with the feeling of a high end Park Ave hotel.  \n\nThe reason why I say it's somewhat of a 4 star hotel is from the culture and service of the hotel.  If I stay at a Four Seasons, you get the 5 star treatment.  Customer is almost always right and they are there to make sure the experience is top class.  Of course you'll likely pay 2x or more than the Barclay. So the price of this hotel is more reflective of a 4 star hotel.  And the service is more akin to a 4 star hotel.  Less personal service. They charge a $45 amenity fee and claim you can have $25 credit per night.  I spent $54 on the buffet but then I find out the $25 can only be used until midnight the night before.  As a Platinum IHG member, I would think they would apply it to my buffet since they didn't inform me of it but they would not.  Again, this is not something I've ever experienced at a 5 star hotel.  Why fight about $25 fee that I paid for? Again this goes back to the service. The front desk attendants are more like a typical Marriott.  It's not bad it's just the culture of a 5 star hotel.  Don't expect an exclusive premium experience here.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The clerk seemed a bit confused about Diamond breakfast at first but then wrote out the coupons.  The bellman Eric delivered our rooms and I was glad to have bell service at that hour as I was exhausted.  Eric remembered our names and spoke when on duty for the rest of our stay.  \n\nAfter going to bed very late and having to be up early, I arrived at breakfast and presented the coupon.  The hostess, Kristen, as she was seating us pointed in to the breakfast buffet stating we could have anything on the cold side with our coupon or could have the hot side for an additional $10.  I pointed out that there had to be a hot option per IHG terms and conditions, and she said I could have scrambled eggs.  After being seated I went back to discuss showing her the direct wording from the IHG app.  She said she is just the messenger and I understood that, but asked her to convey that up and I would like a better answer from Management.  She waived the $10 charges for that morning while it was being researched.  I did indeed receive a call from Hotel Manager Mr. Kaiser who relayed that procedures had been changed and coupons were being reprinted to appropriately reflect that Diamond members are entitled to the full buffet.  I appreciated the follow up and quick action.  This shows the hotel is indeed in tune to its guests.\n\nHaving lounge acces through Milestone Rewards, we very much enjoyed the Club Lounge.

We checked in and were allocated a room on the third floor, the road noise was horrendous and thankfully we did persuade the hotel to move us after one night which they did with no problem. \nOn day two I noticed that we had already been billed $500 on my credit card at check in so queried it with the front desk. They said there was a mandatory $45 per day amenities tax plus they took an extra amount to cover any potential room charges? However they did say we had a $25 per day credit that could be spent in the hotel, hence the visit to the bar to try the cocktail. \nOn checking out we saw that we had still been billed well over the expected amount as the credit had not been correctly applied \nI visited guest relations who explained that the $25 per credits were not rolled over and could only be used each day, this was not what the front desk had told us on day two. Guest relations did take off one bar bill as a good will gesture. \nBasically I think the front desk team need to be made aware of what the hotel policies are and how they are applied and do a better job of explaining them to guests on check in not letting them find out when checking out. \nI suggested to guest relations that they should give each guest a card with the details inside the key card , she then gave me a printed card and said that is exactly what they should be doing. Turns out that we were not informed about other \u201cbenefits\u201d of paying this charge either such as a 10% discount at the Danish coffee shop that we had visited on each day of our five day visit! \nIn conclusion I think the fees are ridiculous particularly as the staff don\u2019t really understand them or inform guests about them \nCorporate greed doesn\u2019t encourage customer loyalty. \nI will now make a effort in future to avoid hotel\u2019s charging Amenity Fees although it\u2019s not always easy to know when these charges may apply , I would rather they just increased the room rate for the sake of clarity.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Quando a recepcionista imprimiu o relat\u00f3rio de consumo, in\u00fameros itens do frigobar que sequer tinham sido consumidos estavam constando.

Ao questionar novamente, a recepcionista come\u00e7ou a ficar rude, SUGERIU que eu tivesse consumido aqueles itens do frigobar e me encaminhou para resolver o \"problema\" com o seu gerente, no guich\u00ea ao lado (o gerente, acredito que de nome Christian, foi muito cordial e educado e prontamente resolveu tudo).\n\nAgora, eu me pergunto: o servi\u00e7o de limpeza esteve TODOS os nove dias de estadia na minha su\u00edte, em nenhum dos dias foi recolhido ou reposto nenhum item do frigobar. Como poderia ter sido consumido algo?\n\nPara finalizar, no dia seguinte (\u00faltimo dia de viagem), tomamos caf\u00e9 da manh\u00e3 no pr\u00f3prio hotel e, como j\u00e1 havia pago as pend\u00eancias do quarto, me dirigi \u00e0 recep\u00e7\u00e3o para realizar o pagamento do caf\u00e9 da manh\u00e3 ($110 USD). Apenas solicitei que fossem retirados os $25 USD da \"Resort Amenity Fee\" que t\u00ednhamos direito por dia, por acomoda\u00e7\u00e3o (e que praticamente nem utilizamos durante a hospedagem). E, para minha surpresa, a atendente da manh\u00e3 (n\u00e3o me recordo o nome), disse que n\u00e3o  faria a redu\u00e7\u00e3o da taxa de resort porque j\u00e1 hav\u00edamos realizado o pagamento na noite anterior (ainda est\u00e1vamos hospedados, com pleno uso do quarto).

The hotel is gorgeous, reception staff excellent especially Gregory and Shena. Also Lilian in guest relations helped us beyond belief with phone issues  We booked for Christmas and our daughters 16th birthday. We were moved to a bigger room immediately after mentioning why we has come. We had chocolate mouse in the room as treat for her birthday too.  Nothing seems too much trouble at all. Our maid is Shirley and she works so hard, our room  always spotless. Our resort fees we included with BA. The New York  people from police officers to bus drivers and shop workers are so welcoming. Sadly this is more than I can say for the bar tenderness at the hotel. They are rude, cold, abrupt and miserable.  They make your feel as your an inconvenience. We waited nearly 40 minutes to be served the other evening and when I approached Muhammad Mimi.. after been looked at several times by different table waiters and being ignored and ushered away.. I thought he may serve us but he was totally aggressive and in my face telling me I'm not the only person in the hotel and to sit down and wait he is busy.. he then said he was going to check the CCTV as there was no way we would have been waiting that long!!  I was on shocked that a member of staff would speak to a guest with such aggression and annoyance as he did to me.  As nice as the young lady that managed the bar was,  I got the feeling that nothing would be done but probably not for the want of her trying im sure. We don't want anything from the hotel but we feel that this is badly letting the team down.  We have not been to the bar since.  We wouldn't normally write a review whilst still away but had to be done as such shocking behaviour. To  end on a positive note ..if the bar\/lobby area for a relaxing hot or cold beverage wouldn't be something you would use then this hotel is wonderful.  We are on the 12th floor and are really pleased with everything except Muhammed Mimi and Co !!

She assigned my partner and me to a room that was clearly meant for one person (see picture of bed attached). We were among several customers who complained and asked for a king size \/ larger bed leading me to believe that this is a stunt the hotel tries to pull regularly. The hotel also charges an amenities fee which they partially \u201crefund\u201d by giving guests $25 per day to use on hotel amenities - keep in mind that a bottle of water is already $11 and even a basic green salad from the bar is $29 once you factor in the $4 gratuity they automatically add to the check. They also charge $9 for bringing food to a room (something I\u2019ve never heard of at any 4 let alone 5 star hotel and which gave very \u201ccheap\u201d vibes).

As a platinum member I used my rewards points to stay here, but that was also pretty much everything that membership could be used for (but I did get a chocolate and note in my room).  \n\nTo take the positives first, location is of course great and being refurbished in 2016 the rooms are also quite delicate. Common areas are also nice, clean and classy. Other than that though I'm not impressed given it's general price point and what you would expect from an Intercontinental hotel.\n\nIt even started before our stay as I sent an e-mail to the hotel with a question before our arrival, and after about a week without answer I had to send a reminder for them to reply. It's disappointing enough that a hotel like this feels they need four working days to reply to e-mails (as per their auto reply), but when they can't even deliver on that, it's not good enough.\n\nI also tried to enquire about an early check-in for at least one of our rooms, but no luck. When we arrived the request had not even been recorded. Pretty much all IHG-rewards benefits are now \"based on availability\" which means that the feeling is that most hotel staff rather don't bother to go the extra mile anymore and hide behind this. Given it is the policy though, I can of course not expect that such a request will be granted, but I'm quite sure that one of 700 rooms was ready before 3PM sharp, so my mother and my 4 year old didn't have to wait in the lobby for 2 hours while my wife and I were delivering our rental car. When I came back to check-in I also found our luggage standing unattended outside the luggage room, with PC's and everything else up for grabs if anyone had wanted to. My mom neither had received any ticket\/confirmation of the baggage being registered, so when claiming it we just had to point it out (and they didn't do anything to check that we were actually the owners).  \n\nCheck-in itself was quick, but with no possibility of upgrades given membership status or any acknowledgement of being a member. I did however notice that they added had attached information about an amenity fee to our stay (without informing me during check-in), even though my confirmation states that all taxes and fees were included. This is a dodgy way of doing business which unfortunately has spread like a plague through IHG-properties (but also in general in the US hotel business). \n\nThe rooms were as mentioned quite nice, but on my shower just before check-out I realized that both shower heads a major black areas. I didn't have time to look thoroughly, but suspect they haven't been cleaned properly in a while and either dirt or mold has been able to \"settle\".\n\nAt the day of check-out I again tried to use one of my \"benefits\" and asked for late check out on at least one of the rooms, but where promptly brushed off due to the hotel being fully booked. Now, having extensive hotel background myself, also as a general manager, I know that it's of course not possible to clean all rooms at the same time anyway. This \"policy\" has therefore a tendency of just adding a pile-up of checkouts at the same time, which was just what happened here. Queues in the lobby were constant and the hotel was not properly staffed to manage this, leading to long wait times.  \n\nAll in all I'm very glad I didn't pay full price here. I really looked forward to my stay here, but instead it has made me seriously consider if IHG is the chain I want to stay loyal to, with so many alternatives out there. Many of the staff members I talked to were nice, but there was also too many that reflected what I feel IHG is becoming now, a chain where policies and procedures minimizing hotel effort is more important than the customer.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

It is my favorite type of hotel - old world charm with an outstanding staff who know how to provide intelligent hospitality.  We stayed for three nights and originally were given a classic room with a king-sized bed on a high floor.  The room had a bit of a view, but only a bit.  It was well appointed with a nice dresser (my new pet peeve is the growing trend of hotels not providing any drawers so you can take your clothes out of your suitcase and put them away properly,)  a comfortable bed wjth great bed linens, and a large, well-appointed bathroom.  \n\nWe had a small, but fairly annoying problem with our room.  A couple of times an hour a high-pitched squealing would emanate from the bathroom.  We supposed it was a dried out gasket somewhere.  The hotel initially tried to come up and fix it, but couldn\u2019t.  They offered to switch our room, but I was able to negotiate our way into a one-bedroom suite for an extra $100 per night, which I thought was a suitable and more exciting solution.  The suite was lovely, had great views and was very comfortable for the remaining two nights.  \n\nEvery staff member we dealt with was very friendly, competent and genuine.  The hotel is located on 48th St between Park & Lexington Avenues.  Most things were within a 30 minute walk.  We walked to the west side and two different theaters in about 20 minutes.

Also there were the additional charges on checkout which accumulated to around $40 per day for all types of additional taxes.

Decision to stay here is mainly location-driven because is located 2 mins walk from the NY offices of the company I work for.  Just because of this, it is convenient to me.\n\nHotel is quite good, very nice in fact, nice room, ok size for NY standards, clean, well equipped, very good wifi, great bed allowing very good sleep.  I really have nothing but positives around the room.  Staff is quite attentive and friendly, but hotel is really big, you see lots of people all the time in the lobby, bar, checking in and out, that it feels like a factory.....zero personalised attention.   Even staff in the front door seem to be more concerned about the tips they get from guests and car drivers than to serve the client. However, nothing of this bothered me.\n\nThe one thing I found really excessive was the price of the food, mainly around room service.  If you consider the food, service charge, gratuity and delivery charge, having a salad and one coke in your room can cost you around $80, what is really excessive. I'm not sure which is the strategy here, but they should definitely adjust this, because it doesn't make any sense. You pay fine-dining prices for standard room service.\n\nIn summary good stay, nice hotel, will return on coming business trips later in the year.....but definitely not eat in my room\/order room service.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I\u2019m not sure how this hotel receives more then 3 stars because it\u2019s an old hotel with a musty smell and arrogant managers. The rooms are very small and the bathrooms are tiny. The service is very slow and if you try to call the front desk it\u2019s takes quite a while to get an employee on the phone. \n\nWhen I checked into the hotel, I asked for an upgrade and was told by a manager that it would cost $150.00 per night. It seemed reasonable, but given that we were only staying for two nights I decided against it. When we arrived to our room, it had a very musty smell and lacked some of the basic items such as towels. I went to the front desk and spoke with the same manager and he agreed to find a different room. Several hours later, we switched to a new room, which wreaked of smoke. I immediately went to the front desk spoke with the same manager who insinuated that I was just trying to get an upgrade, and even suggested that I should find a new hotel.

We have visited and stayed at many NYC hotels over the years,  but for this trip it was a special occasion as it was for my daughters 16th birthday as well as my birthday, and we wanted something really special. I chose the Barclay based off of their impressive website and positive reviews. About a week before we arrived, my husband called and requested a room with a nice view, preferably of the Chrysler building. \u201cNo problem\u201d he was told. So to our unhappiness we checked into a room yesterday that looked straight into an office building. After speaking to a manger we were told that they were booked for the night , but would move us today to something f wifh a nicer view. After a long day out, we came back, picked up our new room key and now have a room looking across to other rooms in the hotel. It might actually be a worse view than before! \nThe room itself is very nice and well furnished. Beds are comfortable. As part of the $40 a day facility fee you are given a $25 daily credit to use. So last night we selected two cans of soda from the mini bar for $9 each, PLUS a 20% \u201crestocking fee\u201d. A bit outrageous even for New York. The other thing that I found odd is that I\u2019ve never stayed at a five star hotel before that had  Dove brand soaps and body wash. Not at all what I would expect from a hotel at this level! \nI just was very excited to stay here and feel a little let down. I realize they can\u2019t guarantee a specific view, but considering that we booked a premier room for five nights and made a special request in advance, I had hopes for something much better than what we got. If you want a luxury hotel with a nice room and the view isn\u2019t important, then you should be happy here.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Very clean with good sized bedrooms, walk in shower and large comfortable bed. Unfortunately our room had no view to speak of. \n\nNow for the \u201camenity charge\u201d. This hotel charges an amenity fee of  $35 a night (plus tax) which unless you scan the small print on website could come as a surprise. On checking in we were advised that, as unbelievable as it sounds, this covers WiFi (what 4\/5* hotel charges for WiFi?) and $25 that could be used against cost of breakfast or drinks at the bar. Unfortunately, given the cost of drinks at the bar, this wouldn\u2019t have covered the ice let alone a drink!!! However, if you don\u2019t use it each day you loose it - absolutely disgusting.\n\nUnlike every other hotel of this standard, there was no turndown service, chocolates etc. In fact there wasn\u2019t even a bottle of water provided in the room but then why would the hotel provide water when they can charge guests $12 a bottle??? \n\nIntercontinental management please can you confirm what the amenity fee covers as you have no amenities? After check out we learned that we could have used the $25 this against the mini bar yet no mention of this by the receptionist on check in??? We really feel as though you have treated us as cash cows and interestingly every single person checking out in front of us raised the same concern and queried exactly what they received  in exchange for $40 a day.\n\nWe also feel the need to compliment the hotel on employing the most miserable, unhelpful receptionist we have ever encountered. This was particularly evident on check out when there was no longer any incentive to be pleasant to guests coupled with constant queries regarding the amenity fee.\n\nIn summary, we left extremely disappointed by our experience at this hotel. Needless to say we won\u2019t be back and will be recommending that family and friends avoid this hotel !!\n\nAs an aside, if your looking for excellent quality breakfast\/brunch with amazing customer service check out the brassiere across the road.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was a very bad experience from the very start,  We went with our kids and I called to make sure we would have adjoining rooms.  Of course, when we got to Check-In, there were no adjoining rooms available.  When we asked what the solution was, the front desk guy got agitated and combative.  The manager came out and tried to bribe us with meal tickets.  Frankly, I was embarrassed for her.  She said she would have something for us the next night.  Guess who never bothered to follow up?  We had breakfast in the hotel - powdered eggs - truly inedible.  The server couldnt be bothered to give us water.  We had to get up and get it ourselves.   Literally the worst meal I've ever had in NYC.  Finally, the rooms are tiny.  My wife and had to stand single file in order to be in the bathroom at the same time. \nThere are many other hotels.

My room was not cleaned, there were stains on the floor, bins had dirty liquid residue, table surfaces were not wiped. Floors were not vacuumed. My tea is never replaced and I have to request them on a daily basis. Laundry bags were not replaced and the list goes on.

The cleanliness and housekeeping are just unacceptable. Very poor standard with no consistency. It is definitely something they have to improve on, before they start losing customers.

I basically had to beg for it the day I left.  Shout out to Shauna at the front desk as being the nicest and service forward human being ever.  Before my business trip, I did some research between the 2 Intercontinental Hotel locations in NYC.  I wanted to make sure whatever I picked best suited me as there was a possibility that I would need a month-long stay in the near future.  I was told before my arrival that bonus points would be provided to Intercontinental Ambassadors since restaurants, bars and food and beverage were unavailable (despite the city being fully open during my stay).  I did not receive any upon arrival.  I inquired during checkout and the front desk attendant informed me that guest relations will give me 5,000 for the inconvenience.

I will never go here again.  If the place were under different owners and management maybe there'd be some hope for a RESTORATION rather than these grotesque no-class renovations.  They even showcase the aforementioned in display cases .  They might as well get their food from the trailor park and they're housekeepers from costco's janitorial department except I'd hire the latter over the former.  The staff are also invasive and nosy although they don't let you see it they want to know anything and everthing about you it's creepy.

Check in very straightforward, staff very pleasant. Unfortunately we were given a room with a queen size bed despite requesting a twin room, they did offer to change but for an additional $30 per night per person we declined. They also charge a room tax of $35 per night but this includes $25 of credit from the bar, mini bar etc per night so it only actually works out as $10 room tax if you take advantage of this but when they charge $9 for a small bottle of water it\u2019s not difficult to use the full amount! The room was very clean, a queen size bed, well equipped walk in wardrobe with hangers, an ironing board & iron, fab bathroom, huge shower & TV in the room.  As the room was quite small there was no chairs to sit & relax, the only one was on wheels to use at the desk so if you wanted to sit and read you had to use the bed which although extremely comfortable was very high. Of the 3 hotels we\u2019ve stayed in whilst visiting this is the best for location but 2nd for the actual room but I would definitely stay here again as location is key when doing a short city break.

The hotel is in a great location close to many attractions, yet it's nice and quiet at night. The rooms are wonderfully appointed and comfortable. Sadly, the staff is not as welcoming as the hotel itself.\n\nUpon arrival, I wasn't even greeted with a simple smile, and the front desk staff didn't even acknowledge my elite status or give me the upgrade I was guaranteed when I made the reservation, and no one even offered to help me with my bags. The housekeeping never changed the toiletries nor the towels during my stay, and I doubt they did anything other than making the bed. They are also extremely loud, as I can hear them outside my room. I don't know what's the point of \"Do no Disturb\" as they keep knocking and calling even when the sign is on the door, \n\nOne night at exactly 11:23 pm I called room service with no one answering, and 11:30, exactly when room service closes, a lady from the front desk answered and rudely stated \"the kitchen is closed it's 11:30\" I explained to her that I have been calling since 11:23 and no one answered, yet she again rudely replied, \"the kitchen is closed I cannot take your order.\" I was so surprised that she didn't even apologize or offer an alternative or even a suggestion. During the summer, I stayed at the Intercontinental Amstel in Amsterdam, the staff there ordered me takeout because the dish I wanted was out of stock, and this was at 2:00 am. The staff members there are very different from those at the Barclay, as they go above and beyond what is expected and truly make you feel like a welcomed guest.\n\nThe Barclay used to be excellent when I first started staying there, and the staff was friendly and welcoming. I have kept returning, thinking that these issues are the exception and not the norm; however, I was disappointed. I am surprised that this is the treatment an IHG Royal Ambassador gets, I can't imagine how a first-time guest is treated. \n\nI don't think I will come back to the Barclay. I have given it many chances, and even when they checked-in another guest into my room, and they walked in on me while I was asleep, I simply laughed it off with the other guest. I have voiced my concerns about these issues to the hotel management before, but I see little has changed, and sadly things are becoming worse. The building is beautiful, the atmosphere in the lobby is quite lovely and the rooms are cozy.

We were greeted, welcomed and checked in within minutes and the person behind the counter was an absolute pleasure to deal with. They even upgraded us to larger suite, something we were truly grateful for.\n\nThe Room\nUpon entering the room, we were met with what I can only describe as pure immaculate opulence. The room was perfect. Two massive beds with crisp white sheets, large desk, television (which we never watched), huge bathroom and, of course, a coffee machine! We were excited about what our stay here was going to be like, let alone our time in NYC.\n\nDuring Our Stay\nWe ate at the hotel restaurant on the first night. Food was delicious. I had my very first NY Pretzel! Cocktails were also fantastic! Throughout our stay, our room came to be our refuge from the busyness that is New York. We were out every single day and night, exploring everything New York had to offer, and coming back to a clean room with our beds made really helped bring a sense of calm and normalcy. The service during our stay was absolutely perfect.\n\nDeparture\nAfter what we would consider a \"long stay\" in NYC, we were excited to be finally going home. Bags packed, elevator down and straight to reception, we were greeted once again. Within 60 secs we were checked out, thanked and a cab organised for our journey to the airport. Truly exceptional service!\n\nLast Words\nI think I've said it all. In all, we experienced outstanding and super-friendly customer service that really helped make a difference. Smiles and greets whenever we arrived back after a long day exploring and an immaculate room whenever we entered.

We chose a room with 2 double beds. The room had all expected amenities but felt a bit cramped with 2 double beds. Housekeeping and cleaning were excellent although our hotel towelling bathrobes disappeared a few days into the stay and weren't replaced (not enough of a problem for us to mention it during the stay).\n\nThe location is excellent if you want to do the tourist \"must sees\"; most are in walking distance. There are very good coffee shops and restaurants nearby.\n\nThe staff were all pleasant and helpful.\n\nThe \"destination fee\" is a problem. We'd read about it in reviews and asked for it to be explained when we checked in sometime around 9.00pm It was explained but we were too tired after a long flight from London, and still on UK time, to take it in properly. It's a compulsory daily fee ($35 by the end of our stay), per room, that entitles you to various \"credits\" against expenditure in the hotel (eg $25 off 'food and beverages'). If you don't spend up to the fee amount, it can't be carried over to the next day so you spend it in the hotel or lose it. It's a ploy\/incentive to get you to spend money in the hotel and it also seems to be a ploy that hotels use to make their room rates on hotel booking sites look lower than they actually are. This hotel doesn't have a traditional restaurant and coffee shop (it serves breakfast and bar snacks) so it has fewer amenities on which to spend your money\n\nWe were able to argue that we checked in too late to have a reasonable chance of spending up to the fee on the first day, so we were  given a credit. Also, when we checked out, the bill didn't show how the credits were applied each day so it was hard to check it. The bill did show that the fee had increased from $30 - $35 for the last couple of days. We weren't notified about this in advance so the hotel agreed to refund the increase.\n\nThe Barclay does most of what you expect from a decent 4 star hotel. But a good hotel should let you choose whether you want to spend your money in it without using tricks like this to get into your wallet. It felt sad to end a holiday there feeling that we had to check our bill thoroughly because we didn't trust the place to be straight.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

As an Intercontinental ambassador\/spire elite, I have access to a more private check-in area.  I would not describe the agent rude, but she was not kind.  She was robotic and even borderline rude at times.  I was not a demanding guest, other than asking for a higher floor, which she was not able to secure.  However, I was checking in at noon, so I did not expect better option.  I booked a Barclay room, which was apparently the highest level of guest room, and since the hotel only has 23 suites, she could not upgrade me to a suite.  I did not ask for any upgrade but somehow she was in this defensive mode.  She offered me either 10,000 points or $50 credit for the inability to upgrade.  The whole check in experience basically ruined my impression.  I used to live in NYC and knew that type of NYC attitude but I am in a 6 stars hotel, so just pretend that you care.  Thankfully I got a different agent for check out.  Honestly the only truly extraordinary staff that I came across was the bell captain, Richie\/Richard.  He was kind and helpful.  He seems to be the only one, who knows what service is.  \n\nSince Barclay Room is the highest level of regular guest room, I am just underwhelmed.  It is a nice room but if this is a high level room, I expect more space and at least enough space to put in a sofa.  Anyhow, the bed is comfortable and I appreciate the tiny touches like heated bathroom floor.  However, I am surprised they don't have bedside wireless charging pad, as well as more power outlets.  WIFI, to my pleasant surprise, is truly premium.  \n\nJust a funny side note, I got a $20 food & beverage credit as an ambassador club member.  I got get anything I like including the mini bar.  The prices are just IMHO ridiculous.  I don't know how they can justify charging $9 for a can of 330ml coke, or $10 for a small bottle of Tropicana Orange Juice.  I expect high price, but this kind of prices is just ridiculous.  I recommend folks just use it at the bar, and you can easily get these soft drinks and bottled waters at two nearby 24 hours CVS\/Walgreens.  \n\nHonestly I am let down with this experience and seriously doubt that I will return to this hotel again.

When the Barclay closed for 2 years for renovations and remodeling we went elsewhere. This was our first return. My daughter and son  were extremely impressed with the renovation as were we. THE STAFF from front desk to room service and housekeeping are some of the best in NYC.  6 nights in NYC,for the Christmas holiday, were wonderful because of the BARCLAY.

On arrival, the member of staff on reception explained that as our destination fee had been included in our package deal, we didn't have to worry about paying it. The destination fee, I believe, is around $30 per day, but you get a $25 credit each day that must be spent by midnight. This credit can be used in the Gin Parlour and will not accumulate if left unspent on any day. You will also be required to provide a credit or debit card as a $500 security deposit: this will show as pending on your account but no money will actually be taken unless you use the mini bar, for example.\nThe rooms themselves are very clean and as beautiful as the reception area and Gin Parlour. The maids clean the rooms and replace the towels every day, without fail. All of the staff seemed to be very friendly and always smiled.

This has to be the most over-rated, unimpressive hotel in IHG. I am an Ambassador member and I booked this hotel because of this program. The benefits were minimal, at best.\n\nI am really big on first impressions. When we arrived, the doorman was friendly and took care of our car, I was very happy. Then we went to the Ambassador check-in area. We were 3rd in line. We were supposedly upgraded to a nicer room. I'll cover that later. So in this hotel, you need a room key, to go up the elevator. Neither of our keys worked. Went back to Ambassador check-in, and there was no line, so we received quick replacement keys. Go up the elevator and the new keys will not open the door. So my partner waits at the room's door and I go back down to Ambassador check-in. There was person with the agent. She said to wait. WAIT!!! This is the second set of keys that don't work! She called out a manager, who made new keys, and then accompanied me to the room. These keys worked. Electronic keys were not invented yesterday. TOTAL FAIL for this hotel! We had dinner reservations, show tickets, and had been on the road for 8 hours. Making people wait for keys, multiple times is just plain wrong!\n\nThe room was very nice. Very clean. The bed was comfortable. We did not have the neighbor noise problem as others describe. Matter of fact, I found the room to be quieter than I expected. This is New York City. But, I do not understand how this room was an upgrade since it was just the standard room. \n\nWe had drinks at the lobby bar, Gin Parlour. Our drinks were very good, but expensive. Expect to pay about $20 per drink with no tip. On our 2nd morning, we had the buffet breakfast. This is served behind the bar in the lobby. Seating is limited. Cost of breakfast was $42. The food tasted good with decent variety. But overall, the quality wasn't 5 star hotel level. I generally found the dining and bar staff capable.\n\nOur departure was another mess. The bill didn't include everything, like our parking, even though the car was parked 2 days earlier. The hotel also doesn't have change of US money. The excuse of a holiday weekend was just another excuse for poor service. Although the door man was the same friendly guy that we had at check-in. Maybe management should have him training the rest of the staff?\n\nAll in all, an average stay at a supposedly 5 star hotel. That is the issue. This isn't a 5 star property, not even close.

I have platinum status with 2 major global airlines, and silver with a 3rd. I spend 50+ nights a year staying in hotels and I\u2019ve stayed at this hotel a few times.

This is currently $30 (plus tax) which is applied to your bill daily to make your stay more enjoyable....Eg. it allows you to enter the restaurant free of charge - why is a hotel even charging guests a restaurant entry fee? When people can walk in off the street and use the restaurant for free. There isn\u2019t any guidelines on what destination fees cover. It\u2019s just an amount the hotel can add to your daily rate. \n\nThe \u201cdestination fee\u201d is a hidden charge allowing the hotel to offer a lower daily rate when it\u2019s really $30 per night higher. You will not see the destination fee as a line item. It\u2019s hidden in \u201ctaxes and service charges\u201d. The destination fee is also increasing. The Hotel\u2019s General Managers decides what \u201cdestination fee\u201d is applied. It\u2019s not applied to corporate rates. \n\nWhen booking a hotel in NYC you might want to consider a boutique hotel that is more honest and transparent in the actual daily room rate.

Alfie set the bar so high that I\u2019m not sure any hotel will ever beat it. Keeping in mind that we had a large suite she was always able to clean the room and turndown down both bedrooms without being seen. I\u2019m not sure exactly how she managed this but it was like magic. We could leave the room for 20 minutes or 4 hours and it didn\u2019t matter. The room was cleaned and turned down each and every time we left in the evening. On out final night we had the chance to speak with Alfie. She is a true asset to your hotel and she alone would have been enough to ensure future visits.\n\nFinally the concierge, Norman. This was a very special trip for my mother and I. I phoned the hotel to ask if they could do anything to make the room feel a bit like home. When we first entered the room we noticed that it was full of framed family photos going back 4 generations.\n\nIt\u2019s details like this that truly set the bar and set hotels like the Barclay apart. When you find yourself in New York I can\u2019t recommend this hotel enough. It\u2019s a gem in a sea of Urban hustle.\n\nTrust me\ud83d\udcaf\ud83e\udd76\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The facilities in the room are not really up to snuff for the price and also given facilities at competitors just across or down the road.  For example, power outlets, for a hotel in that price bracket you'd nowadays expect the ubiquitous bank of sockets for US, European or UK devices that's become pretty standard, instead you're let scrabbling about on the carpet for somewhere to plug your laptop in (until you spot the ones hidden on the alarm clock - the obvious place for power outlets). If you drink tea, you're out of luck, you've got a choice of coffee or some dubious green-ish tea in the room. The turndown service is somewhat random - we were there six nights - one night we even got a chocolate on the pillow. \nSecondly, the IHG Ambassador status, which IHG seem to push quite heavily is a total con.  The words \"guaranteed upgrade\" are used on the website - LOL, and little things like complimentary mineral water are also promised, but when you enquire about these, and why they're conspicuous by their absence, you'll likely be met with a surly receptionist who will look at you like you've just asked for a return ticket to the moon.  \nAlso, if you're thinking of eating at the restaurant or having breakfast here, you might want to consider selling an organ first, it's overpriced, even for nyc.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

However, lately it's been very difficult for me to consider booking our stay some place other than the InterContinental New York Barclay.  \n\nFor me, it has a terrific confluence of elements to make me happy about a hotel.  It's a beautiful balance of old and new -- although it opened in 1926, it's been lovingly renovated so that it has an old New York elegance but still provides 21st century comfort, like the HVAC and plumbing, for example.   Elevators are efficient.  The new furniture is \"real\" -- sometimes you show up at a hotel that looks great online but then realize upon arrival that the furniture is only a bit better than if it were on a theatrical set.  Here the furniture is quality.\n\nThe staff are pretty much universally service-oriented.  The only place where I sometimes experience less-than-attentive service is in the Gin Parlour.  Otherwise the staff are friendly, helpful and professional.  Lately we have been booking rooms that include access to the Club Intercontinental lounge.  It's located just behind the Gin Parlour and it's a fantastic \"add\" to our stay --- there are snacks and beverages, a breakfast buffet, and afternoon hors d'oeuvres.  I love that there is nitro cold-brew on tap and bottles of French sparkling water.  It's a comfy place to hang out, too, with lots of tables and chairs, it's own restroom, and a conference room you can book if you need one.  My only wish is that they were open later in the evening as I'd love to be able to hang out here with a cup of something after dinner but, alas, they usually close at 8 p.m.\n\nMy hubby is an InterContinental Ambassador which gives us a few extra positives including a 4 p.m. check-out, a little upgrade to the room, and a special check-in desk in the concierge area.  When we walk in the front door and get a whiff of whatever scent they pump into the lobby, I immediately feel happy and relaxed strolling to the check-in desk because I know that I'll soon feel like I'm back in my NYC \"home.\"","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Have always been a fan of InterCon hotels in my travels - Singapore to Sydney, Lisbon to London. Definitely not the same experience here that you get overseas. Customer service is underwhelming, especially in the Club Lounge, the restaurant, and check-out.  Prepare to be ignored by the wait staff in the restaurant while waiting for coffee or the bill. Preferred to seat guests all squashed into the same corner of the restaurant instead of spreading us out for comfort and privacy. Manager and host of restaurant didn't care when I walked up and asked for things because waiter could not be found. Take away coffee was $4.50 - you can get it for free at a Courtyard Marriott! Ambassador Check-out preferred to do paperwork instead of helping the growing queue of guests. Couldn't even be bothered to ask me how my stay was. Had reserved a small conference room to work out of - but it was actually a small dining space in the Lounge, not a true work conference room (Note: this hotel isn't really for the business traveler - no desks in the room, no business offices or conference rooms, awkward power outlet locations, etc) Was constantly interrupted by kitchen and wait staff as they tried to access their supply closet which bizarrely was in the room I reserved for quiet and pricacy. Even though I contacted the hotel ahead of time, they forgot to reserve that room. Rooms themselves were so noisy - no soundproofing so heard children running and screaming, neighbor guests slamming doors and talking loudly on the phone, cleaning staff knocking on doors, etc. Inconsistent room cleaning and turn-down service. I fee like the staff needs to visit their overseas properties, particularly in Asia, to see how it should really be done and meet InterCon standards as the \"luxury\" brand of IHG.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":93462,"title":"Very disappointing stay. Would not recommend.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-10-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I booked a 3 night stay through British Airways. I booked a package flight & hotel. I wanted to stay in a 5 star hotel mid town that would be family friendly & could accommodate 3 people (2 adults & 1 teenager)\nAfter a delayed flight (American Airlines) we arrived at the Intercontinental Barclay. Disappointed that there was no one at the door to help us with our bags. We entered the hotel and my first impressions were not great. The hotel feels very corporate and dated considering it was supposed to have had a recent refurbishment.\nThe receptionist was very friendly. It was a tall guy I can\u2019t remember his name. I asked him if I was eligible for a room upgrade as I was told by American Express that this was something I would be able to request if available. The receptionist offered a room upgrade with no hesitation which I was thrilled about. We made our way to the room and we were shocked that the hotel had a stale smell especially in the room. When we got to the room it wasn\u2019t an upgrade at all it was exactly the room I had already booked, which I thought strange. We soon realised that there were only 2 beds in this room despite paying for 3 flights & 3 beds through BA. My mum & nephew laid next to each other on the bed and there was no room either side. I called reception straight away to ask if there was a pull out bed? I was told that we would need to move to another room with a king bed and a pull out sofa. We were asked to come back down to reception to be shown to another room (10 floors) at this point we had been travelling for 12 hours and we were very tired. When we arrived at reception nobody knew what I was there for whoever I had spoken to was no longer at the desk I asked for a manager and explained that I had paid for 3 people but the beds were only big enough for 2 and that the room was too small. The manager was very unhelpful she told me that there was a room available that could accommodate 3 people it had a king bed and a pull out bed but I would have to pay an extra $50 per night in addition to the fee I had already pre paid. \nI repeatedly said that I had already paid for 3 people and that we should be able to sleep comfortably during our stay. Sadly she didn\u2019t agree and told me that no hotel in New York would have 2 large beds big enough to sleep 2 people? I understood that there might not be 2 king size in the room but we needed a double and a single. That room was available but she was not prepared to move us without a charge. I was told that to have enough room to sleep 3 people it would be an additional charge as they were providing an extra service. I would completely agree if I had booked and paid for 2 people but I had booked for 3 people. I was told to contact British Airways. However at this point it was 10pm in the uk and the phone line was closed. After a very uncomfortable and embarrassing conversation we left the reception area and returned to our room. The room was very dark. It had a musty smell. Which I also mentioned at reception and nothing was said about that.\nWe left the hotel for dinner and returned at approx 10pm for a reasonably early night as we had left our house at 4.30am almost 22 hours earlier. We got into bed exhausted from travelling to be woken up by loud knocking at the door (2am uk time) we called out to see who it was and it was someone asking if they could check the room as I had complained about the smell. This was 6 hours earlier by the way. It was as though they had waited for us to go to sleep to wake us. I thought it was very strange to wake us up to ask about the room now. We told them we were sleeping and they left.\nWe woke up in the morning. We had no tea. I called downstairs to order 3 pots of tea from room service. When it came we were handed \u20182\u2019 paper cups and 2 sachets of tea to use in the coffee machine. Rather than the tea I had ordered. We opened the mini bar to find 2 half drunk bottles of water in the fridge that must have been left by the previous guest. \nWe quickly realised that having breakfast here was not a good idea and we left for the day. When we returned we had a message on the room answerphone offering to move us to a room suitable for 3. (24 hours after our initial request)  My mum was so embarrassed by the managers response when we told them we were not happy with the room that she said she would prefer to stay in the room to avoid any further conflict and hassle. And she just wanted to enjoy our short break rather than repacking and moving rooms at this stage. We were in a rush to get out to a show and we didn\u2019t have time to move rooms. I feel that I made them aware of the situation as soon as we arrived and despite there being rooms available they were not prepared to offer us a different room they were more concerned about their $50 dollars per night rather than our comfort. Despite the fact I had already paid $3463.00 for our 3 nights in the hotel and flight! This service I would expect from a basic 3 star hotel not a 5 star hotel. I will also be mentioning this to   Airways and I think they need to update their description and grading for this hotel as it was not as advertised. \nWe were also told at check in that there would be an additional $35 per night room tax added at  checkout. Which apparently is normal for New York. \nWe spent very little time in the hotel. My mum would not have breakfast or drinks at the bar as she felt so embarrassed that we had to argue about our room. \nAfter 3 crowded nights we checked out. The manager was present and despite our complaint and the \u2018message\u2019 that was left by another manager offering to move us, she didn\u2019t even ask how our stay was or offer any kind of apology. I\u2019ve never experienced such poor customer service.\nWe wanted to leave our bags at the hotel as we were leaving at 7pm. The man who took the bags from us was very grumpy and it was clearly an inconvenience to him. However on a positive note the man who retrieved them for us when we returned couldn\u2019t have been nicer and the door staff went out of their way to find a taxi to the airport for us. I would also like to add that the 2 Male concierge staff were very helpful. The female guest relations was not and tried to send me to the 3rd floor business centre to print my boarding pass. The concierge (in the same room) did it without any    hesitation. I think the management and guest relations assistant need further training on customer care. I would not recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Air conditioning is not that easy to get to desired temperature (if it's too cold and you want to increase temperature, systems keep sending cold air - so you have to turn it off). But there were enough negative points on a one-night stay that make the experience not worth it: \n- Destination Fee \"until midnight\": you pay $30\/day of \"destination fee\" (this annoying trend on NY hotels) but it seems you get something in exchange - for example a $25 food\/beverage credit per day. The small print says \"it must be used by midnight\". And for them, midnight means midnight of your checkin day. So if you want to use the credit for breakfast... forget about it. Why do this? The rate of a hotel is always from 3pm or so until 11am or noon. Why create a destination fee whose benefit does not match this usual period of a hotel room? This seems one of those things created to mislead guests. During checkout I complained about that at the same time that another guest by my side was complaining. They ended up giving the $25 credit. But the whole experience is annoying. Why can't they just follow the same standard for both the per night rate and destination fee? Why try to confuse guests? \n\n- I left an article in the (very small) \"personal space\" in the fridge (the rest of the fridge has articles that, if moved, are immediately charged to your room). In the next morning... the fridge was locked. We called reception, they tried to unlock it remotely, it didn't work. We had to wait 30min or so for someone to come and unlock the fridge (and that delayed our checkout). The person was very nice, apologized, but... our departure was delayed in 30min. \n\n- I forgot a charger in the room. Called the hotel to ask about it, left a message. They called me back saying they didn't find it. I know those things may happen, maybe the next guest in the room took the charger, it's hard to say. But it's the first time that I forget something in a hotel room and they are not able to find it. \n\nLet's say I had better experiences overall in other hotels in NY.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The lady at the Reception desk sent us around the corner to the Ambassador desk.  No one was there, but there was a sign on the desk stating that someone was away and would return \u201csoon\u201d.  After more than15 minutes, still no one so another staff member directed us back to Reception desk.  She said our room was clean but had to be inspected first so we were taken to the Club Lounge to wait.  I thought it would be a quick wait. It was over an hour as we sat with our luggage in the Club Lounge.  Finally, after I made a small scene and stated the obvious, a room was available about 5 minutes later. The Ambassador person brought over the keys and acted as if everything was normal.  It wasn\u2019t the same room since it was on the 12th floor whereas the one that had to be inspected was on the 9th.   I am a Spire Ambassador with IHG.  As a Spire, check-in is as early as 10 am if a room is ready.  I was understanding that one wasn\u2019t ready by noon, but after such a long wait, I found that someone dropped the ball so to speak!  After we got our room, most everything else went well for the following 2 days!\nOur room was basically a standard room with Club Access, which I booked.  We may have received a one level upgrade from Superior to Deluxe, but this is the norm at most Intercontinentals with Lounges.   The rooms are most always very clean, well maintained, and have top quality furnishings and decorations.  Our view of an office building was not that great and required us to close the curtains at all times. We avoided the mini bar since it was probably motion-activated.  Given the prices of the drinks in the main bar, those in the mini bar were probably even higher!  We had a good king-sized bed, but to be honest, the one we had an IHG Express location near LaGuardia the night before was more comfortable (it was one of the best beds ever).  The one at the Barclay was not as firm nor were the pillows, and the duvet wasn\u2019t as silky soft; however, I slept better at the Barclay since there wasn\u2019t a noise issue, but my back was sore after 2 nights for my flight home.  This was the first time, I believe, that I\u2019ve had a room at an Intercontinental without a tub.  There was a nice shower with a regular shower head plus a handheld device for easier rinsing.  The amenities (Agraria) provided were what used to be the standard ones at all Intercontinentals, but recently, I\u2019ve noticed specialty brands at many such as in Paris, London, and Bucharest.  There was a closet with a safe although we really didn\u2019t have too much to secure.  The TV was good and received enough channels to entertain when in the room, but we spent most of our awake time either in the city (eating out, walking, one matin\u00e9e, etc.) or in the Club Lounge.  The Club Lounge is open from 6;30 am until 8 pm.  Again, for those Intercontinentals with lounges, I\u2019ve never known one to close before 10 pm, but I understood because there was never a crowd in the lounge so there was no demand.  Unlike in Europe, we weren\u2019t given an option to have breakfast in the main restaurant (unless, of course, we paid full price) so we ate in the Club each morning.  They had scrambled eggs plus either scrambled egg whites or egg white squares, plus meats, both turkey and pork, plus some pastry but not a lot, breads, juices, fruits, yogurts, and more.  I was disappointed that there was no omelet station since we were there over the weekend, and both American Intercontinental lounges that I\u2019ve visited (Atlanta and Boston) have omelet stations on Saturday and Sunday.  I was still able to have a decent breakfast so not a huge issue.  In the evening from 5pm until 8 pm, they have beer, wine, and Prosecco.  I shouldn\u2019t write this, but I think the Prosecco in the lounge (and maybe at the bar where it\u2019s not cheap) is the same kind I get at my local German-based Aldi discount grocery store for under $10 a bottle!  We were able to partake of a few afternoon refreshments the first day but were out at the matin\u00e9e on the second day and had to leave before that time on the last day.  They were ok with fancy teatime sandwiches and flavored breads such as banana nut, but we wanted a hardier lunch so we ate at a Chinese restaurant nearby after leaving our bags in the room.  On Friday evening, it was Sushi night in the lounge with many, many variations and varieties on the back table.  The front table had cheeses and sliced meats as well plus egg rolls and other bite size munchies.  Saturday evening didn\u2019t have anything special and just included the table with hors d\u2019oeuvres.  I never saw any chocolate-type pastries in the afternoon or evening, but there were some eclairs on Sunday morning.  Overall, we were happy with the lounge but would have enjoyed a later closing, more pastries, and an omelet station.\nCheck-out time is normally at 11 am, but as an Ambassador, I am supposed to receive one as late as 4 pm.  I requested a noon check out since our shuttle pick-up was scheduled for just after 12:15 pm but was told there would be no late check-outs for anyone since the UN General Assembly was starting on Monday with many people arriving on Sunday and even before.  I was given many points (or a choice of a restaurant\/bar credit) because of such and understood so no problem this time.  We officially checked out in the Club Lounge about 10:40 and were allowed to wait there until our shuttle pick-up.  I received an email a few days before my arrival informing me of the UN issues and the probable extra security, but we were lucky since the street didn\u2019t close until Sunday night and we faced no extra security in the lobby.  I think this may have been part of the check-in issue since everyone seemed to be \u201cwalking on pins and needles\u201d to use an old clich\u00e9.  It will probably be better if we return on a less hectic weekend!\nI do want to mention one employee who went above and beyond.  Paulette was there from early Friday afternoon when we returned from lunch until closing and was there for all 13.5 hours on Saturday although we didn\u2019t go to breakfast until after 8.  She was the best.  She listened to my travel stories, changed the TV to college football on Saturday afternoon, and just was welcoming and professional.  Nothing was too much for her as she asked often if we needed anything.  As I said earlier, we had the lounge mostly to ourselves plus maybe a half dozen others at times.  I don\u2019t understand why more people don\u2019t use the lounge, especially when\/if they have access?  When I booked this reservation with my weekend Ambassador certificate, I lucked out because I noticed how difficult it is to find a weekend here that is available for such.   Not too long after I booked, it appeared that there were no more weekend certificate slots available the rest of 2019!  I hope to be back here on a future visit to New York and expect a smoother check-in and please no UN meetings!","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The front desk agent who checked me in was barely smiling nor engaging or friendly, rather just sort of there. The Bartender as well was similarly unengaging and had his back turned to us for an extended period of time when we were trying to pay...this is New York people got places to go! Look at us at least for crissakes! Then, one of us came in late and there was no overnight bellman outside to assist them which I thought must've just been short staffing which I could even understand in these economic times. However, a couple of other things also irked me about this property and compounded the situation and compelled me to leave this lousy review. The minibar- no prices and just a note saying that if you move anything for 60 seconds you will be charged. Wait...what?! How do you know if I remove something for 60 seconds?! I was looking through the minibar before I got to the note to look for prices(which aren't there!!) And now I just got this creepy \"somebody is watching me\" feeling which is the LAST thing you want to feel in a hotel room! Whoever wrote that should be fired honestly. As if all that wasn't enough, as I mentioned earlier one of us got in late so we were all up late and we needed to sleep straight through, but housekeeping came knocking on our door at 9am waking me out of my sleep and utterly ruining my day for me as I could not fall back asleep afterwards. I am sorry but that's just too early for housekeeping. When I informed the Front Office Manager I was told that the UN was coming in and they need my rooms and was given a measly 30 minutes compensation. I honestly don't care what your bookings are like for the next day, I don't care if the Queen of England is coming, it does not entitle you to ruin my stay. Thankfully, I will never stay here again as this place is rife with weird hidden fees and general ineptness. This city has so many options why bother?","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

When my family arrived they found an equally unwelcoming reception staff. They were only 40 minutes off check in time. I asked if, given my mothers age and the distance they had flown, they could find a room so they could check in straight away. That was not possible apparently. \n\nThey later checked in and found their room to have a flooded toilet. They asked to move rooms but were told the hotel was fully booked so they had to wait for maintenance to come up and mend the toilet and for someone to come and mop the floor. They also had no robes and no hangers so those also had to be requested. They then took a shower and the seal on the shower was missing so the floor flooded again.

I hurried down to the lobby lounge to make a $25+ purchase, in this case an overpriced $28 gin martini. Bartender explained that he had to place the order before midnight for the credit to post. Seems bogus that the credit may not be used toward breakfast the next day. Lesson learned. \n\nAt checkout I found out that in fact the destination fee does not apply to award stays. If I had known that I wouldn\u2019t have purchased the martini. \n\nI was also denied my IHG Platinum benefit of 2 PM checkout. \n\nIf subway proximity matters then skip this property. Fairly long walk from Grand Central and winding down to the subway lines in that place takes time. ","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

The flight attendant gave me a dirty look, so I didn't take it, but when I landed back at SFO there was a message waiting from Chou. She informed me that she had found my stylus and left instructions about how to contact her manager, Ruchi, to arrange for it to be returned.\n\n I called that Moday and learned that Ruchi would be out until Wednesday.

This one has been wonderfully restored with rooms that are reasonably sized by NYC standards.  There are a number of nice little touches (unusually comfortable chairs to sit in), great bedding, and the overall ambiance when you walk in is elegant.  Yes, the prices of everything are expensive, but one comes to expect that in this city.  What one does not expect is bad customer service.  This trip was a special one for the two of us, so I called ahead the day before to make sure that our type of requested room was available, and would be ready on time (we actually had requested an early check-in).  I got the brush-off over the phone.  When we arrived at the front desk, we did have a room set aside for us, but rather than check us in early, we were told check-in for our room would be well after the official 3:00 check-in time.  Tony at the front desk did offer an immediately available room on a less desirable floor (we like high up floors), and we were willing to take it so long as we were located away from the elevator (a key request for us).  He told us the room was indeed away from the elevator.  Shockingly, when we arrived at the room, it was right next to the elevator.  When I went down to express disbelief, I was told a) he did not say it was away from the elevator (gee - could two people mis-hear him?) and b) what he did say was that he did not know where on the floor the room was located.  That was the topper - what front desk person does not know where rooms on the floors are located???  Lying to customers is just unacceptable.   We live in a world in which customer service is paramount.  This fell far short.  No restoration can overcome this kind of treatment.  ","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My wife and I love to stay at the Fairmont Gold level for this exact reason. To have a full hot breakfast, snacks in the afternoon and tasty appetizers in the evening is an absolute luxury that I am having trouble doing without. It truly takes much off of your mind in terms of food and beverage. The Fairmont always meets our needs however Pauline and Silvia at the Barclay with the excellent food selection have surpassed my expectations. The food is plentiful, different selection every day, full beverage service including alcohol choices, fantastic. This lounge service adds a full star to this hotel's review. The hotel itself is quite nice, on par with a Fairmont, the staff are very friendly and helpful. There are a couple of down aspects though: $30 per day \"resort fee\" and very high room service fees. The resort fee is presented as a mandatory fee but you can \"spend\" $25 of that in house on anything you wish. This is a terrible way of making sure each guest spends more in the hotel per night. We found ourselves trying to find something to spend our $25 on and ended up spending even more because there were two of us. The second aspect, delivery fees, we ordered room service on the first night and one salad and one order of fries ended up being over $50, ridiculous! We quickly learned that room service was definitely a bad idea. The best way is to go down to the lobby restaurant and eat there since there are no additional fees. Watch out for the automatic gratuity of 15%, this is added to everything. Twice I almost added a tip when it was already there. Once you figure this out you can somewhat mitigate the added expense. That all being said, my wife and I would stay here again based mostly on our lounge experience.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel itself is old, which is fine, but it is woefully inadequate as a luxury hotel. The only place to eat is the lobby bar (the Gin Parlour), there is no real restaurant at the hotel. The Exec Lounge is a dark and windowless space squeezed in behind the bar - when the bar has live music you can clearly hear it in the lounge which is playing its own music leading to a cacophony of noise rather than an oasis of calm!  Food and drink offerings in the Exec Lounge are adequate but not special - alcoholic drink selection in the evening is very limited. Our room (1541) was an Exec King - apparently the best grade of room short of a suite. there is very little \"Exec\" about the room. It is dark, has mismatched furniture, smells vaguely of damp (due to the aircon I think) and the bathroom has a shower only. We asked to be moved to a room with a bath and a shower and were told that the only rooms in the hotel with baths are twin rooms. So you can have a king bed or a bath, but not both - go figure! The attitude of the Ambassador Guest Relations attendant was offhand and had no interest in addressing any of our concerns, the concierge gave us a local map from the Doubletree hotel, which had all the Hilton hotels in the city marked, but not the one we were staying at and in fact the only member of staff who treated us as valued guests was our housekeeper Katrina who was absolutely lovely, kind, efficient and very welcoming.Would we recommend this hotel?- not a chance!","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"NONE"}

It soured the happy memories we wished to have from our vacation. One aspect that upset us was the Hotel\u2019s focus on how they could take as much money from guests as they could. We know, from our stays in London, how city hotels can be expensive, but the Intercontinental Barclay take the biscuit. Their \u2018Resort Fee\u2019, charged on arrival, is in our opinion one of those examples. The fee is $34 (incl tax) per day per room and as we had two twin rooms for 6 nights meant our check in surprise was over $400. We were clearly informed that if the daily allowance was not used it was forfeited to the hotel. The fee, we were told, included a Laundry allowance and a food and beverages allowance, telephone calls and free Wi-fi (even though the hotel Wi-fi was free). Laundry was to be handed in before 10am and would be returned by 6pm the following day (2 days!) with the allowance just enough to clean one blouse or two pairs of socks. Worse was the daily food and beverage allowance which was just enough to buy one glass of wine once tax and 15% service charge was added on. The extortionate charges continued with the mini-bar but to rub salt into the wound they added 20% on to the price of anything taken as an \u2018administration charge\u2019. An example would be a small pack of Pringles was $11 plus 20% (around \u00a311). Beware, anything moved\/taken from the mini-bar to look at and not returned within one minute is automatically charged to your room, as we found out.\nAnother aspect is the attitude of the staff. I\u2019d describe it as \u2018functional\u2019 for the most part. There were just a few individuals who were friendly\/human, but the vast majority made us feel invisible or unwelcome. One or two were just plain rude. It is as though the management have little control over them, they run the show.\nI could go on about the bedrooms\/bathrooms but would just point the management towards Premier Inns (yes, Premier inns!) when it comes to user friendly practical layout.\nGood aspects of the hotel, location.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms are exceptionally clean and we generally enjoy our stay. A few issues...this last visit we had some very strange pilllows which were quite frankly horrible - a bit like sleeping with your head on an inflatable (we like down and feather pillows). Absolutely hated them and couldn\u2019t sleep properly and ended up waking up with a stiff neck and for that reason we are trying another hotel next time we come to New York. The other thing is the lobby area is kept very cold by the AC. This may not seem a huge deal except the only restaurant is located to the rear of lobby so one has to have breakfast in an unpleasantly cold area so you have to wrap up to eat even if it\u2019s really warm outside. This wasn\u2019t just me. I heard several people discussing it. In fact I saw a family of Aussies sitting with their coats on. You would think the sight of them would have prompted staff to adjust the AC but no! In addition the waiting staff are sometimes rather slow and aloof. On one occasion my husband and I went down for breakfast and were asked if we wanted to share a table with other people. I couldn\u2019t believe that as there were several empty tables available. We declined as we enjoy each other\u2019s company and call me antisocial but we don\u2019t particularly want to eat breakfast with some complete strangers. My only other issue is there Is no real room in the bathroom to put one\u2019s toiletries. They could do with installing a couple of shelves. It\u2019s fine for a business traveller who stays overnight but for a couple who are staying three or four nights there just isn\u2019t enough room and for a suite you expect more room. Generally (apart from the cold lobby) the hotel has a lovely ambience, and I loved the paper mache \u2018bust\u2019 in the room.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I think it is unfortunate that the best part of the hotel is the Club Lounge. The staff in the club lounge are polite and nice. Paulette was lovely and extremely helpful. The food choices are good and it serves different snack options throughout the day until 8pm. \nBut the rest of the hotel does not match. On arrival at reception after a long day of travelling I was informed abruptly that there were no twin rooms left after requesting this in January.  So ok I was told they have a suite which I could have for an extra $100 a night. That was a swift NO. He went off again and said we can have a Kingsize bed to share. NO we said in unison as I was staying with my teenage son. The reception chap then said we can have a roll out bed for $50 a night. I said I am not paying extra. So he looks at me as if he is doing me a big favour and says oh you know what I will just give this to you. Wow thanks we got a roll out bed for free. We then had to discuss the fact I had booked a club room with club lounge access which is clearly stated on my paperwork.  He proceeds to blame British Airways and said no I do not. But they do a $25 a day voucher towards food and drink each day. He said the roll out bed will be there in 20 minutes. It took over 2 hours to arrive in the room. I spent \u00a360 phoning British Airways and a nice chap called James called the hotel and sorted out the club lounge access which I had already paid for when i booked the hotel. The attitude at reception has completely put me off this hotel. There was no understanding that people have been travelling all day and just want to get into their nice room. I felt everything was a fight and it should not be like that. I am used to travelling and have stayed in hotels across America and this should have been a really nice stay but we were badly let down in the first few minutes of arriving.  \nI also found bar staff a bit rude and unfriendly.  \nGreat location \nGood club lounge. \nWon't be back.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We are both Platinum Intercontinental Ambassador members.  The Ambassador greeting and check-in was wonderful and when they learned it was my birthday, they sent a bottle of Prosecco and strawberries dipped in chocolate to our room as a surprise. The concierge was outstanding, and made a great recommendation to a Jazz club.\n\nOn our last night, we went to the bar at 11:00 for a night cap. I ordered a very nice scotch but unfortunately it was presented on the rocks.  It should have been served neat so I requested a correction. My server took it back to the bartender, but immediately returned with the same drink. She gave me the \"Sorry, but we just ran out\" excuse and offered to remove the ice or get me something else.  I decided to keep it.\n\nThe next morning, breakfast was served at the same place so I was able to see the bottles at the bar. I was shocked to see a half full bottle of the scotch I ordered just eight hours earlier prominently displayed. I asked to see the bottle, and sure enough it was about half full.  They purposely lied to my face in the hopes I wouldn't notice, and they wouldn't have to discard a $22 drink.  This was quite the insult, and I decided to write a letter detailing my experience to the Hotel Manager. I mailed it and 6 days later the manager's  assistant sent me a boiler plate  email response \"sorry to hear about your negative experience...this doesn't reflect how we usually do things...hope to see you again soon\". \n\nThe Intercontinental Boston and the Intercontinental Willard in Washington are fantastic places to stay.

There is a NYC Destination fee charged however it included free internet, $25 per day F&B credit and a laundry\/dry cleaning allowance.

It was extremely important for our comfort. The reservation for two beds was made in 2018 for the 5-8 July 2019 family wedding event. Instead we were upgraded to a suite upon arrival despite our protest.  Some would have loved the upgrade, because there was this one king size bed in the bedroom and a sitting area with a sofa bed.  One of us ended up on the sofa bed mattress that was uncomfortable and not like the king bed, thereby causing stress and strife. To make matters worse, the suite was a handicap accessible one, and we were not able to hang up our dresses, because of very low closet rods for people in wheelchairs. The shower was tiny, had a large folded up seat inside, and a flimsy short shower curtain that let water leak and spray over the bathroom floor. I was very disappointed especially given that the reservation was made months ago, and I had called a week before arrival specifically to confirm we would get two beds. \nThe hotel staff offered an apology and said occupants of double bed rooms decided to extend their stay prior to our arrival.   On other issues, the hotel location is fantastic. In our room, the bed linens were very white, spotless and fresh.  Towels were clean and fluffy, bathrobes and slippers great.

From its location just a few blocks from Grand Central Terminal, to the friendly staff and comfortable room.\n\nBeing an ambassador member, I was accorded early check in at 10am.  The room was clean and classic looking but certainly not old nor dated.  We had a very nice and comfortable king bed.  The bathroom was well stocked with amenities.  Although well shielded from the street noise, the soundproofing internally was unfortunately bad.  The main reason why 1 star was deducted is the noise issue from neighboring room which can be very significant! (otherwise I would have given this hotel 5 star).  \n\nCentrally located in Manhattan, you can easily walk to Grand Central Terminal (for food and subway) or to Time Square and Broadway for theater.\n\nUnlike most hotel where the club lounge is located at the top floor, Club Intercontinental is at the ground floor, hidden just behind the bar.  It was spacious with comfortable lounge and dining seating and what stood out was the good breakfast selection (although afternoon tea and evening cocktail's selection was not as great).  The one issue with the lounge beverage is the hot chocolate machine occasionally gives out very diluted chocolate though.\n\nI will not hesitate to recommend this hotel and to stay here again.  Not sure if something can be done with regards to the poor soundproofing of the rooms.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Great location and the hotel itself is very nice. Nice rooms and good decor etx. But what really lets this place down is the simply awful service across most parts of the hotel. Such a long list of problems; lack of warmth from staff; lack of follow through on requests (took them 90 minutes to print a doc for me); lost my laundry for a day and a half; mini bar not replenished 3 days in a row; coffee pods not replenished; waiting ages for them to answer calls to reception; a very average but very expensive breakfast (52 bucks with a coffee). The list of issues is so long I haven\u2019t listed them all. Others include 1.5 hrs to call me back to answer a query. Having to ring them three days in row to ask them to replenish the water in my room etc etc. I travel a huge amount and this is about the worst hotel service I think I have ever experienced. The staff don\u2019t make eye contact with you and are pretty dismissive. And when I\u2019ve raised some problems they are just not engaged in wanting to fix it.  Not once did anyone just say \u201csorry for that\u201d when I raised an issue. The one staff member that I\u2019ve found very pleasant and helpful is the door man. Always greets you with a smile and happy to give directions. As an Intercontinental Ambassador I was really looking forward to staying her. The service is so surprisingly poor I won\u2019t come back again.  You\u2019d like to think this review would be a bit of a wake up call for hotel management; I suspect it won\u2019t be though based on my experiences.

Unfortunately on  check out, one colleague made our experience glad we were leaving.  On our approach to the desk she was rude we said we were checking out she asked our room number and said we owed $137.68, we were aware we had to pay a departure tax but had estimated $120, when we asked what is it for she replied it is what it is! I then went to giveher a card for payment and she said it was taken from the card given at check in-is it really difficult to have taken payment from our \u2018holiday\u2019 payment card.  When checking in we were asked for a credit card which is why we gave that card and not our preloaded card, but she said it is automatically deducted.  There was no discussion her vocabulary seemed to be no.  I checked the internet to find what the tax is for and I saw that someone wrote we could have drinks off set on it but this was never explained.  It just seems a shame that one persons attitude changed our opinion on our stay, the time you put into ensuring your staff are courteous to guests wasted as one person showed there is really no customer care.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

At this price range, I expect the Barclay to do the little things well.  \nOn the morning of check-out around 9 am, I went to the Concierge desk in the lobby with a simple request.  No one was in line, and the Concierge appeared annoyed when I approached her.  I asked whether the hotel still provided stationary with hotel letter head and envelopes.  My daughter is away at a camp for the summer, she loves New York, and I thought she would appreciate receiving an old fashioned letter in the US mail from the Barclay.  The Concierge had a pained expression on her face in response to my request, advised that room service would need to bring letter head and envelop to my room and requested my room number which she wrote down.  I thanked her and advised I would be checking out that morning, to which I received no acknowledgement.  I returned to my room, finished getting ready for my business meetings and needed to depart the hotel around 10:30 am.  I never received the stationary and envelop which was a disappointment, and also raised the question of for what purpose was I paying the $30 destination fee?

However, this time I was disappointed. The hotel itself is still lovely, however, there were some issues this time which were not.\n1) in the past year they have introduced a $30 per night per room resort tax. Why???!! Yes you can have $25 of drinks etc per day to put against it but genuinely it just feels they are taking even more money from you on top of the high price you have already paid to stay here.\n2) we were here for three nights. There is only one bar. As a paying resident I think it\u2019s unacceptable for the bar to be closed for a private function. You could sit in the lobby and have a drink but quite frankly I didn\u2019t really want to pay $20 for a glass of wine whilst sitting side by side on next to my friend on a sofa in the middle of the lobby NEXT to a bar we should have been allowed to sit in. Not acceptable for the price we were paying to stay in this 4* hotel.\n3) this is a nice hotel, it\u2019s not cheap, it has a good reputation. Both mattresses having rips in them (see photos) isn\u2019t on.\n4) \u00a39 or $12 for a small packet of pringles is quite ridiculous \n5) one unisex toilet in the lobby again seems not the brightest idea considering the number of guests they have. (Always a queue).\n\nIt\u2019s still a lovely hotel, the bedding and decor is great. However, this time it seemed to have lost its sparkle. Staff weren\u2019t overly friendly either.\n\nI\u2019m an IHG member (which doesn\u2019t appear to get you any benefits at all!) and stay in a lot of intercontinental hotels, unfortunately I doubt I\u2019ll be returning to this one.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We had booked two rooms as we were moving my daughter to New York. If you have any IHG status, don't expect much! First, the Ambassador desk was closed at check in, which we understood since it was 9:30 PM, but the gentleman\u00a0at the front desk who checked us in didn't acknowledge my husband's status at all, he's a spire ambassador. He said we upgraded you to a Barclay king and that was it. He told us there was a resort fee but it could only be used the last day of our stay since\u00a0we had used an ambassador night? When we got to our room there was no bottled water, no fruit, no amenity, which is standard for ambassadors. We weren't offered a hotel credit. When I called they said they would send but I didn't get it so I stopped by the ambassador desk on the way out the\u00a0next day and the very rude lady told me that they don't do that at their hotel. They give you a $20 credit on your hotel bill. Even though there was an ambassador card on her desk listing the perks of ambassadorship, fruit, water, etc, being two of them. Seeingthat a drink at the bar there is twenty dollars, a twenty dollar credit is a joke. Plus, a gentleman walked up to us at the bar and asked us if we wanted his ambassador free drink coupons that he wasn't going to use?? The inconsistencies were one right after\u00a0another. We had to book my daughter an extra night and were told that we didn't get the twenty dollar credit for her room. Checkout was a disaster too. Had to wait 15 minutes to checkout, only to see that I didn't have the credit on my bill to which\u00a0she explained it had to be used by midnight of the last night and we used it the morning before checkout! Who has ever heard of this? It certainly isn't written anywhere. I convinced her to take it off any way. This hotel staff, or management, or whoever is\u00a0in charge of their loyalty program really doesn't care if you are a first time or have a million stays. We spent over three thousand dollars on a weekend there even with the ambassador free night and I can honestly say I wished I had chosen another brand. The inconsistencies\u00a0amongst the IHG hotels have me seriously considering taking my business to a different hotel chain. Also, when a \"do not disturb \" sign is on the door, it means just that!

So, after much research we actually booked the sister hotel - Intercontinental Barclay via British Airways holidays. 24 hours before we were flying out to New York I contacted the hotel to request they order us a taxi to take us to the hotel from the airport, at which point they emailed back and said our reservation had been cancelled. I told them that couldn\u2019t be possible as I have the up to date reservation via British Airways holidays. British Airways were brilliant at getting to the bottom of what happened as they weren\u2019t informed by the hotel either - it turned out a member of staff deleted our reservation \u2018by mistake\u2019 and that there was nothing they could do as they were now full. We know (and they know of course) we were bumped for a customer paying a better rate... \n\nBritish Airways promptly booked us into the sister hotel Intercontinental Times Square who initially promised an upgrade for the cock up on their part (that never materialised), upon arrival the reception didn\u2019t even know anything about what had happened other than they were required to take payment from us again for the room. We then had to call British Airways again to step in to remind them that they had deleted their payment details and we had already paid. \n\nI accept that hotels make mistakes, we are all human, what I am so annoyed about is how this hotel handled it. No one even apologised, came to speak to us, or even fully explained what happened, we were just left to it and told we were lucky to get the replacement room! If I hadn\u2019t emailed to book a taxi shortly before we arrived we would have been none the wiser. \n\nThankfully they haven\u2019t ruined my birthday (I wouldn\u2019t allow them to do that) but we have been on the end of some appalling customer service. \n\nMy advice?

I paid cash for the destination fee but had I been asked in the first place how I wanted to pay, rather than the receptionist assuming, I would not now be waiting for the refund.  \n\nOur room, on the 5th floor, was spacious and clean and the bathroom was lovely, with a powerful shower and complimentary toiletries which were replenished daily. Oddly the duvet on the bed wasn\u2019t in a duvet cover but had a plain sheet below and above it - this was fine when we first got into the bed but partway through the night they became tangled and separated so not an ideal set up in our view - we assume the duvet itself was changed each time new guests arrive as otherwise the hygiene implications are questionable. We received daily housekeeping and ensured we left a monetary tip each morning but the service sadly didn\u2019t include the \u2018flick of a duster\u2019 and by our departure day the dust on the bedside cabinets was really quite thick! \n\nEverything said we had a great stay in a lovely hotel and would definitely return.

When we went to complain a woman at reception told us to \"take it up with Trump\" and then ignored whatever else we had to say. They also do not inform you that they will be taking out a further $34 per night (on top of the room cost) as a 'destination fee' for no justified reason other than to make more money. If nothing is taken they will refund $66 per night (the $34 is lost forever), but take note we visited weeks ago and this refund is still on hold so do not expect it any time soon. \nLastly, for two people the breakfast buffet comes to just under $100!

They did a spectacular job on renovating this hotel which reopened a few years ago after a multi-million dollar renovation.  They drastically improved the lobby and installed a showcase stairwell on the main floor.  The lobby is beautiful, warm and welcoming and the floral arrangements are always on point.  It's strategically located near Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center and for the shoppers, it's within walking distance to Fifth Avenue, Barney's, Bloomingdale's, Saks 5th Ave and Bergdorf Goodman and I visit all them all.  An excellent hotel isn't only based on its facilities but its staff.  The staff here is welcoming, warm and personable from the Front Desk, Bellmen to the Room Attendants.  They always recognize me as a returning\/loyal guest and Ambassador member.  I'd like to recognize a few outstanding staff members:  Annmara, Gregory & Sharon at the Front Desk (the three of them alone can serve as instructors or mentors in how to provide excellent hospitality); Richard (longtime employee over 20+ years) and Miguel on the Bellman staff, and Norman of the Concierge staff.  There are others but I didn't get there names.  I love the artwork in the rooms and the carpeted and marble floors.  I brought a dear friend on this trip who is like a sister to me and it was her first experience with the Barclay hotel.  We had both recently lost dear\/beloved family members so we needed a good trip.  I contacted Norman for his suggestion on a excellent florist because I wanted to surprise my friend with an orchid corsage to wear to Easter services in Brooklyn.  His recommendation came through and the florist provided an excellent\/breathtaking corsage which made her day.  We also used the Laundry service and they did a superb job in steam pressing our Sunday attire.  When I asked my friend how she enjoyed her stay, she commented that it was a first class trip. Having tenured\/excellent employees provides a business with consistency e.g., I met Gregory when I first started staying at the hotel well over 10 years ago. Excellence permeates every aspect of this hotel and that's why I love it and will continue to be a loyal customer!!!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It is an old, elegant hotel building that has been beautifully and lovingly restored\/renovated so that you still feel the elegance of the hotel's history but you also get modern functionality and comfort.  For a bit of history, note the display cases opposite the elevator bank that contain artifacts from the hotel's storied past.\n\nMy hubby is part of the IHG Ambassador program and booked online, but surprisingly there was a problem.  When he looked at his confirmation email a couple of days before our arrival, the confirmation was for the wrong Intercontinental NYC hotel (it was for the Times Square hotel).  It actually wasn't my hubby's error as the Times Square hotel was significantly more expensive for that date but the price on the confirmation was the Barclay's price.  So he had to call the Ambassador program to get it straightened out, which got done.\n\nWe booked a king bed room and when we checked in with the Ambassador desk, the staff member mentioned that she'd upgrade us from two standard queen beds to a king deluxe.  Once again, we felt this was a glitch as we had reserved a king room to begin with.  When we double-checked this upon check-out, she told us she upgraded us from a king premium room to a king deluxe room, but that doesn't account for her talking about two queen bed room.\n\nOur room was beautiful, with mauve, platinum, white and gold colors.  There was a nice round table and two chairs where we enjoyed our morning coffee.  The bathroom was well-lit and well-appointed, but one of the other issues we experienced was that there were a number of stains on the paint of the wall opposite the toilet, which one wouldn't expect in this type of property.  And, just like our last visit here in September, inexplicably there were no wash cloths in the bathroom, which we didn't realize until the morning.  I don't get that.  \n\nThe bed and pillows were comfy and the HVAC worked.  Another not-so-pleasant thing was that even though we never set the alarm clock, it went off at 6 a.m.!!!  I wish the fridge wasn't one of those where they stock it and if you move something it gets charged (the tiny section where you allegedly could put your own beverages wouldn't fit anything).\n\nThe staff here are pretty much universally friendly and service-oriented.  Everyone says hello even if you just pass by.  The Gin Parlour just off of the lobby is a lovely bar\/restaurant\/lounge where we had some snacks and drinks (made with house-made tonic!).  Some of our food was a bit overdone (pretzels were too hard\/crispy).\n\nWe were only here for one quick night but made sure to relate most of the issues we experienced to the Ambassador Desk staff member at check-out, and she was very apologetic (I showed her a photo of the stains on the wall in the bathroom) and seemed perplexed that the bathroom didn't have wash cloths, etc.  We also reiterated the booking problem (which wasn't the hotel's fault).  She offered us 10,000 rewards points which we accepted, and while we appreciated the gesture I just realized that those points would get us about 1\/6 of the way to a free night.  Better than nothing, but not what I would call \"generous\" after experiencing so many glitches in for just one night at the hotel.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of these problems, we still felt very comfortable here and would definitely consider booking again, but this time we'd hope they will have fixed all of these very fixable problems.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Having stayed at both intercontinental hotels in New York City, the Barclay for me was a nicer room, with a larger space and decorated to a higher standard. If it's location and views you're after then Times Square is the better hotel, although the rooms are smaller, you are in a much more central location which makes it easier to explore New York City. The only downside to the Barclay was the price of the breakfast and drinks in the bar- 1 breakfast was $40 and although it was delicious, I don't think it was worth quite that much. A gin and tonic cost $20 which made for a very expensive round of drinks! I would definitely stay here again or in it's sister hotel if I visited New York City again- highly recommended.

The d\u00e9cor is really classic New York. Rooms, bathrooms, furnishings and facilities all seemed to be great, our only gripe was that the walls were quite thin.\n\nThe staff were a little hit-and-miss, we sometimes got the impression that we weren't the usual sort of calibre of guest to stay at the hotel, but for the most part they were friendly and helpful.\n\nFor tourists I'd say the location is okay. You're only a few minutes from Grand Central and all the train links to elsewhere in the city, but it does feel a bit out the way of other tourist areas and landmarks.\n\nWe booked this stay through the British Airways Sale and got a really good price on the complete trip. I would, however, point out to any guests staying here on a budget, there is a mandatory $30 +Tax daily charge made to your room called a 'Destination Fee', which you are required to pay upon checking out.\n\nWe were not aware of this when booking and so it did push our hotel budget up unknowingly. This seems like a bit of an underhanded move used by hotels to keep their online booking prices low, only to squeeze a bit more out of you when you get there. I know it's common place in Vegas but also now seems to be creeping into NYC.\n\nAnyway, this $30+Tax does go towards food\/ drink and laundry credit so it's wise to utilise it each day. We used the credit to take a couple cans of Coke out the mini bar each day (around $10 each plus tax, plus an administration fee). This all seemed OK until, at check-out, we were told the mini-bar actually was not included in the fee, and that we faced a bill of almost $300 for 4 days of the fee plus a few cans of Coke! We did manage to plead our case in the end and the Cokes were eventually chalked off the bill much to our relief.  \n\nFor most people I\u2019m sure this won\u2019t be an issue, but I thought it best to inform anyone booking on a tight budget as we were.

I choose the hotel based on the kind of experience I need for that particular trip. Sometimes it's just a clean room off the highway when I'm taking a road trip. Sometimes it's a larger room where I can get work done. Other times, it's a special place for a special occasion. \n\nOur stay at this hotel was for the latter... a birthday celebration at a luxury hotel (and is part of hotel group with which we have pretty high status). Unfortunately, the experience and attitude at this hotel doesn't match their promise :  \"with meticulous attention to detail, we welcome guests to a comfortable living space of idyllic pleasure\". \n\nHardly so. \n\nThey have renovated this hotel, but neglected to improve the staff and the overall guest experience. It is a lovely hotel, with a surprisingly unattractive attitude toward guests. \n\nIt starts upon arrival, where there is no one outside to help or offer any assistance of any kind. No help with bags, no direction to reservations desk, no help up the stairs or with the heavy doors, no one to get a car or a cab. You're on your own. Not once during our stay was there a doorman or a bell captain available for assistance. \n\nWe had booked a Club Room, and the information given indicates that there is a separate check-in for those rooms, so we looked around for that area.  Found the club, but their \"printer wasn't working. You can go to the other side and check in there\". Found that area, were told that the room wasn't ready yet (that's fine- we were early) and they would call us when it was. \n\nNow, in most Intercontinental Hotels, when you are a Platinum or Royal Ambassador, they tend to treat you fairly well. We don't have unrealistic expectations of being upgraded to expansive suites, or anything like that. But usually, in a good property, they will give you the best room they can find for you as part of your \"guaranteed upgrade\" status. So, when we got to our room, which was wedged between the ice machine and the cleaning staff service room on a not very high floor, with a view of the lower level roof,  we were a bit surprised. We asked for a better room. We were shown the same room on a LOWER floor, which they *insisted* was an upgrade. And even more astonishing, said that we would be charged an additional $50.00 a night if we wanted it. We said \"no, thank you\" and stayed where we were. And then called for towels and a robe and another pillow, because the room was furnished with amenities for only one person, not two.\nDid I mention that we had informed them that this was a special occasion?  \n\nHowever, when I later checked my hotel charges, they had entered the \"premium\" room into our folio, and charged an additional $141.00 per night to our bill. When we asked for an explanation, they said \"You said you wanted a premium room\". The ensuing \"discussion\" with the manager was wholly and terribly unpleasant. I don't like being lied to. I don't like being treated like I am being too demanding and difficult when I am simply asking for a hotel to do what they are supposed to do. I don't like being treated with condescension, contempt, or a dismissive attitude. \n\n There were other, smaller, issues as well.  For some inexplicable reason, they had a utility cart with open paint cans and brushes and tools right next to the food in the Club Lounge, and someone was repairing walls near the seating area during the evening pre-theatre snack service. \n\nRoom service?  oh...  I laughed out loud when I saw that they charge about $30.00 for a \"breakfast sandwich\", then add a 22% service charge, a $6.50 delivery fee, and all kinds of  taxes, which results in paying more than $40.00 for what is the equivalent of  $3.50 McDonald Croissandwich. Now, anyone who travels with any frequency knows that room service  is always a bit expensive, but this is just cynical. \n\nAgain, the renovation of the hotel is lovely. It is a very sophisticated and warm lobby, and there was a manager on duty on Saturday night who was quite kind. \n\nIt is an adequate hotel, with clean rooms. \n\nBut ultimately, it is a luxurious facade, with an austere attitude. There are much better places to stay in Midtown. \n\n(disclosure: I lived in NYC for many years. I stayed at this hotel before the renovation, and used to send friends there when they visited. I am not offended by the brusk, somewhat harsh New York attitude, nor am I put off by having to work to get what one wants when in Manhattan. Nothing is ever easy here, and it's always been  part of the NYC experience. The attitudes at this hotel are not typical of NYC -  no matter what they might say to the contrary. I'm sure that my review will be dismissed as that of a \"difficult\" guest. Because that's exactly how we were treated. The only \"difficulty\" we presented was that of a guest who asked for things to be fixed when they were wrong. That's not difficult. That's their job.)","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We decided to try the Intercontinental Barclay for a change of pace.  After our recent visit, we will not be back.\n\nWhen we arrived on Friday afternoon and drove up the street to the hotel, there was no available parking space to pull up to the hotel.  After going around the block, we were able to pull up to the hotel.  When we exited the car, the doorman did come over to give us a ticket, but it was clear that no one was going to assist us with our luggage.  My husband removed our luggage from the trunk of the car and carried it into the lobby.  It did not feel very welcoming.\n\nUpon check in, we were told that the Club Lounge, for which I paid extra, would not be available from 11:00-3:00, due to a private function.  I was not offered a refund of any type due to this. Paying extra for a luxury service and then not being able to access it is unacceptable.  \n\nThe hotel itself has a nice appearance.  The room was clean and nicely decorated.  There was sufficient drawer space.  The walk in closet was large, however, oddly, there was only one bathrobe.  The bathroom had adequate shelving for storing of toiletries.  The shower was fine, nothing exceptional. There was only one large bath towel and one hand towel per person.  Regardless of trying not to slam the door, the doors to the rooms close so loudly that several rooms down the doors could be heard and were loud enough to wake you up.  The thermostat in the room had no option between heat or air conditioning, just a temperature setting, and we were unable to attain a temperature that was comfortable enough for sleeping.\n\nWe had drinks at the Gin Parlour, which is the lobby bar.  The bartenders were personable and the cocktails were on point.  On our second night we again had cocktails and ate dinner at the bar.  Food was pricey for the quality.  Spaghetti bolognese and scallops. Nothing remarkable.\n\nAt departure, the doorman presented my husband with two different car keys and had him select the correct one, instead of having the car properly tagged as to which patron it belonged.  We handed him our ticket for the car and he stated that he needed our name and room number and admonished us for not having the ticket filled out with this information.  When we checked in two days prior, my husband presented the ticket to the person checking us in and we were told it was not needed at that time, and is only needed when we leave.  We were never instructed to complete the ticket.  \n\nWe will be in NYC in two weeks, and I have just booked at the Intercontinental Times Square.  I can be assured that the doorman will greet us with a smile, open my car door for me upon arrival, will unload our luggage, and will promptly deliver it to our room.  \n\nSkip the Barclay and book the Times Square, it's only about 10 blocks away.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Check in was a great experience, Leslie was extremely helpful and friendly with answering questions and making sure we had what we needed to start.  We did receive an \"upgraded\" room on the 14th floor due to my Spire Ambassador status.  The room was very nice and I have no complaints, I just would have liked to see our original room to compare because I'm not sure how it was upgraded.  This was our first stay with Intercontinental's since they made changes to the Ambassador benefits so I can't speak as to whether it is just this hotel or Intercontinental as a whole but I didn't feel the normal personalized service with the status.  We stayed at the Chicago Intercontinental in February and we received the in-room welcome gift and card from the manager and a phone call during our stay making sure we had everything we needed.  We did not receive any of that here.  \n\nHousekeeping was great and we received turn down service on the nights we were out and not in our room.  We also did enjoy the 4pm late checkout because our flight didn't leave until 8pm on our last day.  The bar was usual crowded but the bartenders were friendly and the drinks were delicious.  \n\nThe location worked out extremely well for us, it is close to an entrance for Grand Central and not far from numerous other Subway stops making getting around quite easy.\n\nOne big complaint is the walls were very thin-  I was woken up in the middle of the night once and almost every morning at 5am by the man staying in the room next to us because I could clearly hear everything he was saying.  I did not notice the traffic noise at all.\n\nOverall, it was a good stay.  I've seen complaints from other Ambassador members and we're spoiled by the exceptional service we always receive in Chicago as Spire Ambassadors but we definitely did not receive poor service here or experience any of the other complaints.  We did receive our benefits and we will definitely be staying here again when we're back in NYC.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

First off, I want to say that IHG have really downgraded the perks for being a top tier - t the extent that a I got a $20 off food and beverage - no note, nothing personal welcoming me to the hotel and no breakfast.  IHG have really lost the plot with this - the only reason I was staying here was because of a 241 voucher so they are losing business from me!\n\nAnyway - the hotel itself is well decorated and harks back to a bygone era.  Check was friendly enough - and my benefit was explained... I had been upgraded by one category.  I also paid for Club Lounge access (another bug bear for a top tier - but it was $80 per room per night).\n\nMy double room was a good size, the bed was huge and very comfy and had a really luxurious feel.  The bathroom was gorgeous although a little small for 2 people really.  The shower was not the strongest but it was perfectly fine.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a view - but then I don\u2019t think there is much of a view from many rooms in this hotel judging by the location.  The room was very quiet though for being in the middle of New York.\n\nThe Club lounge was fine - a bit dark but the evening snacks were better than a lot of hotels in the USA - and including wine and beer of a good quality.  Evening cocktails was 1700-2000 and there was other stuff through the day - for 2 people it would be good value - for me it was marginal I thought.\n\nThere is a limited choice of places to eat or drink in the hotel - in fact there is only 1 - the Gin Parlour but it did good cocktails.  It was very busy in the evening and was typical New York prices!\n\nI got a late check out and check out itself was seem less.  The location is a quick 10 min walk to the subway that will take you back to the airport.  Think carefully, as a tourist, about what you want to see as I thought this hotel was in the quieter part of town - although everything is easy to get to.\n\nOverall I thought the hotel was of a very good standard - certainly up to Intercontinental standards albeit my issues are primarily with the loyalty chain.   \n\n","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Been in my room for the past 30 min.  Still waiting for that call. Going down for a drink at this point !\n\n3. When I had to remind the receptionist for my two drink vouchers.  She told me they didn\u2019t have anymore to give out and I can check in with the Ambassadors desk tomorrow ??????  Or if I want I can just tell the bartender and he may be able to take off my bill????? \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15\n\n4.  Then the best thing yet... wait for it.... I get to my room, and what do I see.  Someone\u2019s left over food bowel and food by my door.  I had to look at my door number twice because I thought someone else was already in the room.\nCheck out the enclosed photos.  \n\nWhat the heck !

It was flawless. \n\nDetails below with a tip for getting lower cost room. \n\n1. Service - They were kind, friendly and attentive. \n\n2. Lobby - It reminds you of a modernized 1920s hotel. It is beautiful!\n\n3  Rooms - The rooms are immaculate. I tad small but wasn't an issue. There is a huge mural on one wall that is gorgeous. Great sitting area. \n\n4. Bathroom - Bathroom is beautiful. Small subway tile in stand up shower with tempered frameless glass doors, back lit mirror, lit makeup mirror. Very modern 1920s. \n\n5. Food - Food is expensive. Watch out for the mini bar in your room. They are very proud of the items. \n\n6. Bar -Drinks were great, glass of wine was $15-20 bucks but drinks and service were excellent. \n\n7. Location - INCREDIBLE location. 3 blocks from Saks 5th Avenue shopping, Rockfeller Plaza, and 15 min walk to time square. \n\nTIPS:\n\n1. Breakfast is expensive but directly across the street is Ashley Fine Food. It is a grocer\/cafe. with great hot break break fast ( i had bacon, pancakes and wife had oatmeal and french toast). They also have great sandwhiches from lunch as well as affordable bottled water. Suggest you load up here for snakcs, bottle water, and breakfast\/lunch. \n\n2. Soutwest Booking - I booked the Barclay through Southwest Hotels. I received 10,000 soutwest points fro the booking and ended up not having to pay the $35\/nt resort fee. I expected to have to pay it but was told when ichecked in because of the way i booked i did not owe it. (Not sure if it was a mistake on their end but they insisted i did not owe it whom am i to argue). \n\nWe can't wait to come back and stay again at the Barclay.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Nice rooms, small but not too small for NYC.  It was such a great experience that even though I\u2019m not a IHG member with status (I\u2019m platinum premier with Marriott), I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll stay at intercontinental hotels again and may even do a status match soon. My experience here was everything a luxury hotel should be. My only complaint is that the water in the spray bidet in the bathroom was colder than the water in my home fridge.  ICE COLD so unusable.  Only got even colder of let it run for a while.  It was very cold outside so maybe it\u2019s fine when the weather isn\u2019t so dramatically cold. \n\nHigh recommend but don\u2019t expect a large room.

The candid truth is that the Barclay keeps upping their game. Elevating service, food, and comfort again and again. The hotel was updated a few years ago, and the rooms are large, well appointed, comfortable and elegant. The lobby and Gin Parlor are energetic while maintaining the old world classic New York City feel of a 5 star hotel. And, the location is a 10 out of 10. At 48th and Lex you are a short walk from Grand Central, 5th Avenue, and in the middle of the business district of midtown. \n\nI think the Barclay is setting a standard for an elegance in Midtown East. I wouldn\u2019t stay anywhere else. ","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It might be a NY thing that staff go out their way to help but there was just something special about the team. I can't thank them enough. The view over the city is just incredible. I ordered breakfast to my room on the last day and just stared out the window, drifting away in thought. \nHotel situation was perfect, walking distance to central park, Times Square and surrounded by loads of character you don't see on travel sites, take a walk round neighbouring streets and so much can be found. Oh and make sure you eat at the breakfast buffet, it's amazing and filled me up for the day.\nI've included a few shots from my stay. \nA big big thank you to all the team at Intercontinental New York Barclay, you truly made my stay in the City.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":93462,"title":"MIXED REVIEW: detailed comments re: Ambassador, Rooms, Gin bar, resort \/ destination fee","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-01-28","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Located in Mid-town east, fairly convenient for Grand Central and the '6' subway, this Intercontinental hotel has a bright spacious lobby, renovated\/modern rooms, and a historic feel.\n\nCheck-in: Two issues: 1) As a Platinum Ambassador, I was advised no room upgrade is available if you book a room with two beds as now nicer rooms with two beds exist int the property. Since the Ambassador program \"Guarantees an upgrade to the next level up\" there should be disclosures when booking a two bed room that NO UPGRADE CAN BE OFFERED if you book this room. 2) The $30 per day \"Resort fee\" \/ \"Destination Fee\" is insulting. I don't care if IHG thinks some hotels in NY are doing this - this is not a \"Resort Hotel\" and the amenities it provides are not valuable. The $25 food\/beverage credit is hard to use as \"IT MUST BE USED BY MIDNIGHT ON THE DAY YOU CHECK IN\" - when you arrive at 10pm and have had dinner this is pointless. Why they don't allow you to use it for breakfast is beyond me.  The $15 Laundry credit is all pointless.... laundry must be picked up in the morning to get it back the same day, and overnight laundry (surcharged at 50%) must be picked up by 8pm or so... again late check in and you can benefit from this. On future days we turned in two pairs of socks just because (uses up the allowance) - until all guests start doing this, hotel management will keep adding this fee annoyance knowing people don't benefit from it. PLEASE IHG GET RID OF THIS FEE - IT'S INSULTING - YOU ARE NOT A RESORT. Just price rooms correctly. You also don't get a paper delivered to your room.\n\nROOM: Negatives: Two bed rooms are tiny double beds - not queens, inadequate amount of towels, no laundry bags\/slips in room on arrival, only 1 wine glass on arrival, fruit provided as welcome amenity was old and wrinkled. Complimentary water for IHG Plat AMB not restocked daily. Positive: beds comfortable and windows can be opened for outside fresh air.\n\nGIN BAR: The hotel prides itself on its 'gin bar' with a lot of (overpriced) gin choices, plus you pay extra for the tonic. Laughable is they service these 'uncommon' \/ boutique Gin & Tonics in glasses filled with ice chips. Come on - any good bar knows today that quality cocktails needs to be served over a single large ice cube (or at least large ice cubes). At ~$25 for 1 G&T why would I want it diluted to a watery mess quickly with small ice chips.\n\nWill definitely have to explore other IHG properties for my next trip to NY or return to others I've used that don't have these issues.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We found the foyer impressive and beautifully decorated for Christmas. Later learnt that the location was also very convenient - its not right in the thick of it but close enough to all of the usual Manhattan attractions to walk to most.\nThe standard room we booked was clean and modern, albeit not large (what can you expect in New York?!)\nThe accommodation we found was great value for money (circa \u00a31400 each for flights and accomdation over xmas, short notice for a week - booked through an agent)\nOnly major down-point which tainted it for us was the cost of eating in the hotel. Around $100 for 2 to have breakfast a day, xmas dinner was over $200 including drinks - this put us off eating in the hotel VERY early. We also ran up about $600 of costs on the minibar so it really isnt worth it no matter how tempting and well stocked it is! Ashley's Wholefood across the road was a saviour for our breakfasts, snacks and lunches.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was operated on yesterday, and today I had the pleasure to meet Ms. Chang. She told me that the Hotel Staff is aware of my situation. Yesterday, the General Manager of the Intercontinental Barclay  Ms. Sofia Vandaele  left me a voice message and personally wanted to check on my health status.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93462,"title":"One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-01-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I was delighted by this elegant yet welcoming hotel. I stayed for one night in one of the smaller (least expensive) rooms and still was really impressed; the hotel combines the charm of a relatively historic building with the convenience and comfort of a beautifully updated hotel. For me it combined the best of both. The room was very attractive, and larger than I expected given the price point; the bed was very comfortable; the lights in the room were more than sufficient for reading, the TV channel selection impressive. The bathroom was beautiful, with a spacious and very well lit shower. The keyed elevator made me feel especially comfortable as a solo traveler, since you cannot get to a guest floor without first swiping your room key on the elevator pad. The lobby was beautiful. As someone who was born in New York City  and has lived within a fifty-mile radius almost my whole life, I rarely get to spend a night in a New York City hotel and experience the city as a tourist would. This was really a treat, and if I were a tourist or staying over in the city again I think the Barclay would be my first choice. (The proximity to Grand Central was a deciding factor for me when I booked the room since I was coming in by train.) I do not love Lexington Avenue, but the hotel itself is just off the avenue on a side street and as soon as you approach the steps everything seems quite serene, though not quite peaceful, given that Midtown Manhattan is rarely truly peaceful.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"SOLO"}
