On a Thursday night the noise from the bar across the street kept us up until 2am. All these bars are open until 4am on Friday and Saturday night, so we moved to another hotel to avoid another bad night. \n\nThe hotel was not very helpful or understanding with the situation. I asked for them to refund our two remaining nights. They refunded one night, but said it was too late in the day (3pm) to refund the second night. Given the circumstances I expect a well run hotel to not hassle us over one night.\n\nBottom line: if you\u2019re looking for a hotel that sounds like the party is going on in your room until 2am or later, this is your place!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We continue to come back to Sixty LES for their large rooms, central location, and excellent customer service and decent rates (for NYC).\n\nOn our last stay at Sixty LES, we arrived very late in the evening due to a delayed flight.  It was close to Christmas and the hotel was booked full!  We were met with bad news, our room booked was not available.  We had booked a King Suite.  The good news, Jose R. and Justin had upgraded our room to the Penthouse Suite!  Woo hoo.  What a lovely surprise.  We definitley had not expected that.  It was an AMAZING room, and hard to leave!  So spacious.  We travel with our small dog, so we tend to spend a lot of time in the room in the evening and this room checked every box!  Large tub to relax, fireplace, small kitchen and dining area.    It was amazing.\n\nEven if we had not been upgraded, Sixty LES is an amazing hotel in the LES with large rooms and a cool vibe.  Everyone is so nice!  We will be back soon!\n\nThanks to the amazing staff, especially Jose R. and Justin.

With its position on the 7th floor and volume of the music, the sound travels up the side of the building and from our room on the 11th floor we could very clearly hear what individual songs were even with the windows closed. We wore earplugs so wasn\u2019t too much of an issue for us, but with so many reviews here mentioning it and so many reviews for the bar saying it\u2019s always empty, it makes no sense to have such a disruptive bar which no one wants to go to, and it\u2019s an issue which could be so easily fixed by just changing the vibe of the bar. The views from that side of the building are stunning so if the music volume was cut by half and it was marketed as a chic bar instead of a nightclub it would keep guests happy except maybe 1 floor above and below, and the public might actually want to visit the bar. Hotel guests would probably also want to visit the bar - I know we avoided it because it just sounded way too much but would have loved a chill bar in the hotel to drink and take in the views. \nIt wouldn\u2019t necessarily make us not return to the hotel but if the bar issue was fixed, we\u2019d be back in a heartbeat!","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

All of our rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows with the most amazing city view! I could see the Empire State Building and all the bridges. It's breathtaking at night. Also, they have blackout curtains so every day I could sleep in.\n\nThere is a club named Make Believe on the 7th floor. It's a trendy upscale club.

The SIXTY LES puts you right in the heart of Manhattan's vibrant downtown scene, at a near-perfect crossroads of the Lower East Side, East Village and Soho. For my money, this lively hood provides the best restaurants, shopping, live music venues, and people-watching that the city has to offer. Even better, the location provides easy access to the rest of Manhattan thanks to a subway stop and Citibike dock that are just steps away from the hotel's entrance. All that aside, the SIXTY LES gives good stay. Despite the hipster vibe, the staff are warm and very eager to be of service. The compact gym had everything I needed (including a sauna!), and was gloriously empty whenever I went down for a workout. The pool was closed but pretty to look at, and you could do a whole lot worse than Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya on the second floor. And now for the room. Upon checking into my LES Queen Studio for a one-night stay, I was casually informed that I had been upgraded to Penthouse 1 \u2013 a random act of kindness that may have spoiled me for life. The palatial room on the 21st floor is literally the size of my house, with two floors, three bathrooms, a kitchenette, a terrace offering unbeatable views of the city in three directions, the comfiest bed in Christendom, and the most glorious bathroom I have ever experienced \u2013 complete with a soaking tub that looks like a Richard Serra sculpture. I kept kicking myself that I was there for a whirlwind business trip, and didn't have time to luxuriate in my surroundings. After years of favoring The Standard for my East Village stays, you can bet your bottom dollar that I'll be returning to the SIXTY LES from now on.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

The location of LES is great because it is extremely easy to get uptown, over to Soho and the Village and even out to Brooklyn. Also a great area for cheap late night food, well-known restaurants, and unique thrift shops. The pool deck and bar is a great asset for a summer stay and is very cozy.\n\nHowever, you definitely have to come to this hotel KNOWING that there is a club in it that makes the weekends a bit tough. Even on the upper floors, you can definitely hear the bass until 3AM at least. I would probably not recommend this hotel if you are not coming to NYC with the intention of taking advantage of the \"city that never sleeps\" reputation \u2014 or if you have kids that are light sleepers.\n\nOverall however, the rooms are clean and swanky with nice showers, big windows, and an appropriate amount of space for the price, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I wish the beds were more comfortable, for sure, but otherwise this is a great value for the price and we have enjoyed our stays immensely.\n\nLast tip \u2014 bring one of those crocodile hair clips to clip the curtains together around the column in the room to avoid the issue some people are reporting around light coming in in the morning.

The staff seems frazzled and unfriendly (except for one guy named Marco) I had put on my reservation check in on line that I need 2 non down feather hypoallergenic pillows for my stay. They were not in my room upon arrival. I called down and requested them and when I returned late that evening they were not in my room. I called the front desk the next day and requested again. Once again I did not receive them. So I had to stop at the desk on the way in that evening to ask for a 4th time... I was told they have been very busy that's why I never received them (SMH) Finally did get them that night, but that didn't help me sleep because the LOUD house music and people partying that I heard until 2am from our 16th floor room was ridiculous. Now let's add the loud sex the couple was having next door to us to the mix. The walls are so thin and there is absolutely no sound barrier from other rooms or the outside street noise. The hallway smelt like fried chicken for some reason, lol. Our room was also near the elevator, once again noise from the opening and closing, bell dinging, and people talking. All in all an awful stay. Bad customer service, bad vibes, lack luster amenities... they have a tiny pump pot of coffee at the entrance in the morning and it was  gone when I got to it, I asked the front desk if they will be refilling it and the girl said yes, he went to get it... waited 15 minutes and then left to go find a hot cup of coffee elsewhere.

The first time was in 2022. I returned based on the stellar experience I had last year. \n\nI am a veteran traveler, and I hate boring hotels. I have no patience for the usual \u201cfixtures\u201d and appearance of the chains out there. Mind you, I hate status with Marriott and Hilton, but I avoid them in cities like New York and Amsterdam. I want to experience larger rooms in those cities. The Sixty LES achieves that goal.\n\nNot only are the rooms are good size, but their lack of carpeting appeases my sense of cleanliness. Next up is the lighting: it\u2019s unique and makes the room\u2014AND YOU, look great.\n\nMy only complaint, and why I didn\u2019t rate a five star rating, is the HVAC situation that occurred during my stay. When I checked into my room in the afternoon, the thermostat said 77F. I\u2019m always cold, but that\u2019s a bit warm for even me. I set the AC to 70, thinking that this would bring the room down to a manageable temperature while I went to my meeting. When I returned 90 minutes later, the room felt the same! Nothing had changed. Upon closer examination throughout the evening, it appeared that one side of my king suite was not getting any cool airflow. Only the bedroom area was. In the end, the room got down to 73F. I asked the front desk about this situation as I was checking out. They said that there was a building-wide problem that had occurred. That\u2019s what I figured. It\u2019s NYC after all and HVAC problems seem to be a thing everywhere. It\u2019s also why I didn\u2019t complain. What\u2019s the point when it\u2019s most likely building-wide? You can tell I\u2019ve traveled a good bit.\n\nOne other snarky point: I like that both times I\u2019ve stayed at this hotel I haven\u2019t seen a bunch of kids running around. This place does NOT have a family vibe. I\u2019m not seeking that when I travel. I want a property where adults tend to be the majority of guests. You can call me mean. Fine. I know what I like in a hotel.\n\nI will definitely return to this property in the future. I really don\u2019t see the point of looking elsewhere for when I need to stay in Manhattan. It\u2019s convenient, trendy, and well-appointed. ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Solid location, relatively clean and open rooms, modern feel (though starting to feel a bit \u201cworn\u201d in rooms), nice showers, nice views depending on the room, and very nice staff. \n\nThe challenge with the hotel, as written in numerous reviews, is that there\u2019s a club on the 7th floor. No way to disguise it or hide it \u2014 the rooms on 7 are LITERALLY 5 feet across from\u2026a club. A club that blasts high bass thumping music all night. Seriously\u2026.2 floors up and down you\u2019ll hear it (and feel it) all night, and on the same floor forget about it. \n\nIn our experience, we came to our room on 7 to shower before dinner (5-6pm) and when the elevator opened there was a girl getting sick in a trash can and the floor from over drinking in the club (yes 530pm). Management promptly moved us up to 14, but this gives you a sense of the clientele you might run into on a Saturday. \n\nSo, if you enjoy that because you\u2019re actually in the club until 3am, then it\u2019s for you. If you don\u2019t, you absolutely must be on floor 10-16 (not too close to 18 as the penthouses are for partying too and they start on 19), and anticipate a party feel.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I immediately reached out to Sixty Les and I must say Emely was not just outstanding with her customer service but she graciously paid attention to every detail from start to finish of our stay. We booked the luxury suite what had a magnificent view of the New York City skyline. On arrival there were chocolates and champagne waiting in the suite. \n\nThe hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating and Emely was able to organize an early check in for us.

The front desk staff is amazing, thus the extra star, but upon arrival there is no doorman\/bellman to greet you. Ok, I could live with that, but the lobby is super shabby as are the rooms. I would consider this a 2-3 star hotel. The elevators are so slow there were times I saw people waiting in line to get an elevator. The rooms are beat up and shabby.  The clincher was that there were no robes and slippers and that plastic cups were in the bathrooms for usage-it felt like a room by the hour situation.  The floors were not clean, which I can attest to because there were no slippers to put on. Additionally, the beds were not very comfortable.\n\nI think this a hotel for people looking to stay in the city overnight and by the time they get back drunk don't really care what the situation in the room really is. However, at $795 per night, I expected a lot more!  Not a chance I would ever come here again.  Thankfully I was able to find another nearby hotel and check out after one night. I'm happy they let me off the hook, again front desk staff was lovely, this isn't about the staff at all, just the actual hotel itself.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Marcos was very understanding and accommodating throughout our entire stay. Upon arrival we found that the room we booked was not what we expected. When we initially voiced our concerns about the dirty pull-out couch that one of us had to sleep on for the entirety of the trip and the concern of the shared balcony (which was not specified online), we were given little to no help. We considered cancelling our reservations completely until we spoke to Marcos, who was able to find us a Junior Suite. Similarly, as we were checking out, Marcos ensured we had no issues regarding the price difference of the two rooms. Since you will find my friends\u2019 reviews in more detail, I will sum up my review with this: Marcos was extremely kind and helpful and I would hope the other employees would follow in his example.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

However, Marcos went above & beyond. He is extremely accommodating & genuinely wants to help guests out. If it weren't for Marcos, we most likely would not be returning to Sixty LES for our next trip to NY. \n\nUpon our arrival, we went to our original room, the Allen suite, only to find that it was not only filthy with a beat up couch, but that the balcony was shared. We were never notified that the balcony was shared, which is a major safety concern for us three young girls staying at the hotel. When we went to the front desk to discuss possible room switch with an employee, we were told that there were no rooms without a shared balcony available. We were very close to going to an entirely different hotel -- until Marcos took over. Marcos actually took the time to look up available suites, & accommodated us with a Junior suite, which had no balcony (totally fine), a king bed + a couch to sleep on. Moreover, Marcos let us know there will be a significant price difference because this newer room was cheaper. \n\nFast forward towards the end of our trip, we wanted to verify with the front desk to see what the new price will be since we were never formally told what the price would exactly be. Another employee (not Marcos or the first employee from before) told us that there will be only a $45 reimbursement for the room switch ... absolutely insane. We went from a suite that had an entirely separate bedroom, a whole balcony, & much more square footage, only to downgrade to a studio-type room with a window that barely cracks open? We decided to hold off on discussing accommodations until the next day, which was our check out day. Thankfully, it was Marcos at the front desk. Upon checking out, Marcos realized the unfair price difference, & correctly adjusted the price. \n\nOnce again, I'd like to emphasize that the staff overall were not rude, but it seemed like they didn't care for our satisfaction or safety as guests. If it weren't for Marcos, I would have definitely left a 1 star review for the lack of accommodations, the filth, & the apathy of this hotel's staff. Thank you Marcos, we will be back just because of you & the location of the hotel.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

My friends and I booked Sixty LES for the Allen suite. Upon arrival to the room we realized that the balcony is a shared balcony with the entire floor. We were very uneasy about this being three young women. When we opened our sofa bed it was dirty and very janky. \n\nWe went downstairs and spoke to somebody in the lobby about switching us into a room without a balcony or with a King bed. We were told by this employee that there are no rooms available and every room with a king bed has a balcony. We went back upstairs to weigh out our option and decided that we were going to cancel our reservation and find a different hotel. When we went down to cancel it we were greeted by Marcos. An absolutely amazing employee. He was able to accommodate us and got us a room WITH a King bed and NO balcony (that the other employee told us didn\u2019t exist). \n\nWe were made aware that there is a price difference that will be accommodated at check out. Once it came time to check out a different employee told us it was only gonna be a $40 difference in the room pricing. So they wanted us to pay $3200 for a room with one king bed and no balcony when that is how much we were paying for a SUITE with a balcony and separate living area. Once again we found Marcos and spoke to him and he was able to honor the price difference and give us the correct pricing.\n\nI really didn\u2019t want to believe the bad reviews about the terrible customer service in this hotel since it\u2019s in such a prime location and very convenient. However, the customer service truly is terrible with the exception of Marcos. He was the only employee that wanted to help and actually cares about the guests.

We ask if there are any outdoor place we can enjoy the sun, they say no and three days later we find a nice outdoor area at 7th floor. Or when asking about breakfast: \u201cthere are different menus\u201d. Where can we find these? Use the QR code. Where is the QR code? 2nd floor. This kind of \u201cservice\u201d where you\u2019re left with a clear impression they don\u2019t want you to enjoy the hotel unless\nyou\u2019re a 25-year old hype. \n\nThere is also a club in 7th floor that people outside the hotel also can use, so loud music at night time.

The lower east side area is cool, with lots of nice bars and cafes. \nFacilities are ok and hotel pool is also nice, although small and with a bit strangest rules; drunk guys having spent hours drinking are welcome to swim, but kids that have been swimming competitively for years are told they cant take their head under water \u00abas they can drown\u00bb.

The terrace was only a standing terrace, much to my chagrin. Apparently someone decided it is too narrow for a table, but a small table and two chairs, which would have made a difference, e.g.,coffee in the morning and\/or a glass of wine or a cocktail before dinner would have made a big difference. To me, the room was a $4,000+ waste of money.\n\nThere was an extensive bar, but no coffee maker, nor microwave, which were disappointing. I purchased a Mr. Coffee and was subsequently told the hotel has a coffee maker, if I had asked. Why wasn\u2019t I told this when I checked in? Hotel front desk couldn\u2019t say. Additionally, there wasn\u2019t an Info Sheet of any kind in my room, which would have helped provide details about using the heat and air conditioning, operating the TV, hotel restaurants, about going to the Front Desk if you want a Do Not Disturb notice for your door, the location of nearest subway, neighborhood restaurants & coffee shops, etc.\n\nDepending on the elevator you use, you have to select Floor #1 or Floor #2 in order to reach the lobby and exit the hotel. The walls are thin, as I heard people talking & TVs in other rooms and people talking in the hall, which wasn\u2019t great. One major problem was the music and dancing that occurs each Saturday night. It was 1:30 AM before the music stoppe and I could fall asleep. Again, I was listening to people\u2019s conversations & laughter until almost 2:00 AM. The walls & floors are far (far) too thin in this hotel for music, dancing, drinking, etc. on the 7th Floor until 2:00 AM  - c\u2019mon! Not great after paying $4,000+ for one week.\n\nAlso, I left empty food containers in & next to the trash almost daily, but housecleaning didn\u2019t always take it\/them. I had to call Maintenance to remove the trash. One day, I turned on cold water in the bathroom sink and it was discolored.  Maintenance came up and advised that I leave the water running until it clears. It took 15-20 minutes before the water was clear, again. Last, when I turned off the TV in the sitting room, the TV automatically came on in the bedroom\n\nOn the plus side, the staff are terrific if you need something\/anything. They are polite and helpful at every turn! Aside from housecleaning, who didn\u2019t recognize the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d notice whenever I hung it outside my door, everyone else on staff are just exceptional. I was very grateful for the staff\u2019s kind attention and care.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

If I could take away stars, i would. First off, let start by saying this is THE ABSOLUTE WORST hotel I have ever experienced. I decided to book a room since it was my birthday. I left the room for dinner elsewhere with friends. Once we got back, my friends wanted to use the restroom so my best friend decided to bring them to the room first while i looked for parking. As I was going into the hotel, they stopped me and told me I wasn't allowed up because there's maximum 4 people occupancy. excuse me, HUH??? I BOOKED THE ROOM. THE ROOM IS UNDER MY NAME. I explained to them that my friends were simply using the bathroom and we were going to go back out. They would not let me up to my OWN room and continued to cut me off and say \"4 ppl only. 4 ppl only.\" I walk to the front desk to explain the situation and as I am speaking to the front desk person, I turn to the elevator and see that they just let 8 random (not being racist, just clarifying: I am asian. my friends are asian. The other 8 girls at the elevator going up were white.) I immediately asked them what the issue was and why I wasn't allowed up. They used \"its policy\" excuse.... when I PAID for my OWN room and was being denied entry. I was mortified. I asked them why they were being a bit irrational and possibly being racist and they immediately asked me to leave. I waited for my friends to come down and as I was trying to go up, the security starts yelling at me saying 4 PEOPLE MAXIMUM. Now Im PISSED so I said \"THEY CAME DOWN ALREADY AND ITS MY ROOM.\" Security then let me up and I packed my belongings and left within 3 hours of my \"stay\". I disputed my charge with the bank and they're claiming i stayed the full night because I initial-ed the statement saying that there will be fees if I break anything (which DOES NOT prove that I stayed the night).

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":1128769,"title":"WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-08-05","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Let me just start off by saying I don\u2019t typically leave reviews. But I decided to go out of my way to bring to light some of the disturbing incidents that took place during my recent stay at the Sixty-LES hotel. Long story short, this was the worst hotel experience I ever had in my life (and I travel A LOT). \n\nFirst, during the entire 5 night stay, we only had our room cleaned 1 time. When our hotel was not cleaned, we were told housekeeping services needed to be requested 24 hours in advance. No one told us this at checkin. But we chalked it up to a miscommunication and requested it for the following day. When no one showed up the next day, we called again (multiple times) and were told the \u201cdelivery of fresh linens had been delayed.\u201d Not even sure what that means, but after much persuading the staff reluctantly agreed to clean our room. The job was lackluster at best. They left empty cups and trash, didn\u2019t clean the bathroom and didn\u2019t touch the balcony. Although we \u201crequested\u201d housekeeping services multiple times for the remainder of our stay, they never showed up again. \n\nBut that was only the beginning. Throughout our entire stay, the hotel staff was extremely rude, aggressive, unprofessional, and at times, highly confrontational. For example, I invited 2 friends to our hotel suite to have a few drinks before we went to dinner. The security denied my friends access to our room. When my friends tried explaining to the hotel staff that they were invited by guests of the hotel, the staff member began screaming at them and physically threatening them in the lobby in front of other guests. After this incident, the hotel manager apologized to us and told us that the hotel fired that staff member. I asked the manager why this happened in the first place and he told me the hotel apparently has an unwritten \u201cno visitor\u201d policy. I told the manager that I saw the staff allow other hotel guests to invite visitors to their room without issue. He responded that how the policy is applied is \u201cup to their discretion.\u201d So basically\u2026 the hotel maintains a \u201cdiscretionary\u201d policy that allows them to deny any guests the right to invite visitors to their hotel room. But they won\u2019t tell you this at check in. Unfortunately, our stay only got worse after this.\n\nThis next example is what put the nail on the coffin and was what resulted in us checking out of this excuse-for-a-hotel 2 nights early. On this night, I invited 2 female friends (one of whom was an old friend from college who I hadn\u2019t seen in years) to meet us at our hotel. They did not have keys so we asked them to wait in the lobby for us to come down. During this time, the security guard began aggressively screaming at these women to leave the lobby. Despite my friends expressing that they were visiting guests of the hotel, the security told them they had to wait outside and began physically PUSHING the two women out of the building. All of this was caught on security footage and my friends are now preparing to take legal action against the hotel. \n\nAfter this incident, we decided to switch to a different hotel for the remainder of our trip. Upon checking out of the hotel, I explained all of these incidents to the manager on site. Unfortunately, he was dismissive and unsympathetic to say the least. Worst of all, he cruedly asked \u201cwell\u2026 were the two women intoxicated?\u201d I told him that they had not even begun drinking yet, and even if they did, how the hell does that make it okay for a security guard to physically assault two women for waiting in the lobby for their friends?! Rather than apologizing for his employees\u2019 vile and unprofessional behavior, the manager told us he did not have the power to refund us for any portion of our miserable stay. \n\nUnfortunately, these incidents only represent a fraction of all the unsettling incidents and unprofessional behavior we had to deal with during our stay. I didn\u2019t even get into the two times we were denied entry into our own rooms, which we were paying for! Or the pull out couch that feels like what I would imagine a prison mattress to feel like. But by now, I\u2019m guessing you get my point - Avoid this hotel at all costs!!! They don't clean your rooms. They assault guests. They assault women. They create fake discriminatory policies. And they do it all with no remorse. If you stay here, it will be the worst hotel experience you will have ever have and will have you leaving NY with a truly awful taste in your mouth.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

First off, when you walk into the lobby you're greeted with powerful fumes of incense. This is baffling. If second-hand tobacco smoke is bad, who decided that polluting the air with incense was a good thing? (And of course the smell rides the elevators up through the higher floors.)  The rest of this operation is chaotically disorganized. We paid extra to use the pool, but were told on the morning we tried to do so that it was closed for the day -- because \"It's supposed to rain.\" It never did rain, but they didn't open the pool. (When we peeked in at it the following day, we saw two dogs paddling around amid the bathers.)  The hotel advertises room service, but there was none. First we were told that we would have to come downstairs to pick anything up. Then we learned that there wouldn't be anything to pick up, because food items came from the hotel restaurant -- which was closed, so...too bad. The elevators that weren't out of commission were dirty, the room furniture was battered,  and the minibar had no bottle-opener (seems like a small thing, but when you have to wait more than an hour for someone to bring one to you, it becomes a sizable annoyance). I could go on (and on), but you get the idea.

We booked our stay online, reserving a Junior Suite. Note that the SIXTY LES charges a $29 per night Guest Experience Fee, which includes two bottles of water per night, a $10 minibar credit per night, Wi-Fi, and fitness center access. (The mandatory fee also includes pool access in the summertime.)\n\nAs its name implies, the SIXTY LES is located on the Lower East Side; its main entrance is on Allen Street, with a rear entrance (via the hotel restaurant) on Orchard Street. Another SIXTY property is located in SoHo, as well as a location in Beverly Hills. The lobby of the LES is dark and chic, with a few minimalist furniture pieces arranged along the wall across from the front desk. A wall of hanging beads behind the front desk hides a staircase that leads to the lounge\/bar\/restaurant area. The second floor offers comfortable lounge space, along with the hotel restaurant Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya and the outdoor Kanpai Garden in warmer weather. The seventh floor offers a nighttime club called Make Believe; on the Saturday afternoon that we arrived, with our room located just one floor below the lounge, the noise and vibrations were a bit loud. We were concerned that the raucous music would continue late into the night\/early morning, but when we returned from dinner at about 10:00 pm, it was surprisingly quiet. In contrast, there was no music\/noise on Sunday afternoon or evening, so perhaps the Saturday afternoon party was an anomaly. \n\nOur junior suite number 601 was spacious at 450 square feet. The entry foyer led to the bathroom, with separate glass cubicles for the toilet and the oversized slate shower, divided by a small sink\/vanity area that could be closed off by a sliding door. Note that the back of the shower wall faces the main living area in the room and contains a panel of frosted glass through which shapes can be viewed, so the shower area is not completely private. Across from the bathroom space was a wall with three adjacent closets; one held two cozy bathrobes (but no slippers), another held the minibar and safe, and another was empty with plenty of room to hang clothes and store bags. On that same wall, a built-in furniture unit included the desk (on which trays held non-refrigerated mini-bar snacks and full-size liquor bottles for purchase), and a long wooden bench suitable for holding luggage. (There was a tremendous amount of storage space and surfaces in this room.) Online, room amenities mention Nespresso machines in the rooms, but there was not one in ours. Our junior suite had a small living area (with sofa and coffee table) separated from the bedroom area (with a king-size platform bed [which was a bit low for us 50-somethings!] and two nightstands) with a hanging metal bead\/chain curtain. Large floor-to-ceiling windows overlooked the outdoor pool and Orchard Street. Room d\u00e9cor (including a unique lighted photograph headboard, glossy black wood floors, and black reflective walls) created a stylish, contemporary feel. The wall-mounted television could be angled slightly depending on whether you viewed it from the sofa or the bed. \n\nWe enjoyed our stay at the SIXTY LES; we like the area, and we liked our spacious junior suite.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

We booked a suite which was nice and spacious, nice wet bar with coffee machine (we later found out not all rooms have coffee machines).  The mini bar prices are truly ridiculous - like $60 for a $10 bottle of wine.  I am willing to pay a lot for convenience, but not that much.  The view is nice and the neighborhood is great.  The shared balcony was no better than a window, however. \n We had breakfast on site which was good, and had a few snacks in the sushi bar one night which were excellent.  So the first stay midweek was all pretty fine.  However, they also made us sign something at check-in saying we wouldn't bring any outside food or drink in.  I have never seen that before and I think it's unacceptable.  Can't bring home your leftovers?  What about your latte?  When we returned for our second stay on a Saturday we were a couple hours early and they understandably did not have our suite ready.  We went to lunch and returned at check-in time.  The room was still not ready and they said housekeeping was very behind and it could be another hour.  They offered us free drinks in their wild patio bar.  We were exhausted and needed to shower and nap before obligations that night.  About 45 minutes later they still didn't know when the room would be ready so my husband convinced them to downgrade us to a smaller room so we could just check into something.  This room had no coffee machine.  I thought this was poorly handled, they knew we were in the area and would want to check in on time, and we were already return guests that week which I thought would count for something.  And how long does it take to clean a room when you know a guest is waiting?  Finally I have to say I found the video in the elevator revolting.  Also, when the club is hopping the elevator waits can be long.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I stayed here for 3 nights in October and had a wonderful time.  It's important to note up front that, as a number of other reviews mention, this hotel can have a lot going on.  The club is very active (I didn't see inside, just the many people going in), and the overall party atmosphere can be strong in the public areas (at least on the weekend), so if that sounds off-putting, this may not be the place for you.  However, I found the atmosphere to be energizing and well managed.  The rooms are gorgeous and many of the views are spectacular.  I was lucky to get a King Suite with Terrace and it was very clean and well-appointed.  They nailed all the basics of water pressure, linens, bedding and the overall condition of the room\/furniture. \n \nThe best part of SIXTY LES, though, is the staff.  Oh my.  These people are top notch.  I was not so great at capturing names, but Josh was the manager on duty most of the time I was there, and he is fantastic.  Everyone at the front desk was awesome.  The bellhop team members were EVERYWHERE, and couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, and did everything with a smile and super positive attitude.

I\u2019m also laughing in my head at the fact of seeing a lot of other reviews commenting on the price of bar snacks. Pop chips were $7 a packet which is well over 100% mark up. They are taking the piss. The $10 credit on the daily mini bar just isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nWhat was worse was they stuck us in the room above the social bar which was pumping out bass until 4am. I found it funny how they could leave you a considerate note about being cautious with the transport around the New York marathon trail but not the noise from their own venue. Seems as though they value their tacky nightclub clientele who may only pay an entry fee over guests who spend hundreds of dollars per night for a room who could potentially return but in this case never! I\u2019m glad British air ways were able to supply me ear plugs where the cost of my flight was cheaper for a return then one nights stay at this hotel. \n\nThere was no information about pool closures when booking, and the hotel staff didn\u2019t notify us about sister hotels and their amenities.\n\nFront door staff were on point though, the doormen and cleaners were wonderful. \n\nI\u2019d never return. \n\nThey also never replied to my email about the noise from the social club. Let me mention one more thing. They put traffic cones in front of the entry doors at 12 to ensure their night club clientele don\u2019t enter the lobby. However the front desk staff think it\u2019s a great idea to blast loud music from a portable bluetooth speaker in the lobby sending mixed signals to anyone coming home for the night.

We had a suite on the third floor, street side. Pretty noisy, but that could have been fixed Here's what couldn't: You get a daily $10 credit for the minibar. Unfortunately one of the only things under $10 is a small can of Pringles, so really all the $10 credit would do is probably to encourage you to spend more that $10. In addition, there is a 10% restocking fee (come on!). But the worst minibar affront is yet to come: Their literature says that you \"may\" be charged an additional fee if you store your own items in the minibar.  I must admit in the 19% of the world that Trip Advisor says I have traveled that I never came across something that egregious. A few other tidbits: the sofa was worn and lumpy, actual stuffing showing on one corner of the ottoman. The bed was likewise worn and lumpy. The toilet was slightly off-putting as it is by itself in a small closet-like nook with a 3\/4\" thick frosted glass door.  In addition this was no ADA toilet, and was so low that it was hard to get on and off it. That was ultimately the deal killer for us, and I do have to give a shout-out to a very understanding manager that we spoke with who was kind enough to allow us to cut short our stay after just one night.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

A group of us stayed here for one night for a bridal shower\/bachelorette. We checked in around 5ish. All the rooms were ready but I think we had to change the name on them so there was some difficulty with that. I don't think it took too long to resolve though. The bellmen (Raul and Christian) were AMAZING and incredibly helpful. They were the best part of the stay. The housekeeping staff were also very nice.\n\nAside from them, everything was just kind of meh. Elevators take forever and you're packed in because of the bar\/club patrons. The pool area is small and gets packed early as well. For whatever reason, despite getting ice earlier in the evening, later in the night when my friend called down for more, she was told there was a charge for ice. Before she could inquire further, the guy hung up on her.\n\nThe main room we hung out in was a King Suite Terrace so we had a little outdoor area, which was quite nice. The view is amazing and it was sort of unique since that was the night of the blackout. But you could get views at other hotels too. There's nothing here that's particularly special.\n\nAgain, could be an age thing. I think when you're younger, you're more tolerant to noise, cramped quarters, and sassy customer service - the general partying lifestyle and being amongst the action. Which, is the vibe that SIXTY LES is going for. So in that regard, they're quite successful. (Except I think the pool area could be improved)\n\nIf you're looking for something more relaxing and chill, or if you've got a family with young kids, this is not your spot. I literally saw a guy walk out of the pool because a child entered and was too close to him. He looked at the child annoyed and walked out. Not saying that's the hotel's fault, but that guy is definitely the clientele they're marketing to and trying to attract - young, fun, partying, etc.\n\nNot my kind of hotel, but I could see others enjoying it.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"NONE"}

I must stress your attention this is my  first ever review on TA and the reason for this is that our experience was just terrible. We got there round midnight on a Friday.

Good! the room was on the 14th floor (as we asked) sorta stylish and with a nice view of LES and the rest of nyc although the room was tiny! The pool was a plus as well. We had a flood in our room and they could not do anything for us other than make us pay for drinks at the bar while we were waiting for the room to be fixed. They wouldn\u2019t change our room nor compensate us given the hassle we were going through. The front office manager was awful and indifferent to our situation.

I will start off this review by stating that if you are looking to travel to the NY area and are looking for a hotel with an outdoor pool this should NOT be one of your top options. Initially, my check-in process was very unpleasant. There were 2 woman (Sue and Doreen) who were working the morning shift at the front desk and displayed signs of attitude and annoyance. While my check in process was quick it seemed to be more of a \u201cgo away\u201d quick than positive customer service experience. I actually came back as I had more questions and that\u2019s then I was greeted by the lovely James, who is a hotel manager for the morning shift. Not only did he greet me with a smile but his customer service was top notch. He was able to answer all my questions and gave me such a warm welcome. Moving on to the amenities, i.e the pool. The first day of arrival, while exploring the hotel and waiting for my room to be ready, I witnessed that by 10:30am the pool is already packed and all, 15, of the chairs\/couches are taken. The pool area is very small so be aware. I specifically had a plan the next day, Saturday, July 6th, to arrive at the pool at 9:00am for the opening and secure a chair. This is where things went south. Upon arriving to the pool door at 8:45am I was greeted by a worker who stated the pool wasn\u2019t quite open yet and that they were awaiting the lifeguards arrival. 8:45am turned into 9:10am which turned into 9:20am and a line full of angry customers waiting outside the door. This is when I learned that Sixty Les Hotel outsources all of its amenities which allows the hotel managers and staff to state things life\u201cwe have no control of this situation\u201d. The pool, the club\/bar, the valet parking, and the restaurant are all its own entities and not apart of the Sixty Les brand. The lifeguard was an hour late and no one at the front desk could provide any clarification or explanation as once again \u201cit is not their problem\u201d and yes one of the hotel managers actually stated this and told us, the angry customers, to stop calling about the situation. While at the pool, be prepared for lots of kids\/families. It didn\u2019t bother me at all but seemed to bother other guests as there is a lot of splashing and playing going on around the pool. If you can tune it out the pool is actually a nice atmosphere. While the pool situation was very disturbing I will state the highlights of my trip. Starting with the Bellmen\/Guest Services employees. Christian, Raul and Brian were THE ABSOLUTE BEST. Not only did they help with parking my car on the street, as I was not paying $70 a day to valet, they were able to answer questions about the area and Raul was very knowledgeable about the best restaurants in town. We had a junior suite and the room was very clean with modern d\u00e9cor. I gave this hotel 2 stars because of the cleanliness of the hotel, and James, Raul, Christian and Brian (not the whole staff). I would not recommend staying here again as the overall experience I had was not one that I care to revisit.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I even called ahead to ensure there were no events etc as sometimes nyc pools get busy. The hotel assured me there were no events but when we arrived it was an absolute nightmare. First off, they put a $500 hold on your card for incidentals - even though we pre-paid for the hotel. We asked for a room on a high floor and were surprised when they also charged us $20\/night extra for it at the end of the trip. When we went to the pool it was overrun by a mix of partygoers spilling their drinks in the pool and kids screaming and doing cannonballs. To top it off there were no chairs left so we (along with about 30 other people) were forced to just lay out towels on the floor where people stepped over us. Apparently they sell day passes to the pool in addition to having hotel guests (which they failed to mention). The next day we showed up early, determined to get a chair, only for the lifeguard to be 2 hours late (pool opens at 9 and guests were waiting in line in the hallway until 11am). The rooms are small, and do not offer coffee in them (no machine, and not even cold brew in the mini bar). Also we spilled something on the bed before leaving for the day, and although the room was clean when we came back, the same stain was on the sheets leading us to believe they just made the bed without changing the sheets. Another guest I spoke with said the hotel charged her card $6k and it took three days of calls just to get them to admit it had happened. She also said she had a balcony in her room and someone above her kept dropping lit cigarettes down, causing burns on the furniture. All in all a total disappointment and not relaxing in any way. No real sign of luxury either, just a bunch of overpriced food and drink and a rude staff.

It's owned by Italian company Miss Sixty. However this hotel chooses to sell rooms (802 and others) directly above its lounge that plays hiphop and techno music until 2\u0430m, and it is LOUD inside the rooms - noise and vibrations. I fully understand that this is a hotel where some people come to party, where there may be noise from drunk patrons returning to their rooms, and street noise. BUT! I travel frequently in the US and overseas and have literally never seen a hotel provide a room in which you simply, structurally, could not sleep until 3\u0430m. Night staff was courteous but I didn't want to move to another hotel at midnight (and fight for a refund), and they could only move us to another room the next day. H\u043e\u0288\u0435ls T\u043e\u0272igh\u0288 gave us a compensation voucher, they were excellent! We reported our situation to the hotel's night desk clerk. When I approached the day clerk the next day, she was aware of the situation, courteous, and moved us. However there was no apology from her or from the hotel manager, or any attempt at a further gesture or accommodation by the hotel (typically at four and five star hotels, management sends a note and a fruit basket or something like that). I am sure kind words of Mr Nicholas will follow this review and he will offer to make it right next time if we only phone him before and request a quiet room. However, I would kindly remind him that a) it's not normal to have to phone a manager to book a hotel room in order to be to sleep before 3am, b) it's not normal in a first-world country to put people in rooms like that and then \"manage their complaints\", and c) the hotel actively, structurally chooses to sell uninsulated rooms on top of its booming lounge. No amount of courtesy or kind words can make up for the conscious business decision that they make, to put people in a room which fails one critical, mandatory feature of a hotel room \u2014 SOME ability to sleep at a regular hour. Kind words (parole, parole, parole\u2026) are meaningless when the hotel does this to people, day in and day out. The only way I could ever feel better is if the hotel told me that they had decided to create a new room category for those rooms and disclose in the OTA listings that those rooms are subject to some noise till 3am - many party people would be fine with that. \nPS the elevators and air conditioning are \"disobedient\", but those are things you typically encounter in refurbished older buildings in New York. Oh and the amentiy fee includes a $10 credit for the minibar each night, and the clerk \"accidentally\" didn't tell me when I asked what was included, until I specifically asked about a minibar credit.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Sixty had great pics, a good location, and the price is unbeatable.\n\nI don't know where all the complaints about service come from because I dealt with so many lovely helpful people the entire weekend.\n\nMy standard room was really big, and in NYC that's saying a lot.\n\nThe location of the hotel is perfection. So many yummy restaurants, bars, things to do. Having lived in NYC twice, it's an area not many tourists visit and truly coveted dining is all around.\n\nThe pool is small, yes. You can't complain about that in Manhattan. And yes, there were a few families with TOTALLY unruly kids but that's not the hotel's fault. BLAME THE PARENTS PEOPLE.

You have ZERO personal control over the temperature of your room. I have a feeling it is controlled at a building-level and the employees either don't know this or cant' divulge it. I like to sleep with a cool room and in a hotel I usually go about 69 or 70.\n\nDay 1- checked in- turned AC to 65 to cool the room down quickly and went to dinner. Came back. Room temp was at 67 and felt humid. Realized the A\/C unit was identical to Hyatt and Hyatt House Jersey City which I had the exact same issue with days prior.  Called maintenance, he came and told me it was working even though I explained that the fan was basically silent and no air was moving. I dont care if the wall feels cold. I care if the room is cold. He told me to turn the temp to 50. That's insane. But I did it and the room temp stayed the same all night.\n\nDay 2- Left the AC on 50 and went to the pool. Came back in the afternoon and room temp was at 77 and stifling. Had to open the door to the hallway to breathe. Front desk moved me to a new upgraded room.\n\nUpgraded room was lovely, massive, slightly cool but not ideal.

I declined bc i was checking out in 3 more hours. 7am hit, the AC started cooling down the room again.\n\nYOU CANNOT CONTROL THE TEMP HERE so if you want to stay in the summer, I would just be wary.

I was told on 2 separate phone calls that this would be no problem but I might not get the room type I requested. Cool! Happy to pay an upgrade fee or early check in fee, no foreseen problems. \n\nWhen I spoke to Eddy Griffin the on duty guest services manager this morning, he told me this was not an option and in fact they NEVER tell people that early check will be available. He also said the staff don\u2019t come in until 9 and the earliest I could check in is 1! I explained his staff didn\u2019t give me any indication of this possibility and his response was I TRAINED ALL THE STAFF PERSONALLY! I asked if they record the calls and to listen to yesterday\u2019s conversation to confirm the information that was given to me yesterday. \n\nEddy was rude, I have never come across a guest services agent that was disregarded me so much. After 30 min talking to he said he would contact the actual general manager (even though I had requested to speak with the general manager originally, but I was transferred to Eddy) and the woman I spoke with yesterday and call me back. He never called me back, nor did the general manager. \n\nCurrently sitting in the \u201crestaurant\u201d waiting for check in. This whole mess would have been avoided if they didn\u2019t misinform me prior to me making my booking - or simply cancelled my booking so I could find an appropriate hotel. It\u2019s Friday night in NYC and they could easily resell this room (it\u2019s only 8am!)\n\nLASTLY they have charged me $50 UPGRADE fee to switch from a KING to a QUEEN\u2014 someone tell me how that makes sense.

It was overall a good experience, and I would stay again in the future if the duration were two days or less (the reason why outlined later in this post). \n\nRoom: Nice with a good vibe, and the suite is perfect for three people. The bed being low didn't bother me. Thankfully (maybe due to the holidays) there were no parties or loud music. Their TV system is very slow for some reason. The free internet offered worked just fine for me, so I don't think it would be necessary to purchase their upgrade unless you're doing some heavy duty stuff. \n\nMy complaint: Like wtf is up with not having a coffee maker in the room? There is something really disturbing about doing that to a person.Thank God there was a coffee shop next door. I gladly went through the lobby and to the coffee place in my full on pajamas without any shame. A coffee maker is a La Quinta level amenity, so for the cost and presentation that this hotel is trying to give off, customers should not be tortured with no caffeine. \n\nThe $29 a day \"Experience Fee\": Must comment on this, since everyone is. Like most reviewers here, I think the whole experience fee thing is silly, but a lot of hotels are doing that now. My guess is they do this so that the overall cost per room appears cheaper when advertised online. Hotels should just stop doing this as a separate charge in general as it's annoying (and probably would save their staff a lot of time from having to explain \/ justify this to nearly everyone who checks in), but Sixty LES is not the only hotel that does this. Annoying yes, but something totally on them, not-so-much. \n\nBar \/ Restaurant: The bar with the view of the city is nice enough. I live in NYC so it's different for me, but I could see tourists from out of town loving it. I felt the Japanese restaurant was just average, but it serves until very late (2 am I think on the night we were there). A real restaurant serving so late is a plus.\n\nNeighborhood: A great neighborhood, and located across the street from the F train. It might be good for some to be out of the total tourist trap which is midtown. \n\nStaff: The doormen were excellent, and very friendly. Their demeanor was in total contrast to the receptionists who were a bit stiff (maybe tired of explaining the experience fee). They were professional, however, so this isn't a complaint more than an observation. \n\nOverall the hotel was pleasant, and I enjoyed my stay, but you need to be warned that they charge a really ridiculous $150 per DAY deposit. The first thing I asked was \"what kind of people stay at this hotel, and what the hell did they do that there has to be a $150 per day hold standard?\" Seriously, I would like to meet them. I wondered if other people thought the same thing. I have traveled all over the World, and stayed at 5 star hotels, and I have never ever been required to put down such a large hold. They should review this policy, because if you stay more than a night it can really suck for people especially if they are on a budget, but honestly even if you're not. This is why I would not consider staying there longer than two nights, because out of principle I will not have such a larger amount of money blocked from my card for 3-5 business days. It's absurd. \n\nTo recap: Rooms are nice, service is professional, the location is great and different than the usual tourist traps. Overall, I was happy to stay there, and would stay again in the future for no more than 1-2 nights as the deposit is outrageous, and my rockstar days are over.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I had friends who had checked in earlier and they were told the same thing for the king reservation that they had.  I don't believe that a plumbing issue occurred but rather they booked too many king rooms and planned to switch people to a queen upon check-in.  If I had not been late for something, I would have cancelled my reservation and gone to another hotel for the night.  They made no effort to accommodate me except to reduce the rate to the usual queen rate for the night.  Next time I won't give them the chance and won't bother to reserve a room here.  They also have misleading fees such as the \"experience\" fee just for being there.

I immediately contacted the FD to let them know and they would send an engineer up. It took about 20-25 mins to have someone come. They just looked at it and said they would be back. I called FD again to get some update and I spoke to a different person who wasn\u2019t made aware of the situation. I had to explain all over again. Finally got an update and they said that they were sold out that night but could move me tomorrow or give me a discount for tonight. I was only there one night so that move the next day was not a possibility. Another call sometime later and they said they may able to move me to one of their big suites due to the likelihood of a cancelation. \n\nAbout 8:30pm they finally let me know that they could move me to the two bedroom suite.

The price is decent, and it was a good jumping off point for a lot of the activities we had planned.\n\nFirst Impressions: The first night, we got in from traveling.  After a quick check in, we just wanted a meal and decided to try the sushi restaurant.  We didn't have reservations, but were seated at the bar and had a very nice time in a bustling place with good food.  It was a nice way to start our trip.\n\nLocation: The next day, we had some activities planned in the adjacent areas, and it was an easy cab ride to get to where we wanted; however we did have a few plans to go uptown.  I don't know if it was because it was a holiday weekend or just a regular weekend, but travel by taxi took some time.  With that being said, everything we did in the Village, SoHo, LES, and Chinatown was easy to get to from this location.\n\nService: The staff at the hotel was great.  Very professional and extremely helpful.  The doormen were always there to help whether it was getting a cab or helping us with the door.  One time I was bringing two coffees in and they immediately recognized my need and helped me with the door.  On Saturday night, I guess there is a club on the top floor, and they reserve an elevator for just club patrons.  Some of the young revelers were visibly inebriated and kept trying to get on the guest elevators and were like, \"Woooooo!  Let's ride this elevator!\" and the staff deftly guided them back to the correct elevator.\n\nRooms: The rooms, to me, were like staying in a nice apartment.  There was a practicality and elegance to the layout.  Not one bit of wasted space, thoughtfully planned, and all with feel of room and comfort.  I guess the last time we stayed here, my wife was unaware of a $10 mini bar per day credit that is built in to your room charge.  We decided to use our mini bar credit this time around, but on one day the housekeeping service came so late we decided to skip having housekeeping.  Since we skipped it, they assumed we used $20 of mini bar credits the next day and it showed up on our bill, and then we had to explain this upon checkout...it just seemed like a lot hassle.\n\nThe Bar: I liked the bar on the 2nd floor.  Once again, the staff was great and they make good drinks.\n\nOverall: Good location if you want to roam around the LES.  Right next to Katz's Deli, which is a plus.  The elevators can be a bit slow, but overall, a nice place.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was about an hour Lyft ride from JFK and as soon as we arrived, we were met with such great service, which continued all weekend. \n\nWhat we liked:\n* Service was attentive and fast. \n* GREAT location: The hotel is near tons of food options, from casual to fine dining, as well as shopping, groceries, pharmacy, bars. Everything was in walking distance and really added to the fun and playfulness of the weekend.\n* We had a tiny smidge of a balcony (standing room only) that is shared with all of your neighbors. Although it was small, it was cool to stand out there and watch. Just make sure you keep your door locked because the balcony is shared.\n\nWhat to consider:\n* There is a bar in the hotel and on weekend nights it can get loud depending on where your room is. At first we considered requesting a room change, but after a while it kind of added to the hum and vibration of the city.\n* The hotel room itself does show some wear and tear, which makes this place average. It's not any worse than any other hotel of this age. The difference here is that the initial design was so modern that it still feels up-to-date, there's just normal wear and tear.\n* The bathroom layout was not desirable and the material used for the doors was so flimsy. It's comical how difficult it is to turn on the shower and once you get it on, it didn't drain well. The bathroom is where you see the most wear and tear.\n* The pool is small and there are limited seats, but who is going to NY to swim? Initially we were excited about this amenity, but we sat poolside for about 30 mins before deciding to go explore the city.\n\nWe did not make a mistake by staying here as two young women looking to have fun in the city for the weekend.

They also could not take pre-payment from my credit card that I\u2019d booked it on upon arrival so we used a UK debit card instead to make deposit. They said no payment would be taken from my credit card as a result, but $295 was still taken from my credit card without approval. This was eventually refunded after 10 days but left us short for the rest of our stay in California. This type of place would suit people who enjoy the great location and don\u2019t expect to spend anytime in the hotel or speak to the staff.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Great area, with a New York feel, without the tourist tat. \n* Selection of drinks and snacks in mini bar BUT please see points below.\n* Facilities - bar, pool, restaurant. \n* Alarm clock has an iPhone connector.\n* Comfortable bed. \n* Effective air con. \n* Free bottle of water left in room each day (but don\u2019t confuse it with the mini bar water than is also left out and is listed on the mini bar menu!)\n\nNegatives\/ points to consider\n\n* Quite small room - fine if you don\u2019t have much luggage but we had 2 suitcases and we were clambering over them during our whole stay. \n* We arrived quite late from London due to a delayed flight and although the receptionist was polite, we didn\u2019t particularly feel welcomed. Check in was talking a while due to this being the first time we had used our bank cards in the USA - an offer of a drink, even just water, would have went a long way.\n* Bar attracts a really young crowd rather than hotel guests. It is really loud on the weekend. \n* Alarm, despite us not setting one, went off at 7am. \n* No tea or coffee facilities.\n* Perhaps the most frustrating for us and a real warning for others... they tell you on arrival you get $10 mini bar credit. We only spent this credit on 2 of our days (luckily!). We carefully checked our mini bar menu and it stated each item we wanted was $5 so we knew we hadn\u2019t exceeded the credit. They have actually charged us for the mini bar items and more (possibly tax but this was not identified on the menu and if so, incredibly sneaky)! We absolutely did not have any other items. We have contacted the hotel and surprise surprise... they are now ignoring us! Overall, a nice stay has been tainted by this error and their lack of customer service for previous guests. \n* We gave them a different card to charge but they also charged a card they told us hadn\u2019t been used or authorised. As it was our honeymoon, $295 out of pocket was a real inconvenience... they were already taking $150 per day for damages which took a week to be returned.

I will also say that it also encompasses some my preferences and personal issues that may not apply to everyone.  \n\nThe hotel is very nice and in a great neighborhood.  There are lots of really great places to eat and some good shopping.  We found it very easy to hop on  the subway and get anywhere, especially getting to Broadway to see shows.  We could easily walk to Joe's Pub to see a show and to the fashion district for shopping.  It was also nice to walk across the Williamsburg bridge and explore that area.\n\nThe staff was great!  Always friendly and greeted us as we came and went as well as offered any assistance.  Their friendly faces made me pause to complain, but if you are having issues you have give them a chance to fix it.  On a few occasions they did; like with hangers, top sheet and noise from the toilet flushing and cold water running.  \n\nI actually thought the noise level was good.  Usual traffic sounds outside and on the weekends a slight thumping came from the music in the club.\n\nWe made our reservations in advance and received an e-mail prior to our visit which allowed to check in early and add any upgrades or services.  There were no upgrades available, but they did offer a late check out at 2 pm for an additional fee.  We selected that option and it was verified at check-in.  However on the day of check out we received a call (12:15 pm, noon is normal check out) to see if we needed any assistance with our bags and when were coming down.  I informed them that we opted for the late check out and was asked who I spoke to at check-in.  I did not remember, but she allowed it.  I had my e-mail receipt for the option so I forwarded the e-mail and they confirmed.  We were okay to stay longer, but our keys had been deactivated. \n\nDuring the check in process via the e-mail.  I was asked if were celebrating a special event and I responded with \u201cCelebrating 18 years together\u201d.  They responded with \u201cWe will do the best we can to make this a very special birthday.\u201d  We did not receive anything special.  After we had a few things fixed (TV and Pipe noise), we were given a small bottle of wine and a nice note.\n\nThis review is getting long, but we did have a few issues with the Allen Suite:\n1. The bed had a sheet covering the mattress and then a duvet.  No top sheet.  I called to ask about this and was informed that this is how they do the beds.  I requested a top sheet and they brought one.  It remained on for 3 nights and then it was taken away.  I did not request a new one and tried to sleep with just the duvet covering us.  \n2. The next issue for me was the bathroom.  It was in the living room and had foggy glass walls, so if you have guest over, order room service or are a person that really like privacy it could be a little awkward.  The sliding glass door has a big hole in it (the handle) and there was a large gap between the wall and sliding door when closed, so both allowed the cold air to blow in or people to peep into the room.  It was pretty, but not ideal.  We didn\u2019t get a full sense of privacy.\n3. There were two stalls in the bathroom one for the shower and one for the toilet.  The one for the toilet was small like a restaurant or department store stall, except with a fancy foggy glass door and metal bar in the middle.  The metal bar was an issue,  You had to be careful when pulling up or down your pants otherwise you would hit your head on the bar.  I did that twice, so learned to maneuver things differently so I would not knock my self out.\n4. The closet in the bedroom was very small and only had a few hangers.  We requested some more hangers and they brought them up right away, so that was nice.\n5. Our TV was terrible especially in the living room.  We had to use the remote from the bedroom, but the TV would lose the signal or not come on.  We had to play with the with the wires to get it to work.  I did call about and they came up to fix it, but it worked okay for the that day and then went back to not working.\n6. The free wifi was very slow.  A 12 second instagram video would not even load or it would pause every 2 seconds.  It was like the old days of dial up.  I just used my data plan it was easy and faster, much faster.\n\nOverall a good hotel.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The lobby was very clean and quiet and relaxing.\n\nThe room was well-designed and provided some good amenities. The room was small with what looked like a full size bed. The best space for small the restroom was small and the living area was small. Now this may be something to expect since it is in New York's busy Lower East Side. \n\nI gave it three out of five because the bed was uncomfortable and lumpy. The hotel room near us or the bar below us probably allowed smoking because you can smell it in the room. And the walls were very thin.\n\nThe shower head was very nice rainfall Style. The bar setup was very useful with many cups to use. The complementary soaps and shampoos smell delicious. The bed was clean and so was the room when we arrived. The View was amazing and it was local too many shops and restaurants.\n\nThis was Hotel one of two from our trip so don't have much to compare to in New York. Comparing stay to other stays in other cities such as San Francisco or Washington DC.\n\nOverall I recommended a stay for couples only. This is not a comfortable room for a small family. That is not the hotels fault that is our fault. We made it work and it was a fun stay. ","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Christian met us at the door with a genuine welcome, Doreen checked us in and wished us a happy anniversary, and said that she would call when the room was ready. She was very sweet and pleasant, and made us feel welcome too. After an early brunch and a few hours in the sun in Washington Square we received the message that our room was ready. We made our way back through SoHo, got our bags and arrived in our room. I think it was classified as a junior suite queen, maybe. It was very nice, with a comfortable seating area, firm bed, great shower, two super soft robes, and all the amenities. A nice view of Allen Street with the afternoon sun was perfect for a well deserved nap.  We were always greeted by the staff we met in the elevators as well as the different doormen. Conclusion: A great staff is a reflection of good management. I called the hotel (Aneivah was so nice and helpful) to get the names of the front office manager and GM because I believe they are the key to our wonderful experience.

It was ok - It wasn't what I thought I originally booked, but it was ok for me. My husband on the other hand, was not too impressed. He called downstairs, and first addressed our check in situation with the manager and then requested an complimentary upgrade. They refused the complimentary part, but did allow us to pay for an upgrade. They sent up the bellhop (who was very polite, and considerate) to help us take our belongings to the next room.

We like this hotel as it is well placed for a good walk to pretty much anywhere.  The subway (Line F) is super close (100m) and is a very central line to get anywhere easily. The hotel rooms are well done and the room we had this time 1401 (?) was nicer than the one we had last year.  It is on the 'back\" of the hotel and was much much quieter! Two beds and a decent amount of space.  Ben @ the Concierge was super helpful as always. The Bellmen are well informed and can direct you where you need to go. \n\nAs we were leaving at different times (hubby\/us) I asked to stay a little longer.  We were offered an hour more.  May I just say that at 12:45 - 1:05 Housekeeping came past 4 times.  A few too many and talk about feeling pushed out!  A little unnecessary I believe and that is so easy to fix.  \n\nBe aware - when you check in a hold is placed on your card (standard hotel practice).  The hold is released after 4-5 days.  We checked in and then changed the card we wanted to use to \"hold for extras\".  Well - somehow - charged twice and - crazily - for the bill too (didn't use the second card that should have been recorded).  This, for a stay of 5 days can tie up some $$$ which is just on \"hold\".  \n\nApart from that - it's a great spot.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Everyone at the beginning was very nice and friendly (even the cleaning staff when we would run into them in the elevator).  I was really impressed by how the doorman and the front desk seemed very on top of things.  Doorman would recognize people coming to the hotel from the outside and make suer the door was open for them before they go there.  The first desk person when we checked in was slammed and still really nice and on top of things.  \n\nThe location is excellent and we were able to walk to nolita, soho, and chinatown, not to mention it's super close to Russ and Daughter's and Katz.  Also in reference to the internet. \n\nThere is free wifi, which is plenty enough to use social media and check emails is free in all areas (public areas and room), but if you want a higher speed wifi to stream video or something then there is a charge.  My only confusion with this is that when you do the free wifi it seems to go to a payment or confirmation screen for like 10 seconds and then quickly load another page. I was never able to see what the confirmation screen said and one time it loaded slightly slower and I thought it said I was confirming the paid internet? \n\nOverall everything was great until the last day where I felt like I was being told to leave as quickly as possible.  We had asked the night before if we could have late checkout and was told to ask at 8am and it's based off of first come first serve. We called 8am on our checkout day on the dot.  We were told the latest we could have is 12:30pm (original check out time is noon).  We wanted to grab something to eat really quick before taking our bags out and at 11:50am we asked if it was possible to check out at 12:45, just 15 minutes late.  Our flight had actually be delayed till 8pm and we weren't asking for that much longer in the grand scheme of things.  We were told that we can't check out 15 minutes later since house keeping needs our room ASAP.  Really this means that then we will check out immediately, and ask them hold our bags, and then ask them to get our bags in like the next hour (so more work on both of our parts).  It wasn't until after I said this that I got a maybe, but you have to hurry and come back immediately. We rushed and made it back at 12:25 but our keys already didn't work and we had to get new keys at the front desk.  Definitely got a unwanted feel on our check out day. In addition to this apparently there were bar charges to my room on a previous night. We never even went to the restaurant or bar.  I would have thought that the hotel employees would ask guests for the guest name and room number or check signatures or something to validate this.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's just not a professionally run or maintained hotel. First is the upkeep, even walking into the lobby, things are a little rundown, chipped paint, worn furniture, at least one elevator seemed to be out during our entire stay. Our room was no better. We stayed in a suite with a stained dirty couch, a flimsy thin mattress that was incredibly uncomfortable and a shower that leaked into the room at the base causing a puddle of water on the wood floor. The AC barely worked and when we arrived the room was hot and humid even though it was about 70 degrees outside and evening. \nThe hotel itself seems to split it's revenue between the hotel, the tiki bar and the large Blue Ribbon sushi. That means that there can be long waits for elevators, and bumping into drunks especially over the weekend. Not the greatest family environment. \nThat said, the lower east side is a nice place to stay, lots of new restaurants and coffee shops, and convenient access to Soho. \nWhat really spoiled our trip though was an encounter with one of their staff. My family got in the elevator after dinned to head up to our room. There were two employees in the elevator, the elevator sopped, one employee got off, and the other one stepped forward, I reached around to use my key to activate the elevator and get to my room only to have my hand pushed away and the employee say to me, \"don't try to override the elevator.\" I aid I was sorry, but I needed to get to my room and I had not idea what he was talking about. To which he replied \"I don't have to tell you, it's common sense.\" I again asked him what he was talking about and this time suggested he might be a little more polite with a guest. He grumbled something about \"if you don't like it..\" when I got off with my family and headed to the front desk to complain. The only response I got from them was \"I'll talk to him.\" No apology, although I detected from their reaction this was not the first complaint.\nIf a hotel is going to have a bar, and the employees are going to be frustrated by bar patrons, then they should make separate access, so that hotel guests are not treated like belligerent drunks when they are trying to get to their room.\n\nOver all, I like the neighborhood, but would not consider staying here again. Employees aside, the hotel is just not well kept for the price.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

TV didn't work and when they sent an engineer to my room he got it to turn on and lead to another disapointment that room didn't have the Yankees Game on! so nice engineer suggested I go to the sushi restaurant on 2nd floor and to my amazement the Yankees game was on in the restaurant so it made no sense I couldn't watch it in my $400 a night room smh.

They were very excited!\nOur room was clean and very comfortable. My eight year old enjoyed his robe immensely and we were grateful for the umbrella as there were a few sprinkles that day. The pool area was lovely and the restaurants looked enjoyable though we did not have the opportunity to try them out.\nCheck out was quick and easy.\nWe are extremely grateful to the staff at Sixty LES as about an hour after departing the hotel, our son realized he had forgotten his wallet (with $250 in cash and more in gift cards-all of his birthday money) in the night stand of the room. We went back to Sixty LES and they had found the wallet and returned it to our son completely intact. He was so relieved and happy as were we. The weekend ended on a perfect note and we are very appreciative of the extra mile that the staff of Sixty LES went to make everything so special for our family.\nThe location is great, the hotel is fun. Noise was not a problem in the least. We had a great time and will definitely return!","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There was some good, there was some bad...\n\nQuality - For the quality of the hotel, I thought it was pretty overpriced. Typically I stay at the Bowery or NY Edition. Those are both pretty pricey as well, but you definitely get what you pay for there. I didn\u2019t feel that way here at Sixty LES. I suppose you pay a premium for the pool they have on site. \n\nCleanliness \u2014 There was an old key card in the pocket of one of the robes. Obviously they\u2019re not cleaned after each guest checks out...\n\nStaff \u2014 The staff here are all very lovely and accommodating when you speak with them. \n\nRoom Service - This was by far the worst thing at the hotel and I think it\u2019s because the person taking your order is also the one running it up to your room. So for each order (I made about 4), it would take about 20-30 minutes for them to call me back so I could actually place an order. I\u2019ve never been to a hotel that offers room service and you have to wait that long to simply place an order. That said, the staff delivering your food are so nice so this isn\u2019t directed at their service, but how the hotel management staffs and conducts room service. \n\nTiki Tabu \u2014 Just okay. They were out of 3\/4 of the cocktails on the menu which was insane to me. Stock your bar, keep it stocked. The margarita I did get could have been much better. The crab rangoons were soooo yummy though. \n\nRoom \u2014 Overall the rooms were pretty big for NYC, but the bathroom itself was rather small. They were stylish too.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1128769,"title":"Worth every penny!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-07-24","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"I decided to splurge this year for my birthday and saw that Sixty LES was having 25% off some suites on their website and went for it. I was completely blown away. I ended up staying in the King Suite with a Terrace on the 15th floor, which was one of the corner suites. I didn't even realize when I booked the room that the bedroom would be separated from the living room, I thought it was one large space - This made it so much nicer to have my friends come up to the room and not see all of my personal items. In the living room there was a relatively large television, a couch with an ottoman, a large coffee table, a small eat at table with two chairs, and a wet bar. The prices of the in room items may seem expensive but it's New York City and a Luxury Hotel, so don't expect a $2 bottle of water. The waterfall shower in the bathroom was extremely spacious and there was a ton of counter space, as well as shelves underneath the sink to place items. There is a well lit mirror and another mirror that pulls out from the wall, which has a regular magnification as well as an up close magnification. In the bedroom, there is another large television and a king size bed. The bed seemed a bit low to the floor, just an FYI if you have a bad back, but was extremely comfortable and had amazing sheets. There were also two closets and a desk attached to the wall with a chair. The only drawer in the bedroom is the one at the desk, other than that you will have to hang up your items in the closets. There are two night stands, along with a radio suitable for older Apple products, but it does have an auxiliary cord! I forgot to mention that there is an additional closet in the hallway leading to the living room which has a full length mirror and also you can hide both televisions in the wall units they are placed in. The terrace is amazing, there are two lounge chairs with towels and a small table between them, along with a table with four chairs. You're not completely cut off from your neighbors but there is still plenty of privacy for you go out and sunbathe without being uncomfortable. I was located on the side of the hotel across from Hotel Indigo which has a rooftop lounge, so you can hear the music being played from their area. It honestly didn't bother me or my friends, but if you're looking for a quiet night that most likely will not happen during the summer. Unfortunately, there is not a light for the terrace so eating outside at night may be difficult. I know people have said before that lighting inside the room is an issue, but the switches have dimmers so you just have to get used that! The living room and bedroom have black out curtains, which give you tons of privacy and can help you sleep late without the sun bothering you. In terms of the staff at Sixty LES, everyone was extremely nice and welcoming. This didn't feel fake which has happened at other hotels in the city. They were genuinely willing to help no matter what time of the day or night it was. Room service, just like the in room items, will seem expensive but again it's New York. The food comes quick and is well made, FYI tip and a delivery fee are automatically added on top of the price of the food. Other amenities they have are the pool, spa, gym, some restaurants, and the rooftop bar. However, the \"rooftop\" bar is actually located on the 7th floor. It's a pretty cute and laid back place that has couches and low coffee tables rather than high top tables and stools. Since it was my birthday, I didn't personally buy any drinks, but I'm sure the pricing is similar to that of any rooftop in the city. The only negative about this is that it is located on a floor with guest rooms, so if you happen to be staying on that floor I'm sure there will be quite a lot of foot traffic and noise. Overall, the money spent was well worth it and I can't wait to go back! ","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Several encounters in the elevator with people going to or returning to the rooftop bar who were drunk and disorderly. The crowd at this bar is super cheesy - i would say mostly consisting of self-entitled brats. It's a shame because of the size of this hotel their presence permeates everyone elses experience. They take over the entire 7th floor, the lobby and the pool area. They are loud, rude and noisy. I have a feeling this bar was once cool but is not populated by people who think they are cool but are not. The 'scene' is definitely not the best thing to return to after a long day spent in Manhattan or Brooklyn. One night two guys in boat shoes were yelling at a female guest about how she was in their way  - the doormen did the right thing and kicked them out (they were bar guests) but still, imagine how safe she felt in that hotel. Definitely not a refuge. Definitely not relaxing. \n\nThe rooms themselves are OK. My friend had a larger suite which was nice. But I had a small room. It was VERY small. No closet space and the shower had very little ventilation so ended up smelling musty for a lot of the time I was there. Also - I couldn't switch my TV off which meant I slept (or didn't sleep) to a nice blue glow each night.

Uns hat der Stadtteil befallen, es gibt viele nette kleine Shops und Restaurants und wir haben nette Coofeeshops entdeckt und haben in einem Mini-Restaurant wunderbar Thai gegessen. Wir sind viel gelaufen aber dies tut man sowieso in NY. \nNun zum Hotel. Sehr freundliches Personal und wir hatten ein Zimmer in der 17 Etage welches einen wunderbaren Blick \u00fcber Manhatten bot. Die Fenster waren von der Decke bis zum Boden und gaben neben dem tollen Ausblick auch viel Licht. Die Einrichtung ist modern und es war ok sauber. Somit alles fein, doch das Zimmer war echt winzig. Um das Bett knapp Platz zum drumrum laufen und auch sonst kein Platz um irgendetwas abzustellen, Zwei Koffer irgendwo hinzutun ohne dar\u00fcber zu stolpern ist eine gro\u00dfe Herausforderung.

Scratched furniture and dangling cables is a big no no at that price point.\n\nI would say this hotel should not be charging more than $350 per night in my opinion.  So if you get it for under $400 its money well spent.  Over that, you might not be that impressed.   As you can see I have mixed feelings all based around the price.

It was my birthday weekend and I wanted to try something new! Big Mistake. The room description mentions a deep soaking tub which had me sold! No mention that it \"may have a tub\". Upon arrival we were greeted by the valet who offered to find our vehicle and park it for us, he also took our bags to the room. He was great! We reached the front desk and began checking in, we were so excited! We went right up to our room and were instantly turned off. The once cream sofas were now stained beyond belief, the carpet was also very dirty. Trying to make the best of it I threw my bag on what they consider a king bed literally on the floor and went to the bathroom to find no tub.. \nOnce I realized what I had paid and what I was receiving it made me quite upset. I contacted the front desk and was told someone would contact me. I waited..and waited. I called the front desk again and asked to speak with a manager and even read them my confirmation with the room description. The manager told me \"some of the rooms have tubs\" which is not clearly stated on their website. I asked if there was another room available but there were no more king suites. At this point I asked to be refunded and I would depart the hotel, the manager seemed almost frustrated with me and made me feel as if I had made a mistake and it was my own fault there was no tub in the room. She then said she would send me complimentary breakfast, I told her we had plans for breakfast as it was a getaway. She insisted almost which was kind, until the gentleman from the valet came up with two vouchers for complimentary muffins and orange juice. \nThis was very unfortunate, I will not return nor recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

These brands used to be quite good. A little bit low key, great service. They were kind of boutique-y before boutique hotels became trendy. I've stayed at several of their locations not just NYC but world wide. \nI never felt like a welcome guest at LES during my stay. The hotel looks dated despite being a relatively new establishment. The rooms are pretty nice. Very straight lines, no clutter. Housekeeping does a great job keeping them clean. I stayed here with my husband and we had asked for a single bed. We were given a room with 2 double beds and were told, again in that 'we're doing you a favor' tone, that the room we are being offered is bigger than what we booked so we should just say thank you. Apparently this room 5th floor corner room is a VIP room. There was constant construction noise. The noise from the street, Orchard I think, which is a very busy street with other hotels and bars, bothered me a lot less than the construction noise which started early and went all day. Also, it sounded like the elevator or some service corridor was along this room and there was continuous noise from that as well. \nI extended my stay twice. What was intended to be a 2 night stay turned into a week. The very last day I asked for a 2pm checkout instead of the 11am or 12 noon. I was met with such attitude at the front desk. I was told that if I VIP shows up, they will need that room. I work with VIPs, this is not a room I would put them in because 2 minutes wouldn't go by and I'd get a phone call that they want to move. While this hotel at one time was probably hip, the front desk staff does nothing to make you feel welcome. If anything you feel like they want you out as soon as you step in. \nIf it wasn't for the guys at the door, I would've had the worst time. They were the only ones that put a smile on my face every morning when I left, each time I came through the revolving doors. In particular, and I hope the hotel manager will read this review, Joshua was extremely nice. I wish I could have said thank you to him but he was off the day I left. \nThe bars (both the upstairs and Blue Ribbon's) make the worst mixed drinks, IF they can even make a mixed drink. I wanted bloody mary upstairs and they couldn't make one. \nI love sushi, so the fact that Blue Ribbon is in the hotel was a consolation. You can also order it to your room. \nAll in all, if you don't like the staff to be nice but are looking for a clean place, great location it's a great place to stay. It's also spacious for NYC standards.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel was kept clean and calm, something I always appreciate when there's a bar in the hotel as the lobby can get annoying, but the staff kept people moving and no one that was enjoying the bar interrupted my stay. The bar itself is very weirdly decorated and out of sync with the hotel - personally - but the views are amazing and I was able to catch some incredible sunsets there. I worked on a deadline from the hotels public spaces as well and no one seemed to mind which I always appreciate. Staff were young, polite, and well trained - too often young NY staff can be belligerent, but these guys weren't. Great location, with great staff, clean rooms, well stocked rooms, nice toiletries [which were replaced everyday although i was clearly 'stealing' \/ stocking up on them [thank you, housekeeping] with good wifi and a sushi restaurant on site [didn't eat in] and spa available too [also didn't use spa either, but a guy in Gucci loafers seemed very happy with it!] Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others.

Not by me.  My stuff was all in a room.  They said it looked like I had packed everything but, clearly I hadn't.  I had food in the room, my computer in the safe (oh don't worry, they got that out for me) and a little change on my nightstand (that didn't wind up with my stuff).

The staff was very accommodating and helpful... but the two bars in the hotel were again always full of a younger and pretty annoying crew. Location is great for walking and exploring, but if you aren't familiar with the Lower East Side and it's typical residents and scene, you should familiarize yourself with that first. Ate a divinely amazing dinner at Supper in the East Village not too far. Easy subway access makes location even better if exploring outside of the neighborhood. Oh, and our view from our balcony room (1500) was amazing... Best view I've ever had in the City- Freedom Tower, Empire State, Chrysler Building, and the Brooklyn Bridge. Our room was nicely sized, but I found that the design while trying to be modern seemed a tad cheesy. FYI- I recently stayed at the Sixty Nautilus in South Beach for a girls' trip, and their decor was on point as well as the entire property.\nOne suggestion I would make for this hotel is to have a separate elevator access for guests coming to the Tiki bar late night, as that was extremely annoying coming home at the end of a night out.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is beautiful, very trendy and typical of a NYC boutique hotel. The windows in the room were floor to ceiling with a great view of the city. I found the room to be bigger then average for NY, however the only mirrors in the room were in the pitch black bathroom. We had to sit on the floor by the windows with our tiny compact mirrors while we were getting ready. A few minutes after we got into the room there was a knock at the door. I must have paused for a second to see if it was for our room and before I knew it the door was being opened. I ran into the bathroom as I was in the middle of changing and my gf ran to the door which was already being opened by a staff member wanting to check our mini fridge. Are you kidding me?? We just got there, didn't even have time to make a drink if we wanted to and if he was checking from previous guests that should have been done before letting us into the room, either way, you don't just knock and walk in! We checked out the Tiki bar upstairs, really cute but we had plans and didn't stay for a drink. We did have dinner at the Japanese restaurant which was perfection, food and service were great. My other gripe is they hold $150 for incidentals, I've now been checked out of the hotel for 9 days and the charge is still pending.  \nI really wanted to give this hotel a higher rating but between the staff member opening the door and the charge that's still on my debit card I just can't.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The decor and furnishings were really modern and very well done. The door staff were excellent, really friendly and helpful.  And housekeeping did a great job.  We had a room high up that had incredible views.  The rooftop bar is great for a summer's evening and the views back over the city were fab, but unfortunately the beers were always warm, which is pretty disappointing on a hot day.  The hotel is in a great location, there are some fantastic local restaurants and bars and it's an easy walk (or subway if you prefer!) to soho or East Village.  \nLike many other reviewers on this site, I want to express our disappointment about the rooftop pool.  We chose this hotel specifically for the pool (and paid a lot for it!) as we travelled in summer and wanted the option of some rest days by the pool.  We had read about the habit some NYC hotels have of opening up their pool to locals, so made sure we rang Sixty LES to ask about this BEFORE we even booked. We were assured that the pool is for hotel guests only, however this was definitely NOT the case.  Almost every time we went to the pool it was overrun with locals, and we couldn't even get a chair most days.  Weekends were the worst (we stayed in the hotel for over 2 weeks), with people arriving at 9am and drinking all day.  The staff even served greasy food to one group INSIDE the pool.  They ate and drank in there and one guest with a small child ended up leaving because of their behaviour.  I don't have a problem with a party atmosphere, but I do have a problem with paying guests being unable to get a seat or enjoy time in the pool because of locals coming in for free.  Especially when the hotel assured us (and other TripAdvisor reviewers) that it is for guests only.  You cannot get to the pool without a room key or a staff member letting you up, so there is obviously an unwritten policy about letting locals in!  We tried to raise it with hotel management one day and get them to clarify the policy for us, but we were left waiting in reception for the duty manager for over 30mins and eventually gave up. If you're going there expecting to get good use out of the pool, I wouldn't recommend it.  Otherwise it's a good hotel in a great spot.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was also in a great location. Unfortunately that's where the positives end. As someone who used to live in NYC and work in the service industry, I realise it's different to other cities. But we're both well travelled and must say that Sixty LES was among the worst we've experienced in terms of customer service and overall experience. \n\nThe reception and hotel staff were non-communicative at best - until we were checking out. The elevators were an experience unto themselves with complicated buttons and a confusing and time-consuming system of getting to the gym and spa - only one goes there, but you have to figure that out for yourself as they won't tell you, even when you ask! \n\nThe pool - which is a big selling point in the pictures - is either never open or being prepared for, or closed for, photo shoots and private parties, which just shows a disregard for guests, who pay more than enough for the facilities. Or it's just full of people coming in from outside, as on the last day of our stay, when we were hoping to finally get some pool time, to no avail. When we asked the barman\/lifeguard if any beds would become free, he just said he didn't know. \n\nThe bars on the 2nd and 7th floors seem to just cater for outside clientele and guests do not seem welcome, including for our own pre-wedding reception drinks, which seemed to be disturbing the staff meeting, even though it was lunchtime and open. \n\nThe whole vibe in the place is just not geared towards making guests comfortable or welcome, which really shouldn't be the case. For the prices we were paying for a special week, that just felt unacceptable. A friend of ours was also stopped from coming into the hotel altogether in the middle of the day, which is just wrong. The room was also never really cleaned to a standard you would expect from a hotel like this, including the balcony, which was just left alone. \n\nThere seems to be a problem with the running, management or culture of Sixty LES which needs to be addressed if they don't want to lose guests. We heard other guests complain too, not least about the elevators, which are just plain confusing! Not a hotel to be recommended, in its current form at least!","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Make Maria an others not have to defend it, but be proud of it?\n\nThe rooms are tired and run down.  The TV is slow to work (the channels take forever to change, for example) and the gym is sub-par - small, outdated equipment wedged into a basement.  I was shocked to read that VegasGalB called it \u201ca great gym\u201d -- she must have very different standards that most people, or perhaps liked that there were three treadmills out of the total of five aerobic machines.  Fair enough.  But it\u2019s dark and cramped.\n\nFor exactly the same price, you can go around the corner and get a great hotel room in a hotel that\u2019s far better maintained.  My suggestion to management is to either get this hotel in the condition that it\u2019s price requires, especially given the ample competition (seriously, I just ducked into the nearest hotel to ask their prices and inspect a room and the gym, that\u2019s how I made my decision).

Ma su questo si poteva soprassedere perch\u00e8 appunto, siamo a NY. Purtroppo per\u00f2 si sentivano anche tutti i rumori ALL'INTERNO dell'hotel, dagli ascensori, al cane di un altro ospite che abbaiava in continuazione, alle porte che si chiudevano\n2) Sempre in tema privacy, non ci era stato detto che la nostra suite comunicava con la suite accanto tramite una porta che non siamo del tutto convinti fosse chiusa la prima notte e attraverso la quale si sentiva distintamente ogni parola pronunciata dall'altra parte. Super creepy\n3) Le foto dell'arredamento che si vedono su internet sono assolutamente vere, ma corrispondono all'aspetto delle stanze pi\u00f9 o meno 10 anni fa evidentemente, perch\u00e8 i mobili sono rovinati, usurati, sporchi e vecchi. Non \u00e8 stata fatta alcuna manutenzione, comprese le macchie di umido sul soffitto. Decisamente un brutto effetto che non si riesce a rendere in foto ma che in vivo non \u00e8 particolarmente piacevole.\n4) La camera era essenzialmente sporca. O meglio, la pulizia giornaliera veniva effettuata con una certa accuratezza, niente da dire alle cameriere, il bagno veniva pulito bene etc, ma i vetri erano lerci, c'erano macchie di sporco incrostato sui mobili, gli angoli non venivano puliti da anni, insomma mancava una pulizia generale di base\n5) Gli accappatoi forniti sono minuscoli! Andavano bene per una donna di corporatura media, ma non certo per un uomo medio! Inoltre \u00e8 capitato (non sempre) che gli asciugamani forniti giornalmente fossero sporchi\n6) Non scegliete questo genere di stanze per il terrazzo, \u00e8 sporco, minuscolo e francamente un po' inquietante\n\nOra i pro\n1) La posizione \u00e8 letteralmente fantastica. Vicinissimo a una fermata della metro F (2d avenue) al confine tra LES, Nolita, East Village, perfetta per muoversi a piedi nella lower Manhattan. Un sacco di nogozietti, locali per bere e posti per mangiare proprio sotto l'hotel, c'\u00e8 ampia scelta. Zona sicura anche di notte, c'\u00e8 sempre pieno di gente e di ragazzi che escono.\n2) Il personale \u00e8 sempre stato gentile e disponibile (anche se mi ha stupito che nessuno ci accompagnasse in camera la prima sera, inusuale, ma non \u00e8 stato un dramma)\n3) il bagno della stanza era effettivamente molto bello e grande, con un minilocale per il water, e un'altro per doccia e vasca enormi\n4) anche la stanza era effettivamente molto grande per gli standard newyorkesi (sospetto che il costo della stanza sia esclusivamente a pagare questo aspetto)\n5) La vista effettivamente \u00e8 interessante anche se lo sarebbe stata sicuramente di pi\u00f9 da un piano pi\u00f9 alto (eravamo al 6o piano di 15) \n\nLa connessione wifi \u00e8 gratuita senza psswd a low speed, costa invece 15 dollari (per mi pare 5 dispositivi) se volete l'alta velocit\u00e0\nAbbiamo avuto un problema con il riscaldamento la seconda sera perch\u00e8 usciva solo aria calda ma ci hanno mandato un tecnico che ci ha fornito un'efficiente stufetta.

When we checked in at 5p the front desk clerk said our room wasn't ready. He said since we booked a Queen Deluxe and the room wasn't ready he would upgrade us to a Studio King. I informed him I booked a Studio King and this was not an upgrade. For whatever reason this was too complicated for him to comprehend and I had to show him my email confirmation that stated the room category I booked. Since the room wasn't ready he offered to buy us a drink at the bar while we waited. A nice gesture however the front desk clerk said it would only be about 20 minutes and he would call me when the room was ready. An hour later, no call, I had to go back down to the lobby and ask for the room which was now ready. \n\nThis was a special occasion and since I could not make any comments on the Jettsetter website I called the hotel ahead of time to confirm. The desk agent said I was confirmed for a Queen Deluxe. I had to correct her, she acknowledged the change and noted that I was requesting a high floor. It was rather frustrating that I had to go through this process twice, once on the phone and in person and not get a high floor as requested. \n\nThe hotel has cement ceilings and hard wood floors so it's very loud due to the lack of sound absorbtion. You will hear everthing in the hallways from you room as well as the floor above you. I live in Brooklyn and I'm used to city noise but this seemed louder than normal. Additionally there was some sort of alarm\/notification coming from the hallway all night. \n\nI will not be staying at your property again or recommending it to others.

After this weekend here, I won't be coming back. \n\n My fianc\u00e9 and I came here for a mini staycation (we live in Brooklyn) to celebrate our engagement. Similarly to other folks who've provided negative reviews of this place on Yelp and Tripadvisor, we also came across the issue of having been told we were being \"upgraded\" to a room we had already booked AND had pre-paid for. \n\nEarlier in the day we had even called to confirm that not only was our room ready, but our request for a high room with a view had been granted. The \"upgraded room\" we eventually got had no view and was on a low floor where it was really noisy.\n\nBecause a room wasn't ready when we arrived at 5pm, we were given a voucher for the bar upstairs - a nice gesture, but unnecessary because we were having to wait for a room we had already booked and paid for AND had confirmed via phone. \n\nWe were also told that our room would be ready in less than 20 min. Clearly the voucher was meant to distract us from the fact that the place didn't have it together because by 6p, our room STILL wasn't ready. \n\nIf you're paying to stay at a location like this, you're hoping to get the most out of your time there - that's hard to do when the room isn't ready until evening. The couch in the room was gross and through the night there was a crazy loud alarm noise. \n\nBasically - we wish we had read the negative reviews BEFORE booking here because they are exactly the issues we ran into at this location. When interacting with folks at the front desk, there was no eye contact, no friendly service, and it seemed they were annoyed by guests' presence. ","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

But disappointing facilities and ambiance","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2015-11-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"I travel to NYC a lot and I usually stay at hotels in the midtown area or around Times Square. This time around, I decided to check out the Lower East Side and picked the Sixty based on the pictures and descriptions on their website and reviews on tripadvisor. \nBased on what was shown on their website I was expecting a chic, modern hotel, with a trendy ambiance, nice bars and a large, happening lobby seating for socializing. I was terribly disappointed that the hotel did not live up to the pictures on their website. For the same room rate charged by the Sixty, one can fine other hotels in midtown, greenwich or times square that offer bigger rooms and more lively ambiance. The hotel is located on a small side street and you will almost miss the entrance to the hotel if you are not carefully looking out for it. The lobby area is tiny (felt like less than 300 square feet) and dimly lit. The lobby staff is friendly and attentive. The room I stayed in was tiny compared to  the rooms in hotels such as Marriott (times sq) and Novotel. the decor in the room was nice and I liked the modern bathroom with rainforest showers). The walls are soundproofed well and I could hear conversations happening in the next room and street traffic. The \"rooftop bar\" as advertised on their site isn't really a rooftop bar since it is located on the 7th floor. The  bar is in a closed room (on has to open a door to enter the bar and the inside of the bar is not visible unless you open the door) and the city views from the bar are good but not spectacular. Given the abundance of popular dive bars in the LES area, the bar at the hotel was almost empty on two of the three nights I stayed there and on   a thursday night, it was filled with a huge crowd of what looked like freshmen from NYU. \nI did not try the Sushi restaurant or the breakfast since there were other nicer places in the neighborhood. If you are into listening to live music or clubbing, the hotel is close to a bunch of popular LES dive bars and clubs (mostly filled with NYU students and hipsters). Overall, while my stay was pleasant, I was expecting a more lively and happening hotel full of chic upscale travelers and revelers. If you are a couple, family or a business traveler looking for a quiet hotel then this is the place for you.","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

In most interactions I've had with front desk employees here, they have been dumbfounded with any complaints that require any sort of ingenuity or creativity to deal with...

I thought it was going to be a huge downside but once we stepped into the room, it didnt even matter! the view was GORGEOUS and im sure it would have been nicer being higher, but we had a corner view with clear shot of the freedom tower and to the right was the empire state building. At night, we did hear a little commotion and music coming from the bar but nothing too crazy though im sure there are nights when it could be much rowdier. Overall, the room was spacious, clean (we came back every day to a freshly cleaned room), beds comfy, top notch amenities and room service was quick. The only thing i didnt understand about room service is that they already automatically charge the 20% tip however, when signing the receipt, it gives you an option for ADDITIONAL tip which is weird but i guess that is the standard for NY. anyway, blue ribbon sushi was amazing (and extremely overpriced IMO), drinks were nice and strong but even if nothing else went well, the view alone was worth it with floor to ceiling windows. Going to sleep and waking up to that view took the cake! Outstanding hotel. Definite recommend!","travelDate":"2015-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Great poolside service \/ food - quite a party atmosphere and gets pretty crowded so perhaps not the best if you want some R&R (although not sure why you'd be looking for that in NYC!).  We were lucky enough to be allocated room 1700 - the reception staff told us the view was better then that of the Penthouse... it was incredible - dual aspect windows and a balcony that went around both sides of building provided an exceptional view of Mid-town, Financial District and everything in between.  Hotel and rooms finished to a good standard.  We weren't there long enough to sample onsite restaurant.  Briefly made the bar which was lively, good buzz.  Overall, would highly recommend - ask for 1700!  Never one to return to hotels but would seriously consider it.

I reserved a King Deluxe room because I saw that they had balconies.  I called the hotel to double check and was told that yes, all King Deluxe rooms had either shared or private balconies.  I requested for a private balcony.  Upon checking in, I was told that I was upgraded to a Studio King as no King Deluxe rooms were available. The Studio Kings did not have balconies. I explained that I requested for a King Deluxe with a private balcony, specifically because of the balcony.  The woman at the Front Desk seemed to be offended that I didn't want the upgrade.  I explained that it wasn't about the room size but the balcony.  They offered me a higher class room with a balcony, but was asking me to pay an additional $250.  Unfortunately, I didnt get the name of the girl.  Her supervisor also came over and both of them made me the same offer, I take the upgrade or I pay $250 for a room with a balcony.  I explained again, that I never wanted the upgrade, I chose the hotel and the room because I wanted the private balcony.  This whole discussion went round and round until finally, exhausted from a day of travelling, I just took the room they were offering.\n\nNot all guests will jump at an upgrade, sometimes we want the room we reserved because of the features that it offers.  Dont make us feel like we owe you for upgrading us, especially when we didnt ask for it.\n\nFurthermore, I think that they \"discriminate\" against plus sized guests or maybe they're just saving money.  I am a size 14 and the robe was a size 8 at best and were way too short  The towels are short and were barely long enough to wrap around me and were rough and seemed of low quality.  For the price of the rooms, you would think they'd have enough left over to have bigger size robes made? What do male guests do?","travelDate":"2015-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

What an amazing hotel. We were travelling to New York as part of our 3 week honeymoon and had emailed the hotel a few months back asking if it was possible if we could have a room higher up as we had seen from the reviews to enquire with the hotel. We were so amazed to be on the 17th floor in a corner room with an amazing view of the city through the wall of floor to ceiling windows. Such a treat! You get to see the most amazing sunset also. The hotel also very kindly brought up a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon! We went to the Tiki bar on 7th floor on our last evening for a few early evening drinks which is a great setting with views overlooking the city. I was quite disappointed that i requested a mojito being told we could order any cocktail we like but the bar didn't have any mint so couldn't make one for me. I still find it a little hard to believe that there was no mint anywhere in the hotel (i.e. restaurant etc!) but it wasn't a big deal. The lower east side is a great area to stay. Myself and my husband had both been to New York on several occasions and had always stayed near midtown so it was great to stay somewhere without the tourists and more local. Being from London we absolutely loved the area - with so many cute bars and restaurants on your doorstep to choose from. It was a perfect area for us in our late twenties\/early thirties and would recommend it to anyone of a similar age or prefers being out the way a bit. There is a subway station across the road and it's easy to walk around so absolutely no problems with getting around.

After alot of research we chose this hotel as we wanted to explore the LES and the chance of a balcony was perfect for my partner who likes to have fresh air. Prior to arrival there were a few issues that concerned me firstly an email was sent to everyone who had booked, showing all guests names and dates of stays, secondly I was sent an email offering a paid upgrade to a room I had already booked!!! perhaps I should have had a rethink at this point. I emailed the hotel to see if there was any chance of an early check in as we were on the red eye from San Francisco and was told it would depend upon occupancy, which is fair enough and only to be expected.\nWe arrived at 10am and were checked in by a very nice lady, who was apologetic that the room wasn't ready but we could go to the pool and she would come and get us if room was ready before three, at three we went back to reception and another lady told us our room would not be ready until 4, by this point being very tired and beginning to be a bit fed up, we were given 2 drinks vouchers and went to wait in the bar, back to reception at 4... another lady and still no room, deep breaths and lots of assurances that the room would be worth the wait and housekeeping wanted it to be spotless, don't get me wrong all very pleasant and not front desks fault, but we just wanted our room and a shower, finally at 5 we got our room, now here is where I wanted to say we were blown away by the amazingness of it all....OK the view Awesome, the room OK, the balcony a mess, dirty, impractical the door was soo heavy and opened on to the balcony, neither of us felt safe on it, if it hasn't been cleaned for months (see pictures) when was it last maintained? But the room was like I said OK and you are in an amazing area of NYC so the rest of our stay was fine, all the staff we encountered were friendly, we didn't eat in the hotel purely as there was so many other places in the area to try, so this is where my review should have ended possibly with 3 or 4 stars. however on our 2nd to last afternoon we went to the pool, which is very nice, only to return to our room for the key not to work, so I went to the front desk to be told by a man infront of other guests that both my cards had been declined and he had decided to lock us out of the room as he hadn't been able to contact us, so feeling embarrassed and furious, I went back to the room to tell my partner, get our cards and go back to reception. Again he told us and anyone in the vicinity that both our cards had been declined, he spoke to us like idiots like we didn't understand, yet we knew one card prepaid, had been authorised for the stay and another for the incidentals, both of which had adequate balances. We suggested he tried the credit card again, which miraculously now was fine and explained that the prepaid was showing the total stay as authorised and was ring-fenced, so just required their bank to finalise it, we also pointed out the bank holiday, he finally admitted that neither card had been declined. When we asked him who has authorised we be locked out of our room without trying to contact us he claimed he had, well no email contact, no missed calls on our phones or in the room, not even a note under the door. We asked to speak to a manager he gave us a name but said she wasn't there, we asked for all details of the conversation be passed on so she could contact us the next day, this didn't happen. The following day we spoke with Catherine and she and Sasha provided the apology that was all we wanted for the dealing of the situation, we were happy with this and the other gestures that they made were appreciated, however all these things mean we would not choose to stay here again when there are so many choices in manhatten. Again I think it is only fair to reitterate that most of the employees we encountered were helpful and polite especially Catherine, who ensured the mistake was cleared up and a special mention to Canise who was always helpful and seemed to spend her time firefighting guest issues.","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Location is very good. Never checked out the pool or the restaurant so I cannot comment on those aspects of the hotel. \n\nNow for the rest. We live in Manhattan but wanted a place to stay for a night out on the LES. Chose this hotel as we have stayed at Thompson hotels in the past and had no issues. I knew this was under new management but decided how bad could it be, it was only for one night. \n\nCheck-in -- fine, you will have to wait pretty much until 3:00 but that is the deal coming in so I cannot complain about that. The attitude of the front desk I could do without. When you stay at a nice hotel like the Mandarin they people who work there are extraordinarily nice. Here they make it feel like you are bothering them. Lose the attitude please, you do not work the line at a club, this is a hotel though reasonable people could be confused when you see the lobby at midnight and have to push through the mass of bodies to just get to an elevator.\n\nRoom -- its fine, but very rough around the edges.

Shower is very good but everything else is so so. \n\nNoise -- again, being on Allen you expect a certain amount of noise. But the AC is unbelievably loud, and the noise from the other guests is out of control. Again, remember, this is a party hotel. Very thin walls.\n\nFood and beverage credit -- pretty limited -- drink at the pool or the club. Tried to see if we could use our $30 for a coffee to go but told no. We never ended up using the credit.\n\nCheckout -- fine, uneventful.\n\nMystery charges. This is where the fun comes in. Noticed an additional charge to my card. Tried calling. Placed on hold for 10 minutes, then said I would be transferred to someone who could assist. Placed on hold again, then disconnected. Called back asked if the person I was speaking with could help me, she said yes. Asked my name and then said one moment. Put me on hold again for another 15 minutes, after which I hung up. I will simply dispute the charges through my credit card company. Never did find out what the charges were for.","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Am an NYC resident, but was using the hotel as a bridge while waiting for my new apartment to be ready.   Booked both times using HotelTonight so got a pretty good deal.   Was upgraded both times to a king deluxe room, which has a small terrace as well (is kind of weird as there are no dividers on the terrace between rooms, so someone could walk by your room should they desire, however I did not notice this happening).   Check-in was fairly smooth, 1st time it took them 10 min to get the room sorted out, but the 2nd time it was seamless.   The room itself is spacious for a NYC hotel with a good-sized bathroom, including a spacious rain shower.  Would be nice if there was a hook in the bathroom for a robe (there are robes in the room).  Well equipped mini bar (I don't usually use, but nice to have it there), free wi-fi (though the free option is fairly slow, really only good for emails, basic web surfing).  Was a fair amount of hall noise, but I was able to partially cover it up by running the HVAC fan on low.   Some street noise, but nothing too serious, again the white noise from the fan helps.      Rooms were fairly well maintained overall.   I believe there is turn down service, but I did not receive during either stay (not a huge deal, and I did not make a special request).   No free water, but NYC tap is fine.  Nice outdoor terrace tiki bar on the 7th floor (though if you are on the 6th floor you can get some music noise from the bar), gym is decent, didn't use the restaurant, but is supposed to be very good.   Would definitely stay here again at the right price - nice option if you're interested in LES nightlife and restaurants - much more interesting area than times square where most tourists stay.    \n\nStaff was pleasant and helpful as well","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

We were told it is likely that it is made up but still in sofa mode.  Opening the sofa bed, we found a mattress covered in crumbs but unfortunately still not made up.  Also the cushions on the sofa were stained and dirty.  We called reception and they sent someone up. They brought us up other cushions but they were also crusted in food stains.  We then had to make the bed up ourselves.\n\nIn the bedroom there was very little light because the bulb wasn't working so someone had to come and replace. \n\nWe were offered another room but by this time it was already over an hour and a half since we had arrived and nearly 1am so decided to stay in the room we were in. \n\nI have to say that apart from these things the room was great and a bonus was having a balcony overlooking the street. The room we had had a lovely big bath also. The shower separate shower had  an overhead rain shower and also hose.  Unfortunately, the hair dryer didn't work. Really nice touch was the REN products.  \n\nThe hotel arranged for the room to have a deep clean the next day and all was great with the room.\n\nThe hotel pool is very disappointing.  Yes, it was early August and so busy but it was so over crowded with every sunbed taken and we counted 15 people laid around the walkways which in this very small space made it difficult to walk around.   On eventually getting a bed we listened and watched the crowd.  The majority of the occupants (approx 70%) were local New Yorkers, who treat this as their local public pool.  Even talking to people around the pool, they openly explained they weren't staying at the hotel.  Laughably they come with backpacks with changes of clothes and big shopping bags.  We complained to the hotel and they explained they used to sell places round the pool but stopped this. Clearly this hasn't worked, people in NY know this facility is available and take full advantage.   It would be really simple if they asked people for their room number and name when they came into the pool area or to take towel out you need to show your room key and only food and drinks were charged to rooms etc.   \n\nThe pool area was so busy that on 3 of the five days (had to sit on the floor and wait for a sunbed to be available) when we did get a sunbed, we had to go into the little storage room at the side and hunt for towels and sunbed covers, then change the beds ourselves.  \n\nThis is a real selling point but is something that you can't utilise unless you stalk for beds or wait until the sun has left the pool area.  We accept if is full with paying guests but not people who are walking in off the street.   It was so frustrating.  \n\nThe in-house Japanese restaurant is great.  The barman (native of Japan) is very friendly and informative, he recommended the special Bloody Mary with a twist - one of the best cocktails we have ever tasted.   Really would love the recipe.    The food is beautiful and the breakfast were the most amazing pancakes - they were as light and fluffy and get the medal of best pancakes we eat during our month in the US. \n\nHotel is in a great busy neighbourhood, perfect for exploring Lower East Side and the subway is right across the street. Allen street and Hudson is a busy cross roads so you do get road noise in the lower level rooms but you expect that as the soundtrack when staying in Manhattan.  My mother stayed in a room on an upper floor and that had no noise but she didn't have the luxury of a balcony so have to say I preferred our room. \n\nOn leaving the hotel to go to the airport was asked the hotel to arrange a larger taxi because we were  3 adults, 2 children and 5 large cases.  When it arrived it was just a normal minivan 4 seater.   The doorman said don't worry just squash in and 1 of the kids can sit on your knee.    When I challenged this he said that all should be wearing seatbelt but if we wanted another taxi it would take a while to come - didn't make sense as he was the one trying to squash us in.  What was the point of giving them notice to arrange a taxi for us?  \n\nI was looking forward to staying at Sixty LES and it was let down by things that are so simple to get right.  It was very disappointing except for the main restaurant and their staff and the concierge\/reception staff.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I found Sixty LES and decided to go for it--it looked modern and nice without the ridiculous price tag of places in Midtown. Not knowing NY at all, I hoped the neighborhood would be OK.\n\nWe lucked out with the location! We loved the Lower East Side. Fun places to eat and drink were just minutes away--we never went to the same spot twice. The F line on the subway is literally across the street from the hotel. Don't be afraid of the subway! We bought unlimited rides for 7 days and easily paid for the passes even though we were only in town for 5.5 days! \n\nThe hotel\/room itself was nice and sleek looking. We got a Queen Superior room and it was much larger than I thought it would be! Loved the way the room was set up! We mentioned it was our anniversary and they had a letter and chocolates set out in the room for our arrival! All of the workers were very polite--both at the front desk as well as the doormen. Everyone greeted us with a smile whenever we came and went.\n\nThe reason it's not a 5 star review is that there were some noise issues...the first two nights I wore earplugs because we could hear the people next to us talking very loudly late at night. The 4th night we actually had someone complain about OUR noise level and someone came up to tell us we had a noise complaint (really? We had the TV on LOW and we were simply talking before bed--nothing loud at all). The rooms are certainly not soundproof so that was the only negative thing. We talked to a family staying there who felt very awkward about the frosted glass shower situation (you can sorta see into the shower from the rest of the room--frosted glass is all that separates you), but as a couple staying there we obviously had no issue with that. \n\nI would highly recommend this hotel and the whole LES in general! I feel bad for the people who spend their whole trip in Times Square and don't venture into the other neighborhoods--there is so much to explore beyond Midtown!!","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The pool area is perfect when the kids want to bathe on a hot day. The room had big windows, air conditioning, comfortable beds, separate toilet and shower with a wash basin, mirror, hairdryer etc in between. Plenty of room for a family of four getting ready to go out.\n\nThe area (Lower East Side - LES) is, like the hotel, very trendy and young. But we never felt out of place - we liked the vibe! Finding nice restaurants where we could have breakfast or dinner wasn't a problem. There is a very nice restaurant in the hotel as well, but we liked to get out and explore the surroundings. Try the Sugar Cafe just a few steps from the hotel if you like pancakes and fresh fruit or omelets for breakfast.\n\nBut I'd say that the best thing with the hotel is its staff. They where fantastic and made us feel at home! Even though we had already checked out on the last day of our stay, they gave us access to the pool and the spa while we where waiting to go out to the airport. So we could take a swim, shower and change clothes before we went to the airport in the evening which was great on this hot summer day. A perfect ending to a perfect stay!\n\nAnd yes - there is free WiFi. It works great for Facebook, mail and small stuff. If you want more bandwidth (for working) you can get it for an extra fee of $15\/day.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was surprised that under that circumstance, the hotel did not have a reciprocal arrangement with its sister hotel, Sixty Soho, that would have given us access to their rooftop bar.\n\nThere was no coffee machine in our room, leaving as choices, a trip two blocks away to Starbucks or the high cost of room service.  On a related note, ice was not readily available to guests.  To secure ice, you had to call down to the desk, and of course wait for hotel staff and the inevitable tip to the young person who brought the ice.\n\nI was expecting a hip, twentysomething atmosphere at the hotel, which we never found.\n\nTo be fair though, the hotel was clean; the staff was polite; and the location, just south of Houston Street, was great if you wanted to go to Katz' Deli, Russ and Daughters, Litle Italy, Chinatown and Greenwich Village.

The lobby is cool and stylish, with the staff polite, helpful and well presented. We arrived early, but they were able to accommodate us, giving us a room that was to our exact specifications that we asked for when we booked in that 'additional comments' bit that I always figured got ignored.   \n\nThe room itself was on the 17th floor, and we had views all the way from the freedom tower (financial district) to the empire state building (mid town). The windows are floor to ceiling running along the entire length of the room, and the shower was definitely big enough for 2 people. The room was bright, clean, modern and the bed very comfortable. They even supply an umbrella, so don't bother packing one like we did- save the suitcase space for walking shoes!\n\nAs early risers we ate in the Blue Ribbon restaurant for Breakfast- pricier than going elsewhere but the coffee there was LUSH, and the food more than you could eat in one sitting. The staff member who served us each time we ate there was friendly and relaxed- ideal for early mornings.\n\nThe pool loses sun in the afternoon from about 4pm, so you need to get there earlier if you want to tan, but we enjoyed the quiet shaded pool side most afternoons after exploring with a beer in hand and a chat with the lovely bar staff member Charlie, who listened to us tell him about our day and suggested places we should visit and eat. \n\nThe hotel is situated right in the heart of things in LES, with bars, restaurants and boutique shops on your door step. It's also a stone's throw from 2nd Ave subway station- handy.\n\nWhen we checked out, we were able to leave our suitcases with the hotel, enjoy a morning of adventures and then return and use the hotel's spa to shower and change before our flight back to the UK.

I was given another room begrudgingly.... the internet was beyond SLOWWWWW.... and we were charged even though i did have to go to the neighborhood coffee shop to work one AM.  the Movie section of the TV did not work and also.... no real effort to make anything happen...we were woken up on Monday 7AM to loud construction and when i told the front desk they said... oh well that isn't from our building.  OK If you have construction that is waking up your guests don't charge the same amount as a hotel that is in a quiet neighborhood.... bring down the price and WARN people!!!  i don't complain too much anymore about bad Hotels i just try to warn other travelers.... this hotel needs a shake up .... it is such a great product and it isn't getting my business anymore sooooo many great hotels in NY....","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel is really nice and is ideally located at the edge of the NEW. The subway is just wrong outside the entrance and take you on a 15 minutes to manhattan. Feels very safe to go. Next to the reception, there is always a guy who helps with all matters regarding the tourist stuff or if they can drink their water, as it can. Though it does not taste so good. :-) The swimming pool was closed which was not on their website and it was disappointing. The rooms were nice with a huge tv on the wall and cool views on the 16th floor. Bed queen size was big, about 160-180 cm but hard and low. Comfortable duvets and sheets. The bathroom was great with hair dryer etc. Next to the hotel are two bars with live music. They changed band each 45-minute. The only thing that is bad is that we received a letter under our door after a few days in which it said that they would charge an additional amount to in case we couldn't pay our hotel room.

I accept responsibility on my part. We may be old fashion but was shocked when she handed us new cards for our room as she had cancelled the first ones incase we did not have enough money. I must say after that incident the staff was fantastic especially the reception staff and doormen. We spent a lot of time on the metro getting to places of interest so location was not great. We had to walk quiet a way to get to a diner that we used most of the time. There was nothing in the room to make tea or coffee which was disappointing so we found a little coffee shop two doors down we took it in turn to go out first thing in the morning to get our morning cuppa. We spent a lot of money on thing like this and the bar was so expensive.

Its extremely clean, the staff is so friendly and helpful and accommodating.  We have been upgraded at times to larger rooms and they were beautiful.  Two of the women at the front desk are wonderful, Nalani and Fatou, they are the best!!!  Whatever you need they will get you.  Also the guys at the front door that take your bags, hail cabs and take care of your car are so friendly and great!!! The last two times we stayed there which was this January and March we visited the restaurant on the 2nd floor.  The food is very good and the bartender Max is awesome.  He is very attentive and such a nice guy to talk to.  The hotel is right in the heart of the Noho area.  You can walk to Soho, Little Italy and China town.  No need to take cabs unless its raining or very cold out.  There are tons of restaurants and bars close by that you will not have a hard time finding something you like.  I strongly recommend if you come to New York City that you stay at this hotel you will not be disappointed.","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Lower East Side is a bit edgy, a bit arty and a bit ... err ... how do you put this politely, run-down.  If you are in NYC and want something different and happy to stay this far downtown it may be an excellent choice.  For me it was too far from the shops, restaurants and attractions that I wanted.  I spent more money on taxis than I did on shopping (and I did loads of shopping).  So, before booking here, just check whether the location is convenient for you.\n\nThe other downside is that there is no place for breakfast.  The concierge did a great job making suggestions, but nothing really hit the mark.  All I really wanted is one of those breakfast buffets that they have in something like the Hilton.  I know that sounds bad, but it's what I wanted.\n\nAlthough the price was reasonable (by NYC standards) I probably wouldn't stay here again.","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I would suggest that the real mark for this review would be a 3.5 but i am going to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt as they addressed some of our concerns at check-out in a positive professional manner.\nFirst the good: We had a good sized, corner room with a balcony that had a great view both up and downtown - all for a very reasonable rate. The staff were friendly and courteous at all times (with one exception) and the short walk to Soho and ease with which you can get anywhere in the city makes the Sixty LES a great base.The bed was also very comfortable.\nThe negatives: the room wasn't ready upon arrival, we couldn't get in until 4.40pm, which after a long flight isn't great. The towels in the room are postage stamp sized, it wouldn't hurt to have a couple of bath blankets so that people don't have to drip-dry! We used the sofa-bed in our room and whilst it was just about ok for a child, there is no way an adult could sleep on this though. When we asked for a duvet to soften the sofa-bed, a member of house-keeping passed this to us in a clear bag with the cover that we had to put on ourselves. Not great. The final gripe is WIFI - this is no longer a luxury and you should not be charged for it, you can walk in to any chain of stores in Manhattan and log-in for free, so come on - sort this!\nOne tip to make the Sixty LES better would be to make something of the second floor 'lounge'. People like somewhere to hang out, somewhere comfortable and somewhere with a vibe. Take a stroll round to the Ludlow round the corner and see how they do it - there is money to be made if you get it right.\nWhen we raised some of our concerns at check-out, the hotel adjusted our bill and had a positive attitude, so this was good and showed the quality of the staff at the front desk.\nI would certainly recommend staying here but be mindful, it is Manhattan on a budget.","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our daughter lives on the LES so we are always in search of excellent accommodations. I don't want noisy or small rooms.

The beds were quite comfy with lovely linens.The beds are low to the ground which is a problem if you have knee issues, but we certainly managed without an issue.  Spectacular blackout curtains!  \nNice bathroom with a very modern frosted glass motif and the area is large by NYC standards.\n3] We enjoyed the bar nightly, but we did not eat in the hotel's popular Sushi restaurant.\n Sixty LES is surrounded by wonderful coffee shops, bagel shops, restaurants and  delicatessens. We loved exploring some new blocks of the LES!\n4] We did not use the pool as it was very cold, but the pool is beautiful.\n5] Fitness center was well equipped and had more equipment than most hotels.\n6] We did not use the spa.

For me, the price jumped $30\/night literally WHILE I was booking. I called to complain and they adjusted the rate, and did the same for one of my girlfriends who also called to complain.\n\nMy girlfriend who had specifically booked a more expensive room on the promise of having a bathtub did not receive one for the first night. This made me feel badly as I had chosen the hotel. She got one the second night, but only after the inconvenience of having to move rooms and I do not believe she was compensated in any way for her trouble (she's British, throw her a free pint in the bar for her trouble, hey?)\n\nThe rooms themselves are perfectly nice (though single room QUITE small, but that seems typical for NYC), price is reasonable for that neighborhood, gorgeous views, staff accommodating with taxis, bags, umbrellas, what-have-you. I only had like 10 working TV channels, luckily I had my iPad to read, though wi-fi is expensive so no streaming for me. \n\nThis neighborhood attracts hipsters and partyers; my floor was quite loud, quite late on the Saturday night and my girlfriend also complained of party noise on the balcony below her floor until quite late. You are not going to get your full 8 hours here on a weekend unless you bring earplugs!\n\nI was prepaid, so if in a hurry I probably wouldn't have gone through the formality of checking out. I did, and only to find I had been charged for 2 still waters that I didn't drink or even touch (I'm a bubbly girl myself). Felt like a sly way to make money on people who are too rushed or confident in their pre-booking to bother formally checking out.  \n\nAnyway these days I feel like you get complimentary still water at most hotels, along with hot water kettle, etc. which this also did not have. Very bare bones.\n\nI would still recommend staying here, but stay on top of them for all the little details that might annoy.","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Since the date was December 27th, all hotels were very expensive! I usually stay at their sister property, 6 Columbus, but since it was too expensive I looked on Hotwire\/Priceline for great sales. I found one on Hotwire for the Sixty LES. I booked it and was really glad I did. I am in my 40's so the Lower East Side would not be my principal base if I was looking to stay for a couple of days but for only one night it was perfect!\n\nPROS:\n     *The restaurant: I am a fan of Blue Ribbon so I ate dinner and had cocktails there.\n     *The view: Some people say that when you book with a 3rd party, you get stuck in a closet but it was not the case here. I got a corner room with an incredible view. I had views of the Empire State building and the Chrysler building on the north and East views from the other window. It was simply incredible to have a room with windows from floor to ceiling with this incredible view.\n     *The service: Everyone was the nicest...from the concierges to the front desk agents to the housekeeping people I met during my short stay. It is one of the strong points I remember.\n\nCONS:\n     *The lighting: There were only 3 lights in the room...a lamp on the desk and 2 bright spots next to the bed where you think you are in an interrogating room in a police station!! I know I am one of the freaks who turn in early in NY to watch television or read in bed but there was no in between..it was either near pitch dark or like in a cafeteria!! I emailed them and they said they would bring alternative lighting it I were to go back. It just shows that they have excellent service.\n     *The hotel lobby: It is totally personal...but I prefer smaller hotels where you have the front desk with the concierge and a small intimate area where you can sit and just get up to ask the hotel staff if you have questions. Their hotel lobby is on the 2nd floor and the agents and the concierge is on the 1st floor....I know....I had to nitpcik to find faults!\n\n    All in alll...it is a great hotel that I recommend to younger people who love the Lower East Side. I liked my experience but prefer the area next to the 6 Columbus but it is due to my age;-)","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

Fermata della metropolitana a 1 minuto, fondamentale per raggiungere in pochi minuti qualsiasi posto di Manhattan e dintorni. \nHotel rinnovato e di arredamento fashion molto curato. Camere molto belle e accoglienti. Abbiamo dormito 6 notti nella 410, una King De Luxe al 4 piano. Stanza da letto separata da salottino (due TV schermo piatto, una per stanza), e bagno con doccia (spaziosa e con irradiatore grande, ottima) e vasca (piccolina ma funzionale). Finestre a vetro fino a terra con balconcino (in comune con altre camere). Vista a west: Freedom Tower, One World Trade Center a sud e Empire State Building da lontano a nord. Dietro al letto matrimoniale una fotografia illuminata (lampada) gigante di un olivo. \nPersonale molto gentile e collaborativo. Concierge preparata e disponibile nel suggerire locali per cena o altri avvenimenti (capodanno). \nPrima della prenotazione avevo contattato l'hotel via e.mail per chiedere spiegazioni e chiarimento sulla camera e contrattare il prezzo e ho avuto risposte soddisfacenti (oltre a trovare un piccolo pensiero in camera all'arrivo con lettera personalizzata). \nHanno una piscina esterna (non utilizzabile in inverno, quindi) piccola e stretta al 3 piano. \nWiFi in camera si paga 15usd \/giorno per collegare 3 apparecchi. WiFi gratuito nella lobby al piano terra e in un salottino lettura molto comodo al secondo piano. Quello gratis nel salottino ha segnale potente (reggeva bene le videochiamate con FaceTime).

I had a meeting. I chose to walk.... the list goes on.\nWhen I came to check out I questioned the valet charge and the receptionist said \"it was your choice to go and get the car, not ours\"!!!!

We had an eventful stay and in a nutshell it was noisy and overpriced. \nPros: The location is great and very convenient. There are lots of restaurants, supermarkets and coffee shops around. There is a cinema a few minutes away. Little Italy and Chinatown are 10 mins walking distance. The subway is on the other side of the road. There is a bus stop also right outside the hotel. \nCustomer service is amazing. They have always tried their best to accommodate us and our needs. At some point they left us a small box with bonbons and a \"thank you for staying with us\" note.\nThat being said though, there were a few reasons why we would not go back, noise being the main problem. \nYou need the key (a card) to go to all the floors. You would think they explain that to you when you arrive, but no one did, so we stood in the elevator like idiots pushing the button and wondering why it wasn't working. Then you notice the slot for the card and voil\u00e1! you introduce the card, press the floor button and you can go up. One of the keys wasn't working, but they can quickly fix that for you.\nThis never happened to us before, but we had to change rooms twice. The first room they gave us was very nice, but as soon as someone else occupied the room next to ours it was impossible to stay there. The walls seemed to be paper thin - we could hear everything happening next door: the TV (which wasn't even loud), the conversations (also not loud) and the constant cough. We arrived late at night and were tired from a 6 hour trip. We just wanted to sleep, but couldn't. We tried for a while, but it wasn't working, so we called the front desk and they changed us to the quietest room they could think of. \nWe had two problems with the second room. We could hear what seemed to be an open window or door slamming every few minutes and it was freezing cold. This room is next to the swimming pool deck, which was closed for the season, and had doors (instead of windows) that give you access to the deck. Unfortunately, we could feel the very cold air come in constantly from every crack of these doors. Because the bed was right next to this door, even with the A\/C on we could still feel the wind. Again we tried to make it work, but we were not able to sleep and asked to move again. The staff was impeccable the whole time. They even let me see two rooms and choose the third room. \nThis room was smaller, but we didn't have a problem with that. It was a bit noisy because it is facing Allen St. (busy night and day), so we could hear all the honking and ambulances and what not, but we stayed there for the rest of our stay (almost a week). \nThe staff followed up and called to make sure we were enjoying our stay and everyone was always polite and nice. \nI ordered food service once and the food was very tasty and it took less than the 20 mins they said it would take. I also asked for a kettle to make tea in room and accidently broke a glass and they didn't charge neither of this. \nThe room cleaning wasn't always so great. Our bathroom even smelled to urine for a couple of days. The first time I noticed it, but it was late so I waited to see what would happen the next day. After they cleaned it again the smell was still there, so I asked the front desk to tell the cleaning staff to be more thorough the next time. They offered to clean it right when I complained, but it was late and we wanted to rest. The next day they cleaned it properly. Our last day we didn't have soap in the shower. We had a pen in the room which stopped working in the beginning of our stay so I put it in the bin; it was never replaced. The night before we left was a Friday night - I almost didn't get any sleep. There seemed to be a party somewhere and we could hear music plus the noise from all the traffic - it was like rush hour, but late at night - terrible.\nEvery night the staff would came to knock on our door to ask if we want ice and a square of chocolate. From our room we could hear the staff collecting the ice from the machine. We could also hear the elevator sound from every room we tried. \nSo, no we will not stay or recommend this place to anyone.","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is no coffee or mini fridge in the room, however, you can order room service but it would be $40 for coffee, eggs and toast, for one person... so you definitely have to go out for coffee and breakfast.

I stayed here 5 years ago and it was great. However, now not only is the decor all work and chipped they just get the most basic things wrong. First of all, they checked us into a room which stank of smoke. I mean reeked. Even the bellboy was putting his hands over his nose and mouth. I then had to go through the palaver of moving. We were straight in off the plane from London. I was with my niece who was very tired.Why didn't they bother checking? Apparently (according to the bell boy) they charge $500 cleaning fee if a guest smokes in the room, except on this occasion they hadn't bothered cleaning it. We there then moved. I still wasn't over the moon as the next room stank of air fresher (so off brand - this is meant to be a boutique hotel)? but apparently there weren't any other Double Double rooms available. The next morning, when I took a shower the shower unit reeked of cigarettes too. Weird, but true. I mentioned this and was told they would do a 'deep clean' of the room. This never happened. In fact, the first day our room wasn't cleaned at all.That evening I mentioned it at the front desk and was told that the housekeeper had said that the 'do not disturb' was on the door. Except ir wasn't. They were clearly saying this to cover up their mistake. Also, if they had thought it was on there why not call the room to check? (The previous night the front desk has called at 1045pm waking me up to 'check everything was alright.'! What a crazy double standard. Then the wifi didn't work. And they insisted on going through a merry dance including 45 minutes otp with their service provider to 'check internet settings.' If it doesn't work on two computers and two phones, there's a problem. All they could come up with was 'it seems there is a problem.' Next day no one in the lounge or in the front desk could get online either. It was an intermittent connection. Room service took nearly an hour and twice they got the order wrong. The guy couldn't speak English. I was there for 5 days and they didn't have Earl Grey tea the first day, by day 5 you would have thought they would have bothered, but no. You get he feeling they just don't care. The concierge William was very nice. But the front office staff were brusque and just has no clue about how to treat people. My advice is if you're off to NYC don't stay here, stay at the Bowery Hotel. Probably the best hotel I've ever stayed in. They get everything RIGHT! I would have stayed there except I needed a Double Double, and 60LES is one of the few hotels which offers it.","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our experience was great and the location is perfect. The check in was really fast and the guys and girls at the front desk were very nice and helpful. Unfortunately the pool bar was closed due to the season and we neither could get to know Above Allen Bar, as it only opens on Fridays and Saturdays. But we had dinner at the Blue Ribbon restaurant, on the 2nd floor, amazing sushi and fried chicken. Room service is from de Blue Ribbon restaurant too, totally cool! We ate one of our best club sandwiches ever.\n\nWe never try the hotel breakfast as we are lazy sleepers, but just two doors from the hotel you could grap a coffee at Konditori\u2019s, a Sweden place, from the outside it doesn\u2019t look like much, but trust me is one of the best coffees in town. I went to the gym twice and it is very good equipped but the sauna doesn\u2019t heat too much, even though you select the high temperature range. \nThe room is awesome, with a lovely iron curtain that separates bed from a tiny living room with a sofa bed and a coffee table, it \u2018s quite big for New York standards. The bathroom is the gem and the shower system amazing (ref picture 2).  \nJust a few blocks from hotel  are Freeman\u2019s Restaurant, the best artichoke deep in the world and Clinton St Bakery, I believe the best breakfast I ever had, was worth the 35 minutes table wait.\n\nAs many reviews mentioned and I totally agree, the most remarkable downside is that you have to pay U$ 15 daily to get internet access in the room, very expensive if you consider the hotel fares. The complimentary wifi at the lobby is very slow, and it practically didn\u2019t work at the lounge area in the 2nd floor, signal is too weak, the people at the Blue Ribbon were very kind letting me use theirs.  Another thing I didn\u2019t like is the use of the key card to be able to use the elevators, the slot is very thin and while you are trying to insert it, the elevator takes you to a ride at whatever floor they call you, only a few times I could reach my room floor without scales, thanks of the help of Raul that was always trying to help you. \n\nI totally recommend this hotel, thank you very much for making feel our stay very special\n\nCristian R. lozano","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They handled the problems I encountered in the room promptly and professionally.  Everyone else, including the bar tenders and doormen were also amazing.\nI booked on hotel tonight and chose this hotel because it had a pool and was in a good location for my needs.  I was assigned a very small basic room but when I pulled back the covers there were disturbing hairs on the mattress.  I decided it would make me too uncomfortable to stay in the room so I went to ask for a different one.  After being quickly assigned a second room, I found the same exact issue in that one as well.\nI went down, now very upset and asked for a refund, but the manager put me in a bigger room and asked the head of housekeeping to personally walk me up and check the bed.  Thank goodness this one was clean and I stayed.\nThe room was still not large but a fine size, with a couch and view of the pool.  The decor is minimalist and dark with a black wooden floor and an all black bathroom. The Closets and desk are worn, making them look older and more used than they probably were.  Between this and the hallway, I felt like I was staying in a college dorm.  As I see from other reviews, some people would find this trendy and hip, but to me it just felt cold.  In addition, the bed was very hard so I didn't have a restful sleep.\nThe other reason why I was disappointed was the lack of guest-only public spaces.  I left the room to try to find a cozy nook where I could relax with a glass of wine and read my book but all of the bars and spaces were filled with loud crowds and blaring music.  There is a \"rooftop\" bar and an outdoor beer garden and both were teeming with non-hotel pseudo hipsters. This is fine, of course, for a hotel in NYC to have this, but they should also consider their guests as well.  \nWeather permitting, the pool is heated and got decent sunshine in the morning, so if I had time, it would have been one of the positive aspects of the hotel.\nIf anything, this experience has taught me that I definitely like my hotels on the lush side, not the minimalist side.\nWhen not booking on hotel tonight, this hotel runs $500-$1000 per night, which I definitely can't wrap my head around.  It's only worth about $300-$350 so unless you get a deal and like the above described trendy factor, I would look elsewhere.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Pros: perfect location to explore the LES, Nolita, and East Village, great views from some rooms, pool and decent workout room, cool vibe but not over the top. Really important to me: Upper floors quiet if you're in town for business. \nCons: Some front desk staff surprisingly unfriendly. No interactive TV (no movies, premium cable, or even a menu to navigate channels). Probably something they'll resolve.

From the moment they open the door for you to the minute you check out. I have stayed at many NY hotels before, but this one has been the nicest and biggest room I have stayed in.  The room has a small area with a sofa and the beds are super comfortable, but practically sit on the floor.  The bathroom actually has a little bit of counter space with a shelf below and the shower was updated, clean and had a wonderful rain shower faucet. The lights in the whole room were so cool, you had the option of dimming the lights and making as bright as you wanted. This is especially nice in the bathroom at 2 AM when you don't want the lights super bright. We ate at the restaurant which is a Sushi Restaurant. Very nice meal, a little pricey, but what isn't in NY. (We had 2 orders of California Rolls, Edame, and 2 drinks and cost $70!)  I had a John Daly drink,(ice tea flavored vodka and lemonade)  not the best that I've had, too strong, but once they added a little more lemonade the drink was bearable.  They have a nice Beer Garden area outside on a patio too. The Internet cost is $15 per day, a little steep, not sure why hotels charge this fee, especially when you pay as much as you do for the room itself.. If you go sit in their 2nd floor lobby or the restaurant, it was free. All around this hotel are restaurants and the subway station was only a couple of blocks away which made it easy to get around the city. Chinatown is close as well.

So overall I'm rating my last stay so poorly because of the pool staff. Of course it was a hot day in July and my boyfriend and I wanted to spend it by the pool. Everything was great until 3 pm. After 3 pm the sun deck does not get much sun besides this particular corner spot where I wanted to move since I was trying to get a tan. However Ashley (who works there and is responsible for making the pool beds) told me that a lady that just showed up requested that specific sunny bed. I told her that I am a guest of the hotel and have been waiting for people to leave so I can move to that bed. She didn't allow me. It turned out that person who took the bed is a friend of one of the managers at the hotel (I think so it was a blonde lady dressed all in black who obviously worked there)!!!! This person was not even staying at the hotel she just dropped by to say hi to her friend (the manager) and she took the best spot!!! Really???? Keep it up! With such hotel policy soon you will have NO paying guests at all and will only have friends coming to the hotel for FREE! Ashley tried to tell me that people were not allowed to reserve beds! Then how come this was reserved for someone else???? I was really disappointed. On top of that the service at the bar was horrible! The girl was rude and unattentive! She kept messing up my orders and guess what? In the end I was charged with 20% grat!!! And trust me I don't mind tipping but this was not a well deserved tip! Maybe that's why the service is so bad, the staff know they will get their tip so why bother to actually do a decent job. The previous day we had an excellent service at the pool bar and the grat was only 18%. Go figure! Maybe on Tuesday is 18% and Wednesday 20%?

You are in the middle of the action in the LES, and there are few other hotels in the area.

The management is top notch, and service across the hotel has improved (particularly room service). If you love sushi, the Blue Ribbon Sushi in the hotel, at the pool, and as part of room service is a huge bonus. Finally, hotel management is always willing to add a personal touch and assure you have a wonderful stay. \n\nThe only pro tips are: You should ask if the pool will be open in the summer. Sometimes it si closed for private events. The corner seats at the pool stay sunny the longest. In addition, you should ask what events are happening at the hotel during your stay. Occassionally certain areas are shut off for private events. The hotel management are very helpful in this regard. \n\nHave a blast and enjoy the stay!","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

(I stayed here when it was called the Thompson LES.  Website indicates it is still looks the same.)  It has been my go-to suggestion when friends come to visit.  Prices are high, but not terribly different from other nice New York hotels and it has definite benefits as detailed below. \n\nLocation:  The neighbourhood is filled with upscale boutiques and trendy restaurants.  Three popular eateries everyone wants to visit (Clinton St Bakery, Freeman's, Katz Deli) are all here.  Just north of it is East Village and west is Chinatown, both full of cheap food options and within a 15 minute walk.  For sightseeing, your best bet is the subway.  LES has four stations, the 2 Av station (orange F line) is a couple minutes walk away from the hotel.  It intersects with 3 different train lines, so you should be able to get anywhere.  Personally, the most enjoyable walking neighbourhoods are LES, Soho, East Village, West Village, which are all in south Manhattan.  Staying far up in midtown (above 34th, anywhere near Times Square) is just too touristy, too loud and less fun.\n\nRooms:  We stayed in a room with two double beds (Double Deluxe).  This room was really lovely, spotlessly clean, sleek and modern.  For 3 girls, it was ample room, far more spacious than other boutique-y\/swanky hotels.  One nice addition is the flat seating bench along the wall, which worked out really nicely for storing our luggage (2 carry ons and a large duffel).  The beds were very comfortable.  The lighted wall art could be turned on and off as you please.  The glass and black tiled bathroom is an extension of the room and sectioned into 3 pieces:  Spacious standing rain shower, separate vanity with good counter space, a separate room with a toilet.  One note:  The shower, even with lights behind it, shows ONLY the silhouette of the person in it.  We experienced no noise on the 9th floor, but if you are a light sleeper, ask for a higher floor.\n\nService:  I can't speak to the restaurant or pool amenities as we didn't use it.  I noticed the pool on the lower deck, which faces east so sun is blocked out in the late afternoon.  Front desk and doormen were superb.  They were helpful with little tasks (getting ice, helping with champagne, luggage storage etc) and very friendly.  Overall, made for a terrific stay.","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Staff were polite if not overly chatty, however, the service was great. We had a late check out confirmed with no issues the day before we departed and a stray minibar charge removed from the bill with no questions asked. The room itself was small but very funky and functional. We'd also been given a high floor on request and the view of the Manhattan skyline was simply stunning. The best part of this hotel for us though was the amazing location in the Lower East Side. Although we roamed around Manhattan and even into Brooklyn to see sights and museums, nearly all of the places we wanted to eat and drink at were within walking distance of the hotel. It was our first trip to New York but we were very glad to have lucked out and not be staying in tourist-packed Midtown. The most number of metro stops we had to take was just two, and there is a station right across the road.\n\nThe only issues we really had were that housekeeping staff seemed to ignore the privacy sign we hung out each night, several times knocking on the door - if we'd been sleeping in this would definitely have woken us up. I was also not a fan of the shower, which was a combination rainfall shower with absolutely no water pressure, and a waist-height detachable shower head. It may have just been us or our room but we found it difficult to get the temperature right.\n\nOverall a great hotel that I'd gladly return to and recommend to others.

WiFi in camera costoso.\nIl condizionatore in camera era molto rumoroso: fortunatamente ho potuto lasciarlo spento tutto il tempo.\nQuello che ha influito negativamente sul punteggio totale \u00e8 la sensazione di essere solo un numero e non un cliente, cosa non aspettata da un hotel di questo livello.

I have stayed here approx 20 nights over the past 60 days and must say that my time as a guest has been simply Wonderful.  The staff and accomodations have been terrific from the bellman to the housekeepers to the senior management.  I'm usually a difficult customer because I've travelled quite a bit, and I have been a bit spoiled...but this hotel has had the perfect level of privacy, luxury, and style.  I enjoy the 24 hour sauna and Blue Ribbon food too.  I also happen to love the location to all of Manhattan (especially downtown) and its proximity to great coffee at Konditori (downstairs) and across the street from the subway.

An area that was once more than a bit edgy but is getting to a point now where it is almost too hip.\n\nThe LES has a great staff and well designed rooms. Even though the hotel is at the busy intersection of Allen and Houston streets the rooms are quite because of great floor to ceiling windows insulated. There is a small balcony outside each room. Rooms are well decorated, spotless and comfortable. \n\nThe hotels restaurant is Blue Ribbon Sushi and Izakaya. It is great to be able to get sushi as room service but go down to the restaurant and bar for the great atmosphere. \n\nThe private Above Allen club was small, cramped, loud and hot, but everything can't be a winner. Instead go downstairs and next-door to the Rockwood Music Hall which has three venues, one of which has non-stop FREE live music! Stage one is the free venue where acts rotate every 45 minutes, so even if you don't like the current band stick around for the next. The other two rooms have better known acts which tend to sell out in advance.  Worth trying I'm sure.\n\nDown the street and around the corner you'll find remnants of the old lower east side, the famous Russ and Daughters appetizer store (think lox, white fish salad, bagels...) and Katz's Delicatessen maybe the last of the great old jewish delis in New York, now that the Stage is closed. The LES is also only a few blocks to the new and brilliant Tenements Museum, if you plan to go allocate at least 2 hours for one of their walking tours.\n\nThe staff at the LES is friendly and accommodating. \n\nI would not recommend this hotel for your first visit to New York, but if you want to be close to the newer hipster neighborhoods of the Lower East Side and Williamsburg and you know your way around town, his is the place to stay.","travelDate":"2014-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

My room was nothing short of spectacular, as probably due to my late arrival stayed in a junior suite. I think there are only 3 basic things that are needed for a hotel room to be hit the bar: Clean sheets, good shower and some power points for electronics. Sixty Les excelled: The room was meticulously clean, the bed had the right softness\/firmness that gave me a great nights sleep. The shower was like having a spa with powerful hot water from the two shower heads. And there were plenty of power points to charge electronics after a long day. \n\nLittle things were done very well and in particular I loved the nespresso coffee maker, which for an early morning start is a like a turboboost. My only concern with this hotel is that some of the rooms have balcony's, and that led to a bit of late night noise which could potentially be worse in the summer.  I didn't use the hotel facilities (bar, restaurant or gym) so cant really comment on them and that is the only thing stopping me from giving an excellent rating.\n\nI had a great stay, with great service ( among other things the concierge stood in the street for 10 mins to get me a taxi) and would stay again in a heartbeat.","travelDate":"2014-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We were therefore after somewhere a little bit swanky as well as in a good location to explore New York. Prior to arriving I telephoned ahead to see if we could secure a nice room with a view - and was met with a polite, helpful reply. On arrival, it was even better as we were given a lovely corner room (#1600) plus a free half-bottle of champagne plus chocolate truffles to congratulate us!!\nThe room was cool in design and had a great view of the Manhattan skyline, both south and mid-town. The bed was very comfy, the bathroom was small but shower was amazing!!\nWe really enjoyed this hotel as well as the location, however here a couple of 'less-great' observations:\n- Noise from outside street was still quite audible despite being up on the 16th floor.\n- Corner room is nice but was opposite 'cleaners staircase', so often heard doors opening\/closing and stacking of used room service trays.\n- No tea\/coffee making facilities - these we had to order in, but otherwise the room was very well-stocked.\n- Be wary of 30% mark-up on any room service once tax has been added on (though recognise this is likely a US thing).\nWe'll leave the decision up to you as to whether these things would bug you. We'd still recommend the hotel!!","travelDate":"2014-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I figured I may as well treat myself (right?!) and location and customer service are probably the two most important things I consider when paying for hotel stays.\n\nOn that note, I emailed the hotel for clarification on a matter and a hotel representative, Linda, emailed me back within hours. Not only did Linda answer my question swiftly, she provided me with excellent information. \n\nBecause of Linda, I booked my room, without hesitation, before even reading any reviews. \nAfter booking my room I decided to come check reviews here on TripAdvisor and I'm so excited to see how positive they are. Indeed I am even more impressed that Tenzing seems to respond to all recent clientele who leave reviews. This is impressive and, in my view, should be a clear indication of the level of service that is offered at Sixty LES.\n\nOnce I actually do fulfill my hotel stay I will come back to revise this review, but at this moment, I am very pleased.","travelDate":"2014-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

The rooms are gigantic for manhattan standards, and beautfully decorated. Views are superb on the higher floors. Beds are super, and unless you have a room right next to the pool or rooftopbar in summer, it is a very quiet hotel and you will sleep as a rose, a midst of one of Manhattan's liveliest areas: LES.  Tons of restaurants and bars are within a range of minutes. Also Soho, The Village, Chinatown are within walking distance for the ultimate NYC experience.  What I like so much there is that within 2minutes you have great places to discover live music like the Rockwood orMercury Lounge.  Last but not least, the hotel's own restaurant is atop japanese restaurant annex bar. This is by far out my favourite NYC hotel!","travelDate":"2014-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

This king deluxe room not only had a large modern bath tub... But a great balcony on the main street to get a real view of the city. The cleaning crew never knocks on your door early.... In fact I never put out my sign saying \"do not disturb\" they simply came sometime after 1pm when I was already out exploring the big city!!  When I checked in Miguel immediately upgraded my room. That was just the beginning.....\n\nLater during my visit.. I decided to extend my stay. I called downstairs and the girl who answered made me feel like I had to move all my things out of my current room and into my next. But when I went downstairs I met Robert! He made all the changes while keeping me in my upgraded room in 5mins and compd. ...my internet for the day.  And he is the reason I decided to write this review! \n\nSo thank you Robert and Miguel and all of the wonderful staff at Sixty LES!\nSee you next time!","travelDate":"2014-02","tripType":"SOLO"}
