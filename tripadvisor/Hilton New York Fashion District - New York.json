I called the hotel to see if they could make an exception and the told me to call the Hilton Honors number and they told me to try and ask the manager which I did, they said he wasn\u2019t available and took my phone number and he will call me right back, he never returned my call. When I got to the hotel they wouldn\u2019t make an exception said they wouldn\u2019t change the reservation and I had to pay for a second night. I was upset and responded very curtly, I found it frustrating that they wouldn\u2019t make an exception for a simple mistake. \n\nI usually stay close to a hundred nights at Hilton Hotels and I\u2019m frustrated that they don\u2019t take this into consideration.

Then I went downstairs and asked to speak to the manager in person and he started yelling at me in the lobby, and I mean really yelling at me.

Most places are a reasonable walking distance or short Uber rides to where you need to get to. The room was clean and serviced well daily. \n\nNow the bad things, the staff were quite awful from the moment we arrived the check in process was unfriendly with no information provided and the staff were more interested in talking to each other than serving customers. It wasn't even busy as we were the only ones checking in at that stage. A bit of customer service asking about your trip what you were interested in, telling you about the hotel ..... nothing. Unfortunately that carried on throughout the stay and this hotel needs to train all their staff in customer service. I think the problem is supply and demand, as there is such demand they get filled without even trying and as such their staff just don't should any attitude to care. There were just stupid things like 3 of us staying and only two cups each day in the room, empty shower gel, towels not being left. Every day there was something we had to contact them about and the reaction we got wasn't apologetic either. The rooms are quite dated with peeling paint from the ceiling in our room, the heating sounded like you were beside a 747 at takeoff and only cold area was pumped out. This place needs a refurbishment to really bring it up to any decent standard. \n\nOne thing to be aware of as well is that if you book through a third party provider none of your Hilton Honors are considered, so you don't get anything benefits whatsoever. That came as a complete surprised and was hugely disappointing to a Diamond member. I think that policy stinks and is restrictive trading. Even after complaining Hilton just weren't interested, so am looking to switch loyalty given their behaviour over that. Even if you booked directly I'm not sure there is any benefit at this hotel, there is no executive lounge and you certainly don't feel that loyalty matters here. On hindsight I shouldn't have thought being loyal and booking to stay at Hilton was a good option especially when there were many better deals at other hotels and its a lesson learnt for me and one that will make me stop using Hilton as a result.\n\nSo in summary I would recommend other hotels, there is even a good Holiday Inn in the same road which was a better offer including breakfast and better rooms. Unless you are pushed for choice I wouldn't consider this place. I think a testimony to any stay is would you go back and from my experience I certainly won't be staying there again for any visit to New York. ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1601249,"title":"Nice location but narrow rooms and space","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-25","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I was spending the weekend in New York and previously I have stayed in the Chelsea\/Fashion District and really enjoyed the district.  It was within walking distance to subway stations, within walking distance to Penn Station, and easily accessible and within walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  This hotel is located in the Chelsea\/Fashion District on 26th Street between 6th and 7th Ave (a block behind the Innside by Melia hotel).\n\nThe hotel itself is narrow, like many New York hotels, and that was evident in the lobby which had a wide circular car entrance but the lobby itself was narrow and long.  As you entered, in front were the elevators and to the left was the small check-in desk and to the right was entrance to the hotel restaurant.  Check-in was relatively quick and as a HHonor member, I received two complimentary bottles of water.  I then proceeded to the elevator - there were 3 elevators but one was dedicated to go to the rooftop bar so was not accesible; another one was out of service and so were reduced down to 1 working elevator.  \n\nMy room was on the 14th floor and the narrowness of the hotel also showcased on the hallways which were tight as well as the room size.  I have previously stayed at Motto by Hilton which is Hilton's answer to tiny\/capsule hotels and the room size at that hotel in DC and this regular Hilton in New York were somewhat similar.  As you opened the door, you entered into a little hallway which had the closet, wardrobe, and coffee stand\/shelves along one wall.  The closet was narrow but still contained places to hang your clothes, an iron, as well as an ironing board.  The coffee stand was on an open shelf next to the closet which contained the coffee maker and items on top, a minifridge down below, and another shelf\/storage on top.  Next to that was a mini chair space to put your luggage.  Along that wall was a large desk with lots of desk space and places to plug in your electronics.  There was a standard office chair which was very comfortable.  Above the desk on the wall was the large TV and below the desk were drawers for additional storage.\n\nAcross the desk, along the other wall, was the bed along with two bedside tables.  The bed size was a large full-size or a small queen.  There were lots of pillows available and the bed was generally comfortable to sleep on - it was a bit tight so not sure if two people could fit comfortably on the bed together.  Next to each side of the bed were nightstands with nightlights and places to plug in your electronics on each side.  The bathroom was across from the bed and next to the desk.  It was narrow but did have a walk-in shower, a toilet and a sink.  There were refillable bottles of lotion next to the sink, and shampoo and conditioner in the shower and bars of soap were provided next to the sink as well as in the shower.  Like the room, the bathroom contained the basic necessities but was narrow.\n\nI was only in New York for one day and most of my time was spent outside so I did not experience other facilities of the hotel including the rooftop bar, the restaurant, the fitness center, or the business center.  I did experience the wifi which was strong and was not limited to a certain number of devices.  I was able to stream videos on youtube with no connectivity issues.  Checkout was at 11am and I had requested a late check-out at 12pm but I was told 'to call in the morning and check'.  I called at 10:30am and they said 'no, the latest we can do is 11:30am but you can hold your luggage at the front'.   This was the first hotel that did not offer at least checkout until 12pm and the service was not the greatest in their response.  I checked out and was going to leave my stuff at the hotel and that is when I was told there is a $2 charge to leave your items at the hotel - I wish this information had been told beforehand so customers could be aware.  I am glad though, that unlike other hotels in the area the hotel does not charge a 'facility fee' per night for the wifi and the bottles of water, but $2 to hold luggage when you are demanding customers get out of the room at a certain time is a bit greedy.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

From check-in to check-out, the stay was one of the worst I have ever had and this is coming from someone who travels almost 70% of the year. Caroline, Martha, and Zoribel were front desk personnel we encountered during our stay. We were lied to about the validated parking, our room, and about the daily credit vouchers for being a Diamond member. The parking situation sucks - they say they validate at the lot up the street but if you have an SUV, that lot won't take you so we ended up paying $70\/night for another lot a few more blocks away. We asked for water because there weren't any in our room and the food truck outside wasn't open yet we were told that they aren't in the business of giving away free water. Mind you, I am a diamond member and had no water in my room. I would've gladly paid if they had a small shop for me to purchase from. They have 2 spots allotted in their driveway for loading and unloading for their guests. Both at check-in and check out those spots were taken by town cars just sitting there making it very difficult to load\/unload. We got yelled at (no exaggeration) in front of a lobby full of guests\/workers when we left our car to go grab our luggage and the woman even called my husband an a$$hole in front of everyone. I tried to speak w\/ a manager but no one was on duty (supposedly) and I called and left a detailed voicemail but didn't hear back for days.

Even after trying to speak to her in person to highlight that issues do happen but that it is the response of the team that matters, she continued to say that the issues were caused by me and she would 'allow me to leave' if I chose to do so.

It was run dow. \nThe television was hanging in a 45 degree angle. Curtains were torn at the end and didn\u2019t black out properly, the lampshades were all hanging crooked. \n\nThis hotel is unloved by its owners. Neglected.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1601249,"title":"Another Wonderful Stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-09-23","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"When we realized we were planning a much needed week long trip back to NYC, there was only one place we wanted to return to, and it was the Hilton New York Fashion District, almost a year to the date. \n\nWe like how centrally located the hotel is to everything but just far enough away that you\u2019re not stuck in the tourist trap and bright lights of say Times Square. Plus you\u2019re so close to everything, the Fashion District, the Flat Iron, and Chelsea to name a few. We drove in and opted for a garage that was a block away that had a decent rate for 5 days, letting us have several options if needed to move about the city. \n\nWe checked in on Sunday, I had two rooms, and was able to use the Hilton app to select the rooms and check in prior to getting to the hotel. All I had to do was get keys to either room when we got in. One of my rooms was on the 20th Floor and the other being on the 16th. No need to be on the same floor, though I\u2019m sure I could\u2019ve waited to see if rooms were available. Got to the rooms and had City views. I will say that the view from the 20th floor was better as you could see the Empire State Building from the window. Both rooms were clean and ready to be occupied. \n\nWe settled into both rooms before heading out for a bite to eat. That\u2019s one thing about being in NYC, you can\u2019t go hungry. During our stay we did stop into the restaurant on site for breakfast. I\u2019m glad we weren\u2019t having to attend to a schedule because the wait time for our breakfast seemed to be a bit obvious and puzzling as we were the only ones in the dining room. One of our diners had ordered eggs and wanted them to be poached, she received hard boiled., we didn\u2019t send them back as we weren\u2019t sure how long it was going to take to correct the issue. I ordered the Banana Bread French Toast, I was going for indulgence, which at first it hit the mark, but it was too much to finish. That was the only time we ate in the dining room. On our last night we decided to check out the rooftop bar, which was excellent. Especially for a nightcap. Drinks were great, dessert was tasty and shareable. Service was top notch. The view was great. Just keep in mind that you cannot charge to your room. So have your cash\/card ready. \n\nThe few things I will point out from the stay, on Tuesday after returning to the room to relax, our tv was not turning on, we waited about 5 minutes and noticed the red indicator light re-illuminate and the tv was working again, however we lost quite a few stations. Hoping it was just a temporary issue, we didn\u2019t report it. Then Thursday afternoon after returning back to the room, we called down to the Front Desk, and they sent engineering up. The first gentkeman wasn\u2019t entirely sure what he was doing and tried to say that \u201cmaybe it was the weather.\u201d Um no but ok. He then called another engineer who came in and they tried updating the tv with a USB stick, that still did not fix the issue. His immediate response was to have us switch rooms, with it being our last night, I wasn\u2019t trying to move. We checked with our other room and we\u2019re told that it too had lost channels at some point. \n\nI was also looking forward to the standard comfortable Hilton beds, but this trip seemed to miss that mark. \n\nI would love to see the rooms get upgraded, especially the bathrooms. Bring them into the new standards, take out the framed mirrors and put in the LED backlit ones. And the sink counters were great 10+ years ago. Team up with the Fasion Institue have them design a new and updated vibe. Just a thought. \n\nAll in all, the staff is always great and friendly. Will we be back on our next trip to NYC? Absolutely.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1601249,"title":"Worst Hilton Stay Ever!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-08-18","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"I just want to preface this review by saying that my wife and I are seasoned travelers. We\u2019ve been all over the world and are also Hilton Honors members. With that said, we know a little about hotel standards and accommodations when it comes to a hotel chain of this caliber. \n\nLong story short and simply put, this particular hotel was by far the worst experience we\u2019ve ever had. First off, the rooms are incredibly small. We had a king bed room and our room was basically the bed with barely enough space to walk around it and to the bathroom. Considering this is Manhattan, I\u2019m able to forgive that. What I can\u2019t forgive was everything else wrong with our room, and lack of service and amenities. \n\nFirst off, and our biggest complaint was that our shower wouldn\u2019t drain and that the shower door was also leaking. As you can figure, this caused water to quickly overflow and spill onto the bathroom floor.  This made for us to have hurried showers while standing in stale water as it sometimes took hours for the water to drain. \n\nSecondly, there was no iron or ice bucket or even an ice machine on any of the floors. What kind of hotel doesn\u2019t keep irons in the room??? Anyway, I had to call the front desk twice and they finally brought it to my room 30 min later. As for the ice, I again had to call the front desk for it, only this time they wouldn\u2019t deliver to my room for reasons I couldn\u2019t understand. I had to swing by the front desk myself and pick it up. Awesome hospitality right? Anyway, so I inconvenience myself by going downstairs and asking for the ice at the front desk. Mind you I\u2019m expecting it to be in a metal bucket with ice and a lid. But alas, that\u2019s far from what I receive. They literally give you a bag of ice here\u2026..like they pulled it out of a freezer at 7\/11\u2026..with no ice bucket\u2026.like wtf??? You think that it would be common sense that if the rooms didn\u2019t already have ice buckets that they would give you one when you request ice right?? The following day I swung by the front desk again to pick up some ice and I made sure to mention I wanted I bucket this time around. Instead of the usual large metal ice bucket I\u2019m accustomed to at hotels, they gave me this small plastic bucket as if I were gonna build sand castles with it on the beach.\n\nI can usually forgive the shortcomings of a hotel if the service is exemplary but we found that to be lackluster as well during our stay. Suffice to say we won\u2019t be staying here again and when we return to NYC, we will be looking to stay at a different Hilton location and hopefully a more enjoyable experience as well.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a prepaid reservation and they did not challenge the validity of our reservation. After sitting around the lobby (with several other people without a room) for a half hour, they finally sent us to another property a block away. The new hotel was absolutely fine (actually nicer than the Hilton), but it was an additional $80 out of pocket and all Hilton would do is credit the rate at their hotel. I am a Hilton Honors Gold member, but because I booked through a 3rd party site, it was ignored by the hotel.\n\nThe way we were treated was disgraceful.

I arrived to the hotel around noon to drop off my bag. My room was, understandably, not ready at that time. I again tried to check in after the stated check-in time (approximately 3:30) and was told my room type wasn't ready. I paid for a specific upgraded room, so decided to wait rather than change room type. The front desk staff member did not mention there was a problem with my reservation at that time. I went back out and about and returned to the hotel around 7:30 pm. I waited about 45 minutes while the front desk staff was helping 4 other customers - all who seemed to have a problem. When I finally got to my turn I found out why - NONE OF OUR RESERVATIONS WERE HONORED. That's right, multiple parties - at least 4 that I witnessed, plus myself - were left without a hotel room in the evening in NYC on a holiday weekend, despite a reservation. Thankfully I was able to book another hotel quickly (not a Hilton brand, that's for sure). But it ended up being triple the price since I was desperate and booking for the same night. And I had to take the subway late evening to get there - with my  luggage. To top it all off, my credit card was charged in full for the room upon making my reservation (again, nearly 2 months ago). The first time I tried to check in, they charged my card $100 (understandable for deposit, but odd since I hadn't actually checked in yet). A while after being turned away and after being checked into my new hotel, I get a notification from my credit card that the full room charge was charged again. Then I received a folio that I had checked in and immediately checked out. \n\nThat same evening, I tried to call the Hilton chain customer service number from the app and waited on hold for over 90 minutes to attempt to rectify the situation.

These \"city view\" rooms also cost extra to book, and the rooms and hotel itself are rather worn and dated.  Rooms are also small and the hotel had relatively few amenities.  If all Manhattan hotels were this noisy, I'd give a higher rating, but I've stayed at plenty that, despite the street noise outside, have relatively quiet and comfortable rooms.  Apparently the rooms on the backside of the hotel are quieter (and sometimes cheaper), which would have been nice to know when booking, not when checking out.

The plus side of the location was it\u2019s proximity to many popular places including the Flatiron, The Empire State Building and Macy\u2019s which were all around a 10 minute walk.  The downside of the location is that there\u2019s not a great deal immediately outside the hotel or on the nearby streets other than fast food outlets.\nWe booked the hotel back in January 2019 as we got a good deal and the hotel website boasted a rooftop bar and on site restaurant. When we checked in we were told the rooftop bar was closed for refurbishment and that the restaurant went out of business 3 months ago. This meant there was nowhere on site to get food or drink which we were very disappointed by.  The reception desk gave us a sheet of food options to order in but we didn\u2019t take up this option.\nThe room itself was a decent size but very basic and not what I\u2019d expect from a Hilton.  Our view was onto other buildings so we couldn\u2019t see outside properly. There was a bug on the bed and a bug catcher under the radiator which was a bit concerning!  However we never saw any other bugs so we chose not to make an issue out of this.  The bed itself was comfortable but the duvet didn\u2019t have a proper cover, it was 2 sheets folded round the duvet itself, which became unfolded during the night which was really irritating, and not very pleasant seeing marks on the duvet.\nThe room was made up daily but sometimes quite late in the day. There were a couple of occasions where we returned to our room around 4pm for a rest before going out again and had to wait for the maid to finish the room. We had to ask for additional drinks one day where they hadn\u2019t been replenished and our final day they had run out of bath towels and we only had hand towels. We always tipped the maid as we appreciate the busy job they have and the time pressures, however it was disappointing that we didn\u2019t always have the items in our room that we should have had.\nThe reception team were all very helpful and stored our luggage on our last day when we checked out and arranged us a private cab back to the airport that afternoon.\nOn the whole the location of the hotel was handy, the price we paid was reasonable and the reception staff were courteous, we were just disappointed that the hotel room appeared more of a low budget hotel than we were expecting.  We were also unhappy at the lack of food options available at the hotel and felt that because this change had happened since we placed our booking over 10 months previously, we should have been advised prior to our stay either by Expedia or the hotel themselves.\nWe definitely plan to return to New York again in future however we will be paying more for a more upmarket hotel.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The streets are crowded so its very nerve wrecking...If you arrive, you can pull directly in by the door to check in and from there you will be told where to park or get valet. prices are about 45-60.00 and you pay a fee to take it out and in again. You should prob avoid this. Weekend street parking is free but if you don't move your car before 7 am Monday it WILL have a ticket for 115.00! I have the ticket. So I feel that the parking is the biggest issue here, the stay was comfortable and clean. ","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I had issues throughout my entire stay.\n\nThe first thing that happened is my room's door could not close all the way and I had to put in a lot of extra work just to close it. I called the front-desk to fix it and to move me to a new room because I did not want to deal with it.\n\nWhen I changed my rooms I could not use the digital key in the Honors App. I tried calling and asking the front-desk for help and they kept saying they were trying but they clearly weren't and did not care one bit especially the front-desk manager who was rude to me when I checked out. That same manager then told me to call the Honors IT Support and when I did they couldn't help me because only employees can call the number and ask for help. They never were able to fix it at any point when I was there. The front-desk person who was useless also never apologized for her garbage actions and was arrogant and kept saying she was the highest up when she clearly wasn't.\n\nAs for the room, it's quite small. You don't get a couch chair like you do in other hotels. You only get some super tiny ottoman. The bathrooms are pretty good especially the water pressure.

I'm hearing from friends that the digital key, while convenient needs some improvement because Hilton has many issues with it. I have used it in the past and it worked fine so this is my first time having a problem. The room was medium sized and good for no more than 2 people I would say. I stayed alone. The bathroom was a decent size. The room was clean overall. The only downside to my room was the refrigerator. It was full of beverages for PURCHASE only. No room for storing food you may bring from outside. Since this hotel is in midtown area there's very few parking options. You can pay for self-park or valet. The parking is NOT cheap. self-parking cost me $40(more for an SUV) and you CANNOT go in\/out. Each time you leave you pay the full price again. If you choose valet parking you pay the flat rate $40 plus $10 each time you go in\/out. The property is close to public transportation, Uber and cabs are everywhere, or if you like to walk there's some nice things to see close by such as times square(40th\/42nd street areas). The staff was very friendly but were limited in granting me a late check-out because they said the hotel was sold out that next day, I was granted and extra half hour but because I utilize the Hilton Honors app I was checked out at the regular check out time.

I am pretty hip for my age but we did a lot of sight seeing and walking. So the noise was a bit disturbing. When I called the front desk to complain they offered me eye plugs. When we tried to drink at the two hotel bars they did not have Jack Daniels, Captain Morgan, Absolute Vodka, or Riesling. Are you kidding me? Where in NYC? 1 out of the 3 elevators was broken and it made going up and down a logistical nightmare. Waiting as long as 20 minutes just to go up or down is ridiculous.

We were on the back (alley) side facing the office building next door (no view, limited sunlight), so completely quiet all night long, but you can hear room doors banging when people come back at night and leave in the AM (normal business hours, not late night and late rising folks).

We live within driving distance but planned on having a few drinks during a show and didn't want to worry about the drive home or missing the last train back.  I booked this hotel because there is a year-round roof-top bar and I thought it would be perfect to attend the show and then catch the roof top bar once we arrived back at the hotel.  I had never been on a roof-top bar in the city before.  \n\nIt turned out that the roof-top bar was closed, and closes much, much earlier than other bars, like 11pm.  When I mentioned to the hotel person that I had booked the hotel because it had a roof top bar and I was surprised it was already closed this early on a Saturday night, she just answered, \"There are lots of other bars.\"  Great.  But I spent $199 so I could be at YOUR bar, lady, not some other bar.  There should be a warning that it closes early if they use that bar in their marketing to attract bookings.  I could have had a hotel literally across the street from our show but the rooftop bar was the deciding factor for me even though it was 2.5 miles from the show.\n\nBecause the bar was closed, we looked in the hall for ice.  There is no ice in the hall at this hotel.  We went down to the counter and asked for ice and they said, \"Sure, no problem!\" but no ice ever showed up.  We waited and waited and finally I cracked open a warm beer I had packed with me from home.\n\nCheckout is nice and late, 12 noon, so we didn't have to rush getting out.  We did end up waiting 40 minutes for the hotel to bring our vehicle. We were supposed to get  warned to call ahead for our car, but no warning was given upon check-in.  There is no coffee in the lobby and we had already made the Keurig from in the room- one small cup of coffee each with fake creamer.  So when they warned us the car would take a while, I said, \"How long, because I'd love to run to the corner and grab a cup of coffee to wait with.\"  The valet said, \"No need, wait right here, it'll be 5 minutes.\"  Well, it was 40min and I could have run to that corner coffee shop 10 times.  It was annoying.      \n\nThe room itself was fine and the king bed was comfy.

Having recently traveled to New York and stayed on the lower east side at a Mariott, I decided to change up my hotel (Hilton) and location. Based off reviews, I was confident this would be a good selection. I imagined myself having a drink and snacks on the rooftop bar or grabbing a bite to eat in the swanky burger restaurant, but boy was I was wrong. My flight from California was delayed 5 hours, putting me in New York around 11pm. Needless to say, by the time I got to the hotel, I was exhausted, hungry and excited to shower and get ready for bed. As I got to the hotel, there was no one in sight to help me with my bags, or even to hold the door open. I walked to the check in desk and when I inquired about room service or hotel restaurant, I was told that they were all closed and I would have to go out to get food. It was then that they told me all the water had been shut off as well. The front desk kindly passed me a few bottles of water and said the hotel wouldn't have water until the morning. I then went out into the snow to find food. Unfortunately, all kitchens in the open bars were closed. I went back to the hotel starving, and kindly asked the front desk again about showering. I said I had a horribly long day and wanted to see if there was any way I could shower. The man at the front desk held 2 water bottles over his head and went, \"you can pour these all over you\".  You could imagine how frustrating that would be to a customer. I had traveled all day to show up to a hotel that had no food and no water, not to mention a very unapologetic staff. There was no compensation for guests for this inconvenience - not even a batch of complementary coffee. I was very upset about the experience, so much so that I went to pack my things up and leave but I was just too tired. As I went to bed that night, I couldn't help but think, \"I didn't pay a decent amount of money and fly all the way to NYC to camp\". Needless to say, I will never stay at this hotel again nor recommend to anyone traveling to NY. There are plenty of hotels to choose from and this one was beyond a disappointment.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

While street and hallway noise can be an issue for those on lower floors, it generally dies down by an acceptable time.\n\nThe Hilton Gold\/Diamond breakfast benefit is not quite as generous as other hotels at either a 20 USD voucher per person for the hotel restaurant or 2,000 Hilton points. However, the value of the points is enough to cover breakfast at the excellent Brooklyn Bagel nearby. For all other meals, prices at Rare, the hotel restaurant, are reasonable by Manhattan standards.\n\nThe only minor thing is that I wish that the hotel would offer a sign-in page for the premium WiFi instead of having to get a passcode from the front desk.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

With the tennis in action, hotel prices in the city were very high. \n\nAs a first impression, this hotel is fine. Open and compact lobby, and I was welcomed as a Diamond member after a long-haul flight. NYC was especially humid that week so the a\/c was welcoming. \n\nUp the lift, which took a while to arrive, and I arrived on a high floor to a soulless corridor. Along I went, to a plain door, and entered the bedroom. My first impression was the damp\/fusty smell that was faint in the corridor but noticeable in the bedroom. Second was the tiny size of the room - I know it's New York, but even still. Not impressed. Then I saw the bathroom from the 90s, and remembered that the room still smelled bad. \n\nOn the upside, the wifi was good and the a\/c kept pumping the cold air, though it was likely the source of the smell too. \n\nCome morning breakfast in the attached restaurant was fine, though some natural light would be nice when adjusting time zone. \n\nLocation is a subjective thing in the city, this hotel was fine for meetings I had on the West side of Manhattan. \n\nAll in all I wouldn't stay here again - I'm surprised at the state of the property given the amazing competition in New York.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We last stayed at this hotel in July of 2013; see our review titled \u201cGood Location for Midtown Sightseeing\u201d. We booked our stay online using the Hilton website; although we are Hilton HHonors members, we did not receive an upgrade upon arrival (not even to a higher floor); however, we were able to check in online the day prior to our stay and choose our room number. \n\nThe Hilton Fashion District is located in Midtown in the Garment District bordering Chelsea, not far from Madison Square Garden\/Penn Station. It provides a convenient location for Times Square sightseeing and access to various subway lines, bars, restaurants, and souvenir shops. A Whole Foods grocery store and the Sunac Market are located within one block of the hotel, in case you need to purchase food, drinks, or forgotten items. The Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and its museum are a half-block away.\n\nThe lobby area itself is not large, but still offers a few places for guests to sit and chat. The decor fits the theme of a Fashion District hotel, with spools of thread composing an interesting art piece behind the front desk and mannequins with interesting costumes in the front windows. A tiny concierge\/tour desk is located adjacent to the front door, although it is not staffed. RARE Bar and Grill is located at one end of the lobby, where breakfast is served (complimentary for HHonors Gold and Diamond members). The hotel also features the RARE rooftop bar and lounge, where we joined some friends for drinks one evening. At night, one elevator is dedicated to whisking patrons from the lobby to the 23rd floor rooftop. Two additional elevators access guestrooms on the 2nd to 22nd floors. The hotel has valet and self-parking for an additional fee, and the garage is located just a few yards from the hotel entrance. Taxi cabs were plentiful in front of the hotel, and Uber provides an additional transportation option. \n\nWe had a corner room on the 9th floor, which regrettably did not give us a view of the Empire State Building because of an adjacent building. (On our last visit, our corner room on the 22nd floor had a great view.) The room was average size for New York City (about 300 square feet), with a king-size bed abutted by two nightstands, a desk\/dresser\/bureau combination, a small ottoman\/seat that could be moved around, and a shelving unit that housed the glass-fronted weighted minibar (do not move anything or you will be charged) and coffee-making supplies, and a small closet that contained an electronic safe, iron, and ironing board. The room decor was modern and appealing, and the fashion theme (or sewing theme) carried through on some of the artwork. The bathroom was a decent size, with a combination tub\/shower unit and large countertop vanity with a single sink. Complimentary toiletries include soap, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. Three sets of towels were provided, despite the fact that the room could really only sleep two guests. The hotel does not offer turndown service, nor does it have vending or ice machines; however, you can call down to the front desk to request ice delivery.\n\nWe enjoyed our second stay at the Hilton Fashion District, and we had fun at the RARE rooftop bar.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Friendly efficient check-in, we were given two complimentary water bottles. As expected, the room and bathroom were very small. The room had a small closet with ironing board and iron, and a safe. There was no noise from the outside, and blackout curtains kept out the light. There was Keurig coffee machine, but unfortunately ours did not work. After two calls on two different days the machine was never fixed or replaced during our four night stay.  The honor bar posted a warning that \u201cpulling flap incurs a charge- no refunds can be made\u201d.  The room was worn with dinged baseboards and pealing wallpaper. The a\/c wall unit was noisy, with a musty, mildew odor.  The bathroom had Crabtree and Evelyn bath products, an old wall heater at floor level, that got hot when turned on, a definite hazard for small children, especially if they poked their finger into the coils. There were three elevators for the twenty-two floors, however when the rooftop bar opened, one elevator was dedicated to transport guests directly up the entire night, so was out of commission during that long time period, resulting in long wait time for elevator. Very disappointing stay.  With the numerous hotels in the area would not return.\n\n*Note for families who want a crib from the hotel - my daughter also stayed here at the same time of us.

I stayed from the 16th - 17th December.  I always found it to be one of the most convenient Hilton branded hotels near Penn Station for catching the Amtrak.  It is also within a short distance walk to Times Square, Madison Square Garden and Shopping.\n\nFrom time of arrival, the staff immediately checked me in without wait and thanked me for my loyalty as a Hilton Honors Diamond Member.  I was offered a 1 KING BED SKYLINE VIEW room which same room type I booked (there are no upgraded rooms above this type).  I was assigned a room on the 16th floor (1606).  I was also explained the restaurant, room service and other options available at the hotel.  I also was provided details regarding breakfast.  They provided me details on connecting to the Wi-Fi, and provided me the room keys and I was on my way.  As I was going out shortly after getting settled the front desk provided me with an umbrella as it was raining out.  \n\nThe room itself was nicely appointed and located on one of the highest levels in the hotel.  The view from the room gave me a great skyline view and also full view of road below.  The furniture was in good condition and the room very clean overall.  The overall stay was pleasant and comfortable.\n\nThe hotel did not have an Executive Lounge, but does have a great rooftop bar which provides amazing views of the skyline of New York. \n\nCheckout was as easy as check-in.  I was given an option to check out via Hilton app.  I chose this time to check out face to face this time and again worked with the pleasant staff.\n\nI look forward to future stats at this hotel and recommend for staying as it is a very nicely maintained hotel with great staff.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

We arrived prior to check in time and had already selected a room on the 21st floor using the HH app. (By the way all double beds city view rooms face south, we were hoping for North facing Empire State Building for our young girls to enjoy. I did find this out when trying to select room for check in on the app). Having arrived before check in time we asked to store our luggage while going to get lunch, and the kind lady checking us in offered a room on the 19th floor that was already available. Our two girls were also greeted with crayons and activity pads by the front desk staff, which after a long day of traveling brought smiles back to their faces. We were thanked for being Hilton silver members and given a bag with waters. \nWe were told about the rooftop bar, which my husband was able to go up one night and enjoy drinks and the views. Kids were not allowed up, but the front desk did say if we came down to the desk early they would take us up with our girls so they could enjoy the view prior to the bar opening. We tried at 4:30 on Saturday after getting back from a broadway show, but they said the bar would be opening soon & to come back down the next morning. It was storming the next morning, so I never made it up there with my girls. Maybe next time.\nThe hotel room had a view of water towers not much else; I would definitely recommend the higher floors. A positive, with the room facing south, it was very quiet as far as no street noise. The doors to rooms are extremely loud when closing though, so we could hear those during the middle of the night at times. \nThe room was spotless (which is huge for me, especially traveling with little ones who are all over the place) beds were comfortable & room was cleaned & refreshed daily. The Keurig was a huge plus! Also requested a mini fridge & a couple foam pillows which were brought up. Loved the cotton balls in the bathroom for removing makeup, I would order those myself if I knew where Hilton ordered them from. Small, dense & soft :) the little things do make a big difference. \nThe location is great. We walked to Google to meet a family member for lunch & a tour, walked the highline, walked to Chelsea piers so the kids could play, walked to Madison square park, & plenty of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. There\u2019s a great coffee shop just around the corner & a Whole Foods a couple blocks away. Subway entrance was only a couple blocks away also, so that was easy to catch to head up to the natural history museum & Central Park.\nWe loved our stay at the Hilton Fashion District & I will definitely stay again.

De locatie vind ik uitstekend, het ligt bijzonder centraal in Manhattan en je bent net ver genoeg weg van de gekte op Times Square. Metro ligt om de hoek. Loop je de straat uit richting Madison Square Park dan kom je diverse leuke restaurants tegen. Leuk park\/plein ook Madison Square park, met het iconische flatiron building.  De kamers zijn redelijk ruim en netjes\/schoon, de badkamer had iets groter mogen zijn. In mijn beleving is het echter meer een Doubletree dan Hilton hotel. Dit geldt  eigenlijk voor alles, de bar, het restaurant en de kamers. Zelfs de toiletartikelen horen bij Doubletree (Crabtree and Evelyn) in plaats van Peter Thomas Roth bij Hilton. \n\nProbeer een kamer op een hoge verdieping te boeken,  dan heb je een mooi uitzicht op Manhattan. De kamernummers  ..5 t\/m ..11 op elke verdieping  kijken uit richting Central park, de overige kamernummers richting lower Manhattan, mits je een kamer hoog genoeg hebt. \n\nHet personeel in heel het hotel is bijzonder vriendelijk. In de bar is het echter meerdere keren fout gegaan, bestellingen worden niet, of niet compleet gebracht.  Of ze gaan nadat je besteld hebt eerst uitgebreid met elkaar kletsen en pas daarna je drinken maken. Dit zijn wij niet gewend en komt niet overeen met de service die we uit Europa gewend zijn. Ook vragen ze continu om je creditcard en\/of legitimatie, hierdoor voel je je als gast van het hotel absoluut niet gewaardeerd. Op basis van je naam kunnen ze je uitstekend verifi\u00ebren met je kamer. \n\nIk zou dit hotel zeker aanbevelen en als ik zelf weer in NY een hotel boek, dan zal ik het hotel zeker overwegen.

The space was clean, the bed was comfortable, the room temperature was easily adjusted to our preferences. The city view from our window was unexpectedly impressive. We've stayed in NYC many times--often with a view of a brick wall or something equally uninteresting. In this case, we were pleased to find a gorgeous city skyline with a view of the Empire State Building--a very nice plus! \n\nThe only downside--at one point we could clearly hear the conversation of a group who was laughing in the hall right outside of our room. This could have become a big problem if it had occurred more frequently, but fortunately it only happened one time. (Note to maintenance - there was a noticeable air gap at the edge of the door which probably lets sound travel quite easily.) \n\nThe hotel's location turned out to be very convenient in several ways. We enjoyed the on-site restaurant for breakfast, where we opted to eat twice. We ordered from the menu. Everything was tasty, and there was a nice selection. We also visited the ale house directly across the street in the evenings, which was a very convenient location. The subway station was only a short walk from the hotel.

Situated a short walk (10mins) from Macy\u2019s, Empire State Building and Maddison Square Gardens (basketball etc). A bit longer walk to Times Square, but still walkable (20 minutes). 20 minute walk to Chelsea Market & 10 minutes Walk to the High Line. \n\nFor Battery Park, Central Park, Wall Street and 9\/11 Memorial, subway is recommended. Nearest one is one block away, a 5 minute walk. Within walking distance there are shops, cafes, fast food places and places for breakfast. The area is fine and well placed for walking to attractions, but very busy. Our room facing the road (16th floor) was a little noisy during the busy hours outside. Ask for inside facing room if don\u2019t like noise. The views are poor anyway, so you won\u2019t be missing much. I think if you are looking for an area that\u2019s a little less busy, more classy and you don\u2019t mind a 10 minute subway ride in to mid town, then Central Park area is where we would recommend.\n\nThe hotel is about an hour\u2019s drive from JFK airport. Use the yellow cabs at the taxi rank. Fixed fee of $52, + tolls (I think it was $6.50 for the tunnel) and then any tip you wish to give. \n\nNow the hotel is fairly business like. It\u2019s situated very close to 7th Avenue. The lobby is small, but due to the glass front, allows lots of light in. But what more do you need in a lobby then a check in desk and lifts. There is also a restaurant (fairly large) within the hotel if you want to eat there. Rooftop bar, which we didn\u2019t experience. Appears out of the 3 lifts in the hotel, one is dedicated to the rooftop bar when it opens. If wish to us it, have to return to lobby to get lift back up, no matter what floor your room is on. Breakfast wasn\u2019t included in our room rate and is an extra. Free (basic) WiFi. Free maps of the city. Luggage storage after check out.\n\nThe rooms were fine. Clean, comfortable and all we needed for our 5 night stay. Large bed & comfy. Safe to use for valuables. Desk with chair. TV. Mini bar (charges to your account when remove items), free bottled water on our first day, iron & ironing board, coffee making facilities (no tea), wardrobe, chest of drawers and bedside drawers \/ lights. Bathroom was fine too. Clean. Fresh towels daily. No bath, but walk in shower.  Hairdryer provided. The rooms are quite small, but seems to be standard for NYC. Was still large enough for the two of us and large suitcases, but not spacious. We found the interior lighting very poor. Was fine during daylight hours, but during hours of darkness, the lighting in the room was rubbish. The heating unit was also quite loud when it started up. \n\nStaff were good. Mostly helpful, friendly and happy. Provided good service. One fault with the staff, is the cleaner that decided to start hovering outside our room at 6am. Not cool! Allowed us an extra hour in the room after our check out time (1pm) on request. \n\nI would recommend avoiding the hotel\u2019s own airport transfer service. We got ripped off. Wish we took a yellow cab now. The sign on the desk states fixed rate of $73 from hotel to JFK. I was told by staff this includes tip and tolls. This is more than a yellow cab (fixed airport price of $52), but when you add toll and tip, it seemed acceptable so i didn\u2019t have to faff about hailing a yellow cab. Staff told me a yellow cab would be between $60 and $70, depending on the taxi meter, which is a lie, as it\u2019s a fixed price to the airports, as set by the local government. Clearly wanted me to use the hotel airport transfer service. \n\nFirstly, the driver spent the whole journey on his phone. Secondly he took a detour around the tunnel, to avoid the toll (which was paid for in our fee) increasing our journey time to around 90 minutes. Thirdly he was nipping in and out of traffic, coming on and off the main roads to kangaroo jump traffic queues, fourthly he charged me $80 when I paid, claiming \u2018tax\u2019. He was quite insistent I paid cash, but I didn\u2019t have any so this wasn\u2019t an option. I challenged the fare, but he was adamant $80 was the price. Not wanting to get in an argument over $7, I paid this. This complaint is currently being managed by the hotel reception manager, but not yet resolved. \n\n***avoid the hotel airport transfer service***\n\nOverall, this hotel was great for what we needed. Clean, comfortable, safe and a good location. Very pricey (\u00a3200 a night) and definetely not value for money, but it was xmas time and all hotels were expensive.

Price was around $215 a night (pre-tax) which I found to be a bargain as I saw prices for comparable hotels in the $350 range.\n\nCons:\nVery little negative to say, just a few minor quips.  This is a bit more of a business hotel than something for a family vacation, but we knew this going in and made it worked.  The rooms have large showers as opposed to tubs; our 4 year old thought she was being such a grown up learning to shower instead of having a bath.  Also, no breakfast at the hotel, which we were fine with; ended up going to Whole Foods (two blocks away) each morning to pick up milk, juice, fresh pastries, etc.\n-Wifi was pay per use.

Reception did provide a couple of bottles of water and whilst it was an inconvenience, these things happen.  \nThey had resolved the issue within a few hours and things remained ok for the rest of our stay. \n\nAbove and Beyond\nI have to say that where the hotel really excelled was the additional service they provided. \nI had been in touch with them prior to our arrival to let them know that we arrived on my fathers birthday and that the next day I planned to propose to my girlfriend, so could they give me a price on a bottle of champagne on each day to mark the occasion. \nWe arrived to champagne to celebrate my fathers birthday and the next day following my proposal we came back to our room to flowers, balloons and wine to celebrate our engagement. \nIt was an incredible gesture and one that made our stay all the more brilliant. \n\nI would not hesitate to recommend staying here to anyone, though one tiny recommendation would be to add teabags and milk to the coffee welcome plate as some people love a cup of tea, especially the Brits!","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There's no ice machines on any of the floors at this hotel.   I found a small 1 inch stain on the left sheen drapes of the room, and my partner mentioned that the room was a bit on the dark side as the lighting doesn't have the ability to fully light up the room.

I understand the area this hotel is situated and that's why it's called \"fashion district\", so if that's the vibe you like, this hotel would be for you.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Room faced the back side of bldg and we were on the second floor. I don't mind the low floor, but very dark and just really dim yellow bulbs in crappy old light fixtures. Room was beat up and no one bothers to vacuum close to the mopboards. Also, they are no longer dusted mopboards anyway. Icky old carpeting, nasty mattress and tired old bedding. The comforter inside the duvet cover was stained. \n\nStaff very nice. Food in restaurant (Rare) is still good, although decor looks very tired. We did not complain about room.

I had never stayed in this neighborhood before.  I chose the hotel because they seemed to be the only of the big chains that didn't jack the room rates to the sky during the week. \n It was about 1\/3 the cost to stay at this hotel compared to Times Square or the Financial District.  The rooms are small, but no smaller than any other Manhattan hotel.  It's in a great location, a short walk to 2 subway stations and Penn Station.  It's also a short walk to the High Line.  The hotel is on a lightly traveled side street so getting a taxi can be a chore, you're better off walking out to 6th or 7th avenues.  The bellman has access to a car service so getting to the airport is easy and the rates are competitive with cab fare to LaGuardia.  Dining options in the immediate neighborhood are little limited.  The front desk staff was very friendly and always helpful.  We had a problem with the water pressure in our sink and they sent an engineer up right away.\n\nA couple of things that need improvement.  Hilton has a Digital Key system where you can check in before you get to the hotel and use the Hilton Honors smartphone application as a room key.  But if you don't select that option before checking in at the desk, it can't be added.  Additionally, the hotel charged my credit card for an extra $50 per day for incidentals.  That wasn't disclosed in any of the reservation information.  I expected a hold when I checked in but the charge was put through the night before I arrived.  Despite the hold, charges from the restaurant and bar were also put through on my card over the course of the week.  It all settled correctly at the end, but if you're close to your limit, you might have a problem.\n\nMuch is made about their rooftop bar.  Despite staying on the 22nd floor, right below the bar, we had to go all the way down to the lobby to get on the dedicated elevator to the bar.  When we got to the bar, the open areas on both ends were reserved for private parties, the only area available to hotel guests was in the middle of the bar, which is under a roof and not open like the ends are.  If the hotel is going to advertise the bar as a hotel amenity, it should be more accessible to guests than it is.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This hotel was clean and the staff was nice. The location was a little farther walking from our activities than I realized (5th ave area shopping, 30 Rock, etc), but once we started to learn our way around, it didn't feel quite as far as it had at first. The restaurant breakfast was lacking, as the menu was verbal and limited (3 or 4 items) and didn't open until 7:30 or 8:00. Further compounding this, there was no  hospitality in the form of immediate access to coffee or tea in the lobby (I don't care for Keurig coffee - there was a Keurig machine in our room). On the other hand, the beds were very comfortable! The mattresses felt newer and the pillows were great. I'm not typically someone who sleeps well, and I slept well both nights. I'd say my overall suggestion to this hotel is to start providing coffee or tea, around the clock, somewhere in this hotel!

He even proactively offered three drink vouchers on Hilton to make me feel very welcomed, so I can share it with my friends. He did explain that the rooftop bar was not operated and owned by Hilton, so it is not Hilton's fault if it seems that many people come and go and wait on line to go to the bar. It is opened to everyone as it is by Rare Restaurant. Rooftop bar experience was great. Beautiful view of the city and good house wine. Breakfast was great actually. Huge portions and lots of choices on offer served by Rare. Service here at the hotel and restaurant were all quite nice and friendly. The room was fine and the bed was comfortable. Loved the amount of towels and pillows they provided. I appreciate that and even the set up was elegant. Although, the maid did not clean up some soap residue in the shower area, but the room was clean and good besides that. Loved the Keurig coffee machine and so easy to use and the instructions and reminders were a neat touch. I learned how to use Nespresso, now, but this machine was much easier to use and in a way it a bit more high-tech. I do wish they had an executive lounge for their gold and diamond members. Also, I do wish they were more proactive and accommodating to allow complimentary late check out for its gold and diamond members even if it is by an hour or two. A little gesture can go a long way.

I've staying in this particular hotel twice now this year, and possibly even reviewed it on here.  I am a Diamond HHonors member.\n\nI took the option to pay extra for a \"high floor\".  This is a 22 floor hotel, so given I was paying extra was expecting floors 19+.  I got 16 (room 1611 to be precise).\n\nI have 2 reasons for wanting a high floor - in NYC the higher you are, the quieter it is.  You also have some chance of not looking straight across into someone else's room. \n\nThis was singularly the noisiest hotel room I have ever had the misfortune of staying in.  I arrived on a Saturday and the noise from the street below was extraordinary.  From groups of people in the early hours (most likely spilling out of the hotel's rooftop bar) to the garbage truck every morning between 2 and 4am the amount of noise coming in the obviously cheap and not-soundproof glass was extraordinary.\n\nOn top of that 1611 seems to be opposite some sort of linen closet where the staff felt the need to slam the door every 20 minutes all night.  In the course of a 4 night stay I estimate I slept no more than 2 to 3 hours each night.\n\nTo add to this the toilet obviously had an issue with a valve as water ran through that all night - this was mostly drowned out by the AC but on top of everything else it didn't help.\n\nThe next issue was breakfast.  In all my experiences in HHonors hotels the Gold\/Diamond members get access to the full breakfast buffet.  This was also the case in my previous visit earlier this year, but by this visit it had changed.  We are now offered a very limited option of 4 or 5 a-la carte options and not allowed access to the buffet.  The options are poor.  On the first morning I had a croissant with bacon\/cheese - it was terrible and took 45 minutes to be delivered.  One of the reasons I like the hhonors hotels is because I can get a quick buffet breakfast before going to meetings.  I don't have time for an hour round trip (due to elevators - see below) from my room for a greasy croissant.  Downgrading the breakfast like this is cheap.  I was paying $400+ a night for this stay, don't save yourself $2.  I gave up going for breakfast an instead picked up something on my way to the office.  My wife went for breakfast one more time to give it a try and see if it improved - it was a hot morning and she was refused any cold drinks - only tea and coffee were offered.  Simply abysmal way to treat customers.\n\nThe next issue was the elevators (or lack of).  This is a general issue in NYC but normally a hotel like this with 3 elevators can be relatively efficient.  This isn't the case when one of the elevators is blocked from guest use so it can be exclusively used to ferry non-guests to the rooftop bar.  This confirmed the elevator was working, but still during the day it was locked off from guest use leading to some VERY long waits.  This was exacerbated on my final evening when they had delared this elevator broken, and decided to still reserve one of the elevators for non-guests to get to the rooftop bar.  This meant a single elevator served the entire hotel.  I waited 25+ minutes to get down to street level.  For over $400 bucks a night, you must be joking!\n\nA very bad experience - I did somewhat raise some of these issues with the staff, but after my attempt at explaining why the breakfast was no good I didn't see the point pushing it further, I will just remove my custom from the group instead.  I see you value your rooftop bar customers higher than hhonors guests.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It's a long time that I have eaten such an uninspired French toast. I don't quite understand why they don't let those guests have the buffet without, say, the hot items. I wasn't impressed by the cleanliness either. Particularly the common areas were not clean. My room was also missing a coffee maker. I had assumed it was out for replacement but throughout my four night stay it didn't arrive back. One night I woke up because there was construction noise somewhere below my room. It lasted for quite some time and the next morning you could see that some works had been undertaken. There was never a notice for this.

And, when one of the 3 elevators was not working, the staff prioritized people waiting to go to the rooftop bar over the paying guests who were waiting to get to our rooms! I'm pretty sure I was generating more revenue for the hotel during my stay then the bar guests. I frequently had to wait over 15 minutes to go up to my room, or to go down to the lobby.  The staff joked about the elevator not working, that they frequently break, and that they should have installed a better brand of elevator. It took over 2 days for the elevator to be fixed!  During one breakfast, we found pieces of plastic floating in the container of milk that we were served. When we showed it to our server, they were very nonchalant about it and simply gave us another -- no apology, nothing.

When I first walked into the boutique-style hotel and went into the room, my first thought was \"I should have booked at the Conrad\"... however, that thought quickly went away.\n\nYes, the rooms are small, but for New York standards, they were actually pretty sizable. I stayed in a two double bed room with plenty of room for me and my best friend. Great sized television, bathroom with hot running water at all times (these days, sometimes that's not a given, even at high brand hotels!), decent sized bathroom and great sized shower.\n\nPros: internet speed was fast and reliable, and loved that I did not have to sign in every night. Also, as mentioned, room size was a pro (although, warning for non-new yorkers, rooms are very small compared to, say, a Hilton or even a Hampton in the west and around Texas... think of room sizes similar to London). Plenty of lifts and never had to wait for more than a minute or two. Easy access to taxis and Ubers always showed up within 3 minutes. And the beds! Probably one of the most comfortable beds I've had in a while in a hotel. Also, air conditioning works great!\n\nCons: in the 14th floor and little to no mobile phone service (but thankfully, wifi was reliable and T-Mobile as free wifi calling which worked great! However, this may be an issue for other travelers). Also, it can get very loud in the lobby area at night due to rowdy parties, but thankfully it's quiet in the rooms! My room didn't have a great view (a brick wall), but this was not a big issue for me, but may be for others. Still plenty of light coming inside. Rooms can be a bit darker, even with all lights on, but nothing too terrible.\n\nOverall, a pleasant stay. For the location, the size of the rooms and the price can't be beat! Hilton diamond member and had great service from the staff\n\nPlease be advised: diamonds, there is no lounge at this hotel. But honestly, given that I was out and about the entire day, I later admitted to myself that I would not have even had time to enjoy the lounge.

I paid for a upgraded \"high floor\" view. They put me on the 22nd floor, which they said was their highest. The room had a beautiful view of the empire state building, but the noise ... They told me beforehand that the room was right below their rooftop bar and that I might hear \"a little\" noise. Little was an understatement. Listen, I love to have fun and don't mind a little noise - I don't book hotels in NYC Memorial Day weekend for a \"quiet stay\" but the constant thud of base from above from about 12 pm to 1 am Friday, Saturday, and Sunday was just a bit much. I really couldn't stay in my room during the day just to chill and relax - you have to turn up the TV loud to drown out the noise. At least one night I was trying to go to sleep before 1 AM - not happening with all that music. By the end of it I had bags under my eyes. For the amount of money I was paying per night to stay there, I don't expect that level of noise nightly - ya'll need that sound proofing asap.\n\nAlso - the breakfast buffet was a little weak. Their process for seating is a little strange, they have a perfectly good back area to seat buffet guests but instead go through this off greeting process which takes unnecessary time. The food was mediocre for a what I would expect from a Hilton brand. There weren't many people at all  at the restaurant yet the staff seemed to be hustling. They weren't very attentive to the buffet, food ran out and was not replaced speedily. Fruit was kinda stale - bananas were days old and had brown\/black parts throughout when I tried to eat it. Bacon was fine though. Potatoes were a average. All around rather low quality for a Hilton imo.\n\nThe rooftop bar itself though is pretty awesome and convenient for a fun time if you're staying at the hotel. Also the hotel's location and proximity to other NYC things to do is good.\n\nSo, in sum ... PROs - location, rooftop bar, clean room, nice view on high floors. CONs - noise level on high floors interferes with sleep, breakfast is meh. Between the noise and and the sub-par breakfast I can't say I recommend you stay here unless there's some sort of special. For the amount I paid, I wasn't completely satisfied, especially about the noise. If you ARE going to stay here, request a floor with a view but DO NOT accept the 22nd floor, or bring some earplugs.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

There are \"chairs\" but not anything I would sit in for longer than a minute. The bed itself was saggy and the hotel desperately needs to put in new mattresses. I could barely sleep on it. All the furniture looked tired and worn and the wear and tear is most notable in the bathroom. The wood part of the sink was warped and the neon overhead light looked like it was about to fall off. There is absolutely no counterspace to put your stuff. As other reviewers mentioned, water will leak out from the shower to the outer floor, the door is no use in keeping the water inside.

I called the front desk and they said the entire building has an issue and it was being fixed. Nothing offered to compensate for the trouble like a free breakfast.

Having previously stayed uptown we wanted to stay in a new area when visiting with our two children (aged 12 and 9.) \n\nI had been attracted to the roof top bar and then I realised under 21s are not even allowed in a bar so I emailed the hotel to see if we could get a room overlooking the ESB as the kids would not be able to see the view - unfortunately didn't not get a reply from the hotel.\n\nWhen we arrived hotel staff were very friendly and welcoming. We were told all family rooms were at the back of the hotel. As we opened our door we were met with perhaps the most underwhelming view ever - a brick wall!! As a result the room was so dark and we had to have all the lights on at all times.\n\nThe pictures of trip advisor are not a true reflection of the room we stayed in. \n\nOn the plus side the room was clean and functional and the beds were comfy.

The room was also quiet - brick walls don't make much noise at night!! \n\nThe hotel is nicely located and we enjoyed spending time around the Flatiron building. It's also well placed for a walk uptown or downtown.\n\nThe three star review is not really a criticism rather an indication of how underwhelming the hotel was for us as a party.

I reached out to the property directly in hopes of help, but they never got back to me like they had said. I arrived on a Friday beating terrible weather that caused major air delays. I arrived around 11am and front desk held my bag. Went across the street where a chipotle and Dunkin' Donuts are located and had a little breakfast and some lunch. Came back and asked how I could access the gym, they told me it was unlocked downstairs. So I headed down and was about to hit my first set, and my phone rings. My room is ready! Awesome, I go grab my bag and hit the room. It was NYC small, but just fine. I went to set up my devices on wifi and to charge while I went to the gym, but the internet is down. Oh no, here we go.... called front desk and they sent a maintenance guy, \"Nick\". He identified and fixed the problem quickly, was super friendly and even provided some recommendations while he was fixing the router. This guy is a great asset to the property and was very helpful. His actions caused me to disregard the earlier issues I had experienced prior to arrival and consider this a 5 star stay.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

It\u2019s really well located, on 26th Street, between 7th & 6th Ave.  Easy walking distance to Penn Station\/MSG and handy for the 1 & 9 (Red) metro line.\n\nI love the clever cotton reel Mondrian in reception.  The fresh flowers in the lobby are always spectacular. Check in is always efficient and friendly and I\u2019ve many times been allowed to check in early on arrival in the morning, if my room is available.   They have a great driver service to JFK.  It\u2019s always pretty easy to get a taxi outside.\n\nYou need a key to go up in the elevators \u2013 so it feels safe.  This hotel is very good about not giving out room numbers.  My colleague and I always test them as we check in on different days. They will dial a room for you, but won\u2019t give the number out.\n\nThe restaurant located downstairs is good and has a nice ambience.  I really like the breakfast. Rooftop bar nice too, when warm enough.\n\nThe size of bedroom is dependent on it\u2019s placing. Rooms at the back of the hotel, with no view, appear to be larger.  Suits me \u2026 I\u2019d trade the view for a larger quieter room with no road noise!  Black out blinds are great.  The room has air con that works.\n\nThe rooms are perhaps not the brightest, the d\u00e9cor is quite dark at times, but the white bedding brightens it up.  I don\u2019t love the dark blue carpet and won\u2019t be sorry when they change this. There\u2019s a Keurig coffee machine in the room which is also a bonus.  The bedroom is an ok size and the bathroom clean, modern and usually a descent size. There\u2019s a full shower unit, I\u2019ve never seen a bath in any of the rooms I\u2019ve stayed in \u2013 just a glass shower. The bathroom has a light that automatically turns on and off at night which is handy. The bathrooms vary, again dependent on your location, some have a larger counter vanity area and others just a small one.  Normally plenty of towels.  The hotel photos on the Trip Advisor site are representative of what you get \u2013 minus the fresh flowers in the room!\n\nPrice wise, I think due to it\u2019s location, this hotel can often be a bit more expensive than other similar properties in it\u2019s category.   \n\nWill definitely be staying here again. Great hotel for a quick trip.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We enjoyed being in a neighborhood, not a tourist zone.  There are plenty of reasonable dining options close by.  We did not eat in the hotel restaurant.

The metro\/subway stations are not that close to the hotel (about 2-3 blocks) so it all depends on what your agenda is and where your business is taking place.   \n\nROOMS:\nThe room was actually very very small.  The lighting was poor and it was impossible to see\/operate the safe (in the closet) without a flashlight as there is no light in the closet and you can't see anything without a flashlight.  If you left the drapes opened, there was zero privacy so everyone in the building across the street could you inside your room.  There were no sheers behind the drapes.  The bathroom was OK, although there was no counter space to put your things on...so they had to be left on the top of the dresser in the room.  Not very convenient to say the least.   The toiletries were very small but replenished every day so that was OK.\n\nThere was a Keurig coffee machine which was nice but no mini fridge to put anything in.  You have to request one to be brought up in the room.  The bed was OK as were the pillows.  The room was very clean.  If you are a light sleeper, you hear everything in the hallway.  We were at the end of the corridor as far away from the elevators you can be and still heard them and all the doors opening\/closing, not the best insulation.  We had a room facing the front of the hotel on the 9th floor and could hear the cars honking & the trucks going by all night....a higher floor at the back of the hotel would be much better (we requested one upon check-in but were told that due to renos taking place there were none available).\n\nThe service was very very good, nothing to complain about.  They were very accomodating on all levels.  Given the amount of money you spend per night, we expected a bit better given we've had better and in better locations in NY for the same price.  That being said, if your business is taking place close by, you should be fine.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

First, even calling to try to make my reservation a couple of months ago was a disaster. For some odd reason that I cannot comprehend, I couldn't get through. It was as if something was wrong with their phone system. I tried literally dozens of times to get through. I would have given up after just a couple of tries, but this was a reservation as part of a wedding block so I was feeling a bit committed to this hotel. Then I had problems with the block, such as availability (when we were still well within the window), pricing was off, and minimum nights stay was incorrect. Basically a disaster. Finally we got the reservation locked in, after a million calls and much wasted time.  Then, nightmare part 2, which I'm still suffering through. My plans have changed and I need to change my arrival date. Over the past 2 days, I have been trying to contact the hotel at their main number and I literally cannot get through. Many many times, it has just rung and rung and rung and then I get a beeping noise and disconnected. Finally last night I was able to get in contact with someone at main guest services and tried to change my reservation. After 25 min of trying, they were unable to get into the system to change my reservation. They suggested I try back AGAIN this morning, which I did. So...again this morning I had to try several times to even get through. After getting through to someone at guest services, SAME THING. She was unable to change my reservation in the system. Said the reservation system was down. She also couldn't get through directly to the hotel, and SHE IS IN GUEST SERVICES!! Even she was blown away and couldn't understand what was going on. If it was just a one-off thing, I'd say whatever...the system goes down every now and then. But this - I have never seen anything like it. I do A LOT of travel for work, and have called hotels a million times. The difficulty I have had with this hotel has been unrivaled. I don't even want to call them again, but I'm forced because I need to change my reservation. Something is seriously wrong here. I hope once I get there, the hotel doesn't suck, but I'm so aggravated already and I haven't even gotten there yet. Not looking good.

We stayed here in particular because it was close to Time Square which is where an event was that we drove down for. We stayed here and payed extra for a room with a view and a roof top view of the city located at the roof top bar which says nothing about being closed on Saturdays or in the winter season nor to the fact that we would not even have access to that floor.  These things were important to me because this was my friends first time in NY. The room was on the 17th in a corner no view, the room was ridiculously small, the office chair in the room looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months there were so many food crumbs inside the side cracks, there was construction above that started at 9 in the morning with spackeling and sanding then at 930 the smoke alarms go off. Let me remind you we were out all night the night before for an event and had every intention of sleeping as late as possible. The alarms were so loud because the room was so small we were forced to check out early at 930 and had to walk down 17 flights of steps because the alarms began giving my guest a panic attack. FYI the rooms are supposed to equipped with flashing smoke alarms for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Our room did not have a working alarm for someone with those limitations if it had one apt all.\nI doubt we would be staying at another Hilton when we come back in May","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Carpeted room, I prefer hardwood or tile since it is much easier to keep clean.  Tile in shower could have been cleaner, and one one morning, had to take a cold shower at 7:00.  For some reason the water never warmed up.  To be fair, I didn't notify the staff, as I had to get to the office, and it only happened once.  Limited interaction with staff, but all interaction was positive.  Provided bottled water at check in, however, no way to keep it cold, since the refrigerator is used for the honor bar.

At one in the morning. Not cool. My daughter and I checked in late on Friday, March 3rd. We were so tired. \n\nIn the hall of the 5th floor, the location of our original room, there was a strong smell of pot. When we got to our room, we noticed that smoke was coming from under the door. The smell and smoke were terrible. I put a towel under the door to try and stop it. I could plainly hear the girl next door coughing and arguing with a man. \n\nMy 17 year old daughter finally told me that we needed to call the front desk. I did and they sent \"security\" up to check it out. This amounted to a man knocking on their door asking them if they were smoking. The man next door said \"Is there no smoking allowed?\" (All through the closed door). The security man said that no, smoking wasn't permitted. The man in the room shouted that he was in the shower and to go away. The security guy left and the people next door sprayed cologne that smelled really bad in an effort to cover up the smell of pot. The front desk called and asked if I wanted them to spray neutralizer in the room and I said I would prefer to move rooms. \n\nBecause of the late hour, we got moved but to a smaller, handicap accessible room with no counter space in the bathroom and a smaller bed. I was happy to move but when we got up early the next morning for her college visit, we were very tired.\n\nI was disappointed to know that when a guest breaks a hotel rule as well as the laws of New York State, absolutely nothing happens to them. We were inconvenienced and they got stoned. Somehow I failed to see this as equitable.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I felt welcomed from the moment I walked in.  I stay at many Hilton properties when in New York City for business, this was my first time at this location, and now my favorite! Marion  and Charles, who work the front desk, recommended a great place for dinner and for dessert.  They're recommendations were spot on and I was not disappointed.   The location is great....close enough to Penn Station that I walked to hotel once my train arrived.     There are plenty of great restaurants and bars close by.  I walked outside at night, and felt very safe .","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
