She was so pleasant and friendly. I had a long day as I had just left a funeral. I guess she sensed it and immediately sparked up a conversation that resulted in a good laugh and an exchange of encouraging words. I can tell she has an amazing rapport with the regulars because in my short conversation with her a few people walked up just to say hi to her.

But what absolutely is not fine is their supposed room service menu which I ordered a surf and turf off - to the tune of 103 usd. It arrives cold and in cardboard container with plastic cutlery that is impossible to cut the food with. Photos attached \n\nThis is completely unacceptable under any circumstance. When I called the front desk all I got is well it's your problem and this is how we do room service as it's a third party provider! At least I managed to get some real cutlery to eat my very cold steak and lobster finally.\n\nSeriously though? This is acceptable? The menu listed room service - so l expect room service not a take out that I could have ordered better and cheaper through Uber eats. The attitude of the front desk manager frankly is the worst issue here. He absolutely didn\u2019t care. And refused to take responsibility for what is listed by Hyatt as their room service. The food didn\u2019t  even come with what was listed as sides of mashed potatoes and beans! I mean really really poor quality and really badly done!\n\nAwful and completely unacceptable. I don\u2019t normally use trip advisor to vent but use it as a memo to remember my stays and meals - this one frankly is best forgotten and am using the platform to vent and warn others of what is a hotel that simply could care less.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

It is a few miles from JFK and I booked a room so that I could get a few hours of sleep between flights. I checked in on-line in the afternoon and was assigned room 816.  When I arrived at the hotel at 1 AM that evening, I checked with the agent at the desk who confirmed that room, gave me a key, and pointed me in the direction of the elevators.  I took the elevator up to the 8th floor, and after walking down several long corridors, found room 816.  I touched the key to the pad on the door, opened the door\u2026and saw toys strewn all across the floor of a dimly-lit room. I swore softly and, wIthout looking further, closed the door and started back down the corridor.  A loud male voice accosted me, \u201cHey you!\u201d,  and as I continued to  retreat, \u201cHey!\u201d,  \u201cHey can\u2019t you hear?\u201d.  I had no idea how this was going to end, but I got to the elevator as quickly as possible and went down to the front desk and explained what had happened to the agent who had checked me in. She apologized and appeared surprised when I asked for another room, far away from this one.  She said she would need to talk to a supervisor, which she did, and then she gave me a new room.  While I was waiting, a highly agitated woman came into the check-in area yelling about someone entering her room where she had two kids and how could this happen and already that day cleaning people had come in without asking her.  I did not volunteer that this someone was me, and she was escorted away to see a supervisor. I got my few hours of sleep and returned to the lobby to check out.  I got an explanation that the family had stayed an extra night, and that somehow no one had entered that information into the hotel\u2019s system, and that the fact that the room was not cleaned and prepared for a new guest was never noted, and that therefore somehow the room was allocated to me even though it was quite occupied, and that this was a rare event (by which I concluded that it was not unheard of as one would hope).","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

On the plus side, the property is quite impressive. Being a newer hotel, it boasts modern facilities and a sleek design that immediately catches your eye. The personal message I received before my arrival was a nice touch, making me feel welcomed even before I stepped foot in the hotel. The proximity to the airport is also a major plus, offering convenience that is hard to beat for travelers.\n\nHowever, it wasn't all smooth sailing. As a Globalist member of the World of Hyatt, I've come to expect a certain level of service and hospitality, which, unfortunately, fell short during this stay. Simple tasks like issuing a working physical key and ensuring the club area's cleanliness were met with difficulty, which was surprising and disappointing. The quality and variety of food and beverages in the club also left much to be desired, detracting from the overall experience.\n\nDespite these setbacks, there were some redeeming factors such as the room upgrade and the overall condition of the hotel. It's clear that there's a lot of potential here, and with some improvements in service and attention to detail, this could be a fantastic option for travelers. Here's hoping that feedback like this can help refine the experience for future guests, making it as outstanding as one would expect from a Hyatt property.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"NONE"}

This so-called airport hotel is located in Jamaica, a Resorts World Casino, some distance from the airport \u2013 and a $25 cab ride either way. \n\nAs well, the hotel does mention it has a shuttle to the train but after asking three different staffers for more details and getting a different answer every time, I just went for another expensive cab ride. Definitely not coming back to this property. \n\nThe hotel itself, beyond these criticisms, was fine. I liked the little marketplace that was open late (I\u2019d come in on an evening flight), didn\u2019t have time to check out the rest of the options attached to the casino (it does not have its \u201cown\u201d restaurant or bar).\n\nI wasn\u2019t thrilled that on the morning of my departure, the shower essentially didn\u2019t work \u2013 the water came out in droplets. It wasn\u2019t a case of low water pressure but no water pressure. Unfortunately there wasn\u2019t time to call down and ask \u2013 so I didn\u2019t get a shower at all. That\u2019s pretty ridiculous. \n\nAnd speaking of \u201ccalling down to the desk,\u201d  I\u2019ve been wondering how long it will take before hotels start to eliminate a phone in the room. I didn\u2019t mind, when I had a question for the front desk, googling the phone number. But when you call you\u2019re directed to send a text. Are you kidding me? \n\nGenerally, Hyatt has been my go-to hotel of choice and certainly there\u2019s not much of that at JFK (the TWA is so expensive and not terribly well run at that). This was a disappointing stay and there\u2019s reason to try it again. If you just want a simple overnight at a JFK airport hotel, you probably won\u2019t find it. Next trip I\u2019ll just fly out of a different airport. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Food such as bagels, lox, salmon, cream cheese, hash potatoes, scrambled eggs, sausage links, fruits, pastries and cereals are provided along with bottled OJ, soda and an all in one espresso coffee machine.\n\nThere is mini shuttle service that can take you to\/from the A train subway which is a five minute walk across the street off Rockaway. The A train departs frequently about every 20 min from Rockaway station and will take you about 45-50 minutes to Midtown Manhattan  and Times Square. There is also a bus stop across the casino that will take you into Queens or a connector to LGA airport (google your destination for map).\n\nHotel rooms are clean and very spacious, from king size, 2 Queens or select King size + pullout sofa upon request. Bell service is provided and taxi limos are provided to airport destination ( or just use Uber\/Lyft).\n\nThere is a SugarFactory restaurant and select fast food spots in the cafeteria (Popeyes, Panda,etc). After 10 pm, might as well take a uber to a diner nearby.\n\nIn a nutshell, Hyatt is a great spot for individuals who want to be near JFK, while exploring Times Square and playing some slot machines for the week.

Rooms are nicely appointed & the Regency lounge has a good variety of food. Would stay here again if I had more than a 16-hour layover at JFK. Overall a fantastic stay & I would consider staying here as a base for access to Brooklyn, with the A train nearby.\n\nPros:\n\u2022 The room was clean, and housekeeping was seen deep cleaning each room & the floors smelled like Clorox. The room passed the blacklight test.\n\u2022 Everyone we encountered was nice & greeted us. Clive went above & beyond our toiletry offering to bring us a microwave & larger fridge for our stay.\n\u2022 Chromecast functionality works well. Easy to connect & no problems with streaming through the Hyatt app.\n\u2022 The Hyatt Regency lounge was nicely stocked & had 24-hour access. The lounge included Natalie's Carrot & Orange juice, something I have never seen at any hotel lounge.\n\nCons:\n\u2022 No hotel shuttle & not close to JFK. The Lyft ride was 15 minutes & cost $27. For those looking for a short layover hotel, this is not ideal.\n\u2022 The water took a long time to warm up (in both showers). The first morning it ran for almost 8 minutes before it was warm. The 2nd night the bathroom near the hallway warmed up faster, however, the main bathroom took a long time. Not sure what the issue is.\n\u2022 The walls are thin. You can hear people outside on the street, and people in the hallway. We had a connecting room & could hear our neighbor's entire conversation.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

New, nice decor, nice touches. \nBut - it falls short as an airport hotel. I stayed here twice when I needed a hotel near the airport, but only because I had Hyatt points. If I was paying I would not choose this as an airport hotel. First, there is no shuttle. I\u2019ve never stayed at other airport hotels that do not have some kind of shuttle service. Second, the food offering is poor for those who might arrive late or leave early. There is no 24-hour room service (I arrived at around 1am, so this mattered). Room service only starts at 11am so if you want breakfast, it\u2019s get to the club lounge or grab something like a bagel\/fruit salad from the Starbucks\/grab and go (which is 24 hours I believe). Third, the actual restaurants all seem to be in the casino complex next door which is a pain if you just want to go down from your room to eat something. There\u2019s nothing else in walking distance. Probably a great hotel if you\u2019re there for gambling. \n\nAlso weirdly Uber\/Lyft (see: lack of shuttle) get confused by the address and keep wanting to take you somewhere round the back (closed gates so no can do). Maybe the hotel can liaise with them to get customers to the right place.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

After a few minutes another desk agent came to the desk.

On the way down to the front to get keys fixed my husband ran into a guy that was stuck on our floor because his keys would not work and he needed to go up.\nWe were offered late checkout as Explorist but the girl never put it into the system so in the morning my husband went down to get coffee and came back to the room he was locked out. He called down to the front and they told us that the late checkout was never entered so our keys deactivated at normal checkout time.\nLastly, if you are handicapped and are thinking of staying here before heading to JFK make sure you have a plan to get to the airport. The aquaduct metro station going in the direction of the airtrain is not accessible so you can ride the shuttle to Jamaica and catch the airtrain from there, get an uber, or go to the aquaduct racetrack metro stop ride it back toward the city one stop then get off and xome back two more stops to get to airtrain stop.\nIf I had to do it again I'd probably just stay at the Hilton","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"NONE"}

At peak season I paid almost $500 with taxes, and I received no complimentary breakfast. There are many hotels in NYC that will give it to you for less per night. I suggest you go find one.\n\nAs for the hotel and staff, this location is nice and clean and the staff is friendly if not frazzled by the volume of guests. Bathroom doors tend to fall off the rails (barn door style). ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"NONE"}

I knew there was no shuttle available, but that still remains a shame. While a handprint on the wall shouldn't be a big deal, it was certainly a turnoff and the air ducts that didn't have covers gave the room a shabby feel. The bed too soft to the point you sank down to the springs. The last negative piece was needing multiple requests and over 30 minutes for 2 bottles of water to be delivered to the room. \nOn the positive side, the doorman was the brightest spot for this hotel.

We arrived at the hotel late at night and we were given keys to a room. We went up to our room on the 8th floor and neither of the keys worked. We went back downstairs and explained that our keys didn\u2019t work and after a few moments they issued new keys. We went back upstairs and yet again the keys didn\u2019t work. We went back downstairs and the desk agent did something and handed the keys back and said they should work now but if they don\u2019t you\u2019ll have to wait for someone to reset the lock. This was extremely frustrating to go back and for the multiple times at 11:00 at night.  What was most disappointing about this experience was that neither of the agents working the desk ever apologized for the issues we were having. The check-in experience also did not include any explanation of the property itself. We asked about dining and was told the sugar factory was open until midnight. Upon walking over the sugar factory at 11PM they stated the restaurant had closed. The whole experience felt very disingenuous. \n\nOtherwise the room that we were put in was excellent. It was clean, reasonable size, and had updated fixtures and amenities. The location of the hotel is perfect for a flight at JFK. We went to the market near the hobby and had an amazing experience with the three employees working. They helped us select food items and offered to heat them up for us to enjoy in our rooms. They were the highlight of our stay! \n\n","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Despite JFK being the premier international gateway for the East Coast, the airport is plagued by terrible hotel accommodations. Save for the TWA Hotel, the Hyatt Regency is the only quality airport hotel serving JFK. It\u2019s also the only casino in NYC and uses it\u2019s position to leverage Manhattan level pricing in Queens, even outside the weekends and holidays. \n\nFrustratingly, the hotel still commands high prices despite being one of the few airport hotels to NOT offer an airport shuttle. However, it\u2019s adjacent to Aqueduct Racetrack A-Train Station with a pedestrian bridge that connects to the casino and provides free shuttle service to\/from Aqueduct-N. Conduit. The A-Train is the longest NYC subway line and provides access to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the area and the casino, there\u2019s a heavy presence of private security, NYPD, and occasionally even federal agents. The casino has multiple F&B outlets for hotel guests to utilize. The Regency Club food quality is superior to others in the US, but the hotel itself has no restaurant and the breakfast quality in the lounge is not a sufficient substitute.\n\nRoom hardware is fantastic with suites even get motorized shades and Le Labo bath products, typically reserved for luxury hotel brands like Park Hyatt. Service is great too especially when NYC service culture can be questionable. Friendly overtures which are rare for the city can be found at the Hyatt Regency JFK.\n\nExcellent recognition as a Globalist member and implementation of the World of Hyatt program. US properties tend to fall short on delivering to the large base of domestic World Hyatt members, but the Hyatt Regency JFK exceeded expectations. For going above and beyond, I want to acknowledge Alex for allowing me to check in early by providing an alternate room when my original room wasn\u2019t available and Zeena for arranging my original accommodation to be available at the earliest possible time. Carlos and Charlie have been indispensable as bellmen. Also Jeffrey, Jonathan, and all the wonderful FD and Regency Club staff have provided great service. 8th Floor housekeeping have been flawless and provided 5 star service.

Never again.\n\nWe arrived at JFK around 11 pm, thanks to a 90 minute delay in getting a landing gate.   I called the hotel to locate the shuttle service, something nearly ALL of the major chains provide free of charge. \n\nFirst it took 10 minutes for someone to answer the phone.  Then we were told that Hyatt does NOT have an airport shuttle.  What followed was as bizarre as it was  bewildering.\n\nWe were told to take the A train, not to the stop for ALL the other shuttles, but to stay on to the end of the line and transfer to the Howard Beach Station of the NYC subway system and wait there for the A train.  Then take that to the Aqueduct station, go to a meeting point where we will be taken to the hotel.\n\nA bit of background.  I know that station b\/c I lived in the neighborhood for two decades and was there when they built that station.  It is located in a primarily commercial section nearly of whose stores are closed at that time and is practically deserted.  \n\nSo here we are, two senior citizens, with 4 pieces of luggage, waiting on an isolated station in a system that has recently been the subject of a mass shooting, stabbings, multiple assaults and people being pushed to the tracks.  All to wait for a train which is notorious for criminal activity.  Why not just put a target on our backs.\n\nNext we are to lug 4 pieces of luggage off the Air Train, onto the A train, off at Aqueduct  and to an undescribed meeting place in a location we know nothing about.  \n\nIt gets better.  We took a cab whose driver was situationally challenged and cost us $36.  Upon arrival, we were told that for an additional $30 - $25 if you pay cash - you can get a ride to the airport the next morning. We paid the cash.\n\nBreakfast? The others give complimentary breakfasts.  Here, the Hyatt costs you $25pp - a total of $50.  So, for what the others give gratis, Hyatt costs you an extra $100- something you should add to the cost of your stay.\n\nWhen I travel later this month, I have decided NOT to stay at a Hyatt - there's a price to pay for non-performance.  Oh, I wrote to Hyatt and asked for my points back.  I'm still waiting for a response.  \n\nMake your own decision where to stay.  I've made mine.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":23449150,"title":"Great Airport Hotel but No Shuttle Bus","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-07-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Besides Grand Hyatt SFO, Hyatt Regency JFK might be the best U.S. airport hotel I have ever stayed at, in part because it might not be entirely correct to call it an airport hotel.  I found the hotel to have more in common with Las Vegas casino resorts than a NYC airport hotel, but if I had a long layover at JFK I would consider returning.\n\nHyatt Regency unfortunately does not have a shuttle bus and is about 10 minutes away from the airport compared to the numerous \u201creal\u201d airport hotels which are 5 minutes or less.  After considering the cost of taxi back and forth it can eat into the value of staying at HR if intending to use it only for a brief overnight.\n\nI booked the entry level room and I was proactively upgraded to an Executive Suite as Globalist guest.  The room layout was almost identical to Grand Hyatt SFO hence the reference to it above, the room had two full bathrooms (one of them with bathtub separate from a stand-alone shower) and minimal use of carpet which I loved.  We had sunset views of the city sky line far in the distance from our 9th floor room.  Surprisingly the bathroom amenities were not the regular Pharmacopia found at other HRs; normally when hotels deviate from brand standards it\u2019s for a cheaper variety, but here it was rather Le Labo to give a small taste of Park Hyatt instead.  \n\nThe Club Lounge near reception was open and we had breakfast and happy hour there.  The space was not very large so I wonder if it can get full at times but it was not during our brief stay.  Breakfast did not stand out one way or another except they had smoked salmon which was a plus.  \n\nFor happy hour I am normally not a big fan of lounges in North America but at least once again it was not an overly crowded zoo therefore it could make for a decent place to relax and have a drink, which included canned mixed drinks but strangely the wines were in cans too.  There was a small salad station and bite size appetizer warm dishes which I found to be above average for a lounge in this part of the world, especially at JFK airport.  \n\nIf I did not order room service, my stay might have been close to perfect.  Unfortunately more than one hour after ordering we still had not received anything and when I called the restaurant there was no answer so I called reception and they could not get a hold of the restaurant either.  Eventually someone called me back to indicate that they had no staff available to bring my food to the room hence the delay, and that they would send a bell boy instead.  When the food arrived I was surprised to see that it was in plastic boxes in a bag rather than usual room service tray or cart.  \n\nIf I only had a layover of less than 12 hours I might look at more convenient alternatives closer to JFK airport than HR, but if having close to 24 hours (needing late check-out for an evening flight) and spending lots of time in the hotel, I would definitely pay again the 20-25 USD Uber each way because the value of staying at HR is excellent, I know my odds of suite upgrades will be better than other hotels, and HR has a respectable lounge.  So this is a hotel I can recommend when being aware of the location drawback for people not using the hotel as a casino resort but more as an airport hotel.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

It was wonderfully quiet during my stay.\n\nThe signage directing to the front door of the hotel could be improved, mostly for travel in daylight hours.  The hotel sign at the start of the drive up to the canopy is a little low in height and GPS was guiding past that entrance.  GPS was easily ignored at night with the lighted signage guiding the way.

A bunch of amateurs running a hotel. Stayed one night with room service before a flight out. Warned the hotel several times that it appeared that my $100 room service bill had turned into an over $3000 bill. I told the room service attendant that the bill seemed wrong but she ensured me the number above the signature line was the amount to pay and the over 3k number underneath was Hyatt points. I am a Hyatt locality member so it could have made sense .\n\nThe next day on my check out bill I saw the 3k again and warned the front desk. I was again assured this was an oversight and that there was no hold on my card.\n\nAfter I flew to Rome and the next day I got a noticed of my credit card company that The Hyatt at JFK at charged me for over $3400 , the $300 plus stay and room service in addition to the over $3k I had warned to hotel it appeared to be charged twice! Needless to say that you don\u2019t want a 3K amount pending on your card when you travel.\n\nI called the hotel . Billing department always had an answering machine on and never replied. Hotel number was picked up by someone remotely and when she picked up the phone (after many attempts without anyone answering) she had to transfer me to the Hyatt and I got disconnected. When I called back she blamed me for getting disconnected. I didn\u2019t do anything other than listening to music and hearing someone picking up the phone and disconnect me.\n\nBut sure blame the guest for being stupid , hey it was also my mistake they you grossly overcharged me by 10 fold and I probably should have told the hotel another 20 times that they were making a mistake.\n\nAlso my mistake that your business center printer had no drum in it. I should bring one next time when I am staying at a Hyatt. Also my mistake that I had stained linen\u2026 will bring my own when I stay at a Hyatt next time. And how stupid of me when I call the hotel number to think that someone that answers the phone is actually at the hotel instead of answering a phone remotely! I thought only 5 bedroom B&B\u2019s in off season did that. \n\nGrow up! Run your hotel professionally. Apologize for your MASSIVE mistake and correct it immediately . Not only that compensate the stay. This is such a gross mistake! Train your staff so that they understand what they are looking at and know what to do. From checking in till check out no-one had a clue what they were looking at or even how to activate a door key. \n\nDo yourself a favor and stay at another Hyatt and let staff explain you how to run a hotel. Even for an opening year these mistakes are beyond anything one should expect.\n\nStill the problem has not been resolved , probably it will end up disputing the charges. Swallowing the fact that I spend many hours of my well deserved vacation to deal with the inability of a hotel to manage things correctly and likely a lawsuit because in any capacity is a 10 fold overcharge and the issues it is causing me during my travels sufficient to have the hotel pay for their stupidity !\n\nThank you Hyatt JFK for showing how children manage a hotel!","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

All the amenities were great.\n\nMy issue was the location - not he way there I got into a stand up row with the taxi driver as he couldnt find it (and wouldn't take my directions) and he got very aggressive. On the way back I asked for a Town car - and got a beat up car that I would not class as a Town car. I had also asked for a taxi with a card machine but the one I got didn't have that so we had to stop by a booth to pay before I travelled.  Why this hotel does not have a courtesy bus I do not know - but the lack of one will mean I do not stay here again.\n\nThat is a shame as the hotel is lovely.

The taxi from JFK battled to find it and so too the UBER driver to collect me the following morning.  The best way to get back to the airport, particularly for early morning flights, is to ask the hotel to call the taxi service they use most because otherwise you may end up paying UBER for a pick up that doesnt actually take place. I took a taxi that had been called by the hotel to pick up other guests who didnt show. The rooms and bathrooms are really nice and new;  very comfortable new beds. I had issues with temperature controls in 2 rooms and moved between them as maintenance corrected the issues. Overall, this hotel provides a great alternative to the other very old hotels serving JFK. My room was on the 5th floor facing the entrance of the hotel and it was amazingly quiet. I would definitely stay at this hotel again now that I know how best to deal with the issue of finding it.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

It was an invite based on prior slot play at RWCNYC. I had inquired to RWC on their pet policy with regards to pets being allowed on the casino floor. I was assured via email that there would be no issue and I just had to pay the pet fee $75 and fill out the pet policy form. I frequent Hard Rock Casino inTampa and I never had any problems. So when I get to RWC I proceed to casino floor my first night, first they ask is my pet an emotional support dog, I said know but show security the email that was sent to me from the customer service rep from RWC. They allow me onto the floor, but the next night I\u2019m hit with resistance because the security guards were not told that I could bring my pet on the floor so they called their security manager, Mr Laranzo (I don\u2019t know his last name, nor would he give it) So I spent 25 mins lostening to this man explain the rules and such! I had emailed RWC prior to my traveled so that I would not have this type of situation! The security staff said that if they allow me to bring my pet chihuahua on the floor, then everyone would want to bring their pets! I read the policy on the website and also emailed CS two weeks prior just so incidents like this would not happen! The security manager and their staff were ill advised and both Hyatt Jamaica\/RWCNYC need a staff meeting regarding the resorts policy and procedures on pets. My trip was ruined after this exchange and I will not be returning.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I flew red eye and got to the hotel around 7:30am. I was able to check in online and saw that my room was ready. But because I had requested to redeem a club access award in advance, I wanted to check with the front desk and make sure the award was redeemed successfully and that I would have access to the Regency club. Because the funeral wasn\u2019t until the following day, I figured the club access would provide enough food and beverage options, and a quiet place to rest besides my own room. I didn\u2019t feel like venturing out to the casino or outside the hotel in this trip. \nWhen I got to the front desk, Jonathan was courteous and helpful. But he saw the club access was showing up as an extra charge, so he called up the floor manager to help. The floor manager (whose first name might start with an R, wasn\u2019t entirely sure because he didn\u2019t even introduce himself) said I would need to call Hyatt and there was nothing he could do on his end. I was thinking to myself \u201caren\u2019t I at Hyatt? Why couldn\u2019t you help me?\u201d But anyway I was already exhausted so I just called the Explorist line. And the agent said the hotel had to do it on their side and asked me to hand over my cellphone to them. The floor manager took my phone, spoke to the agent who taught him how to do it on the same computer that he said he couldn\u2019t do anything. In the end everything seemed fine, but unfortunately that wasn\u2019t the end of it. \nAfter checking into my room, I figured since I was checked in, I wanted to check out the club since it was still breakfast time. Jonathan who happened to be at the club checked me in after I entered the club. I sat down to get something to drink and some fruits. But then five minutes later the same floor manager walked in and came to me and said I wasn\u2019t supposed to come in for breakfast until tomorrow morning, so either I left right now or I couldn\u2019t come back for breakfast tomorrow.  I was shocked and didn\u2019t even know how to respond. I was so upset but didn\u2019t want to make a scene. I said ok and then he just walked away. I felt so humiliated by the way he spoke to me and how I was treated. \nI have been loyal to the Hyatt brand and got to Explorist status. But if that\u2019s how I am going to be treated, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever want to stay at another Hyatt property ever again. ","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The receptionist was friendly and the bellhop offered to take my bags to my room even after I told him that I had given all my cash to the taxi driver.   I am globalist and was given given a corner room on the top floor, but I doubt that it is bigger than the others.  The room itself is very nice.  The beds, pillows and linens are very comfortable.  Although the hotel has been open for about 5 weeks, there are very few people here.  During my morning walk through the lobby, I encountered about 5 other guests.  There are many more employees than guests.  My wife and I had our complementary breakfast in the Regency Club room and it appeared as though we were the first people in there this morning even though it had been open for over 2 hours.  The breakfast was adequate and the staff were very nice.  One big downside of staying on the top floor with so few guests is that it takes a very long time for hot water to make it up to the top floor.  We had to let the shower run for about 20 minutes before it became warm.  Another downside is the lack of a hotel shuttle.  It cost us $30 by taxi from JFK.  I told the taxi driver I wanted to go to the Hyatt Regency.  He had never been to the Hyatt Regency JFK so he assumed I wanted to go to the Hyatt downtown.  Luckily I had the address loaded into my phone and I was able to show him how to get here.  TIP: have the address available for the taxi driver and check your phone to make sure  you are being taken on the correct route.  Another downside is that the safe did not appear to work.  Since there are very few people here it seems to be a safe place to be during a pandemic.   Overall, this hotel is very nice.  I would definitely stay here again since it is a very good use of Hyatt free night certificates.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Our cab ride to a nearby Hyatt Regency was circuitous, to put it mildly, as the driver of this dirty vehicle looped far afield before dropping us at the front entrance. Thankfully, situation changed dramatically for the better as soon as we entered the gleaming doors of the clean, fresh and welcoming new Hyatt at JFK. Reception staff went out of their way to swiftly check us into a beautiful upgraded suite at the end of a quiet hall where we could catch our breath and clean up. A quick walk through the hotel before dinner revealed a hotel equipped with modern conveniences, crisp security and a well-appointed Regency Club staffed by friendly and helpful people. Check-out next morning was a breeze, with bell desk handling bags and a smooth, professional driver for return to JFK for our early flight.

No comp room. I had planned on leaving work (which I  did), getting a car and going straight to the hotel to rest and nap for a few hours then get up and play at the resort. I was very excited that I did go play for a lil while expecting to come back to the room for a nap and then shower and get ready to go back to the resort for a night of FUN. Upon returning to my room approximately around 6:30, which was VERY cold to the point that I wanted to turn OFF the air conditioner but I couldn't because there seem to be some type of malfunction. I couldn't even take a shower because I didn't want to risk getting sick. I called down to the front desk and told them about the A\/C and this open panel box in my bathroom with some type of device hanging out of it. Pics are attached. I spoke to Heidi (Manager) who said that someone would be up. I waited for an hour and NO ONE came. I then called again and she informed me that she put the claim in but if I wanted to leave the room just give permission for them to go in. I wasn't doing that. Heidi then told me that someone would be up in about 15 mins. I waited another HOUR and NO ONE came. I then went downstairs to see her and showed her the pic of the open panel and the reading of the air conditioning meter. She told me that she would switch my room. The keys to my room was delivered, I went to the new room, 521 from 539 and guess what??? The key did NOT work. I finally got inside about 10pm. I couldn't get enough rest because my body was tired. I love nice hotels (which yours is) and I feel my planned day definitely didn't go as planned because of the poor service and poor attention given to my needs. Again, I was excited to see your hotel open and wanted to be one of the 1st to patronize and use it the opening weekend. I paid over $400.00 for that ONE night and was denied a late check out. I wondered had I experienced this treatment if I was a white man or old white lady? And I understand that's kinks would happen due to it being new. Attached are pics I took of 2 of the problems. I wish you all the best on the future and do hope and know that things will get better.\nThank you\n\nWaliek Crandall \n718 813 9972.\n\n","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}
