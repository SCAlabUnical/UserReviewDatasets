{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":99447,"title":"Awesome! Will Stay Again","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2024-04-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I feel that any poor reviews are from people who do not have proper expectations and are unfamiliar with NYC and what constitutes a GOOD hotel. First off, Manhatten is old. The buildings are old. There are 2 million people living just in Manhattan, and it is doubled to 4 million people during work days. Space is prime. If you can find a hotel room that is not only affordable, but clean, with its own private bathroom, AND in a fabulous location then you have A BIG WIN!! The La Quinta fits all of the above. It is a BIG WIN! Every employee we interacted with were polite and helpful. The woman who runs the morning breakfast room was exceptionally kind and hard-working. She must prepare hot food and keep restocking and cleaning in a small space for many people every day - and she really deserves a raise! We upgraded our room to the King Bed, and the upgrade was worth every penny. We scored a room that was MASSIVE by NYC standards! Meaning, we had a tile hall vestibule to enter the room [handy for our wet umbrellas on rainy days], a separate area with a writing desk, two small closets [we called them \"his & hers\"], and plenty of room to walk all around the bed [this is seriously a big deal in NYC]. We had packed light, so we had no issue finding room for things, but if you bring a big load of clothes and other stuff you will need to use your suitcase as your storage drawer. [PACK LIGHT] \n\nWe had a good chuckle at the tiny bathroom with a sink barely the size of my two hands [washing your face is an adventure - and you might as well combine it with taking your shower]. Again, this is all NORMAL for a budget hotel in an old NYC building. What is important is that everything inside our room was spotlessly clean [older, yes, but CLEAN]. Our huge King-sized bed had a new mattress and was very comfortable. The small window unit kept the room appropriately heated or cooled as needed to the temperature we set. Because we were on the 2nd floor if someone smoked outside the front door of the hotel we would have to shut off the unit or it pulled in the cigarette smoke. This was only an issue 2 times out of 9 days. \n\nYes, the elevator is very tiny and slow [NORMAL for an old NYC building]. We were on the second floor, and always used the stairs. So, if you can walk the stairs, I would recommend simply asking for a room on a lower floor and don't use the elevator. \n\nThe location of this hotel is priceless. Just a half block to gorgeous Central Park - which is a destination to explore all on its own.  a couple blocks north to the Natural History Museum, and a quick half-block walk to the 72nd Street Central Park subway station which is served by the B Train on weekdays, the C train all days of the week [except late nights], and the A train during late nights only. You can get everywhere you need to go from this station because the trains take you to Penn Station which literally connects you to everything else [subway\/metro, Long Island Railroad, and bus lines]. \n\nWe stayed at the La Quinta for 8 nights, so we bought a 1-week unlimited subway pass on our second day for $34 [each person needed their own pass] which covered all our rides to anywhere, and it saved us so much money [otherwise each ride is $4.60, so get yourself an unlimited pass!]. This hotel is located in a very safe, desirable Mid-Town West Side area just 4 blocks away from Lincoln Center [we walked one evening to a Metropolitan Opera performance], multiple delicious restaurants, and bakeries, and if you like to walk everywhere like us, then it is just a 15 min brisk walk [or 20-minute stroll] south to Times Square [we walked to and from our Broadway shows in mere minutes] - however, the hotel feels like a world away from all the chaos and noise of downtown\/broadway\/etc. DO NOT stay down there! [I once paid big bucks to stay at Marriott Times Square and had to endure sirens and street noise all night, plus it was required that I enter and exit through the Times Square madhouse every day. NOT worth it!] The La Quinta Central Park hotel is in the middle of a quiet one-way residential street with no traffic. Out of 8 nights, with a window facing the front of the hotel and being close to street level, we only heard a dog bark once, and a siren once from a distance. In other words, nights are peaceful here - which is unusual for Manhatten. \n\nPLEASE prepare yourself to understand that NYC is just like any very big city with millions of people - there is a lot of trash generated and it must be put out at the end of the day for late-night pick-up.  This La Quinta must stack up their garbage bags at the end of the day. And, when you see that, it is a sign they are conscientious about keeping the property free of garbage each day. Just like the inside of the hotel, they keep the sidewalk and hotel entrance very clean. Arrive with appropriate expectations, and you will have a wonderful time. We will absolutely stay here again when we return to NYC, and have already recommended it to friends and family.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My room was SHOCKINGLY small, but okay. Then I turn on the heat and I see black mold in the unit. I was constantly waking up because you can hear all sorts of things from customers in other rooms to the opening and closing of the doors to get to the elevator. And the elevator: one. Tiny. And it takes forever and ever. Housekeeping knocked on my door before 9 *sigh* also\u2026 the lobby is closed at certain times? It\u2019s not clear when those times were but I just thought, really? For all I\u2019m paying to be in a room where two people couldn\u2019t open their suitcases and have room to walk about the room. The benefit was that it really encouraged me to stay out and about. This isn\u2019t a bad review of the *workers* but it is certainly about the hotel. If I hadn\u2019t pre-paid I would have left. The room was generally clean and beds were relatively comfortable.

It was a really nice overnight stay. I was expecting less, but was overall quite pleased. Clean room, but a little run down but it far exceeded what some reviews here may suggest. I'm not paying for fancy. La Quinta is a great value for a stay in the city. I got a comfy bed with more room than I expected. Bath was clean. Linens smelled fresh. Check out time was noon which was more than enough time if I wanted to head out early and circle back for luggage. Location was perfect for my travel itinerary. Having visited The Met early in the day, it was a nice 20-minute walk through high points of interest in Central Park to arrive at La Quinta. If you are up for walking in the city, it's an easy and enjoyable distance to walk to most attractions. I attended a live taping of The Late Show and walked back to the hotel well after 2am and felt safe walking alone. And after a late night, I woke up to La Qunta's FREE BREAKFAST. I was expecting to grab a coffee and a danish and just head out. Instead, I made myself a plate of scrambled eggs, sausage and home fries! Hello! Fuel to start the day! Well done, La Quinta. And that you are dog friendly to boot, makes you deserve even more praise. I hope to be back again soon.

I was actually just happy to have a bed to sleep on as most everything was booked. I got in late, staff was very nice and helpful, and that is about the only nice thing I have to say about this place.  I was not told,(nor saw) a breakfast the next morning. The key cards were not working so staff had to let you into your rooms. My room was tiny.  Double bed, dresser and nightstand with a narrow path to walk around 2 sides of the bed only.  Bathroom was tiny also.  You could sit on the pot and use the sink (and almost the shower) at the same time.  There was a roach in the bathroom.  The shower was probably the best part of the whole room. Big enough for an adult and good water pressure with hot water.  The towels were like new and fluffy.  Bed was very firm.  Window AC unit was struggling to keep room cool. One elevator for 14 floors with approximately 8 rooms to a floor.  The front door was nice and location is half a block walk to Central Park and it is a fairly safe looking neighborhood.  This could be a great place with a little TLC.

On arrival at the hotel, we were informed quite nonchalantly, that our room booked room (a king-size) had been given to other guests, that the company have oversold. We were instead given a smaller room which was very shabby and had faults (Room 908). \n\nAfter complaining to the desk staff we were informed that we would have the room we booked by the second night. We were told to come to the desk at midday to arrange this. Unfortunately, as it was a holiday, we had things to do, booked tours etc and had no time to hang about the lobby. \n\nAs a result, no room change had been arranged and we had to stay in the the shabby 908 for a second night. I complained to a different receptionist who also suggested I come back at midday the following day, which I told him was simply unacceptable.\n\nIt wasn't until we spoke to the receptionist in the morning, a lady called Jasmine, that she presented a solution and proactively helped us secure the king-size room she booked. She admitted that both of the previous receptionists had the facility to help us in the same way but had simply decided not to. On the third night of fifth we were given the room we needed.\n\nFirst of all, this was a very disappointing result overall. We'd carefully chosen the hotel based on photographs which depicted a neat boutique style hotel, not a scrappy, tired establishment with graffiti in the elevator and cracked tiles on the lobby floor, peeling wallpaper, chipped masonry and paint... The photos online are misleading.\n\nThe hotel was a trip to celebrate my birthday, we had travelled a long way and the stress your hotel caused was unnecessary and unkind. Also the first two receptionists passive and unhelpful.\n\nRoom 908 has chipped paint on the walls, no safe key, and a faulty lock on the bathroom door which locks the room from the outside. On the second day, we arrived to find that the room had not been turnover (bed changed), yet there were no towels. We called reception three times over a 90 minute period for new towels to no avail. I had to go down to reception to ask for some to be ready for collection at reception when we returned from dinner.\n\nWe were given a small discount for services but no compensation for being given the wrong room and our booking dishonoured. We are looking for a sincere apology from your company and a refund. We have been to New York on several occasions and this is the very worst accommodation we've stayed at by a very long way.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

You hardly have any space to walk. We only got one double bed and one single bed. We went to the front desk to complain and they said they did not have a room with more beds and tat they were sold out. We asked if they could bring a rollaway bed and they did not have any. We called booking.com. and they did their part by communicating with the hotel and try to solve the issue. I myself worked in hospitality for more than 10 years and work in revenue with the director of revenue. I talked with GEORGE, the hotel manager and I explained that the right thing to do was to accommodate us as they uploaded the wrong inventory in the third party. He acknowledged that the situation was unfair for us but he chose not to help us. One person had to sleep on the floor for 3 nights. The room is dirty and has bugs in it.

The Lobby is small, so once I walked in and there were 5 people with their luggage you felt like you was back at the airport waiting on the long TSA line. There is only one tiny elevator, which fits only 4 people with their luggage. So if you're not in the elevator, you will be waiting a long time for that elevator which was my case after I checked-in. The room seemed like it was cleaned since the bed was made. The room temperature was great once I walked in, but the big issue was that the AC filter cover was rattling. I found out that the reason the AC cover was rattling was because it was broken. As I watched TV in bed I noticed that the lock to the room had been compromised. You could tell someone had forced the door at least if not kicked. After that all you can ask yourself is \"how secure is that lock anymore?\" I can't remember why I picked up the phone to call the front desk but I think it was to complain about the AC being too loud, especially since the room was small and the AC was right next to the bed. When I got off the phone I noticed that the phone was filthy, if I would have noticed that earlier I wouldn't have called to complain. As I continued watching TV I decided to keep looking around the room and noticed the furniture was chipped. I decided to take a look at the TV remote and realized it was also filthy. The next day I noticed I had long brown hair coming off my head in the shower, weird since I have a faded set of hair black hair. That made me think, were the beddings cleaned??? Or did they have long brown hair and that's why I saw long brown hairs? Hot Breakfast, this was something I was looking forward to. I pretty much booked my stay because they had Hot Breakfast, but the quality of the Hot Breakfast was very low. To tell you that my highlights were my waffles I made in the waffle maker & the yogurt I got from the fridge. So, do I recommend a stay there? NOT if management does something to fix my issues. Will I stay there again? I will highly think about it, but IF I do, I will inspect the room once checked-in and then request for another room IF I get another room like my last stay.\u00a0","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

For the remainder of my life I will never stay at another Wyndham property, regardless of location or property type.  Further, I am removing Wyndham properties from the list of approved hotels that our employees may use for business travel.  \n\nThis property was clearly a tenement building and public housing project turned into what is supposed to pass as a hotel.  The one tiny elevator it has services all 14 floors of this hotel and 100% of the six times I needed to get to and from my floor, it was fully occupied by housecleaning staff with two cleaning carts and no room for others in the elevator.  The housekeeping staff (who all look like LaQuinta\/Wyndham long ago destroyed their souls) don\u2019t even look at you when the elevator door opens; they just say No room! and carry on to the next floors while you wait for that one dingy elevator to return.   Getting to the 4th floor or lobby took anywhere from 14 to 20 minutes.  Needless to say, the cleaning staff did not exit the elevator to make room for the guests.  \n\nRoom 407 is their \u201cExecutive Room, King Bed, Corner\u201d and is the best room that this property has to offer at any time.  This shambles of a shoe box-sized room cost $327.57 for the night.  The hallways were strewn with empty coffee cups and assorted debris.  The carpets which appear not to have been changed in my lifetime were filthy, worn, and had bleach stains and other stains of unknown origin.    The ottoman has a large round stain on it that looked like poop or blood.  The air conditioner was a small house air conditioner was damaged and filthy and the air coming out of it smelled like urine.  The lampshade was broken and cracked.  The bathroom had rust and the wrong size tank cover.  The doors and walls were filthy.\n\nThere are only 7 rooms per floor at this hotel because that is what New York City Project Housing provides.  The entire size of my room would fit inside a 1-car garage.  \n\nThis property is located on the upper west side of New York City; one of the most affluent areas in the entire United States.  Mind boggling.  ","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Like most Wyndham properties and NYC hotels in general, the room was small, but that really shouldn't be a factor in judging the room because we're in NYC! We should be out and about and not stretched out in the hotel room. I just wanted to get that out of the way. My bed was quite comfortable and the A\/C was just right so I slept soundly and restfully. Pro tip I got from a fellow hotel guest...the elevator door is kind of wonky sometimes and if you want to make it stops re-opening and stranding you at the lobby you need to hold the button for your floor until it is all the way closed and starting up. I boogied out early to hit the road home, so I didn't have the breakfast options or see the breakfast room. There's a tasty Mexican restaurant called Santa Fe a few doors down where I enjoyed a delicious meal with the fluffiest rice I've ever had. The hotel is a half block down from Central Park, and around the corner from the famed Dakota apartment building where John Lennon lived (for you history\/music buffs). There is no hotel parking. You either need to hope for street parking, or there is a 24 hour public garage you can access .3 miles down the street (find and pre-book NYC parking garages using SpotHero).

It was clean, the housekeeping was amazing, and everyone was helpful.  Alberto was a great help in fixing our TV issues, a long-lost remote control!  I had my mom with me who was excited to have Spanish-speaking staff.  They could be more organized, they stored their cleaning supplies in the hallways, and they needed more staff to keep the eating area neat and tidy.

The TV, the shower\/tub, bathroom, a\/c\/ unit.  The TV actually didn't work at all, but we didn't bother to call down because it wasn't worth it for one night.  The a\/c unit just blows hot or cold air directly onto the bed (based on the way things are positioned in the room) so hat's not very comfortable at all. The hallways outside of the room are extremely cramped and the elevator is very sketchy.  It actually did break down during our stay, luckily with no one on it.  I wasn't getting any messages on my phone while I was connected to the wifi, but I was able to stream okay.  The staff was nice enough and I believe the amenities were clean.  However, cleanliness is hard to determine when everything just looks grimy and dingy with age.  In typical NYC fashion, you will hear everything on the street all night.

Will never do that again. A hotel with so many issues should not be operating at all. There should be someone paying attention to this hotel and saying something to the manager who has poor management skills. Nia, the manager, was helpful at the beginning but there was no explanation at all as to why the hotel did not have a working elevator and when it would be fixed. (This should have been advised before people make the booking). Also we were locked out of our room and there was no explanation or help. The only solution was to sleep in another room without our bags, toothpaste or things. It was a horrible experience. Nia was never there at 6 am as stated by the receptionist who needs A LOT more training as she does not even know how to activate keys properly. Everyone just covers their mistakes and does not honestly correct them. Only good people there were Alberto, Guadalupe and Freddie who were very honest about problems in the hotel and helped fixed the issue. Upper management should shut down this hotel or change its management right away. I always had good experiences in la quinta and this was the worst ever. Our room was opened up by different people and we also opened up a room that was occupied so they clearly don't have a good system stablished. I hope there is repercussions for the manager of this hotel Nia. Never coming back. I did get a refund for the elevator and the horrible night we had but that does not fix the HORRIBLE experience.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The longer I looked around the room, the worse it got: Our shower had mold growing all over it, the toilet paper holder was absolutely disgusting with rust and grime, the bedside tables were dusty and filthy even the lamp was caked with grime and clearly looked like it hadn\u2019t been cleaned in years, the ledge above our sink was slanted because the shelf was falling off from the wall, and even when we went to turn on the TV we saw that the battery back to the remote wasn\u2019t even on it!

This one however, left a lot to be desired. Location was great, next to Central Park to be able to walk to the park and to the MET. However, the room left a LOT to be desired. I read reviews that the rooms were small as was the elevator, and I was ok with that. I didn't need a lot of room. However, I didn't realize just HOW small the room was. With a full double bed shoved into the corner, there was just enough room for a dresser and a couple feet to walk on either side of the bed. I'm gonna guess it was 8' or 10' x 12' foot room. That was it. The bathroom was tiny too. There were minor repairs needed that I reported to the front desk staff as I left. I understand these things happen. But when I checked out my bill came to over $477 for 2 nights. I thought I reserved at $175, but the small print. They charge a $35 resort fee per night. What kind of resort amenities I paid for, I wasn't sure. There was no pool to provide excess towels, no sauna, no weight room, no special equipment to maintain outside of general hotel equipment. Their \"business center\" was a table in their small lobby with a computer for guest use. Resort fee for the \"free\" Wifi? For the \"free\" breakfast? The \"free\" use of their business center? \n\nOn the good side, they did have a mini-food supply store in the lobby which came in handy for a quick snack or drink. The staff were very nice, the little I had come into contact with them. It seems to be a rather old building, so I can understand the small rooms. I just can't understand the 'hidden fees', the resort fee really irritated me. Just say your room was $210 and be done with it. This was the explanation: \nTotal Before Taxes and Fees $350.40\nOccupancy Tax 5.875% $9.82; \nCity Hotel Fee $3.50 $3.50; \nSales Tax 8.875% $14.84; \nResort Fee $30.00 + Tax $34.43; \nOccupancy Tax 5.875% $10.76; \nSales Tax 8.875% $16.26. \n\nI upped my rating from poor to average.

Unable to travel, we needed to alter her plans, add an additional day to her stay, and move her flight.  The hotel's policy would ordinarily require her to come downstairs to the front desk to sign a couple documents and present her payment information.  However, when explaining the situation to the man who answered the phone, he immediately understood how challenging their policy would be for my spouse.  His name is Steve and is one of the managers of this Wyndham property.  He went above and beyond to accommodate us and volunteered to bring the paperwork up to her to sign, allowing her to focus on her health and wellness.  In a world where \"cover your ass\" is the norm, especially within large companies, where policy and procedure rule the day, Steve was compassionate and kind, and this kindness was beyond words.  Thank you, La Quinta and Wyndham for employing the kind of person that can hear the guests so clearly and find solutions to provide comfort and care.

So, then we went downstairs with pictures and videos and the lady at the front desk denied what was right infront of her and said they had to send someone up to check and it would be about 10 minutes. 30 minutes later\u2026.

Small issues some...like the paper holder in the bathroom was loose and hanging, the toilet seat loose, and the shelf pitching forward enough that anything placed on it slid off.  Not so small....there was no smoke detector.  More seriously, on the first night the hall on our floor smelled strongly of pot\/weed smoke, which penetrated well into our room.  On the second night, it was the same with cigarette smoke.  Not pleasant...but obviously the reason that the smoke detector in our room was missing.  Mask requirements were not enforced with neither staff nor guests.  The elevator ran so erratically throughout our 4 day stay that we often had to use the stairs...to the ninth and 12th floors. How could a hotel with one elevator not have a 24-hr elevator maintenance contract?  On the day of our supposed check-out, we found that an Ipad and a piece of art (in a tube) were missing from the room.  GM Steve was very nice and said all of the right things, showing me the key codes of all entry into the room....but regardless...we checked in with both items and they were gone.  Given the theft...and my EMT visit to the hospital after climbing the 9 flights of stairs (72 yo here), we missed our flight to Mexico and had to stay and extra 2 nights.  Our second room was larger, but the telephone did not work at all, and one bedside lamp had a broken bulb but still did not work even with a good bulb.  Steve comped one night, but seriously....this was the visit from hell....and the room would have been empty had we not had these problems.  Comping both nights would have been the right thing to do, but it is not at all the issue here.  That said...we love the location and actually the hotel....but have very mixed feelings about giving it another try.  We considered a bit of a treasure on the UWS..sadly gone.","travelDate":"2020-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I tried calling the hotel, no one ever picks up the phone. So I called Winyham customer service. They said they had both my reservations and to cancel one I would be charged $200.00. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was disconnected. When I got to the hotel I told them what happened and they canceled one of the reservations. I ask how come no one answers the phone. They said it doesn\u2019t work. The hotel smelled like weed and air freshener. Got to our room, there where no towels. Called the front desk they said they would send some up. Two hours later we got 1 bath towel and 2 hand towels for three people. One of the shades on the window was broken and would not close. We had trouble sleeping because the smell of weed was so strong, I was feeling sick to my stomach. In the stairway between the 3rd and 4th floor there was a half of a smoked joint on the stairs. It says on the website free breakfast. It was stale croissants, stale donuts, and moldy apples. Upon leaving we noticed the smoke detector in our room was covered in tinfoil. When I check out I tried to tell the front desk what happened and there was a seedy guy standing there chiming in on the conversation. He was making me very nervous, I had to just leave. \nI tried calling Wyndham customer care. I told them what happened, then I was disconnected. They called me back and I was disconnected again.

Excellent little hotel but not value for money.  \n\nNegatives:\n-\tOnly 1 small elevator so ask for a low floor room if you don\u2019t do stairs - sometimes we waited ages for the elevator especially in mornings when cleaners using it too and people checking out.   \n-\tIf you aren\u2019t as agile, ensure you check bed configuration \u2013 our bed (Room 606 I think) was in corner against wall, so I had to either climb over my partner or sit up and move forward to end of bed to get out.

If not they are more than willing to take your luggage while you wait for your room. My room itself was small of course (this is NYC after all) but it was clean. The elevator might be an issue as there is just one, and I waited for over 5 minutes trying to come down with my suit case to check out, but I had time. I was a little disappointed in the breakfast. I went down on a Friday at 915am to get me something small and there was absolutely nothing left but coffee. When asked if they would be refilling, all I received was no from the woman that was working in the kitchen area. I ended up walking to Starbucks a few blocks up.

Hairdryer and iron were also in the room along with toiletries.\nBreakfast included and tbh it was better than we expected. Various breads, bagels, muffins and pastries. Usually eggs and sausages. Cereals and a waffle iron for you to make your own (though it seemed to have a mind of its own each time I tried).\n\nCons \nKnew the room would be small but didn\u2019t realise how small - don\u2019t bring the cat as you won\u2019t be able to swing it!\nIt was also far too hot despite turning the radiator off.\n\nThe breakfast room was far too small to accommodate the volume of guests and if you didn\u2019t go down early you could miss out on items. The one issue we did have one morning was the hot items were still frozen. Once reported it was rectified.\n\nThe lift was a little small and slow at times.\n\nHowever our stay was good and tbh you\u2019re not in the room other than to sleep so would recommend \ud83d\ude01\n","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

A stones throw to Central Park, and a short subway ride to all of Manhattan\n- Friendly staff\n- Rooms cleaned thoroughly every day\n- Good powerful air conditioning\n- Free coffee and tea 24\/7\n- Comfortable bed\n\nSecondly, the negatives:\n- The basic double room is smaller than you expect. We could not get two suitcases in the room without having to step over them every day, and spent the entire week tripping over each other. We ended up with one suitcase living in the bathroom.\n- The bath tub is approximately four foot long. Fine for a stand up shower, but impossible for anyone other than a child to lie down in\n- The bathroom sink, toilet, shower head, shower controls and towel hook were all loose and wobbly, and some were almost hanging off the wall\n- The windows were almost opaque with dirt and grime\n- The breakfast was limited and very difficult to eat in the restaurant. The restaurant has around 30 seats and the hotel has 14 floors worth of guests. \n\nUltimately, as if often the case, you get what you pay for. But my god, pay for the upgraded room. We booked the basic room after seeing the photos on Trip Advisor. To our surprise, the photos on Trip Advisor do not accurately represent the room size of the basic double room at all. Thankfully, we spent most of our days out and about exploring.\n\nNB: Excuse the untidiness of the photos, we were in the process of packing to leave!

CAN\u2019T WAIT TO RETURN!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-01-15","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"I absolutely loved staying here!!!! It was only one night but we\u2019ll be back for sure!\nHere are details about parking, the room & hotel from a first time guest...\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, & was a bit anxious, never having experienced a Manhattan hotel before. Plus, worries about parking & the hassle of loading\/unloading on the busy streets of NYC crossed my mind a lot too since I was arriving in my own car. But, it all went so smoothly! \n\nNow, for the sake of quick reference for other Trip Advisor review readers, here goes:\n\nAccommodations:\nIf you\u2019ve never stayed in NYC before, be prepared for SMALL! One small elevator for a 14 story building. If you can think \u201ccruise ship sized hallways & rooms\u201d, you\u2019ll be in the right mindset. BUT! None of this presented a problem, it\u2019s just something to be prepared for.\n\nWe (adult daughter & I) had a corner king room on the 6th floor & it was AMAZING! Super clean, updated room with plenty of space for two people! Not to mention an extra comfy bed, a cute view out to the back from a couple of the windows (others faced the neighboring homes, so we just kept the blinds closed), refreshing shower, huge TV, & in-room coffee maker. And again, super clean everything!\n\nParking & Amenities:\n\nUnloading-Though there is no designated spot outside the hotel to stop while you unload or go to check-in, 71st is a quiet, fairly narrow, residential street, with open gaps (errr, fire hydrant\/no parking areas) where you can pull to the side momentarily near the hotel. Just make sure someone stays behind to move the car if necessary while you\u2019re briefly inside.\n\nParking-One block up on 72nd between Central Park West and Columbus Ave is Rapid Parking lot. If you get your parking ticket stamped at the hotel front desk at check-out, the total cost is $38 for 24 Hours of parking (as of January 2019). That\u2019s a steal in NYC! \n\nOther Amenities: Complimentary breakfast from 7am-10am (didn\u2019t get to try it though), a mini convenience store in the lobby, computers in the lobby\n\nLast but not least, Maria at the front desk overnight was so friendly & helpful! She made me feel at home, & not like \u201cjust another guest passing through\u201d, by taking the time to talk with me a little when I went downstairs in the middle of the night. Her friendliness was the icing on the cake! \n\nI highly recommend this hotel!","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We needed two beds but the only room available had only a double bed so I took our twin size inflatable air mattress.  There was not an area on the floor wide enough to accommodate the width of the air mattress but we made do for one night. The next day, after the Macy's Parade was over, they were able to give us a room with two beds so we were much more comfortable.\nThe location of the property and the excellent staff are the redeeming features of this hotel. Fabien,at the front desk, made our after dark check-in easy. He had extra Decaf coffee and the extra linens for our air mattress delivered to our room by the time we returned from seeing the tethered balloons. The balloons were just a few blocks from the hotel so there was no need to take the subway. \nDuring the day, Keith has the keys to the kingdom (i.e. the authority and trust of the owner, whom we met). Keith keeps everyone and everything running smoothly. Because this was the second coldest Macy's Parade on record and we'd gone out on the street at 5:00 a.m. we took the bedspread with us. Upon returning from the parade, I confessed to Keith that we had soiled the white comforter from our room and asked whether there was a guest laundry available so I could wash it. Keith told me to just give it to housekeeping and dismissed it as unnecessary when I offered to pay for the bedspread. When I saw a housekeeper pushing the laundry cart, I told him of Keith's instructions and also our room number so they could charge me if necessary, but he too dismissed it as though it was no big deal.  I supposed they are used to this as they are the closest hotel to the parade route. We only had to walk one block, really only half a block, before finding a place on Central Park West. \nOn our last trip to New York in 2016, we stayed on the other side of Central Park. It is busier and noisier, and quite a bit more spacious and expensive. You pay to be nearer 5th Ave. and all the action This hotel is just one block and then right across the street from Strawberry Fields in Central Park(John Lennon). We walked through the park and saw the Sheep Meadow, the ice skating on the Pond, and then down 5th Ave all the way to Rockefeller Center admiring the Holiday window displays. The next day we also walked to the American Museum of Natural History ( famous from Night at the Museum movie) so this location is perfect if taking the subway makes you nervous like it does us.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is tucked neatly into a Brownstone residential neighborhood.  While only about a 2 minute walk from Central Park, it is isolated away from the bulk of the traffic and the noise nearby.

Starting with the positives, the W 71st St location is fantastic, a quiet street near Central Park. If you ask, the hotel will validate parking for a garage one block over. However, that's generally where the positives end. Indifferent front-desk employee at check-in. Instead of the queen that we reserved through a 3rd party booking site, we were assigned to a double and a single without anyone bothering to tell us. One small elevator for 14 floors = long wait times. L-shaped room with a single next to the door and a double around the corner, literally behind the elevator shaft. The  double bed occupant can hear muffled mechanical sounds through the night. The window A\/C unit is literally at the foot of the single bed so that it blows directly on the person sleeping on the single, and the cooled air doesn't effectively reach around the corner to the double. Room was small and dark with inadequate space for open luggage. I had to put my carry-on on the bed. Bathroom so tiny that only one person could stand in it. No tub, shower only. Hook to hold clothing missing on door, and shelf above sink too narrow for a normal sized toiletry bag, so you would have to use toilet seat as a storage area or go outside of the bathroom to use the desk. No plug-ins on top of desk for chargers, only on the nightstand next to the double (no room for a nightstand next to single). I had to crawl under the desk to plug in my laptop. Average hotel breakfast (included breakfast is rare in NYC) but the dining room is insufficient for the number of people that it needs to accommodate. It was standing-room only depending upon the time of arrival. The rep in the morning (Keith) is VERY nice and was apologetic. They did discount the rate by a small amount (@ 5%). In NYC if you are looking for budget accommodations, small rooms are to be expected. However the experience was so uncomfortable that in the future we'll trade the UWS location for other options in midtown where more efficiently designed spaces can be found in the same price range.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"NONE"}

But everything was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. As one other review mentioned, we did not have elevator service for a few days, but luckily our room was only on the fifth floor. I'm not going to ding the hotel for that. If you plan on spending lots of time at the hotel, this is probably not the best place, but if you are looking for a reasonably priced (for Manhattan) place to rest that is close to lots of the sights, this is a good choice.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's a few blocks from the metro and Central Park. New York doesn't have the ability to spread out so they have to go up. That being said, EVERYTHING about this hotel feels confined. The halls are narrower, the rooms are smaller, (BUT the bed is SO comfortable!!!.and honestly your not going to spend that much time in your room), the dining area is cramped, and the elevator is a two person and luggage or 4 people with out luggage. But it's New York, and this is a fact of life there. The worst part of our room was the lack of mini fridge and the crazy small (3foot long 2 foot wide) excuse of a tub. The staff was very nice and knew a lot about the area.   The best part of this hotel was the location. It's crazy close to so many things.  The worts part of this hotel was the elevator broke down half way through our trip, and still hadn't been fixed on the day we left. Thankfully my husband and I are in decent health and where only on the 5th floor. But we would have been looking for other lodging options if we where any higher.   Honestly, for our next trip, now that we know how the metro system works, we'll stay out of town a bit for a cheaper price and a larger room.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is perfect (perfect!) for tourists who plan to visit museums, walk through Central Park and experience a different flavor of NYC one can enjoy on the Upper West Side.  The rooms are small, but they reflect value.  We could not obtain a better price for our weekend stay. Our vacation intent was not to linger in the room, yet it certainly was tidy and had every single thing we needed. The room was quiet (9th floor) and we slept soundly (never even heard the baby next to our room).  As guests, we were among many families staying here.  Also, among our fellow guests were a great showing of Europeans.  This is pertinent as we found this hotel to be similar to many in Europe.  Small, compact and efficient.  The breakfast is a huge bonus.  Not fussy, but a nice extra.  Front staff very kind, friendly and helpful.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.  No valet, parking next block over.

It is only at checkin that we were told the elevator was down and would NOT BE BACK IN SERVICE BEFORE MONDAY!  (Today is Weds). Now, the clerk was apologetic and tried to help us find another hotel.  (I know the area, so I booked another hotel myself).  Problems can happen BUT WHY DIDN\"T SOMEONE CONTACT US BEFORE we wasted cab fare, etc to get there.  We wasted money and when I told the front desk person that notice would have been nice, I heard her starting to call people who had reservations. There was a sign posted about the elevator when we entered the hotel so it wasn't something that had happened just at that moment.   Just not acceptable.  LaQuinta, you made  us waste money and time.  The only room they could give us was on the 7th floor.  And I asked twice to have my charges refunded.  And if they aren't, I will be even more dissatisfied than I am right now.  I have zero confidence that this will be taken care of, given what i experienced there.

Camera al 14esimo piano, molto spaziosa e pulita. Eravamo preoccupati dalle recensioni di altri utenti, che lamentavano le dimensioni ristrette, ma nel nostro caso pienamente soddisfatti. Bagno con vasca, cassettiera ampia e  piccolo armadio addirittura con asse e ferro da stiro! Letto king size. Pulizia impeccabile. Ottima la colazione dalle 7 alle 10, con il classico stile americano di uova,hamburger e patate, ma anche yoghurt e latte freddo. Succhi,the e caffe,marmellate,toast e tutto il necessario per cucinarsi i waffel.Banane e mele sempre a disposizione. L'area colazione \u00e8 piuttosto piccola; capita di dover attendere per sedersi, ma andando alle 7.00 era solitamente libero e al massimo abbiamo dovuto aspettare una decina di minuti. Sono convinta che avere la colazione inclusa \u00e8 un grosso vantaggio, perch\u00e9 evita di correre subito fuori per farla, con ben poche varianti di scelta. Come leggevo da altre recensioni, in effetti avere un solo ascensore per 14 piani implica attese,ma non \u00e8 stato un grosso problema per noi. Forse \u00e8 da considerare nel caso si viaggiasse con passeggini o con persone anziane.Posizione fronte central park \u00e8 da favola, metropolitane vicine. Non abbiamo trovato supermercati nei dintorni, forse perch\u00e9 \u00e8 una zona prettamente di hotel. Oltre al meraviglioso Central park, l'hotel si trova a due passi dal Dakota building.

Since it was almost half the price of every other NYC hotel I looked at, I decided to go ahead.  I'm so glad I did!  I personally believe that most of the complaints are people with ridiculous expectations.  We paid a little extra to get their \"king corner room) because of all the complaints about the rooms being small.  This is NYC, we didn't expect a large room.  This room was more than adequate (a king bed, a desk and a small bathroom), especially since we didn't actually spend a lot of time there.  We were on one of the top floors and the elevator is a little slow, but we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes, usually less.  The breakfast place is small, but it's a good, free breakfast.  It's a half a block away from Central Park, very close to subway stations, less than a 2 mile walk to the Met, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and many other tourist destinations.  Because it's a little further away from the touristy places, it's pretty quiet.  An uber cost us about $45 to get to the hotel from LaGuardia.  All in all, I have no complaints.  I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone heading into the city.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Not horrible, not amazing, just fine. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you're planning to have more than two people in a single room, because it's true - the rooms are teeny tiny.  While it worked out okay for me, it's not best for those who have lots of luggage or are claustrophobic. What's also small is pretty much everything else in the hotel - elevator (which was infuriatingly slow and inefficient), dining room for breakfast, bathroom, shower.   I also kind of had a weird experience with the front desk. A day or two before arriving, I noticed I had a charge of $90 from the hotel already. The booking website I used said I'd be charged for everything when I checked in, so I wasn't sure where the $90 would be coming from before I was even there. When I called the hotel, they told me the charge was for incidentals and would \"fall off\" once I checked out. But, when I checked in, it was explained to me that it was a pre-authorization for my card and was part of the total booking fee. A little weird - maybe miscommunication\/misunderstanding?  Now, despite all of that - the hotel is comfortable, quiet, and in a good location. The subway is a block away, Central Park is across the street (hence it being included in the hotel name...), and there is a Starbucks within walking distance. It's a good value for the price - but just know what you're getting yourself into before you book.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

If you are coming to New York to see the sights, you will not spend much time in the hotel room as was the case for us, which meant the size of the room did not really affect us at all (we were only there to sleep). The rooms are clean and the staff were friendly and accommodating.

Just like most places in new york the rooms and hallways were extremely small. Bed was comfortable and room had what you would need. Breakfast in the morning was better than what I expected after reading some negative comments about it, offering numerous warm items as well as yoghurt, fruit, and pastries with a choice of warm and cold drinks. Only issue we found with breakfast was that a number of items regularly ran out despite the employee working hard to keep everything topped up, might be a good idea to give her some help during peak breakfast rush times. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. And price was reasonable considering location. The location itself was close to all that is located near to central park, and about a 30 min walk to times square, which is close enough to uber for $10 a time if you don't feel like walking.

I've seen other reviews that complain about the size of the rooms -- yes, the room is an efficiency. It's best if you are a solo traveler because the room rates are low and you have ample space for one person. If there are two of you --  you'd better be very much in love because you'll be in tight quarters. The rooms are cute. The window unit air conditioner is odd, but I get that this is an old property.

Habiendo leido comentarios con antelacion, reserve para dos la habitacion de tres, ya que muchos hablaban de lo peque\u00f1o de las habitaciones y realmente era cierto...extremadamente chicas, pero bueno en la de tres que me aloje estuvimos bien! El descanso fue excelente, la cama increible, no daban ganas de levantarse, el ba\u00f1o peque\u00f1o pero justo, TV, cafetera, caja fuerte y un desayuno ideal que no teniamos previsto en la reserva y nos dieron de todos modos. El Hotel es para manejarse independiente... una peque\u00f1a recepcion, una maquina de comida chatarra y PC para consultar internet. WIFI Free en la habitacion y zonas comunes  y una ubicacion si bien alejada del midtown perfectamente conectada con las lineas A,B,C y D a una cuadra y la 1,2 y 3 a dos cuadras. A una cuadra y media de Lincoln Av y Brodway, 4 cuadras del Lincoln Center, media cuadra del Central Park y a la vuelta del edificio Dakota ! mi experiencia fue sumamente grata!!","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Immediately I was greeted by Willington, a great guy at the desk.  He was friendly, had great advice, and was a real pleasure to talk to.  The rooms are surprisingly spacious for NY, and the free morning breakfast has been well above average: waffles, sausage, pastries, eggs, cereal.  The rooms are well kept and the service\/maintenance staff are all very friendly and polite - they even hold the elevator for you and greet you in the morning.  And then there is the location.  The hotel is a block from Central Park, an easy walk from Broadway\/Amsterdam, and a block from a subway station.

This one was smaller than average.  Unfortunately with what space they have they failed to provide any working surface like a desk.  Therefore any work you do has to be done on the bed.  That is hard enough but to make it worse, during our stay the wi-fi was so slow that it was essentially unusable.  I carry a hot-spot which I used but for the price I should not have to use up my data.   TO SUM THIS UP -- DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS HOTEL IF YOU WANT TO USE IT AT ALL FOR WORKING.

I chose many times to walk the flights down versus waiting for the elevator.  It can't be helped and I understand but give yourself time to exit, because it can take a while.  The breakfast area is tiny, there were times when there was no seating and the line to get food was long.  The breakfast was not good.  The eggs and sausage were not appealing, the oatmeal consisted of packets of plain but no brown sugar or nuts or dried fruit to add.  The orange juice was good one day but terribly watered down the next.  After the first few days I just didn't access this area.  My room was tiny but I read the reviews and expected it, but I was just disappointed in the care of the room.  My bed had a wrinkled comforter, it was nicely made each day when I returned to the room but had stains and wrinkles.  The bathroom had bath towels and hand towels and wash cloths all hanging on a towel rack.  Two days before I left I picked up a washcloth to wash my face and it was full of long black hair!  This is a tiny washcloth and they fold it in such a way to make it a little fancy to finish their towel ensemble on the towel rack.  So please don't expect me to believe the house cleaning person didn't see it!  The first day of my stay, I took a shower and at the conclusion I noticed several long black hairs in my tub and tried to reason to my self that perhaps when wiping out the tub after they cleaned, maybe some hairs stuck to the side.  But as I stood there staring at this tiny washcloth with at least seven long black strands, I couldn't help but think that someone was bitter with their job and planted them there!  It grossed me out and I just could not appreciate my stay.  The last complaint is the wifi, I could not upload my data to my company and had to use my phone as a hotspot.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

GREAT LOCATION! \n\nNot only is it close to Central Park, but Strawberry Fields (the memorial for John Lennon) is less than half a block from the hotel.  Definitely worth a visit for meditation and history.\n\nThere are also A LOT of fun places to eat in close proximity to the hotel.  I did take out from Zabar's (2245 Broadway at 80th St) - a bagel, sable and lox from a deli counter where the counter help are fish carving artists and treat the fish like it was gold (only more expensive), some cream cheese, and two pieces of rugelach, and some chocolate babka to bring home) and brought it back to the hotel for dinner one night.  \n\nI also recommend:  Tasty Cafe (2062 Broadway at 70th St) for coffee, soups, sandwiches, and delicious baked goods, with free WiFi.  Empire Szechuan (193 Columbus Ave at 68th St) delivers excellent Chinese food and sushi to the hotel.  Gray's Papaya and Franks (Broadway and 72d St) is a good place for cheap eats - $6 for two franks and a drink, stand at the counter and eat it there.  And Hummus Place (305 Amsterdam Ave at 74th St) - lots of good vegetarian choices in a small and intimate setting; and Joe & the Juice ( 247A Columbus Ave at 71st St) - the smoothies sound like odd mixes but are really tasty.\n\nThe subway is only two blocks away, so getting around Manhattan is convenient and cheap.\n\nThe hotel is a little tired and the rooms are small.  The shower was ok, but the sink could only muster lukewarm water.  What's up with that?  And don't pay more for a room with a better view - the windows are so dirty you can't see outside anyway.  The free breakfast is below standards for hotels of this sort - yes, it has the usual waffles and a few baked goods, but the eggs and sausage were inedible. And it is time to replace the towels and washcloths - they are so old and have been washed so many times they are almost transparent.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":99447,"title":"Pretty Disappointing","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-12-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I want to be fair so I will start by telling everyone I was using LQ points on this stay.  Therefore, I did not have to pay a lot of money to stay here (more on that later).  However, the points required were earned with many many nights I stayed at LQ hotels and that is just as valuable as money.\n\nWith that as my prelim, I must admit that this hotel is not only underwhelming it is pretty disappointing.  But before I cover the negatives I do want to call out the few good parts of our stay.  First, the staff is both helpful, knowledgeable and pleasant.  They are a real plus to this location.  Second, the location is nice if you are looking for a quite and more out of the way place to be in Manhattan.  With easy access to the 1,2,3 subway it is fairly convenient but again not very close to anything but the park.  \n\nNow for the downsides.  It is often said a team or business is only as good as its weakest link and I will cover that first.  The free breakfast was mediocre at best (not the items but the lack of having it hot and stocked).  For instance, they ran out of butter and a few other things two days before our stay ended and made no apologies for not having items for the rest of our stay.  Also, the room where breakfast is served is far too small and there is almost never anywhere to sit.  To add to the problem the start time of 7 AM is late enough for those of us with places to go but is exacerbated by the lady fixing breakfast.  She did not even get started setting stuff out until a little after seven.  The start times was at best 715 to 730 and that was even with lots of folks milling around waiting.  She starts too late and frankly is over matched to get the job done.  Items never seemed to stay stocked and she just never operated with any sense of I need to get this done to meet our commitment to the guest.  Finally on the one day she was not there a man had the job.  A different guest other than me did something he did not like and he purposefully embarrassed her in front of all of the rest of us (that occurred on the Friday morning of our visit).  Not classy at all and again this happened to someone I do not know.\n\nOther issues with the hotel were (1) virtually no hot water in the shower most of the time.  This was true even after they staff came to our room to investigate,  (2)  Maybe the slowest and smallest elevators in NYC (and that is saying a lot); (3) the rooms are very very small and not laid out to accommodate both work and sleep; and (4) this is the only LQ I have ever stayed at that charged a small fee $5 per night when using points.  That is not a big thing but it seems counter intuitive to get a free room and then be charged.  To add to that they taxed the $5 at a rate that made the overall tax rate over 40% of the $5 fee.  Again this is not a big thing but it is the only hotel of any kind which has ever charged me to use points.  Sadly it was also the hotel I enjoyed the least of any I have ever used with points as well.\n\nIn conclusion, this LQ is not an awful hotel but lots of things went wrong that made it well below par.  I noticed that on some nights they want well over $300 for a room and even in NYC that is way over priced for this place.  Therefore, I would say buyer beware and you would perhaps be better off staying somewhere else.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We had a corner king room. I'm a germ freak and even I considered the room very clean!!! It looked like the walls were recently painted. The staff was so friendly! They helped my son and I with figuring out the subway system, held our luggage twice (arrival and departure day), and even found a place for my son to practice saxophone since we were there to tour conservatories. The location is perfect!  Yes, the breakfast room is crowded, but I've never been to a free breakfast that wasn't. The elevator is small and slow, but it really wasn't bad. We never felt the need to walk up or down the stairs. I will definitely stay here again! The beds are super comfortable and the front desk staff is AMAZING. \nThey were even very sweet to me when I misplaced my jewelry and called to ask if anyone found it. The front desk person was trying her best to help find it when I found it in a pocket of my suitcase I don't normally use. I was completely at fault, but she was very sweet to me!!!

Excellent location for the park and the Museum of Natural History.  Prior reviews complain about the renovation but the front desk staff said that is all done.  The renovation of the rooms and lobby are very nice.\nWe had a room for 3 with a single and a double bed, and while it was small, it was fine for us.  Can\u2019t give any info on the double rooms but they must be really small.    I think even if you are just 2 people it may be worth paying for a triple for the extra space.   \n We had a room on the 14th floor (really 13, which I always find funny when hotels skip floor 13) we actually had a view of the tree tops of Central Park which I thought was cool.   \nIf you just need a room for a day or two or are sightseeing all day and just need a place to shower and sleep this hotel will do just fine.   I\u2019m kind of picky when it comes to cleanliness and it was acceptable.    The bathroom had a slight mildew odor but I have to admit I\u2019m really sensitive to smells, too sensitive according to my husband.  Anyone who is a clean freak should be okay here.  \nThe window A\/C unit cooled the single bed well, but not the double bed, which was further away.  The bathroom also gets no A\/C so that gets warm and muggy.   \nStay here with really close friends or family because there is no privacy when getting ready in the morning.\nThe free breakfast was okay.  Gets crowded and busy, but I think that is every hotel that has a free breakfast.  \nWe will probably be back if we need to spend a night in NYC if the price is right.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

One evening as she got off work, she waited for my family and I to show us the ins and outs of the subway.  She was on her way home and we were on our way to 42nd street. The room was small but suited us fine as we were only there to sleep and shower. The location is very convenient to central park and subway. Neighborhood has many cafes and grab and go eateries.

Shopping, restaurants and museums are all within walking distance.  This newly renovated hotel was a great find for us at a reasonable price considering its location. The rooms are small, which adds to the total New York experience and gives you an idea of how regular New Yorkers really live on this island of 9 million. Simple, clean, comfortable, it was the perfect place to stay. The staff were polite and helpful and check in went smooth and quick. Comp breakfast is offered but of course we chose to go out because after all, I am \"the bagel snob\" and it's what I do. So, if you are planning a trip to the city, and the type where you'll be out and about more than staying in  your hotel room, this place is perfect. Oh, and remember, you are in New York and city noise is part of the deal 24\/7.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My first night I was kept up by the dripping of condensation from the air conditioner above onto ours. I even had earplugs on and it didn't help. I complained and they said they'd fix it but didn't, so two nights no sleep. Also they were doing construction on the floor below and promised there would be no noise. Second morning, hammering at 7:30 am. And the construction crew were overusing the one elevator so it could take 5 minutes to get up and down. For all the trouble, they gave me a $20 credit. That's just insulting. Very disappointing.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}
