The hotel is small and slightly out of the way. The rooms are spotlessly clean and the breakfast buffet was an extra bonus.\nOur room had no view at all, and purely from it's location and the height of the building, I'm not sure if any of the other rooms would have an outstanding view.\nWe had a room on the 1st floor so we didn't have any issues with lifts as we could walk up the stairs if need be, even though we chose not to after a long day walking.\nThere are 2 lifts which seemed to work fine when we were there, although I should imagine there would be more of a wait in busy periods.\nThe reception staff are extremly friendly and helpful, assisting with directions or any query we had. There is security by the door that leads to the hotel rooms, so extremly safe. The female security guard was lovely and very friendly. \nWe had one drink at the bar the night before we went home. These were very expensive, but I should imagine no more expensive than anywhere else in New York.\nCentral Park is about a 10 minute walk away, but very easy to get to. There are bars and restaurants just up the road, so plenty of places to eat. All walking distance.\nWe found the location great, we were close enough to walk everywhere, but far enough away fron the hustle and bustle of times square. \nIf you're looking for a quieter hotel away from the main tourist trap, then this place is for you. 10 minutes from Columbus Circle with the shops and restaurants. This is a great little hotel.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

On the plus side, I found the room to be very quiet and comfortable.  I was satisfied with safety measures (key entry to the elevator and security posted in the evenings)--important because of the location in Hells Kitchen between 10th and 11th Avenues.  Be mindful that it is not an especially short walk to the nearest subway stop (Columbus Circle is 0.5 mi, about a 12-minute walk).  I was OK with that, and the size of the room, mainly based the proximity to Lincoln Center (0.4 mi).

We left $3 per day for the housekeeper as they work very hard.\nBreakfast is included which is buffet style,all staff were lovely ana worked very hard.\nThe lifts are quite slow,however ibeliwve this is caused by staff using these for moving their trolleys around.\nThe door going to the lift area needs to be opened via your room key and swings into the opening of the bar which must drive the staff crazy. I would suggest that it is changed as it is very annoying.\nWhen we checked out we were able to leave our luggage at reception and go explore the city for one last time.\nThe staff booked us our own transport back to JFK which cost $95 was ideal as we didn't want to take several suitcases back on underground and the Air Train especially when we were travelling on The busiest day of the year \"Thanksgiving Eve\".\nThank you for a great stay and we will be booking to return in 2025.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

However.  I've stayed in many hotels in NYC, and for the price of the room there should have been a little more space and at least one bureau.  The room looked directly into another building which I was told by the front desk \"that is how all the KIng Rooms are\".  Again, can be typical NYC but not for the money. At busy times of the day wait times for the elevator can be upwards of 10 minutes and after that there are usually stops on every floor so add a few more minutes. Doesn't seem like a big deal big after a few days it becomes annoying.  The weekend we went the hotel they decided to do some major work on that patio they are proud to show so many pictures of.  The work was super loud and necessitated blocking off the patio on the Friday, and then for the rest of the weekend the main entrance via the patio was blocked off.  Here's a novel idea, if a property is going to schedule work, they should discount the price. Not only was the patio mostly unusable, the blocked entrance meant you had to go out via the side which meant you had to walk by all the smokers. Yuck.  ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Restaurants and supermarkets are also available in the surrounding area. Unfortunately, it is also very noisy in the area because there is a hospital a block away, but if you want peace and quiet you shouldn't travel to NYC, we were aware of this and therefore it didn't bother us. The rooms are adequate for a couple and there is a small closet in the room. Other amenities include a safe, ironing board, iron, TV and USB ports. All in all sufficient and very clean. As has often been mentioned here and in other forums, long waiting times for the elevators are to be expected.\n\nThe breakfast is typically American and sufficient, but unfortunately it's all just disposable dishes.\n\nAt the reception we only experienced friendly and very helpful employees who answered every question patiently and friendly.

Unser Zimmer lag im 9. Stock mit Blick auf das John Jay College. Wir waren zu viert (2 Erwachsene und 2 Teenager) und fanden das Zimmer sehr klein daf\u00fcr, aber zum Schlafen reicht es. Unsere Klamotten breiteten wir auf dem Sideboard gegen\u00fcber der zwei 1,40m breiten Betten aus. Der kleine Schrank zwischen Bett und Bad ist hoch, aber winzig.

Hafermilch) gab es auch. \nAufschnitt: 2 verschiedene K\u00e4sesorten (Cheddar und eine andere).\nGem\u00fcse: Gurkenscheiben und M\u00f6hrensticks.\nS\u00fc\u00dfe Teilchen: t\u00e4glich eine Sorte, die variierte (Muffins, Waffeln, Pancakes etc.)\nDas Hotelpersonal war super freundlich und hilfsbereit.

The rooms are small but have all the features you'd want like nice shower, sockets by the bed and coat hooks. But it's noisy and the air con is too loud to use at night. Security is good and everywhere is very clean and in good condition.\nThey lose points for 3 reasons. 1. For $400 per night they only service rooms every other day - that's cheap. 2. They have no real evening food as their bar food is just cheap snacks. 3. Worst of all the quantity of plastic waste at breakfast is completely unacceptable.  A major company like Marriott should have a far better environmental record and invest in a dishwasher.

We were absolutely blind sided by the payment and expected a $100 deposit like any other hotel I\u2019ve stayed with before, or a credit card that they would charge should anything happen or be charged to our room. \n\nWe were persistently told that our booking would have the \u2018fine print\u2019 even though I showed them our full booking confirmation which had no sign of this information. The manager then agreed to bring the charge down to $150. \n\nAs it\u2019s a special occasion, I called up twice before we arrived to reserve a room with a city view.

We were also told repeatedly to \u2018cancel our booking\u2019 as any solution to anything we were unhappy with. \n\nThe hotel is run down and not worth one penny that we paid. Nothing worth damaging for that $250 deposit. \n\nThe elevator is also very slow, with three different hotel guests telling us waiting that it takes about 20 minutes to get downstairs in the morning.

The hotel absolutely does not reflect a 4 star , the first impression I got is is of a family run Imbiss . None of the employees have uniforms and the bar in the lobby consists of a bare 2-meter desk.  The breakfast although quite varied and  abundant is served in a basement. The buffet is served in plastic plates , glasses , cups and cutlery .  The rooms are of normal size as well as the bathroom , comfortable bed and cleanliness .  Our room overlooked an inner courtyard so to see what the weather was like we had to go outside because you couldn't even see the sky. Since we used the room only to sleep sleep this fact was not a big problem for us. The big problem consisted of the 2 elevators that were supposed to transport the guests to the 12 floors of the hotel as well as their internal staff.  The waiting time for the elevator especially in the morning was ridiculous to say the least , one morning I waited 24 minutes to reach my room.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

When I arrived on a Monday night to check-in there were at least 10 people in front of me waiting, but the check-in counter was fully staffed with 4 people and I only had to wait 3-4 minutes.  A very nice surprise given how it goes at some check-ins.\n\nThe rooms were well done in terms of decor and comfort.  A bit small (as all NYC rooms tend to be) and it was a bit tight in terms of doing anything other than laying in bed.  But I liked the room style. \n\nThe breakfast buffet was well staffed, stocked and convenient.   \n\nMy only issue were the Elevators!   There are only 2 elevators for this 18 story property and they are extremely slow to point of being almost unusable.  I waited 5-10 minutes at times to get the elevator and get to my room.  These elevators are clearly broken in terms of they seem to \"get stuck\" before opening and sometimes pause for 20-30 seconds.  I also experienced several times where the elevator dropped a few feet and seem to hang\/pause between floors.   \n\nI tried to take the stairs but found that the stairwell actually isn't straight up\/down once you get to floor 10 or so - it goes through a labyrinth of internal hallways\/rooms and to be honest no clear sense of when it ends or how to get to the ground... Not sure it would meet a fire inspection TBH. I had to abandon my attempt after spending 15 minutes trying to get down from 16 to floor 1 - couldn't do it simply via stairs. \n\nThe last thing that was awkward is the entry to the elevators from the lobby.  Never in my life have a seen such an odd, hard to use and strange ingress to the elevators.  There is this large glass fire door you have to unlock with your key before getting to the two elevators.   This door thou is actually in the middle of the lobby bar and so when you open it, it swings very wide, hydraulic and often hits patrons seated at the end of the bar.   Both days I was there this happened and watching guests come in and out multiple times it was always awkward and caused guests to be concerned of hitting somebody.   To add a little drama, every day the same guy (hotel employee) was sitting in a seat next to the door telling people how to unlock it...  A door setup so complex, you need a guy there to explain it! \n\nSo the bottom line - a great property, great staff, nice location - but trying to get the door open to get to the elevators and waiting for what felt like hours to get up the elevator really destroyed the user experience!   I have to believe this can be fixed - get your elevators fixed and have the layout of that lobby door changed.\n\n","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Upon closer inspection, there were greasy fingerprints on the tv screen, and the floor was not vacuumed well enough. The floors in the hallway were noticeably dirty and needed to be vacuumed. None of these issues were dealbreakers, but there are not enough elevators for the hotel. We had asked to be on a lower floor so we could use the stairs if needed, and we were glad. We had to climb up and down. Finally, on a good note, the breakfast buffet was better than I expected. We would stay again for a short visit, because of the location, but we canceled a future reservation for a longer stay.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Brought long wait time and line up. Was the joke among guests waiting or in the elevator.  My room was on the 12th floor so was using the stairs down and only used it when I was going up. \n\nI would probably recommend at time of check-in to ask if both elevator are working.

What went wrong? Let me count the ways.\n\n1.  I\u2019ve never been in a Marriott property as poorly maintained as this one. Ensuring that things work as they should is an after thought at best:\n\n2.  One expects elevators in NYC to be slow, small and over-crowded to a degree but it regularly took 10 minutes or more to have one stop that was not so overcrowded that you can board.  On the last day one of the two elevators were out, causing even longer delays. Ended up walking up and down 6 flights, last time with luggage, and I am a senior citizen.\n\n2.  Electronic room keys often didn\u2019t work at all, requiring a trip to the front desk to change the code, and even then it would take several tries for the door to unlatch. One time a maid was able to open it for us with a master key; she tried our key and it didn\u2019t unlatch.  Family members in other rooms, we had 3, had the same problems.\n\n3.  The shade for our room was operated by a remote control but only would go down in closed position but not go back up in open position.  We reported this to the front desk; they sent a maintenance worker up to fix it.  He said he did, but you guessed it, he didn\u2019t and it malfunctioned again.\n\n3.  An alarm in the lobby area was sounding for at least 48 hours; nothing was done to silence it.  I can\u2019t imagine how the staff could work with the incessant noise.  And one has to question the safety implications of an alarm sounding that wasn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t be turned off and was being ignored.\n\n3.  Housekeeping is non-existent for a 3 night stay.  On day 2 I asked for overflow bathroom trash to at least be emptied.  The front desk staffer called housekeeping and they promised to empty it and refresh towels with a full cleaning the next day.  Returned to the room that night and you know how this turns out, neither was done.  On the morning of day 3 I reported the problem to the front desk person and she checked and said housekeeping was not scheduled for me and must be requested 24 hours in advance.  I said it had been requested the prior morning; it somehow didn\u2019t end up on the schedule.  They said they would try to fit me in for service but would at least empty the trash.  When we returned later the trash was emptied; never got the full service requested.\n\nI have stayed at Marriott properties world wide and this was the worst ever.  Stay away.  I feel for the staff working there.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

As the closet only has space for 2 or 3 coats, it was necessary to leave the clothes in the suitcases and opening them became a very difficult task.\nBreakfast is enough to start the day, but  very basic, inconsistent and, by European standards, even 3 stars, with low quality products (loaf bread, microwave sandwich, packaged pastries, etc.)\nThere were days when there were waffles, others not, on some days there were eggs, others not, on some days with very sweet juice, on others almost only water, etc.\nAs for the room housekeeping, it is necessary to ask the reception, otherwise there is no cleaning.\nOf the 7 nights we stayed at this hotel, we spent the first 4 days without cleaning the room and changing towels, although I asked, right at check-in, for cleaning every other day. Apparently there was a miscommunication and after a more emphatic complaint the situation was resolved and the cleaning, which became daily, was impeccable.\nThe Hotel charges, or pre-authorises on the credit card, a security deposit of USD 50 per day that will be refunded (or not charged) if there are no incidents. In our case it would be $350, understandable, but a bit of a stretch.\nOverall the experience was not bad and for what I paid I would have no problem repeating this hotel, but if I didn't pay a promotional price, given the usual rates I would probably choose another option.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

The biscuit was still there when we checked out 5 days later, A vacuum hoover stood against a wall opposite the lifts and there it stayed. I think it was there for us the hotel guests to use to hoover the floor ourselves. Other parts of the floor needed hoovering too.\nThe carpet on my floor was stained and looked like a well worn carpet from a bust nightclub. It needs replacing badly.\n\nThe breakfast bar was open for 'grab n go' only due to Covid. No sitting. On offer was coffee, tea, orange juice, cereal bars, fruit, muffins, bagels. I think yogurt was on offer too.\nHot food options such as bacon, sausages, toast etc would of been nice. Guests could of taken such hot food back to their rooms to eat. We grabbed breakfast at a local 'cafe' and for 4 of us the check was around $60 in total.\n\nThere are two lifts that can make you wait at busy periods like in the mornings. This hotel has about 18 floors so no surprise. But there are stairs to use. Waiting for the lifts is not a negative against this hotel. I'm just adding this in my review.\n\nThere is a tiny shop area in the reception to purchase essentials. They was also a microwave to warm stuff up if you have a warm drink or pizza.\n\nWe did not have a car and as far as I'm aware, there is only off street parking. \n\nThere is a gym below the ground floor but this I didn't use.\n\nDue to Covid there is no room service unless requested with 24 hours notice. But they will replenish the basics such as loo rolls and towels if requested on the day.\n\nThe hotel reception staff are happy to look after suitcases should you have a later flight after checking out early. \n\nSo in whole, my stay here was ok. Just the issues as mentioned. If the Savoy or a chain hotel, there is no excuse for dirty floors.\n\nIf I visit New York again I would stay in a hotel closer to amenities.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We chose it for the location, primarily, and it didn't disappoint in that way:  about a 15-minute walk to the Metropolitan Opera or Carnegie Hall.  The grab-and-go breakfast was plentiful but boring:  always the exact same variety of granola bar, the same type of yogurt, always plain bagels only, etc.   There was hot oatmeal every day, though, which was a big plus.  The orange juice came in small cartons and one morning they were out of it when I went down at 8:30 a.m.  That shouldn't happen.  But on the whole, the breakfast was a plus.  Another plus:  the hotel was filled to capacity at least three of the five nights we were there, and we rarely heard any noise from the rooms above and below us or to the side of us.  So the sound insulation must be very good.   Final positive:  very friendly and helpful front desk staff. \n    As to the negatives, the big one was that we couldn't get our room cleaned.  We were told we could have the room cleaned, and just had to ask the day before.  We stayed five nights, and asked on the third day to have it cleaned the next morning, and it wasn't.  We mentioned this the next day at the front desk, and the front desk staff was very apologetic and said she'd be sure it was cleaned the next morning.  It wasn't.  We had to put trash and used towels out in the hall, get clean towels, and get more toilet paper.  That's inexcusable.  If they don't have enough staff to clean the rooms, they shouldn't promise the rooms will be cleaned.  Another negative:  besides a tiny room, the \"closet\" was about 12 or 13 inches wide.  I've never seen a tinier hotel closet.  Finally, this hotel has just about the slowest elevators of any hotel I've ever stayed in, and that's quite a few.  The computer in the hotel lobby was also extremely slow.  But, a final plus:  the printer worked.  \n    Bottom line:  we probably wouldn't stay here again because we felt so ripped off about not being able to get the room made up even once in five nights, and having to take our trashcan out of the room and also get supplies.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Check-in and check-out were quick and efficient, but that's about where the good stops.\n\nMy room smelled straight up like sewage, and I wish I was kidding. I thought the smell might have been from the hallway or it might go away with time, but it never did, and it was 100% coming from the bathroom toilet and shower drain. So gross. The roller shade for the window was also torn (like a giant tear down the middle), and it gave me major murder scene vibes. And the air conditioning didn't work at all; I tried resetting it, pressing the up arrow, and even reaching out to the front desk for help (spoiler alert: they were useless until maybe 10 hours before checkout they finally must have reset it\" from the outside\"). The room was boiling. To top it off: the phone\/alarm clock combo in the room were not working (dead to the world even plugged in), my room was only stocked with one single bath towel in the bathroom (no hand towels, no shampoo, nothing), the bathroom faucet was super powered and sprayed water everywhere whenever it turned on, and the staff I interacted with were super rude and disinterested both over chat and coming to my room when I requested an additional towel.\n\nThe location is a solid 10-15 minute walk from the nearest subway station, and my window looked out on some industrial tower\/plant thing. My room was next to the elevator so I heard noise literally all night long. I would literally stay ANYWHERE else in the city to avoid staying here again.

We finish spending our Saturday doing a plethora of activities (that we can given where we are of course ;) and really just wanted something cozy and warm to rest for the night. A quick search online brought my attention to this hotel. Location was a little further out being closer to 11th Ave but the room was priced very well and seemed comfortable. A few quirks but overall, a really nice stay. Ashley at the front desk made our check-in experience seamless and easy, and immediately felt like we were being taken care of. The room, clean, comfortable and much bigger than the usual \"boutiques\" that you will find throughout the city. \n\nWhere they may loose some points: \na. You're not getting that overly stylish d\u00e9cor or look at this establishment. Some attempts within the room but nothing grand. More of an FYI but if you're okay with this (as I was) then nothing to worry about. \n\nb. The toiletries, nothing crazy. In fact, you will be better off preparing your own items to have the quality that you prefer. It being a franchise hotel, I believe under the Choice umbrella, my experience is that this sometimes comes with such properties. \n\nc. The hotel entrance\/exit. I would assume due to Covid-19 restrictions, they have to do their best to manage people coming in\/and out. This is accomplished by having guest enter with their keycards and newcomers enter via doorbell. The keycard gave us some trouble at the front after we checked in, noticed it happened with another guest as well. Maybe an slight error or issue with their system but didn't keep us out long. \n\nAll this said, I look forward to returning. It was a great finish to a wonderful night as this place worked really well for what we needed. Absolutely will be back. A lot of food options nearby as well, especially for takeout or for a quick walk (Peperino Pizza, pretty good pizza and nearby on 60th).","travelDate":"2021-02","tripType":"NONE"}

I do not blame the personnel working here for the property\u2019s defects.\n\nThis is kind of a \u201cjust enough\u201d Marriott property. Rooms are small. Uncomfortably small. Bathrooms even more so. It\u2019s appointed pre-Starwood merger and it has some compromises that make it feel more dated even when the hotel isn\u2019t even this old.\n\nNo electronic locks for example.\n\nOne issue is the location. It\u2019s close to the pier. Close to Fordham University. Close to Lincoln Center and reasonably close to Central Park. \n\nIt is not close to a subway station. Columbus Circle is a good distance away. It\u2019s good for walking, don\u2019t get me wrong. But at night after a show it\u2019s simply not a nice walkable area at all.\n\nIt has a small bar, not bad at all and it offers a few bites.\n\nThe major issue with this hotel is its lack of functional design. It\u2019s awkward to enter into the elevators. There\u2019s only 2 for the whole hotel. The hotel is 18 floors high. Housekeeping uses them. It can take a long time to get an elevator. I found at least four times when only one elevator was working properly. A housekeeping supervisor used the elevator to go down ONE floor instead of using the stairs.\n\nThe windows do not seal well. There\u2019s blower noise from the outside. Rooms are small and can get claustrophobic.\n\nThe good thing is that in comparison to other Marriott properties this wasn\u2019t nearly as expensive. Maybe in the summer it is more comfortable.","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My problem - I cut a deal with the hotel for a Corporate Rate at the end of last year.  The rate worked in the system just fine during the 1st 2 quarters of 2019.  It stopped working during the summer months (sporadic at best) and I've had to work to get the rate adjusted to our original agreement.  Three weeks ago it happened again, and after checking, I realized I was charged too much on my previous visit.   I wrote an email to Andrea, my corporate contact asking her to fix the system (a too high rate was showing again) and that I needed a room for the upcoming week.\n\nI got a reply from the Front Office Supervisor the next day indicating he adjusted the bill.  Upon me emailing again about a reservation (1 day back and forth on email) he replied indicating that the hotel was booked solid, but with rain in the forecast there might be a cancellation.  That obviously doesn't work for me.\n\nI booked elsewhere and asked if Andrea had been fired because I hadn't heard from her.  I got a reply from Andrea explaining that she had been very busy, that the problem had only happened a couple of times and that my rate may not have been available (outside of black out dates - which this was not why would that ever happen?)  She then provided a screen shot with my corporate rate coming up with no dates.  She did not address my concern over asking for a room and being told the hotel was sold out.\n\nI replied explaining why this response didn't make sense to me and that I was disappointed.  I asked again about why I was told the hotel was sold out.  That was three weeks ago and I have received no reply.\n\nTo whomever may care at Marriott - it matters to me and travelers like me to honor your commitments and instruct your staff to treat ALL customers with respect.  I have an honest and legitimate concern.  While my overcharge refund was made, I was otherwise not taken seriously or treated with care.\n\nYou material re: my Lifetime Titanium Elite Status seems to indicate that you value my loyalty and patronage.

The subway is two blocks away which is perfect for people who don\u2019t like a lot of walking whereas we are walkers and we did lots. We found the location no problem.\n\nRoom - The room was cosy, clean, quiet, comfortable and modern. However there wasn\u2019t a lot of storage to unpack clothes- which isn\u2019t always a bad thing. It would have also been good if there was a plug socket next to the long standing mirror rather than just than the bathroom for hair drying. For us that\u2019s a safety feature. However all in all, the room was suitable. A simple, inexpensive fix to storage would be to put some hooks on the wall for coats, bags etc. \n\nBreakfast - Scattered around the hotel there is a traffic light system of the times of when breakfast is busiest, we really liked this. \nThere was a range of different choices from fruit, cereals, waffles and cooked breakfast. It was self service which was great and the quality of the food was very good and tasty. It was great to see fresh fruit. The only feedback would be to consider recycling and segregate plastic and cardboard. This is big in the UK but not sure in the USA. \n\nOverall we were very impressed. Great value for money combined with first class service from the moment we arrived to end of our stay. I would recommend anyone looking at this hotel to consider as its competitive on pricing and having breakfast buffet included saves time and money. \n\nA special mention goes to Ashley for making us feel welcome and especially Robert who went the extra mile more than once for us.

The positives are:  1.  excellent location. This is a great location if you were going to something at the Lincoln center such as the opera. It is only about a quarter of a mile and an easy walk to Lincoln Center. There are also many places to eat within walking distance. It\u2019s not very busy  around here at night but I still felt safe walking back by myself after the opera. 2.  the staff is very friendly and very helpful. Every staff member was enthusiastic and went above and beyond to help with anything I might need. 3.  The room is small and tight but it is clean and has a coffee maker and a refrigerator, and clock.  4.   The fitness center is good. There are a couple of treadmills, a bike, and elliptical, and free weights. \n\nNegatives:   There is one big negative to this location and that is the elevator situation. This is an 18 story hotel and they have two extremely slow elevators that serve the entire building. It is really a ridiculous situation and something all the guests talk about. I got on the elevator this morning on the ninth floor and by the time I got to the lobby I seriously forgot what I was going down for. It\u2019s a huge negative and one that actually could prevent me from staying here again. I don\u2019t like having to take 15 minutes to just go down and get a cup of coffee. I think the only workaround is to request a room on one of the bottom two floors so that I could walk up and down the stairways. Another negative as there are no ice machines in the building. If you want ice you can call down to the front desk and they will send a bag up to your room or you can ask at the front desk and they will go get you a coffee cup full of ice from the breakfast area.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Every journey is painfully slow, the doors take ages to open and close, and the programming is awful. So we spent a long time waiting. You really need to do something about this!\nAnother poor design fault is at the main entrance - where there are steps down from the road. Every time it rains they have to tie yellow tape across the stairs to prevent you from using them - you then need to take the slope down nearby.\nBut the staff are all very friendly and helpful, and, despite what I say above, we did enjoy our stay there.

Elevators are very slow = be prepared to walk up and down the stairs - much faster than waiting for the elevators. Had to wait 10 minutes for the elevator the day we left (couldn't walk down the stairs with our luggage). The elevators also appear to open on any floor that requested an elevator, even if that elevator is moving in the opposite direction requested (often had people joining us on the elevator thinking it was going up\/down when the elevator was in fact moving the other way).\n\n4. Minor room issues = shower doors were not properly installed which resulted in excessive water on the floor after shower use. Thermostate in our room did not work and therefore could not control the temperature or fan. Pre-check in requests made on the Marriott app (foam pillows, extra towels) were not fulfilled.  \n\nOverall was good enough for what we needed (needed to be near the CBS recording studio around the corner for the purpose of our stay); however, definitely a disappointment in comparison to other Marriot hotels we have stayed. Will not return.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

At first, I was a bit disappointed about the location, but once we got there, I realized it actually had a lot of good selling points.  It's far, far west, near the river.  But, if you are driving into Manhattan (as we were) it's really simple to get there off the West Side Highway, and you don't have to deal with a lot of Manhattan traffic.  Also, parking was a lot cheaper in that area than others.  I paid only $25\/day to park which is cheap for Manhattan.\n\nAs mentioned, the location just off of 10th\/Amsterdam Ave. is about a 10 minute walk from the Subway at Columbus Circle.  It's also about a mile to Times Square.  We ended up walking to all the shows we had booked, each was a very pleasant walk of about 15 minutes or so.  It was actually nice to be away from a lot of the crowds and congestion of staying right in Times Sq.\n\nAs for the hotel itself, it was very nice.  All the employees were very pleasant and cheerful and helpful.  The room itself was as small as it could possibly be, without feeling closed in.  There was plenty of room to walk around the king bed, but if someone was standing at the foot of the bed, they had to move to let the other one get by.  Bathroom the same.  Just large enough to do your business, but tight.  Everything in the room though, was very nice, new, clean and modern.  Breakfast was amazing, for a free breakfast, this was one of the best I've ever seen.\n\nSo this was a first visit for me, but when I return to NYC I will certainly consider staying here again if I can get a good price.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room is a reasonable size, again by New York standards which means not roomy but not by any means cramped. There is only a shower in the room so those who insist on baths may be disappointed. The included breakfast is a step up from those in the standard bargain hotels. The breakfast buffet is not of course overwhelmingly but it is reasonable and filling. For a more quiet and relaxing breakfast do try to get there early. Lastly, there are only two elevators (lifts). When I was there one was not working.

L'hotel si trova a  15 minuti a piedi da Central Park, sulla 58 strada, zona comoda, tranquilla e carina, a 10 minuti a piedi dalla stazione metro Columbus Circle e im generale a poca distanza dal centro. La struttura \u00e8 moderna, con un bar al pian terreno con cortile esterno; il personale \u00e8 stato sempre gentile e disponibile. La nostra stanza al 10\u00b0 piano (una king standard) era dotata di bagno, cassaforte, tantissime prese, asse e ferro da stiro, frigo e smart tv. Era abbastanza piccola, abbiamo avuto difficolt\u00e0 a trovare un posizionamento per le valigie, cos\u00ec come con l'armadio, che era praticamente ad unica anta, perci\u00f2 non abbiamo neanche potuto disfare la valigie, per mancanza di spazio sufficiente per entrambi!!!

La stanza dava su un cortile interno, ma purtroppo confinava con un locale credo dedicato all'impianto di areazione, che emetteva un continuo rumore intermittente che la notte risultava molto fastidioso. La pulizia quotidiana non era approfondita, tanto che, soprattutto in bagno, negli ultimi giorni si sono accumulati polvere e capelli... Lode invece alla colazione internazionale, di ampia e ottima scelta (se proprio devo trovare una pecca \u00e8 solo la mancanza del cappuccino!). Altra pecca della struttura, la presenza di due soli ascensori, di cui uno per diversi giorni fuori servizio, con attese snervanti a tutte le ore.

The best kept secret maybe 1.5 blocks to the west and 1 block up: walk under the westside highway, cross the bike path and turn right to enter south end of Riverside Park and Locomotive Lawn. It is a nice area to relax on the Hudson River. Plenty of seatings. You can watch the sunset here over the New Jersey side. Back to the hotel, rooms are small but still new and largely functional. Closet is tiny. No luggage stand. There is a mini fridge. Bathroom is compact but overall not bad. Not much space around the sink to put all your toiletries but the towel shelf above toilet helps. Breakfast is quite good: noticeably better than a similar hotel class like Holiday Inn Express. Great selections and well staffed so items are restocked quickly and areas are kept clean. Check-in was pleasant but the staff could be more honest and competent. Being platinum elite, I inquired about an upgrade expecting a no (because we booked through Hotwire) but got an evasive answer that I was given a high floor room (10th floor of the 18th floor building with window facing another building so no view)! Room was already pre-assigned. No attempt to even look. Asking her to add my partner name to the reservation. Said yes but didn\u2019t do it. My partner arrived later to have trouble getting a room key! Will we be back? Yes, at the right price. Expectations set to low accordingly!","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff is great, better than in some expensive hotels I\u2019ve stayed in. If you ask for something, they remember your room number! Front desk *and* the cleaning staff was responsive and friendly. \n\nThere's a great breakfast included. I'm talkin': scrambled eggs, eggs-cellent oatmeal, fruit, diy waffles, bagels, toast, etc. etc. It was a seriously good breakfast, and I was forced to eat a little of everything. And have seconds.\n\nThe only potential issue is the neighborhood; Hell's Kitchen is a bit quiet: very residential, with little retail. But there are plenty of independent restaurants and there is a Starbucks across the street. Everything you'd want to do and\/or see is within walking reasonable distance. \n\nThe street itself is a jumble of warehouses and construction, so it's not the most picturesque location. So if you dream of staying across from Central Park when you\u2019re in New York, you're better off\u2026 well\u2026 staying near Central Park!\n\nAs to be expected, rooms are a bit on the small side, but I\u2019ve stayed in smaller in the city. There were a lot of families staying there, however, with many Europeans\u2013more than U.S. tourists. The rooms are immaculate and bonus! there's a refrigerator. The hotel has plenty of public spaces where you can hang out, including a bar and some nice armchairs near the front desk.

Don't expect to use the elevator between 07:00 and 09:30. There is no service elevator so the staff has to use the guest elevator. First you\u2019ll have to wait. Sometimes as long as 30 minutes. Then it stops frequently. I found it easier to walk down from the 14th floor than taking the elevator. During the morning the elevator is frequently full of cleaning staff and you can't get in.\n\nIn my room, the A\/C system cycles frequently and the fan is very loud. \n\nThe dining area is efficient and well-attended to. Sort of. Staff are visible and available. But, your shoes will stick to the floor and your napkin will stick to the table. It\u2019s not very clean. The A\/C blows so hard that your already tepid food will be refrigerator temp by the time you sit down. One staff member simply brushes table scraps to the floor with a dry napkin rather than wipe the table with a cleaning cloth and catching the scraps.\n\nSaving the best until last. My daughter (27 years old) met me at the hotel in the morning. Before I got downstairs to meet her, a reception clerk had already hit on her. Then I came down and right in front of me he continued to flirt. Totally inappropriate and unlike any Marriott property I\u2019ve ever stayed. We were late for an appointment so we dashed out. We discussed the incident, I\u2019m not off-base. Upon checkout I told the desk about the incident. He offered to to have it addressed. I hope it is. This was my daughter, one young lady.

The rooms are clean and well appointed but are extremely small. It was quite difficult to control the temperature in the room and there was no real view. Breakfast is served cafeteria-style in the basement of the hotel. This is a good hotel for visitors and travellers to New York but is not equipped for business people. The major complaint is that for a hotel with about 16 floors (or more), there are only two elevators, which causes delays and is frustrating.

You have to get down on your hands and knees to access it, making it very difficult to see all the way to the back. I found this out the hard way when I realized I had left my house key in the safe. I thought I\u2019d cleared it all out, but it was difficult to see all the way in.  I called the hotel as soon as I got home.

He contacted the hotel via email before we arrived, this apparently went through to the main company rather than the hotel. He wanted to advise them that the trip was for my birthday. He was told to contact the hotel directly. Which he did when we arrived, he was told that they didn't have any room service facilities and they could not accommodate anything. This was a real shame really as we've visited NYC 3 times now for my birthday and in the other hotels they have always helped to make the day that little bit more special. \n\nWhen we arrived the check in was very smooth and quick. They lady dealing with us was very informative and helpful. \n\nThe room was extremely small and the hotel doesn't appear to have a good view of anything really. The rooms had everything that you needed for the stay, hairdryer, iron and fridge etc. The heating in the room worked really well, we were there when it was minus 15 and it kept us really warm it was just really noisy but we got used to it. All hotels in NYC are small and I have stayed in smaller. \n\nThe room was clean on arrival however I have to say that the maid service has a lot more work to do. Our floor wasn't hovered in the week that we were there, our shower appeared to just be loosely wiped with a cloth, our shampoo etc wasn't replaced every day which was very frustrating. I could continue with the list but there was something missing every day. \n\nThe tea and coffee facility in the room was good (when the items were replaced which didn't always happen).\n\nThe breakfast really was Good, there is plenty of choice and they changed the variety of cooked items each day. Items such as scrambled eggs, cheese omelette, bacon, sausage, cereals, fruit, variety of breads..... We both really enjoyed the breakfasts every day. The room does get busy towards the end of each service but if you don't leave it until the last minute the dining room is fairly quiet. \n\nThe hotel is located about a 10-15 minute walk from times square. It's in a fairly quiet location but it is easily accessible to everything. It's a nice a quiet area to get away from noise of the tourist areas. It's about a 10 minute walk from Columbus circle which is opposite central park. \n\nThe nearest subway is 10 minutes walk away. \n\nThere is plenty of places to eat near by all within walking distance. \n\nOther than the cleanliness of our room within our stay and the poor maid service I would stay at this hotel again!

Lovely restaurant, lovely evening, all due to Daniel.\n\nMarx!  Always available to get me a cab and anything else I needed.  Marx was reliable, always at the front desk, never did I need to search for him, met my every need.\n\nDelilah! Called her from the airport:  I did not have my purse.

She\u2019s either really good at modeling superb customer service or she\u2019s really good at hiring superb employees.  Or both!\n\nThere were other staff that were great too, but sadly, I cannot remember their names.  The staff made phone calls for me, provided directions and suggestions to cafes and grocers, and were consistently, immediately available to help me.\n\nAlso, must not forget Justin in the cafeteria downstairs.  He took care of me whether I was hunting for bananas, oatmeal, or whatever I needed.  \n\nMore than anything, the staff made me feel I had a home away from home.  Every hotel in the Marriot chain provides superb service, but this staff went beyond the polite and helpful\u2014they made me feel I was a part of their \u201chome.\u201d\n\nFinally, the room, though tiny (NYC real estate is tight) it was very clean.

It had something for everyone, from little omelets and sausages to waffles to fruit and yoghurt, albeit all consumed on paper plates with plastic utensils. Being a tropical fruit fan, I especially liked the cut assortment of melon and cantalope.  The hotel is a safe and easy ten minute walk from Columbus Circle,  which is a major metro station and shopping Center next to Central Park. I was surprised to find a huge Whole Foods market there. Columbus circle has easy subway JFK connections. I took the subway both ways. The short Walk to Central Park and the walking distance to major attractions in and around Central Park, to Broadway, to major shoipping areas etc. really made the trip enjoyable.

The hotel admitted to us they were still working out the kinks because they had been open less than a year, but some will never be resolved. The rooms are small, even by New York standards. Shockingly, their is only very limited space for clothing. There is a wardrobe, about 15 inches wide to hang clothes, that you have to share with the ironing board. Maybe you can hang 5 or 6 things in there. But even more shocking they have no bureau to put your folded clothes!!!. Look at site photos carefully. The room is so small, one can't fit. The TV rests on a long narrow table. You have to pile your clothes on it. In all my trips to NY I have never anything like it. The bathroom is also small. And there was room for my wife's toiletries, not mine. The bed is comfortable, but the AC is extremely loud. The breakfast buffet is average, by NY standards, I have had better and worse. The breakfast room was poorly organized. And, they used paper plates, napkins and cups, and plastic utensils, all of that going into the landfill. Not environmentally friendly at all. We were disappointed in the maid service. One afternoon we came back to our room at 3:20pm and the room had not been made up. When we called the desk, they said rooms were cleaned in random order from 9 am to 4:30 pm. Never heard of that either. Elevators were slow, only 2 for 18 floors, 226 rooms, and no staff elevator. Lobby was small too, when a big group came in, we had trouble getting thru to the elevator. Everything mentioned in here would be echoed with the other couple we traveled with and by other people we spoke with and overheard. The glowing reviews make no sense to us. Oh and by the way, don't let the hotel name fool you. There are no suites, we asked, so you can't upgrade. The name is their trade name. The average rate we paid with taxes was $400 a night.

However, those things do not make up for the location.  It is not safe to walk to after dark because of the homeless who are staying in one doorway on this dark block that feels like an alley.  Unfortunately, just one block east feels safe but this block does not.  I am a city girl and my daughter lives in Manhattan but neither of us felt safe walking on this block after dark (58th between 10th Ave and 11th Ave).  Also, the rooms are very tiny even by NYC standards.  The bed takes up the entire room. There is a desk chair that only fits in its spot.  There are not any drawers to unpack clothes in.  There is a very small armoire to hang clothes in, no room to store luggage.  The night tables each have one drawer that will hold about two paperback books.  There is a safe but it is not reachable because it is on the floor right next to the bed (no place to bend down to it).  The bathroom is nicely laid out but again no where to put things.  There is barely a counter that will only hold a small cosmetic bag.  I stayed for 5 nights so I really missed being able to unpack and put my things away and hated having to leave my suticase out.

We chose the FAIRFIELD INN & SUITES MANHATTAN\/CENTRAL PARK because the price was good, specially for an hotel located near Central Park and Times Square.  We are from Canada and with the exchange rate, we just couldn't afford the 4 stars hotels directly in Times Square anymore.\n\nWhat a good move we made !  Everything was perfect and worth a lot more than what we payed for.\n\nThe entire hotel was renovated in 2016, which means that the furniture, the decorations, the carpets, the bathrooms, the lobby, the hallways and even more are all in perfect condition.  \n\nThe rooms are not super spacious, but hey : this is NYC !  They are still perfectly equiped and totally functional.  Glass showers, modern faucet, beautiful neutral colors, comfortable bedding... Everything was clean and tidy.\n\nThe staff was the best part of our stay : always helpful, smilling and polite.  They even saluted us and called us by our names every night when we came back in. There is always hot coffee and flavored water in the lobby.  Special mention to DANIEL at the front desk who is super friendly and funny, yet still professional and efficient.\n\nThe included breakfast was a surprise for us : there was something for every taste.  From scrambled eggs to cereals, oatmeal to sausages, bread, fresh fruits, cake, hard boiled eggs and yogourt, you were garanteed to find something good to sustain you.  This can easily save you 10 to 15$ US every day if you get up early enough to take advantage of it (from 6h30 to 9h on weekdays).\n\nBesides the included breakfast, you also have a refrigerator in your room, as well as a safe, without extra fees.  That is not so common in 3 stars hotels in NYC.\n\nThe hotel is located on 58th street, between 10th and 11h avenue, a bit set back from the main touristy sites.  But you can get to 59th\/Colombus Circle metro station in 5 minutes by foot.  Times Square is at about 10 to 15 minutes by foot also.  Yellow cabs pass in front of the hotel or at the closest corners every minute, and the hotel staff will even hail them for you if you ask for it.  Nothing to keep you from choosing this place.\n\nI would definitly go back at this hotel on my next trip !","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I would recommend this hotel. I forgot to take pictures when we got here.\n\nPros:\n*The staff is so friendly! The night Front Office Supervisor, Senia, and Daniel are truly a delight! They give recommendations freely. They make you feel so welcome when you walk through the door, it makes you feel like your going \"home\" and not just a hotel. We had so much fun talking to them every night!\n\n*While the rooms are small (it is NY), even with a king size bed it doesn't feel cramped. They've done a good job with making it comfortable and inviting. I love the art above the bed.\n\n*The beds are so incredibly comfortable! After all the walking you need a great place to land, and these beds and pillows do not disappoint.\n\n*The shades allow for total darkness in the room!\n\n*Its so quiet! I was told NYC would be so loud at night and to take earplugs. This hotel is in the residential area, and it makes for a very comfortable sleep. It also gives you a great place to decompress from the day.\n\n*Huge breakfast selection of your typical eggs, meat, cereal, yogurt, waffles, bagels, juice, coffee, oatmeal, etc.\n\n*The bar area has a nice seating area and a good alcohol selection. It has couches and a table separate from the actual bar so anyone can sit.\n\n*Decent size gym, but we didn't use it because all the walking wore us out.\n\n*The shower is a pretty good size.\n\nThings that are a positive, but also a con\n\n*The quiet, means it's a walk everywhere. Including to the subway. The first day it wasn't bad, but after all the walking you do (if you aren't used it), all you want to do is sit down and you have a decent walk back.\n\n*Ice makers - only in the lobby. You can get ice on your way in, because they have extra ice buckets downstairs. I think you have to take your extras back down because housekeeping doesn't take them. I think they'll bring ice up to your room if you ask\n\nCons\n*The elevators are very slow. There are too many people in this hotel for the 2 small elevators they have. They have a 10 people max and trust me everyone fills that capacity so it makes for a tight fit with 10 average sized individuals.\n\n*The breakfast ends at 9 during the week which feels early after exploring all night, but again it's the residential area.\n\n*The breakfast area isn't big enough for the amount of people in the hotel. We had to bring our food back up to the room to eat because there wasn't even standing room. Because the elevators are so slow, our food was cold by the time we got up to the room.\n\n*Housekeeping never refilled our coffee with regular coffee, only decaf, and didn't give us new cups. \n\nThe cons aren't deal breakers, but I think things that they could improve. Overall the pros would bring me back. I'll just bring better walking shoes!","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We received a warm welcome from the front desk staff and customer service was good throughout our stay. \n\nWe stayed in a room with two double beds on the 9th floor. The room was clean and bright with just enough room to get around and store our luggage. The bathroom lacked storage but we made do. The beds were VERY comfortable! \n\nI was a bit disappointed with the housekeeping as I felt just the bare minimum was done on a daily basis. Furthermore, our bathroom didn't have a bath mat until the second day, they kept throwing out our barely used soap from the sink everyday (which seemed quite wasteful) and they were giving us new towels everyday even though we had hung them to be re-used. \n\nThe in-room Wifi was easy to connect to and very reliable. The in-room smart tvs were a nice touch and worked well. \n\nThe daily breakfast was great and certainly adds value! The buffet had a very nice selection and the food was good. My only complaint is that all of the dishes and cutlery were disposable. For the quality of this hotel, it felt a bit cheesy and again, very wasteful.    \n\nThe hotel is located on a quiet street near many amenities and is about a 10 minute walk to the Columbus Cirlce (59th St.) subway station and an entrance to Central Park. \n\nI have stayed in other parts of the city and at other Mariott properties that I preferred over this one so although it wouldn't be my first pick, this hotel is largely in line with my expectations of the Marriott brand and I would consider staying here again.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Coffee pots,fridge, iron, flat-screen etc. The bed was very comfy, but the shower was fantastic.  It is spacious, with terrific water pressure. (we were only on 9th floor). The location of the hotel was the best part.  We were in NY for an expo, so being centrally located between the piers and central park was key to us.  A 15 minute walk you are in central park, same time to the piers.\n\nNow the cons- I knew staying in Manhattan meant that rooms were not going to be oversized, but this reminded me of college dorm days.  Not smelly socks in a corner  dorm days, but that size and storage is limited.  The king sized bed takes up the majority of the room, while the desk\/ entertainment center\/ takes up most of what remains.  Our room did not have a dresser, but instead a small closet that got filled up quickly. The bathroom is laid out in a fashion that wastes a lot of space that could have been used in the bedroom.

I was surprised at both because it seems both should be reasonably easy to resolve and it would improve the comfort of stay considerably.

If you get to choose, do not pick a room facing the street if you are a light sleeper.

The woman who checked us in was very friendly. We were given a room on the second floor, so I expected to hear some noise outside, in which we did.

The closet is almost non-existent (no exaggeration). The bed was not very comfortable to me, but the rest of the family did not mind it. I cannot recommend for a family of four. It's just too cramped inside. If you are single or maybe a couple then this would be perfect.\n\nThey have a small bar area and a fitness center, which I did not try.

Its rooms are spotless and clean (with wood floors rather than carpet), with modern furnishings. We had 2 Queen Beds, and were provided with a crib for our baby. This is where my only negative comment comes in, and that is that the room is TINY, especially with the addition of the crib, which takes away even more room to move around. However, if one is travelling and staying in Manhattan, one has to also understand and expect that accommodations are going to be cramped. This is NYC. Staff, especially those at the front desk and in the breakfast room, are friendly and helpful. Being a family of 4 with 2 young children, we really appreciated the daily breakfast buffet. It offered all the basics that you need to start your day: scrambled eggs, bacon and\/or sausage, yogurt, coffee, cereal, bread, juice, etc. It even has a waffle station with 4 irons so that you can make your own waffles.\n\nThe hotel is conveniently located close to Times Square, the metro stop at Columbus Circle (10 minute walk), and Central Park (13 minute walk). It's kind of tucked away on a quieter section W 58th Street where there isn't a lot of car traffic, though as previous posters mentioned, it is across the street from the hospital.\n\nHappy hour is also every night in the lobby from 4-7PM. It's not a very typical bar\/lounge setting, as it's just a long table with some chairs and couches, but it was a nice way to wind down in the evening with a drink.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our stay.

So, finding a good hotel at a reasonable price can be a challenge. The Fairfield Inn offers an excellent balance for for people who want their creature comforts at a price that won't kill the family budget.\n\nThe nightly rate of a hotel room in the Big Apple is dependent on several factors:\n\n1) Location - This Fairfield Inn is far from midtown and a long walk from Central Park. It's located between 10th & 11th Avenue, closer to the Hudson River than the park.\n\n2) Room Size - The rooms, like many Manhattan hotels, are very small...especially compared to suburban or high priced city hotels. I believe the cabin on my last ocean cruise was larger.\n\nSo, why am I rating this inn with an Excellent 5 on TripAdvisor?\n\nThe reason is that despite these negatives the Fairfield Inn has offsetting benefits that go beyond location and room size.\n\n1) Though small, the rooms are perfectly laid out. They are totally efficient. Every switch and outlet is right where it should be. The bathroom is excellent. It's shower is large. The sink and Toto toilet are first rate.  Lighting throughout the room is far better than most hotels I've stayed at. They even have the most efficient and innovative blackout curtain I've ever seen on a hotel room window.\n\n2) An excellent breakfast is included. It is better than at most Marriott properties we've been at. Given Manhattan prices that complimentary breakfast could cost you $30 for two people; more if you have kids.\n\n3) The staff is super friendly. That's every person from the front desk to the housekeepers. These people actually like their guests.\n\n4) The room and facility are spotlessly clean. The entire hotel is modern and well kept up.\n\n5) Marriott's point programs can be applied...and Marriott rewards its best customers. So, we were able to apply points to pay for one of our two nights.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you can allow for the off-the-beaten-track location and the small room you'll have a nice, efficient hotel room at an affordable price.\n\nMy one recommendation to Marriott management is that they consider putting an all-in-one workout machine in their fitness room. These used to be in the fitness rooms years ago but have since disappeared in favor of just hand weights and treadmills.  Though hand weights are OK, an exercise machine would add a lot to my stay.\n\nThis Fairfield Inn has my full recommendation.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was quite close to Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center. (And within walking distance of Central Park BUT not within view of it.) There were some nice local restaurants--including the Greek Kitchen. And it was quiet and away from the madness of Times Square. The hotel is brand new construction. However, the design isn't the best. The check-in area is very narrow and tight, so if several people are checking in, it's difficult to navigate around them and their luggage. \n\nMy room was quite small, even by NYC standards. However, I liked the laminate wood (rather than carpet) floor. And overall, the room is well-designed with ample desk space. The bathroom was also small, but there was a shelf to store toiletries. The worst feature of the room was the air vent--it was EXTREMELY noisy (so much so that I turned off the AC and opened the window). There was not a lot of street noise (an occasional ambulance from the nearby Sinai medical center), so the open window arrangement isn't a deal breaker (unless you stay in the summer or are a light sleeper). \n\nThe breakfast room was ample size--enough seating (which isn't always the case in hotels with complimentary breakfast). There was a wide variety of food--eggs, sausage, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal with toppings, bagels and pastries, waffles, cold cereal--an excellent value! \n\nI have mixed feelings about the front desk staff; they were friendly and cheerful, but not always familiar with the layout of the hotel or the hotel's location (for instance, I was told I was upgraded to a view room, but was actually given a room on the opposite side of the hotel--but I was given an apology and a new room; I asked for some dining recommendations, and the staff member could only give one. When I asked about taxi fare to the airport, the staff member said she wasn't sure.) \n\nOverall, I'm conflicted about this hotel. I do really like this unique location and I can be forgiving of inexperienced staff, but the AC was so loud it affected my sleep. To me, nothing is worse than feeling sleep deprived on a vacation in a fast-paced city like NYC. \n\nIf you're not a fussy sleeper and you're interested in a less touristy area that is still within walking distance to many sites, then you may really enjoy this budget-friendly FI.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were allocated an adapted room on the 7th floor which had a massive bathroom, but the shower was low but that didnt bother us as neither of us is very tall.  There isnt much hanging space for clothes in the room but as we were on a multi stop holiday we just lived out of our suitcases.  Breakfast was included and was very good - there was a choice of hot items that changed on a daily basis, cerials, yoghurts, bread, bagels, muffins, make your own waffles, a choice of hot drinks and juices.  The staff in the breakfast room were extremely polite and friendly - in fact all of the hotel staff were.  It did get a bit manic in there one morning (Xmas day!) and there werent many empty tables so a lot of people were taking their breakfast back to the rooms which was a good option.  The hotel had a small bar that opened at 4pm and they had a happy hour and they also served bar snacks if you didnt want to go out to eat.  There are only 2 lifts in the property and at these could be slow at busier times.  Nearby is Columbus Circle for the subway and its just a short walk to Central Park, Times Square and Broadway.  Overall a great little hotel in a nice quiet location but close enough to where you want to be - would definately stay here again when in NYC!!","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This hotel had the lowest prices. The positives are that it's a new hotel, so everything is clean. The bed, pillows, and linens are comfortable and fresh. All staff members are nice and helpful. I also like that the floors aren't carpet but instead hard floors, which feel cleaner than carpet. The decor is nice and modern with some artsy touches on the wall. The TVs are large and have a great picture. There's a long counter with a chair if you want to work on your computer. Breakfast is very well done, probably one of the better Fairfield Inn breakfast set-ups I've seen. It's in a larger room downstairs and has the same normal options but a few additional items too. \n\nThe negatives are the location is a bit out of the way. You have to walk from mid-10th Avenue to Columbus Circle to get to the subway (which isn't a big deal unless you're exhausted, carrying stuff, and have bad weather.) I didn't notice a simple way to get downtown using the buses, but you can get there with transfers. I didn't mind the location, it's just not as convenient as some other places I've stayed. (The upside to the location is that it's a quiet street and feels safe.) The other negatives are the walls are pretty thin and you have to call the front desk for ice since they don't have ice machines. The rooms are tiny and don't have much storage space. Everything is very compact. The closet only hangs about 4 items. There's only one area to lay-out one suitcase. For one person, it's manageable. Or for short-term stays, it's fine. \n\nOverall, I'm recommending the hotel because of the cleanliness factor, the current low prices, and the eagerness of the staff to provide good customer service.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Daniel who checked us out was also full of local knowledge about where to go nearby and how to get places while avoiding the crowded areas. \n\nThe location is outside of the main tourist\/hotel areas and 3 blocks from the subway so be prepared to do a bit more walking. There are some very good food places around Columbus Circle for snacks and drinks - Argo Tea is worth a visit if you want an alternative to Starbucks.\n\nThe noise insulation is not great - this is a common New York problem which still isn't fixed here, the windows let noise in and the guest room doors do nothing to keep out noise from the corridor so try to get a room away from the elevators! 1 trade off is that given its location the street noise at night isn't as bad as in some other parts of town.\n\nThe rooms are small but again this is a New York thing, by New York standards they seem fine for the price. The shower in the bathroom is brilliant, there is no token bath with a drizzly shower head over it. Instead they've forsaken the bath for a proper double width shower cubicle with a really powerful and high up shower head. \n\nPaid $140 for 1 night which for Manhattan is actually good value - we normally stay at properties on Lexington Avenue which charge around $200 a night. Having said that do bear in mind that this is the budget Marriott brand and so the building and in particular the free breakfast are basic.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

If the regular rooms are much smaller, larger luggage would be a huge problem. We were in room 1505 with a view of a roof top lawn. \nThe breakfast room is best before 8:00. After then, it has the noise level and commotion of a school cafeteria. The self service selection is large, from eggs to waffles to cold cereal, juice and fruit. The coffee is good. The staff is exceptionally attentive and will clear your table and make sure you are well served.\nThe location was good for us. We like to walk and thought nothing of the 10 minute walk to the subway stop at Columbus Circle and the walk of the the same distance to Lincoln Center. For the holiday week, I would certainly prefer this location to Times' Square, which has gotten way too crowded.\nThe bar area is popular with guests. Wine is about $15 per glass, but the pours are large.\nOur favorite thing about the visit was the service. This young staff go out of their way to please. Even the maintenance guy is very involved with the guests, welcoming all and giving advice on restaurants.

I'm also a cost-conscious traveler, so price is important. When booking in NYC, I put price as a priority, since hotels can get extremely pricey. So I found the new Fairfield Inn for about $107 per night, and though I should give it a shot. Two doubles beds are a must, so that was the room we chose. After check-in, we had to drive around the block to the off-site parking garage ($40 for a normal size car), but that's when trouble started. There was a apartment fire that caused hours of delays, street closures, and general mayhem. We couldn't get back to the garage and wandered for the next two hours in search of 1) a way to the garage, or 2) a place to eat and parking nearby. When we finally got close to the hotel\/garage, I tried to get out of our reservation. An employee named Daniel insisted on doing what he needed to to keep our business. In fact, he met us at the corner of 57th and 11th and walked alongside our car until we were safely through the police blockade and into the garage (there was a fire engine blocking the street entrance, so he had to direct us onto the sidewalk). After taking care of us, he did it again for another hotel guest. Daniel deserves Employee of the Month. \n\nAs for the hotel, there's good an bad: \n\nThe good: good complimentary breakfast, contemporary look, friendly staff, and you can park outside the hotel if you check in after 7pm. It's also three blocks from the subway. We went to Rockefeller and it was a three block walk and two stops on the subway to get to our destination. Very easy, even with subway newbies. \n\nThe bad: the room was extremely small, even for NYC standards. There was very little room to do anything besides sleep. I'm torn about the flooring. There was a laminate surface, which looks nicer than carpet, but I'd prefer carpet for my kids. Also, the elevators are excruciatingly slow. They do offer loaner cribs, but it took three attempts to get one to our room. Lastly, our phone wasn't working. The hotel was about two months old, so it's not an issue that I should have to deal with. \n\nOur experience was tainted by a fire emergency that was out of the hotel's control, but it still did make our stay a bit of a nightmare. I gave the hotel a VERY GOOD rating primarily because of the efforts of one individual who went above and beyond the call of duty.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rate was good compared to other hotel choices.  We wanted to be near Columbus Circle and Central Park, only a two block walk away, so this is a good choice for that location.

Decent restaurants close by to walk to.  \n\nNegatives\n1) Rooms are very small.  Ok for 2 people but any more than that and you would be on top of each other.  You have the space of one person between the bed and window and the bed and the desk.   \n2) Elevators are slow with all the stops. So as others have suggested take a lower floor and take the stairs.     \n\nI would also like to offer that I made a suggestion to the manager Axel about a concern I had in the breakfast area.   Axel agreed that the hotel can do better and this was corrected the next day.  Doesn't matter what the issue is, the point is the hotel is responsive.  Thank you Axel for listening to my concern and making this hotel experience better for all guests.  \n\nFor parking, you can pull up with your blinkers on and unload your car in front of the hotel.  They do have luggage carts available in the front door.   You may be able to park on the street overnight if you can find a spot.  Don't quote me on that.  The hotel offers $10 off a $50 rate at the garage under the BMW dealership next door.....a one minute walk.   Extra $10 a day mid-size SUVs and up.  I did find a much cheaper parking garage at 507 E 70th Street, only one block over.  The rate is $28 a day $36 for SUV even not having a hotel discount.  So I saved $14 a day over the hotel discount at the BMW garage for 5 days there for a total of $70 savings.    \n\nOverall this is a great hotel is your are not spending time there due to small room size.  The hotel is clean, friendly, and safe.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Large breakfast area with plenty of choices.(Free)\n\n4. Free internet\n\n5. Decent workout room with new Life Fitness Cardio Equipment and free weights.\n\n6.

KIng bed took up almost the entire space.\n\n2. Large TV in workout room did not work (I asked) which was strange considering the hotel just opened.\n\n3. Location while quiet is a hike to sights.

Firstly, the hotel is nice and new and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The king room was very tiny, which was fine, but trying to store items was challenging because there was no dresser and just a very tiny closet. However, I did like the coziness of the room.  Apparently, there are some larger rooms available. The other problem we had was with the car service they use when you want to arrange transportation to the airport.  First, the car showed up 50 minutes late which would have been huge if you had not allowed a lot of time to get to the airport. Secondly, the driver changed the price from what the hotel quoted. Third, midway to the airport the driver said he did not take credit cards and proceeded to stop at an ATM. Fourth, the driver said he could not provide a receipt. And lastly, my husband had to direct the driver into the airport because he had no clue how to get to the departure terminal for Delta. The hotel was notified of these issues and were very apologetic, but it left a bad taste in our mouths that they were using such a shady company.  \n\nThe hotel is close to Central Park and Columbus Circle.  Lots of decent restaurants within walking distance.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I waited to book our hotel room with the app \"Hotel Tonight,\" because the prices go down as you get closer to check-in time; that is, if rooms in some hotels remain available.  However, I did not end up using the app because I found this  brand new Fairfield Inn online and the price for one night was less than others found on the app, and they honored triple AAA.  The hotel has excellent front desk help and attention to customers' needs was excellent.   The Manager, Robert Castano was extremely helpful when we ran into a snag with the parking garage next door.  When we called the hotel for advice and to complain of an expensive error at the parking garage, Robert actually left the hotel and CAME to MEET  us in the garage in order to help us resolve the issue.  (The parking  attendant did not honor the price offered by the hotel and the attendant only spoke Spanish--total frustration)!   Robert's professionalism, and his ability to intervene in Spanish to resolve the problem was magical.  He, and the other staff made our stay feel very special.  In the future, I would stay again, except the hotel bar was lacking atmosphere and space; and the hotel ought to consider changing  the sitting area a bit; and try to rearrange bar into a larger, more inviting area rather than going to a window and ordering as if you were at a bank teller's window ordering something to drinkl.  The person I stayed with said the heating system had  a loud fan which did not allow for a great night's sleep, but I found the black out shade and comfort of the bed very nice. I slept fine and even missed my morning workout because I slept soundly-- and we had to be somewhere. The gym I missed trying out at the hotel has brand new treadmills and elliptical machines with attached televisions.  While we missed the free breakfast, we saw the room that  offers breakfast, which is quite large and offers a buffet, if you are there before 9:30 am  on weekends.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My only comment, which could be both a  positive and negative is that the flooring in the room, is a faux wood material like a pergo, which I appreciate because I know how bad and nasty some hotel carpets can get, so keeping the floors clean should be easier and you won't wind up with black dirty socks.

It is clean and in good condition.  Complimentary wi-fi and breakfast are nice.  Staff are still learning the systems and procedures; it took a few tries to get a key that worked for my room.  There is still a bit of residual work like minor painting taking place.  The room was tidy, small, but reasonably sized by NYC standards.  It was relatively quiet.  I would try this property again in a few weeks.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Room is small but that is typical for NYC.  Very clean and the staff is very helpful. From the map it looks like it is out of the way, but we found it accessible to Lincoln Center and Times Square.  After all one should walk in NYC even in the rain.  This hotel has very nice outdoor space which is quite unusual to find in the city.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Room are very small and AC is extremely noisy, I felt like I was sleeping with a running airplane engine in my room. I was part of a group and we all experienced the same noisy situation with AC.\nRooms and public areas are perfectly clean.\nThe entire team is very polite, well trained, proactive and very pleasant.\nDue to the noise level of AC, until this problem is fixed, I will probably not stay there again, but I could recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Camere belle, un po' piccole ma con ottimi materassi e arredi semplici e di buon gusto. Personale molto gentile e accogliente e sempre disponibile.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":10368723,"title":"Not that close to Central Park!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-09-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This hotel is still under construction so I can't comment on it directly. It looks like every other FFI that I've stayed at.   However, I work in the area and can tell you that its not that close to Central Park.  Its probably at least a 6-10 minute walk to Central Park from here.  If you are looking for a park front hotel or a place with lots of activity in the immediate area keep looking.  The area is all the way out on the West Side, a couple of blocks from the Hudson river.  It is a short walk to the bike\/walking path along the river.  There is a Citibike dock in front of John Jay College on 11th ave.  There is no on site parking so I guess they will make a deal with a local garage.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
