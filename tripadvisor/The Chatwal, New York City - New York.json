Despite choosing The Chatwal for four separate visits within the past year, I found myself receiving no special recognition or appreciation for my continued patronage.While I did enjoy the perks typically associated with my American Express Platinum card, such as room upgrades, I expected The Chatwal to extend personalized gestures acknowledging my loyalty beyond these standard benefits. Unfortunately, this was not the case.As someone who values the importance of customer loyalty, it's disheartening to feel like just another guest, especially after investing my time and resources into staying at The Chatwal multiple times. I believe that loyal customers should be acknowledged and rewarded for their dedication, yet my experiences at The Chatwal fell short of this expectation.I hope that The Chatwal, New York, takes this feedback into consideration and implements measures to better recognize and appreciate the loyalty of its guests in the future. Until then, I may explore other accommodations that prioritize and value customer loyalty.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

It has a lot of charm. The location is perfect for walkable to Bryant Park, Times square, NYC Library, Rockefeller Center , Radio City, Lincoln Center, St Patrick's, Central Park, Tavern on the Green, ton of restaurants. We walked to all the places mentioned. Close to a hop-on hop off stop. Cabs are easily available. We did not eat in the restaurant or drink in the bar.. The staff at the front desk was so kind to send a bottle of champagne. It was our 25th wedding anniversary. Unfortunately we did not get to drink it! The room is a little tight. I would remove some of the furniture. We were on an inner room. Did not hear any noise from the city which was well appreciated. Love the bathroom. Great rain shower, toiletries, robe and the Dyson blow dryer. Going to have to get a blow dryer from Dyson now... dang it. Coffee was provided in the morning You could grab one by the elevator to take to your room. There's just so much to see in New York City and I wish we had had a drink in the bar at least one night. Maybe instead of the champagne and drink in the bar that would have been great exclamation The only issue that I had was there were hardly any door men at the door....until checkout day on Sunday. The doors are pretty heavy to open. Most of the time they be lounging by the front desk. There's an opportunity for better service there. Otherwise, great service was experienced from housekeeping, reservations, and front desk.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

She explained the hotel amenities and the added benefits the AMEX provides. Our room was ready early, but we decided to have a cocktail in the lobby prior to brunch.

After we made the reservation for brunch, she took some time to talk to us and go over some of the hotel's history including notable guests and events. BTW - Brunch was fantastic! \n\nThe room was exquisite, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite that was spacious and very well appointed. The bathroom was amazing, I was captivated by the rain shower (45 minutes!!).  heated bidet, twin sinks and plenty of towels and toiletries. \n\nIt would take all day to explain every detail that made our stay perfect.

Really nice touch with a welcome letter, wine, chocolate and fruit! I had to double check with the front desk if it was part of the room before I open it and get charged for it ;) They assured me it was for us to enjoy. There was a slight hiccup when I checked in. I was early and the room wasnt yet available but my bags were accidentally brought up to another room which they thought was my room. Not a big deal since I had the show to see and my room was of course ready after the show.  The bed was turned down for us. What made it most memorable was the service. Every staff member was so friendly especially the staff member who handled our bags\/ and the door. I did not get his name unfortunately and I\u2019m bummed about it so I can properly give him the credit but he was just the nicest and most helpful.

He noticed we were a party of 5 and extended his generosity by offering us a room upgrade.  What made it most special is that he didn't really HAVE to do this - but id it anyway :-).  Then, he ensured that we were personally welcomed in our room with champagne and a hand-written note - What a nice touch.  We accepted and stayed in the Chatwal Suite with terrace, and Wow- What a treat!  While soaking under the rainfall shower, it almost felt like being transformed into another dimension.  In other words, it was a beyond Spa-like dream experience from only a shower :-o. But it was that garden terrace that had me from the moment I saw it.  Thank you, Manpreet- for everything.

For a hotel that bills itself as luxury and 5-star, the service was subpar and underwhelming, especially at the price point you pay and in relation to the service at comparable hotels.\n- Service at the Lambs Club (for breakfast x2) was uncomfortable at best. Server was inattentive and did not make you feel welcome. Small mistakes with our food for two straight days with breakfast. Who gives hot milk for an iced coffee. Rude\/aggressive when we tried to explain about breakfast credit we wanted to apply to our food. \n- Service at the front desk. Rarely see people at the front desk or at the front door. Ali was the saving grace and always positive when we saw him. Anyway, we had booked via AMEX and they provided us with some breakfast credit, which was explained to me either as \u201cfree continental breakfast or 80$ per voucher (for 2 people total)\u201d when I arrived. When we went to redeem this at the restaurant the server was rude to us and said that is not true and to deal with it at the front desk. We went to the front desk of the hotel and explained the situation and again was made to feel like I was in the wrong. \u201cWho told you this? What time did you get in? We don\u2019t do this (80$ credit) anymore - it\u2019s just continental breakfast.\u201d Ultimately they honored what they (initially) told me and I appreciated that, but thinking back on it it makes no sense for me to have known this was your previous policy\u2026.unless someone at the front desk explicitly told me this was an option. Bizarre. And although breakfast ended up being included and was actually pretty good, we ended up eating elsewhere and not going the third day because of how uncomfortable we felt on day 2 of breakfast at the Lambs Club. \n- Service for an issue with the room. They don\u2019t tell you this but the bathroom has a TV in it. No instructions btw. Only found this out because I noticed a red light that was on in the bathroom and it seemed really sketchy. I asked the front desk and they said it\u2019s a TV light and to use the remote in the bathroom to turn it on. I let them know that I had tried the remote but it didn\u2019t work - could someone come and fix that. I don\u2019t need the TV but if it\u2019s broken, why not fix it for other guests. When we return at 1am to the hotel the TV is blasting in the bathroom, and I tried using the remote to turn off the TV and it doesn\u2019t turn off. I called the front desk to get someone to turn off the TV so we can sleep. I call 15 min later and they said someone was coming up. \u201cOh hey, btw, did you use the remote. You have to be really close to the TV to turn it off.\u201d When I say really close, you had to be about 3 inches from the TV for it to turn off. When have you ever had to be this close to a TV to turn it on\/off. Again, it\u2019s the lack of clear communication or even instructions on the remote that would have avoided this issue.\n- Service upon check-out. They would not provide an invoice b\/c I had booked through Amex. I have booked several hotels over the years via Amex (including competitor \u201cluxury\/5-star hotel brands\u201d), and this is the first time I was made to feel like I had five heads when I requested a final invoice\/bill. I wanted to make sure that the breakfast credits were applied correctly (the staff replied \u201cOf course we do\u201d in an almost defiant tone) and there were no surprises as it\u2019s good practice in general to check the final bill because you do give them your credit card for any \u201cincidental charges.\u201d Ultimately I did not receive this final bill and am hoping I don\u2019t get any random surprises. Also felt rushed out despite no one else in line.\n- No room service after 11p despite them advertising themselves as having 24h room service\n- No Netflix despite there being a Netflix button on the TV remote. \u201cOur TV\u2019s don\u2019t support this.\u201d And honestly this really summed up the whole experience at the Chatwal. And while this is no fault of theirs, ESPN was not working when we were there for the US Open due to the Spectrum\/Disney issue. It\u2019s a little frustrating when you\u2019re there to watch the US Open in NYC and the TV in NYC does not play the US Open nor do your TV\u2019s allow streaming or smart capabilities that could have allowed us to stream it on the big TV. Ended up watching the Open on my phone. \n- If you get a back-facing room like we did you will not get any natural sunlight. I\u2019m not joking when I say I didn\u2019t realize the sun was out (it was hot and sunny every day) when we opened the blinds every morning at 8:30\/9. \n- While none of these is individually overly egregious per se, the sum didn't make for an enjoyable visit. When on vacation you're there to get away, not have more issues to deal with.\n\nTLDR: Price not worth it. Amenities are dated. I will not be returning. Go to the EDITION or Langham or anywhere else really that knows what customer service is.\n","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is amazing if it meets your requirements for being 30 seconds from Times Square and the theatres. \n\nThe rooms are quiet and you will get a good night\u2019s sleep - unless your neighbour is watching tv; if that happens, you\u2019re hearing what they\u2019re watching.\n\nI really, really wish I was writing a much more positive review. I spent months researching New York hotels for a special occasion, with multiple specific requirements, and was delighted to find The Chatwal.\n\nI was looking for a bit of a unicorn - quiet rooms (not always possible in NY), a bath as well as shower, AND a terrace. Oh yeah, near to the theatres as well. With 24 hour room service, or at least room service for part of the time. I told you I was looking for a unicorn. \n\nFrom what I could see from reviews, Chatwal ticked all of these boxes, and I excitedly booked the \u00a3700-850 per night room with terrace and bath for three nights in mid-July 2023. \n\nThe hotel has grand heritage and the story of the Lamb\u2019s Club is lovely. I won\u2019t go into it here but it\u2019s definitely worth looking into.\n\nUnfortunately, the hotel does not live up to it\u2019s heritage in either physical presentation, or service, and if you are looking for an opulent, luxurious stay with immaculate service, you will not find it here, I\u2019m afraid. \n\nI did not experience the \u201clooked after from start to finish\u201d or \u201cpampering\u201d at all, recounted by other reviewers and instead, witnessed several complaints from other guests during my stay. I wish I would have known half the stuff I am putting in my review beforehand, so I could discount it as an option rather than be disappointed.\n\nI have no idea what you need to do for fresh flowers and monogrammed linens but clearly, our custom was not as valuable to the Chatwal as that of others. I don\u2019t actually want those items, my point is that there is a huge discrepancy of how people are treated. \n\nThe terrace pictures on the website aren\u2019t exactly telling the whole story of what the terrace looks like, which is located surrounded by buildings (I do appreciate to be expected in NYC but there\u2019s creative photography and then there\u2019s misleading), with an overwhelming noise of various A\/C\/heating units. The terrace is absolutely not worth it, don\u2019t pay the extra for it. There was a water feature which didn\u2019t work. I asked at the front desk if there was a button we needed to press to turn it on and was told that in order to make it work, an engineer\u2019s appointment would have to be booked. \n\nIf you have a water feature on a terrace, you expect it to be working, not for the guest to have to raise, only to be told an engineer is required. If I\u2019m booking a room with a water feature on the terrace, it\u2019s a given I expect it to work as standard. That\u2019s not unreasonable, that\u2019s logical.\n\nThe bathroom was nice enough, however, the shower leaked onto the floor, no matter which way you stood in it. There is no way the staff aren\u2019t aware of this because it\u2019s a case of physics for how the bath slants downward toward the floor and the cleaning staff must be either mopping a flooded bathroom or removing sopping wet towels every day that the shower is used.\n\nAs another poster observed, the door staff were rarely present, and we didn\u2019t see the famed Concierge once, although we did have a conversation with a very helpful person on the Concierge desk one evening and were disappointed not to see him again as we wanted to give him a tip. \n\nThere is no room service between 9pm-6am, despite the literature in the room advising 24 hours. The literature was printed post-pandemic, so is reflective of what the hotel advertises on its website as well. The staff simply shrugged when this was brought up and reiterated the times it\u2019s available.\n\nThe elevator is long overdue maintenance to bring it up to date and is the slowest we\u2019d ever experienced. We took the stairs after the first encounter with the elevator.\n\nWhen returning to our room one day, we experienced a member of staff shouting angrily after us as we climbed the stairs, instructing us to go back down, and advising us only guests can go up to the hotel. We said we were guests and the attitude changed, however, it would have been better to ask first and even if we weren\u2019t guests, there was a better way to approach things. \n\nWe went to the Lamb\u2019s Club for breakfast one day and it was absolutely fine. Nothing spectacular but nothing at all wrong with it. High prices but not totally out of line with comparable locations.\n\nThe bar man in the hotel bar was excellent. He really made a huge difference to our stay and lifted it considerably. The dessert chef (apologies if this is the wrong title) who came round to offer bonbons whilst we were at the bar in our last night not only made absolutely heavenly bonbons (seriously, I\u2019d pay to ship these to the UK), she shared a beautiful story that Chatwal is missing a trick on by not including her on their website (if she consented, of course) and making more prominent use of her talent for surprise and delight for guests. \n\nThe hotel is not terrible. The location is excellent and you will get a good night sleep. It\u2019s just way past its prime and heritage only gets you so far when service is also lacking. \n\nFor context, we were in New York for 4 days, went to two Broadway shows, two Michelin starred restaurants, many pancake places, Ellis Island, tours all around town, Central Park, New Jersey etc and spent only sleeping and getting ready time in the hotel, including any visits back to change before going out. We did not spend all our time there and the review is from that perspective. I would return to Chatwal if they had an offer on because the location is excellent and we did get a good night\u2019s sleep. I love the heritage and hope it restores to its former glory.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It didn't matter if there was no doorman during the days though since you can't catch cabs or get dropped off in front of the hotel during the day because the road is apparently closed during the day per the taxi drivers -- seemingly for construction. There were multiple occasions when there was also no one at the front desk or concierge desk -- I was shocked by the lack of service in the lobby.

They claimed to fix it but it didn't work our entire time there. The staff wasn't friendly in our experience at all. We flew in red eye, tried to get our room early, that's okay that they couldn't accommodate but they promised to clean our room and get us in earlier than check-in. They were actually able to get us in the room just 10 minutes prior to check in. And I was traveling with children. The best staff we found were the doormen.

I was assigned a fantastic suite where complimentary premium water, a plate of fruit, fresh flowers and a delicious plate of charcuterie (which was my dinner) were left with a handwritten welcome note. \n\nThe bedroom was huge and comfortable and to my disbelief my initials were monogramed in the pillow covers..what a magnificent detail; then the butler (Sonna) rang to offer her services as all guests at the hotel are assigned a butler. \n\nA big thank to Suyapa from housekeeping whom everyday left the room spotless and even put fresh orchids in the bathroom; One day I even found a backgammon game set which later I noticed were left to all the guests. \n\nIn room service was also perfect and prompt; Cindy at the front desk always greeted me and Steven the doorman went to get the Sunday New York Times and left it in my door before 7.00am. The front desk team led by Adam Hermann is fantastic and followed up on all the details. \n\nFinally Congrats to Francisco the Head Concierge who assisted me with several things; he has over 20 years experience in the Times Square area thus a huge plus for guests looking for hard to get Broadway shows. \n\nThe details in room are too many to list here: plenty of complimentary water, complimentary fast wifi, an Illy espresso machine with pods replaced daily, luxurious linen and towels, ultra luxury toiletries by Asprey in the bathroom etc. \n\nThis is a boutique hotel and therefore they are able to focus on serving very well guests; whilst not cheap I found it to deliver much better value than most large luxury hotels. \n\nThe phrase \u201cyour home away from home\u201d has become a meaningless cliche but not at The Chatwal; These people truly know what they do and they care.

The one negative was the vanity unit, which features strange designer sinks that are a nightmare if you wear contact lenses (good luck if you drop one) or if you want to fill the sink with water (not possible, no stopper), and a bottom shelf comprised of useless wide-spaced rungs so you can't easily store anything there.  \n\nWe really enjoyed our stay at the Chatwal, it's one of the best of the NY hotels we've experienced.\n","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was in an entry level room, which was spacious enough for what was advertised.  The room lacked natural light and had only a small window.

The bathroom was excellent -- extremely spacious relative to the size of the room with a wonderful shower and many premium toiletries and amenities.  The carpets were a little old and worse for wear.  Many of the fixtures were tired in general.  Given the room rates, it was disappointing that the rooms lack many of the more standard products in other luxury hotels (such as espresso makers, etc.).

I ended up choosing The Chatwal, due to the fact that I really enjoy The Luxury Collection brand. Overall, this was a very nice stay. Would I be back? Maybe.\n\nThe Chatwal is in a gorgeous Art Deco style. I love how the hotel is an intimate, boutique property. It was so easy to navigate and I really got to know the staff. By the second day, one of the doormen said, \"Welcome back! It's good to see you again.\" The staff were all absolutely lovely. Oddly, we had a welcome card in our room from the butler, but whenever we contacted him, we were told he wasn't on duty. It was very strange and pointless to offer that service. However, the staff were all very quick to take care of any needs we had. \n\nThe room was stunningly appointed, with elegant furnishings and rich colors. The bed was comfortable, but had very bad staining on the side. There was nothing in the minibar and turndown service was not offered. It wasn't a huge deal, but not offering these things knocks the hotel down from being a true luxury property. We absolutely loved the huge bathroom, with the walk in shower. It felt so luxurious with the Asprey toiletries and warm brown tones in the bathroom. If you are a light sleeper, note that sound between rooms is very apparent. There is also quite a bit of street noise. \n\nCurrently (as of February 2022), room service is offered until 10pm and the restaurant is open to hotel guests. I never ate in the restaurant, but it looked lovely. There is a very small fitness center that's open 24 hours. You do need proof of vaccination to use it. It's a nice gym with all of the basics, but isn't suitable for anyone needing a lot of equipment for an extensive routine. Also, the spa and pool are currently closed.\n\nI would possibly return to the Chatwal, but I would like to try other luxury properties in the city first. Maybe this hotel can be 5-star again when it reinstates some lost services.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Nevertheless, you sleep well and the bathrooms are large and comfortable.\nThe hotel facility is of a good standard, as is the restaurant and bar. The breakfast at The Lamb Club is also excellent, both the service and the dishes.\nUnfortunately, the positives end there. I had booked a rate with breakfast included (and I'm also Bonvoy Platinum so I get free breakfast) but I received vouchers for the continental breakfast (which includes only coffee, a juice, some fruit or cereal and two croissants). If you want the American breakfast (with eggs and bacon) or a second orange juice you have to pay extra... Also, at check out I found out that you have to pay for water (brought by default to the waiter and costing $10 + tax per day - more than a quarter of the value of the breakfast that cost $36 on the menu). Honestly I find this policy really outrageous, a real scam. I would like to tell you about the other amenities such as pool, spa, gym, evening turndown service and house car but I could not use them because they were not available. Not even the room service is H24 (closes at 10am), the minibar is empty and there is no coffee machine in the room. At checkout I pointed out that paying $10 for water in a breakfast that should be included is outrageous and received a rude response from the manager who denied that my rate included breakfast and said that he was just doing me a favor to include it. After I showed him the confirmation email, he cancelled the bill with an annoyed look and didn't even bother to apologize for the bad impression. I have toured several hotels in the USA and around the world and this is the one that left me with the worst memory. Asking the full price and cheating guests at breakfast, not including the evening turndown service and not giving any compensation (not even a drink) for all the unavailable services disqualifies the whole hotel and the manager, who - in my opinion - should be ashamed and change his job. Even the latest reviews on the web confirm my bad experience and lead me to advise anyone against staying here. The Chatwal may have been a grand hotel, now it is more like a 3 star hotel both in terms of services and how you are treated.

The staff were incredible on all fronts.  From the moment we checked in, through drinks and dining, to the butler service (yes some rooms have butler service,) we felt an even, but non-intrusive helping hand. When we arrived, our rooms were not yet ready, but the door men, and front desk hopped into action, taking our bags, offering lunch ideas, and even water and umbrellas for our exploration.  \n\n Even though the property is only a block from Broadway, which we avoid like the plague, the location as surprisingly quiet and allowed easy access to the hub-bub but also to quitter locales to the east like Bryant Park, etc.  The lobby was beautiful and comfy with amazing people watching especially right before the theatre and had coffee available until late morning.  There was also a lobby bar with friendly staff and incredible drinks (Bloody Mary ice cubes anyone?!) There\u2019s also some dining options, including a second floor restaurant with live jazz in the evenings and another bar.   I don\u2019t normally suggest hotel food in New York, but this was one offered one of the best meals I\u2019ve had in a long time.  Order the cod with stuffed calamari and relax with an excellent cocktail while listening to the jazz.  Honestly, it\u2019s dumb to say in NYC, but you don\u2019t have to leave the hotel to have a great visit and that\u2019s what makes this spot so fulfilling.  That said, the location was perfect for exploring, either on foot or by metro, especially given it\u2019s relative quiet and calm so close to Times Square.  \n\nNow for the room itself, I should mention we were upgraded one level from a standard to a junior suite, but even in NYC that label can lead to a room where you can barely walk around the bed.  That was definitively not the case here, the room was practically palatial and extremely comfortable to-boot.  The bed itself offered an excellent sleep with tons of pillows, a nightly turn-down service, and excellent black-out curtains that combined with the double-paned windows to provide for excellent relaxation.  I didn\u2019t work from the room, but the couch and desk were both large and near lots of plugs.  The bathroom was gigantic with rainfall showers, heated toilet seats, double sinks and bidets.  However, when you go to pay the rate, you may say \u201cfor this, I expect over-the-top amenities.  Well, those were there too.  The rooms came with an iPad from where you could control lighting, set wake-up calls, play music, and even order up a shoe-shine, laundry, and shirt pressing while sipping your in-room Nespresso.\n\nAgain, generally I use my NYC room as a launching point to other things, and no more than a place to put your feet up and lay your head.  The Chatwal goes so much further in every area, form service to food to relaxation and a feeling of quiet home.  If you have the means, this is a special spot.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

He assisted us in getting rides to the Met and Natural History Museum. Eduardo was always friendly and greeted us every morning. The housekeeping staff always did a great job in keeping our room neat, clean and tidy. We had drinks and food a couple of nights at the Lambs Club which was very nice. It was nicely atmospheric.

I thought I was paying $18 for yogurt delivered to the room, it was $30. They cleaned my room late in the day. They are close to be a very fine property but need to get the little things right or its just not a good value.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room - while not very big - was comfortable and practical. I had access to a patio which was nice since I visited in June. The bathroom was a little dated with way too many mirrors, but the built-in TV in the bathroom was pretty neat - probably convenient if you take a bath. I did get a room upgrade, so I'm pretty sure the rooms in that hotel aren't the biggest since it's a old building.\n\nThe staff at the hotel was extremely friendly, they even ironed my dress shirt for free. \n\nBreakfast was very crowded but good. I did not take a look at the gym since I had a bad cold and wasn\u2019t feeling great. I had a great experience overall and would definitely stay there again.\n\nAdditional Info: I needed to stay one night in NYC for a business trip but wasn\u2019t able to find any decent hotels at a reasonable rate and decided to utilize the Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts site to book a night there. Those hotels are usually in a higher category and more expensive, but I figured I\u2019d rather spend $100 more for a good hotel than spend $250 for a mediocre one.

Wir sind mit gro\u00dfen Erwartungen angereist, da wir bisher ausnahmslos gute Erfahrungen mit Hotels der Luxury Collection gemacht haben (z.B Schlosshotel Fuschl am See, Nakha Island Phuket, Laguna Beach Bali, etc). Diese Erwartungen wurden leider im Chatwal auf ganzer Linie entt\u00e4uscht.\nFangen wir mit den wenigen positiven Aspekten an, die leider sehr schnell aufgez\u00e4hlt sind: Die Lage des Hotels direkt am Timesquare ist sehr gut, so dass man viele Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten in NYC zu Fu\u00df erreichen kann. Zudem ist das Concierge-Team sehr bem\u00fcht und hat uns bei allen Restaurant-Reservierungen sehr gut unterst\u00fctzt. Das war es aber auch schon an positiven Dingen, die man im Chatwal erleben darf.\nInsgesamt war der Aufenthalt leider sehr entt\u00e4uschend. Anl\u00e4sslich meines 40. Geburtstags haben wir uns f\u00fcr ingesamt 7 N\u00e4chte im Chatwal eingebucht, was im Vergleich zu anderen G\u00e4sten eine \u00fcberproportional lange Dauer darstellte. Trotz des besonderen Anlasses, \u00fcber den meine Frau das Hotel mehrmals informiert hatte, gab uns das Chatwal ein \u201eZimmer\u201c das maximal als bessere Besenkammer durchgeht. Weniger als 20 qm gro\u00df, mit einem einzigen kleinen Fenster zum Innenhof, so dass das Zimmer \u00fcber faktisch kein Tageslicht verf\u00fcgte und mehr an eine Gef\u00e4ngniszelle erinnerte. Die Klimatisierung im Zimmer war nur von eiskalt bis tropisch -warm steuerbar. Und dies alles f\u00fcr knapp EUR 600,00 die Nacht. Der Gipfel war dann bei der Ankunft im Zimmer, dass sich nach erstmaliger Benutzung und anschlie\u00dfenden Verlassens des Badezimmers die Badezimmert\u00fcr von au\u00dfen nicht mehr \u00f6ffnen lie\u00df. Ein toller Start, nachdem man gerade mehr als 9 Stunden Flug in den Knochen hatte und man sich f\u00fcr das Abendessen frisch machen wollte. Ein Techniker versuchte sich dann knapp 2 Stunden an dem \u00d6ffnen der T\u00fcr. Ein Frischmachen war f\u00fcr uns nicht m\u00f6glich, da sich s\u00e4mtliche Kosmetikartikel bereits in dem verschlossenen Badezimmer befanden. Letztlich musste der Techniker die veraltete Badezimmert\u00fcr gewaltsam aufbrechen. Dies hatte zur Folge, dass sich die Badezimmert\u00fcr nicht mehr schlie\u00dfen lie\u00df und die T\u00fcr sperrangelweit offen stand.\nNachdem wir die Rezeption \u00fcber diesen Missstand informierten und um ein anderes Zimmer baten, hie\u00df es, dass das Hotel angeblich vollkommen ausgebucht sei und ein Zimmerwechsel nicht m\u00f6glich w\u00e4re.Als Gegenleistung bot man uns ein freies Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck f\u00fcr den Folgetag an. Das Zimmer mit der aufgebrochenen Badezimmert\u00fcr sollten wir behalten. Nachdem wir darauf hingewiesen haben, dass wir f\u00fcr den stolzen Preis von fast EUR 600,00 die Nacht ein solches Zimmer nicht akzeptieren werden und obendrein durch meinen runden Geburtstag ein besonderes Anlass ansteht, war auf einmal das Hotel nicht mehr voll ausgebucht , wie es noch vor wenigen Minuten hie\u00df. Man bot uns dann ein \u201eUpgrade\u201c auf ein anderes Zimmer an, was allerdings mit Zusatzkosten von knapp EUR 200,00 pro Nacht verbunden gewesen w\u00e4re. Die reinste Abzocke! Als wir dies ablehnten und das Hotel langsam merkte, dass wir die Geduld verlieren, war dann auf einmal doch ein Zimmer der gleichen Kategorie und ohne Aufpreis frei, was wir nach langem Hin und Her bekamen. Ein solches Verhalten habe ich in einem Luxushotel noch nie erlebt. Nachdem wir dann vom Abendessen gegen Mitternacht zur\u00fcck kamen, klingelte unmittelbar nach unserer Ankunft im Zimmer das Telefon. Der Rezeptionist fragte allen Ernstes um Mitternacht bei uns nach, ob wir nun doch nicht das Upgrade f\u00fcr EUR 200,00 die Nacht nehmen wollten? Das kostenlose Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck wurde nicht mehr angeboten. Stil und Klasse, wie man es von einem Luxushotel erwarten d\u00fcrfte, absolute Fehlanzeige!\nLeider setzten sich die negativen Erfahrungen auch w\u00e4hrend des restlichen Aufenthalts fort. Obwohl sich die Rezeptionsmitarbeiter f\u00fcr die Erfahrung am ersten Tag entschuldigten und immer wieder darauf verwiesen, dass ich doch ein paar Tage sp\u00e4ter in Ihrem\nHotel einen tollen Geburtstag feiern soll, gab es am Geburtstag selbst keinerlei kleine Aufmerksamkeit nicht mal eine Geburtstagskarte. Unpers\u00f6nlicher geht es wohl nicht mehr.\nInsgesamt ist das Chatwal in vielen Punkten \u00e4u\u00dfert kleinlich, was f\u00fcr ein Luxushotel unw\u00fcrdig ist. Man hat den Eindruck, man will viele Leistungen nur auf dem Papier anbieten, tats\u00e4chlich sollen die G\u00e4ste die Leistungen aber nicht in Anspruch nehmen. So wirbt das Hotel mit einem kleinen Indoor-Pool, der nach einem anstrengenden Sightseeing-Tag durchaus f\u00fcr Entspannung sorgen kann. Nur wie soll man den Pool nutzen, wenn die \u00d6ffnungszeiten des Poolbereichs nur zwischen 10 Uhr und 18 Uhr liegen. Zu dieser Zeit will man doch gerade NYC kennenlernen! Dann erscheint es auch in Ordnung, dass es im Zimmer zwar keine Kaffeemaschine gibt, man sich aber in der Lobby kostenlos einen Kaffee holen kann. Dies bringt allerdings auch nicht sehr viel, wenn die kostenlose Kaffee-Bar nur in der Zeit von 8:00 bis 9:00 Uhr \u201ege\u00f6ffnet\u201c hat. Nett klingt es auch, dass das Hotel einen kostenlosen Fahrservice anbietet, der einen abends in Restaurants fahren soll. Kleinlich ist es allerdings, wenn einem der Fahrservice verweigert wird, da er nur f\u00fcr 20 Blocks gilt und unser Restaurant bl\u00f6derweise aber 22 Blocks entfernt ist. Bezeichnenderweise empfiehlt das Hotel selbst meist nur Restaurants, die au\u00dferhalb von 20 Blocks liegen. Die Beispiele sind hier nicht abschlie\u00dfend. Da ist jede Jugendherberge kulanter und gro\u00dfz\u00fcgiger.\nInsgesamt leider ein sehr entt\u00e4uschender Aufenthalt. Wir kommen definitiv nicht wieder!","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's located steps away from the theaters and Time Square so everything is within walking distance, but it can get a bit hectic too. Nevertheless, the hotel was always a quiet luxurious refuge from the madness of midtown. We were always greeted by name and with kind smiles. Waters were offered upon returning form our run in Central Park, which was a nice touch. The spa and gym are small but stylish and our massage was fantastic. The bar in the lobby and on the second floor were equally posh and of course, the hotel is home to Iron Chef Zakarian's Lamb's Club. Room service comes from the Lamb's Club too, so when we ordered a burger at midnight, it was indeed epic. We stayed in the Heritage suite, which is actually two rooms combined together (901\/902). It seems a little odd at first, but it was nice to have two full bathrooms so that we didn't feel cramped and we also had a separate seating area that was so comfortable that I took a nap in the middle of the day.

Called to tell the staff.  They were willing to come bring more towels and mop up; but otherwise, no solution, no offer to switch rooms.  We cleaned up the floor ourselves after each shower with a pile of soaking wet towels.  Yet at 100 degrees outside in NYC, we needed the shower multiple times.  What a mess!\n\nOnly 1 of 2 elevators working.  When the \"good\" one got stuck, waited 15 mins, finally got directed to the service elevator.\n\nPoor sound insulation.  You can hear almost everything next door, especially through the vents and bathroom.  Tons of hair dryer noise.  Awakened by noisy neighbors at 4:30 in the morning.  Then at 7AM by an alarm from the next room that kept beeping for over 30 mins; had to call the front desk.  (They then dealt with it quickly.) You'll need quiet neighbors here.  Ours weren't and a bad night's sleep for this reason is a dealbreaker...\n\nAt checkout, the staff finally seemed to realize this was a bad stay. They offered to comp breakfast, but breakfast was already included in our room rate.  They then decided to offer a room upgrade for our next stay, and promised to follow-up by e-mail, which 36 hours later still hasn't arrived.  Frankly, we were eligible for an upgrade THIS stay (Amex FHR), but they didn't offer anything, even after all the problems with the shower.  \n\nThe staff was very kind, but I must admit it's kind of annoying when they fumble around to find compensation that costs them nothing and requires us to come back and spend a lot more money -- and then just fails to follow-up anyway.  Better to have just said \"sorry,\" and left it alone.\n\nI did, however, receive an unsigned e-mail from the Chatwal with my folio and a request to write a Trip Advisor review, which I don't do too often.  I e-mailed them back asking if they really wanted a review, but they didn't reply.  Another fumble...\n\nBottom line: the hotel is a calm, elegant spot in the Theater District.  But we spent a lot: $950 (w\/tax) for a night in a loud, wet, <300 square foot room.  My bad judgment in trying someplace new; this rate would have bought a larger space and better view at the Mandarin, Ritz Carlton Central Park, Park Hyatt, St. Regis, and many other top spots.  So even for NYC, sorry guys, you made this feel like a really bad deal.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":1641016,"title":"Chatwal - Chat With The Wall","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-07-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"The Chatwal, centrefold NY, is nestled 2 blocks from Times Square and is a short jaunt to the Broadway theatres. This is a high-end hotel prestigiously encased in a landmark building interiorly marked by majestic Art Deco fashion. In former years, The Chatwal was the haunt of the rich and famous and the royalty of the greatest stars on Broadway. It is rich with their shenanigans and tales and uses this notoriety as a drawing card in the hotel's marketing strategy.The Chatwal has endured iterations of remodels, renovations and remastering to get to the fervour of luxury it portrays today. It is a fusion of  old-school Art Deco design with a spectrum of modern glam.\n\nThe facade of The Chatwal is majestic. When viewed from across the street, at night, it looks like a gigantic alter dotted with appropriately sized candles, sanctuary-like....almost saintly. The componentry of the lobby makes use of reds, browns and warm lighting that ensures a welcoming vibe for guests. The Chatwal offers a comprehensive repertoire of suites (suite oriented hotel), some include spacious furnished terraces.The suites are all meticulously curated with built in cabinets veneered with faux leather which morphs them into classic luggage pieces from yesteryear. The walls are fabricated in suede and spacious baths are plastered in stripes of tinted mirror and doused with an abundance of decadent toiletries and when you throw in complimentary butler service you now have the basic standard of all rooms, a very high hoteliery bar indeed. The \"Chatwal Crowns\", a collection of 10 suites, each having a unique distinctive theme, are the real accommodation stars of this hotel production.\n\nI was in a Tinseltown mood, so I booked the Hollywood suite. The suite was ornamented, of course, along Hollywood lines with movie art and cinematographic memorabilia arranged throughout. The bath was an eye-popper, like walking into the \"House of Mirrors\" at Coney Island, with glistening black marble floors, mirrored walls that encased a shower cubicle bigger than most NYC apartments, and a vanity area complete with a behind the mirror television. I could brush my teeth and watch \"Good Morning America\" at the same time...more multi-tasking. But beware, the toilet seat comes hot....a bit of luxe over-kill I suspect.\n\nI'm not usually a spa person, but after my harrowing trip into the city, I needed something relaxing. I tripped down to the Red Door Spa where I engaged in the signature \"Stress Melt Ritual\". I felt like I was in suspended animation.\n\nAfter the spa, all topped-up with exhilaration, I moseyed on to the Lambs Club restaurant which featured a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace, chrome light fixtures, hand crafted leather seating. Black and white photos of broadway and Hollywood stars grace the walls, like the TCM screening room, with portraits the likes of Katherine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Charlie Chaplin, W.C. Fields amongst others. They are arranged in such a position and fashion that they seemed to be talking to one another. This bonanza of pictures is so enticing that one is inclined to chat with the wall as if you are part of the imaginary conversation.\n\nSince this restaurant is called the Lamb's Club, I ordered Colorado Lamb Chops from the heftier part of the menu (sumptuous) paired with a cocktail called \"Surprise Me\" (artistically handsome and delicious) and warm Rhubarb Shortcake (a taste of heaven).\n\nAll hotel staff were attentive, experienced in their craft and were amped up to anticipate and execute your every wish. Keep in mind that the Chatwal is a fully loaded luxury hotel and it is advisable to come with a heavy wallet and a strong credit card(s).....not withstanding...the Chatwal embraces an \"all-in\" NYC hotel experience........so when luxury, location and comprehensive facilities and service are your requirements for tackling NYC..........then try The Chatwal..........Chat With The Wall.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"SOLO"}
{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1641016,"title":"Excellent Service, Great Location for Shows, Mediocre Restaurant","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-07-05","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We stayed here for 5 nights in June 2019.\n\nThis hotel has some incredible strengths and just a few weaknesses but overall, it's a real quiet peaceful refuge in the middle of a busy crazy city. Inside, you would never know you are in NYC Times Square show district.\n\nMy entire stay was hosted as part of a week long engagement.  This is not the place to stay if you are concerned about prices.  A full breakfast here is $40 per person so $100 a couple with tax and tip.\n\nWhat I loved:\n\nThe toilet hands down was the best part of my room. It was electronic and had a butt cleaning spray that must have had a laser because it was accurate every time.  It would shoot hot water directly into the right spot at first shot and the hot water would continue for at least a minute.  Felt so good, and got you clean like you need to be.  If all toilets had that, the world would be a better place.  It also has a front sprayer for women. When you are done with the water, you tap the hot dryer button and it drys you down there--perfect!  Plus the toilet seat was always heated.  If my schedule was not so busy I would have spent more time here.\n\nThe rain shower was excellent--as good as it gets in shower technology, although sometimes the temp control did not hold the temp and needed adjusting during the shower.\n\nI loved that they covered the bed headboard with a sheet. All hotels should do that.\n\nYou know how you hate closing hotel double curtains with your hand before bed or opening them in the morning--who knows how dirty\/dusty they are--Not here:  They have remote controlled curtains--Channel 1 for the outer and Channel 2 for the inner.  They were the best and fun to use.  It was one of my favorite things to do everyday. Everyone should get them--perfect opening and closing every time.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable.\n\nThe service from the front door and desk staff was impeccable.  Immediate response for everything.\n\nThe King bed standard room was tight for 2 people--I had to keep pushing in the desk chair to get by and two people can't pass one another in the room. These are small rooms like on a ship.\n\nOur room faced the back--an old rent controlled apartment building (see pic), but with the double pain high quality windows closed and not facing street side you could hear a pin drop at all times it was so quiet and peaceful.\n\nLocation is perfect if you are in town to see shows--you will be able to walk to all of them. It's also close to the E train that takes you right into 1 World Trade Center.  I took it and it's the fastest way--20 minutes--E train's last stop.\n\nA constant annoyance both at night and each morning was not having a refrigerator in the room.  It's a problem with no solution because as I looked around the room, there is no room to put one.  We had no place to put the great dinner leftovers, cakes, or some yogurt or hard boiled eggs for the morning to get us going. Food went to waste.  No place to keep bottles of water cool.  Sure the staff would come up and take care of that for us--but you know--it gets old keep calling them for help. Like at home, you just want some things right there immediately.\n\nThe other weak spot was the hotel restaurant.  Because it is a small low volume operation, even though it carries a high end menu with high end  prices, it does not result in quality and efficiency.  They can't afford to have an executive chef and professional manager there full time.  One morning our order was forgotten and we had to go through 3 people to get it out.  At dinner, a request for the salmon to be cooked medium came out sushi raw after I cut into it.  When I told the waiter, instead of remaking it, they gathered all the bits and put it back in the oven and re-delivered the pieces to us.  I was not expecting that.\n\nI would like to see a breakfast menu that lends itself toward efficiency like an Omelet with a choice of egg whites and a clear list of add-in's to choose from. How about Yogurts from Fage or Chobani and some grain cereals. Freshly cut and cooked potatoes. Freshly squeezed OJ and Grapefuit juice for their sophisticated clientele.\n\nTheir lounge is an excellent environment for pleasure or business and I am sure they can mix any concoction you desire.\n\nThey have the best complementary Mercedes car service from 2 PM to 10 PM that will drop you off within a 20 block radius.  The will also complementary press your clothes and shine your shoes.  Their towels and sheets are top quality and housekeeping is excellent.\n\nOverrall, this is a fine small personalized hotel to stay if your budget can handle it, with the limitations I outlined above that may not be a concern for your stay.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

At the time I was a Starwood Platinum member and got a nice upgrade to a junior suite. I always looked forward to coming back and was delighted to schedule a three-night stay. The hotel is very much the same \u2013 even though it is in a busy street going west to loud Times Square, it is very quiet and tranquil inside. Going east from the door, it is mid-town with less tourist traffic.\n\nStaff is invariably delightful. Special mention to Ali at the front door and Kyle with the car. My wife said Pilar at the spa was great. The room is a mixture of Orient Express and technology. Very nicely appointed. The Lavazza espresso machine produced delicious coffee. Towels are fluffy, robes are soft, and Asprey toiletries, while a bit parfumy for me, are very nice. The fitness room is small, but serviceable.\n\nJust three relatively minor gripes: One: the climate control was a bit glitchy and we had to set it up again every time we returned to the room. Two: I am now a Marriott BonVoy lifetime platinum member and wanted to have a nice upgrade for the rare stay with my wife. I was upgraded to exactly the same junior suite, which would have been nice if I hadn\u2019t used 3 of the 5 suite upgrades I had earned for this year. I probably would not have used them if that was the case. I made several calls in advance and got conflicting answers. Reached out twice to Judith Dilone as I saw she answered reviews on tripadvisor to discuss, but she never called back. The last one is breakfast. Last time a full breakfast was included because of frequent guest program status. This time, I chose the breakfast amenity and it is a \u201ccontinental breakfast.\u201d The issue is that there is no protein offered whatsoever. The coffee was delicious, the two pastries excellent and the parfait or fruit salad good too\u2026 but there was no choice with eggs. In my experience with many Luxury Collection hotels, a full breakfast is offered to those of us who earned high status through years of loyalty. It was fine, but somewhat disappointing.\n\nI will come back if - like this time - the location is convenient for our activities.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's an easy walk to most area theaters and takes the stress out of trying to find cabs.  We booked through Marriot bonvoy.  We will stay at The Chatwal even when not going to theater.  The walk from the hotel to Fifth Avenue is easy.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I would not recommend booking a superior room and if u book points and want recognition for status i suggest find another hotel as this one wont look at your side (p.s. we overheard another elderly couple at check out when asked if they would come back they said they dont feel mariott treats loyal members properly and they are disgusted by it)","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The size is nice, a boutique hotel that\u2019s beautiful inside.  \nOk- a couple things to work on! So we had an issue 1st night with no hot water, unfortunately we waited til 11pm to take shower from day and disappointment set in as no hot water.  The staff was quick to jump on it, but it was not resolved until later, after our bedtime.  We had hot showers the rest of the trip and we were compensated with a hotel credit but it was a bit of bummer.  Again service was top notch!  \n2nd item.  It\u2019s minor but important to me, no in room coffee.  Not sure why and they do have coffee in lobby for short time in morning.   But I missed coffee in my robe in my room. \nAlso, bell hop arranged a car for airport on last day which was wonderful.

I would not do the same.  \n\nOur toilet failed to flush properly the first morning we were there, but by flushing it repeatedly over a dozen times I was able to get most of what was in it down.  I reported it to engineering, via their digital system for reporting such things. When we returned from having been out for several hours, I received a message back that it had been fixed while we were out, but it was not.  We reported that to the front desk and left to go to dinner and a show.  When we returned, we had received another message that it was repaired, but we could tell it hadn't been by flushing the toilet and seeing how poorly it operated, even with nothing more than a sheet of toilet paper in it.  The next morning, we attempted to flush the toilet repeatedly after using it, and it was really inoperable and created quite a smell.  We left to go out to lunch and a matinee show and made it clear at the front desk that they had better fix it or change our room.  When we returned we went up to our room and it had been fixed, but no-one should have to report a broken toilet three times and spend two full days in a room with it.  \n\nI might add that after the toilet had finally been repaired on our third day there, the people at the front desk chose to change the code on our locks.  Why they did that I have no idea, because the reservation was always for three nights.   I discovered this only when we were leaving to go to a Valentine's Day dinner reservation and the Cher Show, but forgot our tickets to the show and had to run up to the room to get the tickets.  As a result, while an Uber car was waiting and charging me for being late, I had to go to the front desk and ask them for new keys.  At that time, the people at the front desk wanted to discuss the fact the toilet had been repaired, but the time they took to do this was costing me money as the Uber driver was charging me for being late.\n\nThe room was fine and other than the items above, the service was generally good, but I cannot give this hotel more than a \"poor\" rating under the above described circumstances.  Their \"engineering\" staff is obviously not capable and the management obviously does not do sufficient supervision of them.  It doesn't take a genius to put a piece of toilet paper in a toilet and see if it goes down.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We booked a 3 night stay using Starwood.Marriot points and were given room 303. I have Gold status with Starwood and Marriot.\n\nFirst of all, the hotel is located just steps from Time Square. However it is not directly facing Times Square so it is relatively quiet! We flew in to Newark, took the train to Penn Station, and then walked about 10 blocks to get to the hotel since we had difficulty finding a cab.. If you know New York, 10 blocks is nothing.\n\nDoormen were nice. Check-in was smooth. I used the Marriot app to check in after I landed, and the room was ready when I got there at 3:45 pm.\n\nOur room was tiny with a window (probably purposely) obstructed by difficult to move curtains revealing a view of a wall. Our bathoom was disproportionately huge and awesome. We had a nice rainshower with good pressure.  There was a  nice TV in the bathroom. The toilet had a heated seat and bedet function. My wife and I laughed when we saw the room and then said to each other \"Yep we are in New York.\" We love NYC....and I think most people come to this city to experience the city...not to spend too much time in the room. So the small room didn't bother us.\n\nWe didn't try the restaurant downstairs, the pool, or any other facilities. I did like that there was fresh coffee by the elevator every morning. The cleaning staff was excellent. I also met a butler each morning in the lobby but never found the need to use him. There was a cool little bar and restaurant downstairs as well as a larger bar and restaurant on the second floor. The menus looked great. For breakfast, there was a great French place across the street...and I also liked eating at the Flame (simple diner food) which was half a block east just across 6th ave.\n\nThe hotel also has a car that can take you within a 15-20 block radius. We used it once and the driver was nice, but the car is on a first come basis and never seemed to be around.\n\nUpon check-out they gave us chocolate which was a nice touch,\n\nOverall I liked this hotel and would stay here again. I'm not sure having status with Starwood or Marriot is important with this hotel. I used points, and I got.....a free room..not much else. Everybody was nice here, but unlike other reviews, I was not routinely addressed by name. Maybe that would have been different had I actually paid for the room.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Ours was available around 3:30.  The desk staff do their best to expedite things but don't count on an early check-in. Check your bags and head out to explore the city.  Our room was well appointed, with technology that was easy to operate.  The shower had great water pressure with a rainfall shower head. The bed was very comfortable.

The hotel offers a car service that can take you to restaurants and theaters in a 3 mile radius. The rooms are nice and have everything you need. Even items you didn't realize you needed, (like dark washcloths provided specifically to take off make-up). The bar and lobby is cozy and lovely with a 40's deco vibe. The bartender takes pride in making your drink to perfection, which was lovely to come in from a long day of sightseeing in the city and stop in the lobby bar before getting ready for a night out. We really did walk EVERYWHERE when we were there - even on drizzly days- which they provided us with an umbrella. The Chatwel knows that creating a luxury experience requires hiring professional staff that can maintain that concept throughout. Which they do.

With a minor exception or two (doormen too busy chatting each other up to operate doors), every member of the Chatwal's team that we encountered was professional and polite. Beyond service, though, there were disappointments. This is not to say that the Chatwal is a bad hotel, or even an average one. It is a luxury property outfitted with the bells and whistles that make luxury hotels great--in-room espresso machines, remote control blinds, butler service for pressing and shoe shines, and daily newspaper delivery. Even considering these perks, the Chatwal comes in, when compared to the city's other luxury stalwarts, as only better-than-average. The hotel's overall design is elegant, but certain elements are cheesy (cheap-looking stock photos of New York in guest rooms) or discordant (mid-century Noguchi coffee tables that seem otherwise inconsistent with the hotel's design vibe). More noteworthy is the fact that the hotel's \"bones\" simply aren't that great. We were upgraded to a junior suite that was plenty large but was laid out as a large rectangular box. The hallway-hotel-room effect was not made better by the fact that rooms on the 5th floor have small windows that let in relatively little light, making even the large-ish room feel dark and claustrophobic, especially during the day. For the money (and we paid for only a standard room), there are more luxurious options in the city. And (for me anyway) the other options have the added bonus of being farther away from the crush of Times Square. Having said all this, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that bathroom lovers might swoon for Chatwal. The bathroom in our suite was a spacious stunner of a jewel box, all mirrors and chrome and dominated by a huge rainfall shower.

The staff was attentive to him - which was lost on him, but appreciated by mom!  The hotel is beautiful in its art deco style and the location was great for us as we like to roam around Times Square.  \n\nWe are locals who like to have nice hotel-based stays once in a while.  We like to take advantage of in-room amenities and to play tourist in the neighborhood.  My son got a kick out of the television in the bathroom.  I was disappointed that there was no tub, but the shower was roomy with multiple showerheads.  I saw pictures of a tub on their website, so if this is important to you, I would check in advance when booking.  My son loved the modern touches - especially being able to control room features from the tablet: dimming lights, opening curtains, ordering extra pillows, etc.  He had a blast!\n\nBe warned the pool is very small.  We requested the resistance feature which makes it a lap pool - and my son loved it.  We did not go at a busy time, so we were always the only ones in there, but I could not imagine this pool during a busier time and having to share the space with others.  I think maximum capacity was 5.  \n\nEverything was wonderful, my son loved his stay, which is most important to me.  Thank you, Chatwal.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Everyone was so nice! I wasn\u2019t feeling well and as soon as I checked in, the fro t desk staff brought 2 pots of tea for my sister and I.   We loved the room and the terrace was fantastic.  Being a gold member, I would have liked an upgrade, but the room, although small, was perfect and I ended up spending lots of time on the beautiful balcony.  We had a late dinner at the Lambs club bar upstairs and everything was delicious.   Went to bed that night, and for the first time in a long time, actually slept through the night.  The bed was very comfortable and the dark shades worked like a charm.  I was visiting NYC to celebrate my sisters 50th birthday and to see my Dr at Columbia.  After a fabulous night sleep and morning coffee and paper on the terrace, I took a fantastic shower in the amazing bathroom.  Unfortunately, while in the shower, my sister walked in and said my dad fell ill.  I had to get on the first flight back to Florida, cancel the Dr and all the amazing plans we had.  The staff at the Chatwal was amazing.  They didn\u2019t charge my for the nights I was going to miss.  They went above and beyond to comfort me during the worst day of my life.  They had a car waiting for us to take us to the airport immediately. The support from the team went above and beyond what can be expected.  Not only that, one of the mangers contacted my travel agent to make sure all was okay a day later.  My sister and I made it back to Florida in time to say goodbye to my father, who passed just after we arrived to the hospital in Florida. I can\u2019t thank the staff enough for all you have done for me.  Although I didn\u2019t get to enjoy more than 15 hours at your hotel, I will definitely be back when I see my Dr.   You made me like family and for that, I am forever grateful.

We actually canceled the second night to make sure my birthday trip not to become a miserable one. \n\nThe room\n we stayed was very small. There are a king size bed and desk...and no space left. They \"upgraded\" the room to the one with terrace but all you see is next building wall and all you hear is mechanical noise from air conditioners. Unless you are a smoker, I don't think you need this terrace. I just did not like the tired carpet with black stains...that itself made me feel not luxurious any more. We didn't enjoy staying in this room at all. It was far below our expectation.\n\nThe services\nPeople working here are very polite and friendly. We never felt rude or anything at all. They actually sent a little birthday cake to our room which I really appreciated and loved it. But there is definitely lack of communication between staffs. I had to call twice all the time to get something I need (bags brought to the room after checked in, request for in-room water bottles (there were no water provided in the room), etc.). It seems they just simply forgot...because after a second call, they brought whatever I requested immediately. To cancel the second night, the SPG rep told us that the hotel manager requested us to give him some feedback when we check out. We agreed so we mentioned it during the checkout procedure but the lay at the front desk looked no idea what we were talking about so we just left rather than tting bothered to explain further... (I believe that was your idea, manager ?)\n\nOh it seems you can stay with pet at this hotel.

We payed for our room with SPG points (a high number in order to get the suite).  This room featured two full bathrooms, a bedroom (with desk\/chair\/armchair) and a sitting room (with desk\/chair\/sofa\/coffee table).  There is a Murphy bed in the wall which I assume can be opened if you need to stay in the room with children.  This could be a nice option because there are two full bathrooms.   The Retro style decor was fitting for a dark room with very little natural light (views of close-by brick buildings and no sunshine ever directly enters the rooms so after 10 days we were really missing the light.)  \n\nThe bed was comfortable and we were glad there were 2 bathrooms because we used them as him\/hers because the countertops were way too small to share one bathroom comfortably.  Excellent rainshowers with good water pressure, toilets are Totto with integrated bidets. Housekeeping was kind and friendly but the finishings were starting to feel tired and heavily used (carpet was quite worn).   Room was right off of the elevator and we had a neighbor a few rooms down the hall with a yapping dog for a couple of nights.  \n\nAlthough the room was sufficiently spacious, there was not actually a real closet - the only real closet was full of the mini-bar\/safe\/extra bed linens\/coffee maker and they had installed a separate wardrobe, which was fairly small and low-hanging.  This won't be a big deal if you're only staying 2 days but for a 10 day stay or if you're bringing kids we were short on hanging space (though there was plenty of dresser space - one in each room so my husband and I each had our own.)  \n\nThere were ipads and other techie things in the room that didn't really do much - or at least nothing useful - we still had to go around the room shutting off lamps and lights one by one each night.  Additionally, our cable TV didn't work for much of the stay - they finally fixed it the last couple of days but without apology (On Demand movies are $20).  Also, the free wifi is nice, but it bumps you off constantly without telling you and my husband and I both burned through our data plans because we didn't realize that their wifi system had kicked us out - I highly recommend checking you're on each time before you start navigating.\n\nUpside to this hotel is that you can catch just about any subway train to anywhere in Manhattan within a few blocks (I'm not a big Times Square person, but certainly, it's a convenient location for seeing shows or catching subway trains and it's just far enough off the main drag of Times Square such that it's not noisy.) \n\nThe hotel restaurant is fantastic - we ate there repeatedly at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The lunchtime pastrami sandwich in particular is truly special and they have fantastic cocktails.  I can see this being a convenient spot for a business lunch.  And as far as Manhattan hotel restaurant prices go, it wasn't a rip-off - the restaurant was actually full for most meals, likely because the food is truly great.  Service a bit slow, so don't expect to have a quick bite - but if you have the time, it's a nice benefit.\n\nThe free use of the red Chatwal Mercedes with driver was really nice - if he's around he'll take you anywhere within a 20 blocks radius (give or take).  Lobby staff was also friendly and helpful (they capably helped me with a few package related issues).  Late at night there's no doorman and I struggled to open the heavy lobby door myself with my heavy suitcases in tow and for anyone with mobility issues you should know that there are about 8 unavoidable steps up\/down to get in\/out of the building.  During the day, doormen were helpful and friendly.\n\nIn the last 9 months alone, we've stayed in 3 different 5 star hotels in Manhattan in the  (and two non-five star properties) and this one is on par with the other two five star hotels -each having their pros\/cons.  This one isn't my favorite and I'm not sure I would make an effort to return (would prefer to keep trying different places) but we had an overall very positive experience and as fas as NY goes, this is a safe bet.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I just wrote it off as NY is too Big, to Bustling... to know you... not at The Chatwal. We felt like family and like we were home right from the start and remained feeling \nlike that as we hugged our Doorman goodbye and got in our Car Service to leave. \nThis is not an overwhelming property, but rather a chic, eclectic boutique that captures Art Deco days from the past. Indeed you think the elevator will open and Clark Gable or Humphrey Bogart will emerge. \nIt\u2019s a hip place and makes you feel hip just being there. \nWe reserved The Producer suite with an adjoining Deluxe room and it was really special. While not cheap by any means, it was fair compared to what you become accustomed to paying in NY. \nThis Suite is beautifully appointed and has two Terraces,  one on the main floor and one up a Spiral Staircase that leads to the roof and has terrific outdoor furnishings. Breakfast or an evening nightcap surrounded by New York and the glow of Broadway is truly unique to this property and this room. \n\nBut, our adjoining was a Deluxe King room, and it was wonderful if you are just taking a normal space. It was larger by NY standards and the rooms are terrifically decorated, with rain show\n\nEven though you are only steps away from Times Sq, the hotel is a quiet escape from the bustle and is totally soundproof to the bustle all around you. \n\nEveryone is terrific and obviously well trained at the Chatwal, but the bell staff and the front desk team truly stand out as stellar. Petro, one of the desk managers took the time to personally walk us up to our room to start our visit and the terrific service from the entire team continued from there. Most of the staff greeted us by name when we passed them. \n\nAlso of note are some special touches that we really enjoyed. \n- a Red (hotel theme color) Mercedes availible on request as a house car\n- Chocolate and champagne upon arrival\n- a black \u201cMake-up removal cloth\u201d which my wife just thought was wonderful\n- beautiful robes\n- oversized towels\n- fresh flowers in the room\n- daily replentished bottled water and Crystal \u201cChatwal\u201d embossed drinking glasses\n\nand I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve forgotten some things that made us smile during the stay. I\u2019ve certainly enjoyed most of these at some great properties, but The Chatwal forgot nothing. \n\nThe Chatwal is our families new home in New York.

The first visit was flawless, raved about it to all our friends..was even planning a group trip here in October. I have to say we have had nothing but problems since we arrived. It is currently 9:49pm and after a long day of walking and sightseeing we are sitting in our room #505 waiting for our room to be serviced. Our breakfast dishes still sitting in the middle of the room. Not happy. \nMy daughter and I came into the city for a little getaway. We are SPG members and my husband booked a room for us here as a special treat. We arrived at the hotel to be told we were awarded the smallest bed in the smallest room they had, despite our SPG status. Too late to change hotels and after much fuss we were given a nice suite for one night as long as we were out the next morning but no room available til 4pm. Not exactly accomodating. At that time my daughter begged to stay another night and as I figured there would be no further issues we decided to stay. In the middle of a museum trip the manager from the hotel called to offer me a king bed room for the next 2 nights. I was good with that. We arrived back at the hotel to find luggage brought to room and had a nice night. \nWell..the following day my husband was called by the front desk (while we were in the middle of lunch) wondering why we had not checked out?? Say what?? What a disorganized mess. So I called the front desk AGAIN and was told they had no idea I was staying another night. Like seriously. The staff is courteous but definitely feel there is a great lack of communication here and huge problem with organization. These issues have really made this trip very stressful and we will NOT be returning to the Chatwal.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I need eight hours of uninterrupted sleep in order to effectively do my job. During my two-night stay, I was rudely awoken both nights by different disturbances. On the first night, the electric window shades went haywire in the middle of the night \u2014 opening and closing like they were possessed by demonic forces. And speaking of demons, the party people next door woke me up the second night smoking and drinking on their terrace until 5 am. I literally slept for a mere a four hours that night. The cigarette smoke was spewing in my window and the noise was unbearable. I asked them to quiet down but they did not comply. \n\nThe think the worst part of this experience was management\u2019s lack of response. The manager offered me 5,000 Starwood points to compensate me for a miserable experience. This never happened. No points.

During those trips, we like to stay in the theater district (places like the Algonquin, the Millennium, and the Premier \u2013 all on 44th street). These places are without frills, but offer quiet, safe sleeping within walking distance of all theaters. On our recent trip, we decided to splurge for an upscale hotel in the same neighborhood for 4 weekday nights, taking advantage of a special which included a daily full American breakfast, and was priced as 4 nights for the price of 3 (total price was 2-3 times what the other hotels would charge for room only).\n\nThis was our first stay at the Chatwal, which is a small, boutique hotel on 44th street. Outstanding features included a wonderful staff, a one-time gift of nuts and chocolates, daily gifts of bottled water, a large, comfortable, quiet, room with good seating, a comfortable king bed, computerized lighting, and good temperature regulation.  The bathroom was very unique.  We had a late model Toto toilet (heated seats, wash and dry \u201cdown there\u201d, and reliable flush), a spacious rain-like shower which included hand held spray and plenty of very nice towels. The only problem was the sink. It was beautiful and modern, but not very functional. The sink opening itself was small, as much of the sink area was composed of a slanting metal cover which did not reach the water. You could not rinse anything out in a sink of this design. Even worse, there was insufficient counter space for two people with the usual things the airlines force us to put in plastic bags. While the bedroom had plenty of electrical outlets, the bathroom only had one electrical outlet \u2013 a problem for recharging toothbrushes and shavers. Breakfast, in the Lambs Club restaurant was fantastic.\n\nSo was it worth it? Yes. I really enjoyed my stay. I will likely return.

It looks very shabby with plastic entrance (also the doorman is  often too late to open the door when you arrive)\nWe arrived at Sunday around 6pm and were longing for a drink at the great bar on the 1st Floor. However despite some other guests, the bar on the 1st Floor was closed (never saw this before in similar luxury hotel; ok\u00e9 you can expect this in a 2 or 3 star hotel but not in this hotel)\nNormally when you order your cocktail or beer, you get some peanuts or olives to accompany but not here, here you have to order them apart. Not very service-minded as the drinks are quite expensive. \nThe rooms may be nice but if you book a room for 2 persons with a queensize bed, you will regret this, as the room is so small you fall over your suitcase; beside the fact that you do not have enough space to hang your clothes in the closet.\nAlso the carpet looked filthy and run down. The bathroom however looked great and brand new.\nThe swimmingpool was so small, you d better say a plunge pool or jacuzzi.\nOne positive remark is the very friendly ladies of the reception.\nIt is a pity, we expected so much of this luxury hotel, unfortunately we will not return. \n","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It\u2019s the bathroom that proved rather perplexing.  We\u2019re used to Japanese lavatories having spent time travelling in Japan, but this one (and God knows why it was thought a good idea to adopt them in this hotel) seemed to have puzzled the plumbers who did the installation.  The seat was infernally hot, the jets of water needle sharp and when the blower sprang into action it was with alarming ferocity.  To cap all this off, the hand basins were of a design that made absolutely no sense at all.  Some sort of stainless steel shallow rectangular box, the first half of which was a slightly tilted shelf which the water did not reach and the back part so lacking in depth that it was impossible to really wash.  Most peculiar.  Style over substance in every way.\n\nWe ate twice in the dining room and the food was delicious.  Great menu.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel very welcome. All the staff were friendly and approachable. The concierge recommended a lovely Italian Restaurant and even booked the table for us.We were offered hot apple juice on our way to the room by the doorman which was very welcome as it was a cold day. (In the morning there would be tea and coffee, see further down)\nWe booked a junior suit which was on the 3rd floor and looked out over the front of the hotel and opposite the Hudson Theatre. Fear not, it was not noisy in anyway. The room was very spacious and well equipped. Lots of storage and drawers so everything could be hung up or put away. The usual mini bar -well stocked plus an array of nibbles and snacks. Complimentary coffee from a snazzy little machine was included but no tea. (Remedied this by freeing a couple of tea bags from reception and using the hot water from the coffee machine.)The bed was large and comfortable with lovely cotton sheets. I have left the bathroom until last - this was the size of bedroom in some NY hotels. All glass and crome. Amusingly there was a TV screen in the mirror and of course a toilet that washed and blow dried your nether regions. What a lark! Finally the shower big enough for a whole family at once! Nice products Asprey of London. Worth mentioning too was the fact that the rooms were kept spotlessly clean. \nOur board basis included the American breakfast and this was served in the lovely Lambs restaurant. It was not explained what this actually entitled us to so we found on some days we had to pay a supplement which obviously then meant adding a service charge. We then found out that service charge was included so we ended up paying this twice. Also where we did have to pay extra instead of just being charged the extra where I presume we had chosen outside of our plan we were charged for the whole item. For example we were entitled to a juice. So we chose beet. It transpires that beet is not included. On the menu orange is $12 (which we were allowed to have) and beet is $15. So instead of being asked to pay difference we were charged full price. A very small point but nevertheless irksome. Incidentally the oatmeal and seasonal berries are a must! I miss it already.\n\n","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We mainly chose this hotel for being part of the SPG group and for the understated luxury. Upon arrival I was pleasantly surprised by the location being so close to Times Square and the Theatre District. It's not far from the subway either.\n\nCheck-in and lobby services were excellent with the front desk staff being very friendly and recognizing our SPG Platinum status. The doormen and bell staff were also very proactive though we did not require help with our bags. In that respect, our immediate first impression was a good one, espcially in the art-deco lobby, which while small, is very tasteful. On top of it all, near the elevators, there was always hot coffee, tea and and hot apple cider after coming in from the cold. A very nice touch. \n\nThe room itself was not overly large but was comfortable with hues of black and red. \nThankfully in the room, there are many plugs, outlets and other, enough to charge all your devices, phones, portable wear... I was very pleased with how well our room was soundproofed as I barely heard any noise despite being on the street side.\n \nThe bathroom was a highlight being large for the size of the overall room and with japanese bidet. The large mirrors and black marble finishing give it a nice touch.\n\nWe never ran into the maid service once, with them magically sprucing up our room, everytime we were out. The staff was also very helpful in with a missing clothing item that got lost in one of the clean-ups. \n\nWhile this is not a review on the Lamb's Club, the hotel restaurant, we did eat there a few times for dinner, x-mas brunch and breakfasts. I won't go into detail here, but the food was quite good, though the service was a little cold, albeit professional and perfunctory.\n\nA small caveat that is not really a fault of the hotel.  We found catching a cab or Uber in front of the hotel could be difficult due to it being on a one way street.  Cabs\/Ubers need to go through the pedestrian traffic of nearby Times Square before reaching the hotel, so plan accordingly.\n\nOverall I was really impressed with the Chatwal. The location is excellent being close to the popular tourist areas by foot. The hotel service was top-notch. It's definitely a more upscale hotel, so the price matches but it was well worth it.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is a block or two off of Times Square (which I typically avoid as my NYC stays are for business and I'm not typically interested in fighting the tourists in Times Square).  Having said that, because it is slightly off the main area you really can avoid the crowds if you want to - but, equally, if you are here for vacation you are right in the thick of it in a few minutes time.  The hotel itself is stunning and unique - has a bit of a very high end 1920's feel to it.  The rooms are upscale and modern.  There are two bars, both fairly low key. One is in the lobby itself but I recommend heading up one flight to the more private setting.   Food and beverages are top notch.  Service is exceptional.

We didn't mind. It's the small touches that make a difference. The theme is contemporary art deco, with touches of chrome and leather. Leather straps serve as doorknobs and drawer pulls. Shower amenities are displayed in a leather suitcase. And then there are the gadgets. A bedside iPad controls the lighting, temperature and music in the room. And the toilet is sure to be a big hit with Japanese tourists - it's got several features including a heated seat, several rinse cycles and a dryer.

I wouldn't have known this hotel if it was not on the Amex fine hotels list. I have yet to experience a bad surprise whenever we go with the Amex fine hotel selection (as much as it sounds like a marketing for Amex, it is true) so I decided to give it a try and I did not regret it one bit:\n\n1. The room was very spacious given its central location in New York City. We had an upgrade by Amex so our room came with a sitting and study area.\n\n2. The bathroom was incredible: spacious and tastefully designed. It uses one of those smart Japanese toilets.\n\n3. Service was top-notch. Staff were polite and professional. We were particularly impressed with the doorman who always greeted us with a smile and provided any help we needed (many of the luxury hotels have doormen that just stood for the purpose of the hotel image). The concierge was very efficient in recommending and booking us a decent steakhouse within a short notice.\n\n4. Breakfast was amazing. I have noticed the staff would always seat their guests in different zones to allow privacy. Of course in a busy morning it might get filled up eventually, but from my observation every morning: they do their best in optimising the privacy. I am impressed with this given it is only a small hotel and arranging seating this way will mean they need to have more waiters\/waitress covering different zones (which may be deemed not economically optimised by some hotels). Another great example of its attention to details.\n\n5. The hotel logo was skillfully embedded in the design. For examples, the complimentary bottles of water are branded with their own logo. A very small thing but by the end of my 3-night stay, I have grown to really like its hotel logo and start linking it to fine hotels.\n\nThank you for a pleasant stay.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

La visita a este edificio desde el OBSERVATORY, es inolvidable, no solo por el entorno que conmemora la ca\u00edda de las torres en el atentado de 2001, si no por su fabulosa visita a lo alto de la torre (protegida con cristales), donde podr\u00e1s ver toda la ciudad. Recomendable realizar la visita antes de la puesta del sol, para que la luz sea m\u00e1gica. Tienes posibilidad de adquirir diferentes tipos de pase VIP, Standard Pass, pase libre durante la semana, etc.. al final todos te dan acceso a las plantas 101, 102 y 103, por lo que el Standar Pass es el mas ventajoso\n\n \n\nRockefeller Center en el Midtown entre la 5th y la 6th avenida\n\nLa visita a lo alto de la torre Rockefeller, ser\u00e1 otra gran elecci\u00f3n para ver desde lo alto el esplendor de Manhattan. Te ofrecen un ticket para visitar el TopoftheRock en lo mas alto del Edificio Rockefeller, y adicionalmente dedicar una ma\u00f1ana para visitar el MOMA museum y sus fabulosas tiendas de recuerdos, donde encontrar\u00e1s cosas muy muy originales y curiosas\n\nDesde aqu\u00ed podr\u00e1s aprovechar para pasar por la Radio City Music Hall, donde seg\u00fan el calendario programado, algunos actores empiezan a dar sus primeros pasos, participando en audiciones en busca de futuros contratos\n\nOtra opci\u00f3n es subir a lo alto del  Empire State Building. Evidentemente, otra gran visita, pero teniendo en cuenta que lo mas emblem\u00e1tico de las fotos que te lleves de NY, es que salga siempre este edificio, ser\u00e1 bueno tengas en cuenta que tal vez no merezca la pena gastar tu dinero en subir y visitarlo.\n\nEn su lugar y para que puedas hacer unas muy buenas fotos del Empire, te recomiendo subir a la terraza Lunch bar de la 230 5th Avenue, es gratuito, con poco turismo y es un buen lugar para tomarte una copa al aire libre mientras disfrutas del entorno gigantesco de Manhattan\n\n","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

A little small, extremely dark walls that look like construction paper. The bed was slightly lower than most hotels, it was a platform bed and also a little firm. There was a good size flat screen as well as a well stocked mini bar. The bathroom looked very inviting with its shiny floors, but they were extremely slippery. There was a heated toilet seat which I loved! The shower had a rain shower head with good water pressure and a hand held that wasn't on a bar to use as an alternative. Thankfully the shower was big enough to get yourself out of the stream of water to lather yourself. I am not a big fan of this type of shower. I was very pleased with the towels and the fact that they were big and thicker than most hotels I've been in lately. \nThe hotel is within walking distance to Times Square and Broadway shows, but because of that proximity getting transportation in and out of the hotel was a nightmare.

Everyone, from doorman to maid to manager to front desk is professional and seems genuinely happy. The rooms are stunning - not easy to create a new and higher-quality feel and yet they have. The custom designed furniture and fittings are very creative and create the feel of a modern classic. Technology is everywhere, but discreetly hidden. The TV is framed so if it's off, you don't notice it. Power and multiple USB ports are tucked on the back of the nightstand - unobtrusive and extremely useful. The room is controlled using an iPad mounted on the nightstand - could have been annoying but it's been made simple and pleasant to use, including butler service, menus, lighting, ac, alarm, etc. Beautiful bathrooms with huge rainfall showers and top-tier amenities and who doesn't love a heated Japanese toilet if they're being honest? Food seems limited, then you taste it and realize it's fantastic. On my first stay, there was a mess-up with the booking service, not their fault. Yet they took responsibility for it and handled it superbly. I was immediately happier than if all had gone right in the first place. They universally requested that I return so they could show me how great the experience really is. For me they already had. I did return and they went way beyond anything required to make my stay exceptional. I was deeply impressed. This simply does not happen anymore, I stay in 20-30 properties each year. In reality, some 5 star hotels should really be high 3's, some if not most are really 4's and some are genuine 5's. The Chatwal is a smaller property off Times Square that I somehow hadn't heard of, all usually disqualifying characteristics for me, and it turns out to be the very definition of what a 5 start hotel really is. In the end, it comes down to service and for me the underlying feeling of whether employees are happy and proud or simply trying hard to present the right image. The Chatwal is a happy place. Goodbye to some very nice Manhattan 5-star hotels - sorry, you don't come close.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was a five minute walk to the theater, and a ten minute walk to the subway to take a twenty minute ride to the concert at Barclays Center.  But even better than it's perfect location was the hotel itself.  We have never had a better nights sleep in NYC.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We highly recommend this hotel, and will stay here again on our next trip to NYC.  The only hiccup during our stay was that our in-room brochure stated that the bar was open until 2am on Friday and Saturday, and that a bar food menu was available.  We arrived around 11:30 on Saturday after our concert and ordered drinks, and told our server we might want to order something to eat a little later.  A little past midnight, we informed our server that we wanted to order something to eat, and were told that the kitchen closed at 11:00, and that it was last call at the bar, even though we had just witnessed a nearby table being delivered a food order.

Plus 100 for a rollaway(wait what!?) ... the king room was still small. \n It's disappointing as can be when you feel conned. How difficult is it to give a family two beds? It's sad that as often as we travel, we will never return to this hotel.\n The positives were the attentive bell staff and the location to time square. The area was dirty outside and not an ideal spot. \n I know it's New York but the valet is 60 plus a night. It's better to uber or taxi it but we had family obligations in New Canaan.\n  Safe yourself and stay somewhere else. Unless of course you want to spend the same amount of money as you would at Trump towers for a fraction of the experience. You can't compare in any way! We spent nearly 400$ for a closet size room.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"NONE"}

My daughter and son-in-law have been there five times previously and we were there as she was running the half marathon today.  Pluses- first and most important of all  is the staff.  Cannot possibly say enough.  Everyone we interacted with was superb but the doormen and the Bellmen deserve special mention.  Ali, who escorted us to our room, made it clear that  he was there to help in any way.  Everywhere you went you got smiles.\n\nThe room itself was lovely with only one shortcoming.  We had a Junior Suite that I received as a Starwood Platinum - more on that later.  It was roomy and the bathroom was incredible.  Two downsides - we were on the street side on the 6th floor and it was still rather noisy - and the window itself was very cold.  My daughter said they often ask to be placed on the other side of the hotel and it is much quieter.  Second is the lighting - like many other hotels lately, I'm glad I have an iPad to read from because it would be difficult finding enough light anywhere to make reading easy - especially for a 69 year old!\n\nAll in all a lovely hotel with the feel of a boutique.  We usually stay further away from the action, mostly the St Regis.  There are certainly pluses and minuses for each location.\n\nThe only two issues I had were at check-in.  I knew that the Starwood website had every type of room listed as still available for sale.  As a Platinum (for 10 + years), I am entitled to a suite yet it was not offered.  Some hotels honor the intent of the program and some don't and make you ask or push.  Sure enough, she spoke to the manager who approved it but after all these years, there is simply no excuse for making someone go through hoops to get what they are entitled to. Worse, I was told the Junior Suite was not ready yet but if I wanted, I could occupy a larger suite immediately for a surcharge.  When I asked what it would be, she told me $675!  No thanks. Again, a bad taste.\n\nThe other issue was when my daughter and son-in-law checked in.  If I was the owner of the hotel and I had a guest returning for the sixth time, I would be in shock if the front desk agent asked him if this was their first visit to the Chatwal?!  That is not how you make people feel valued.\n\nAll that aside, very good chance we'll be back as the hotel was lovely and the staff was simply incredible.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The pictures of the rooms and the hotel on line do not do the accomodations justice.  This hotel is in a great location for the theatre district, it is beautifully decorated in red and white.  In our room the color scheme was chocolate brown and chrome ...and it had all the modern high tech amenities one needs.   The food served in the dining hall on the main floor off to the left was superb.  We had butler service and everyone on the staff was sincerely courteous, polite and helpful at all times.  The bathrooms are top of the line with combo heated bidet\/ toilet. Shower with 3 types of functions that can be run at the same time.  \n\nThe second day we took a cab to battery park to see Ellis island. The doorman took care of that for  us and off we went.  If you are looking for  a comfortable stay in NYC to  do clubs and theatre, this is the. Place to be.  I have stayed in other luxury hotels in New York but I must say I like the homey European feel of the chatwal very much and would stay there again.  \n\nIf you choose the  Chatwall, I hope you enjoy your stay as much as my sister and I did!","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Chatwal was first class from the minute we got there, starting with the doorman and the attentive bellhop to the front desk workers.  The entire staff was so professional.  We arrived early, but only had to wait a short while for our room to be made ready.  We were given an upgrade to a Deluxe room (seemed more like a suite) which was awesome, giving us some extra space to relax in during our stay.  An especially nice touch for my daughter's birthday celebration was a bottle of Cabernet and some chocolates left in our room--thank you so much Brandon!  The room accommodations were excellent.  The bed was so very comfortable, providing a great night's sleep, and I certainly don't say that about all hotel beds.  There was a large walk in closet, as well as a sitting area with couch, and chair.  The bathroom had a nice shower with rainhead, as well as a heated seat bidet toilet.  Also a tv in the mirrored wall.  Housekeeping did an excellent job with the rooms--one of the cleanest I've seen, and that includes places like the Four Seasons.    \nMy only real complaint about the room would be that there was not an in room coffee maker.  There was coffee available in the lobby.  \nAs for other hotel amenities, there was a Red Door Spa and workout facilities in the basement which we did not have time to check into.  We did have breakfast in The Lambs Club, the hotel restaurant which is itself famous.  There is also a nice mezzanine level bar, as well as a lower key lobby bar.  As we were seeing two shows while there, the location of the Chatwal was perfect, just off of Sixth Avenue on 44th.  We were on the 8th floor, but street noise was not a problem at all.\nWas very happy with our stay, and would definitely recommend it to friends, as well as stay there again.  Thank you Chatwal staff for everything!","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Everybody was extremely nice and accommodating.  We were able to get early check-in and late check-out.  They also gifted a bottle of champagne.  Our room was very nice as you would hopefully expect for $800.00\/night. One small complaint:  for the price, the hotel should have coffee available later than 10am., especially on the weekend.  They also should have some complimentary snacks\/hors d'oeuvres available throughout the day.  As much as I enjoyed the stay, there any a dozen other hotels within two blocks that offer the same accommodations with concierge service (day and evening coffee, snacks and more) for less than 1\/2 the price.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

After the Gramercy Park Hotel it is one of my favorite places to stay in Manhattan. In terms of other Starwood properties nearby it is much better than anything other than the St Regis or the GPH as mentioned. For example it is much better than the W Times Square which is nice and the Westin. \n\nHere are some quick pros of this great place:\n\n- It is a smaller property in term of number of rooms and the staff guest ratio is good. \n\n- The service is very good with friendly, accommodating and efficient people.  \n\n- They have an overnight dry cleaning and pressing service which is very good -- arrived at 9 pm and had dry cleaned clothes returned before 8 am the next morning. \n\n- Good and prompt room service. \n\n- Really nice rainfall shower with high water pressure. \n\n- The rooms are very modern, comfortable and stylish. It is hard to describe the decor (you can see the pictures) but it has a bit of a yacht type of fee. They have well thought out centralized controls for the lighting, etc. \n\n- The rooms are very quiet. I have stayed on the lower floors and have minimal noise even when closer to the ground floor (the 10th is the top level). How they manage to sound proof it as well as they did is kind of amazing. \n\n- Great coffee set out in the morning. \n\n- A really nice Art Deco interior in the lobby and bar\/restaurant and Lambs Club history. \n\nA few exceedingly minor drawbacks:\n\n- The room designer over did things a bit with mirrored surfaces.  Personal opinion and not a big deal just not a fan of that aspect of this otherwise really beautifully designed notes. \n\n- The blackout curtains in the room are great but room's electronic controls are really bright and next to the bed to the point where you want to put something over them. \n\n- If you are going to a show or the like the location is terrific. If you're in town on business and heading over to midtown or otherwise the Times Square traffic and location is not convenient and adds travel time to your day. \n\nThat is about it - love staying at this place.

I am a lifetime Starwood Platinum and on past stays I almost always get room upgrades. I like the staff and always have good interactions. Brandon and his Butler team always go the extra mile so do the other staff. \nI want to be clear that the reason for this poor review has nothing to do with the staff, they are excellent and were on this visit as well. \nMy critique is directed at management. \nWhen I arrived it was late after a very long day and I was tired. At checkin I had a cordial exchange with the night manager, he mentioned something about an upgrade and I didn't think it was anything other than the usual upgrade I get when available so didn't think twice. Then he asked me to sign a piece of paper with 300 dollars written on it. That  should have been a red flag as that has never happened before so shame on me but when you trust people, your guard is down. I thought he was saying I was getting a rate of 300 so just signed it without reading it. I will never make that mistake again. I was shocked when I received my bill that it was a 300  per night add on to my rate of 475 for an upgrade to a terrace room. I was shocked first because I have stayed in the same room and other terrace rooms many times always as a complimentary upgrade,  second because after I contacted the hotel and explained that I had misunderstood since I always get upgrades , they still insisted on charging it noting I had signed the piece of paper.  For such a \"luxury\" hotel dealing with a very good customer, I was really disappointed. If 1200 is worth losing a good customer, maybe it isn't so luxury after all. I think the staff are great but this one shows very poor judgment on the part of management especially for a Starwood Lifetime Platinum. The best companies shine when things go wrong, that is when brand loyalty is really built. The Chatwal has now lost my loyalty and my trust.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The soft product - in terms of the front desk, the doormen and general ambience - is extremely good and very much in keeping with a 5 star experience. The location is great, despite being a block from Times Square (or maybe that's a good thing of course!). The hotel is quiet and I did feel as if I'd stepped outside of the street hubbub into a relaxed place. \n\nI put a lot of emphasis on first impressions and my check-in experience was great. As a Starwood gold member, I usually get upgraded and I've come to rely on that, which is probably not the best idea and I was tripped up for the first time at The Chatwal. My stay coincided with the UN General Assembly and I was told they were full so there could be no upgrade but they would keep it in mind if availability changed (it did not). I wasn't so bothered, after all this is a 5 star hotel and so I expected the room to be just fine in any case. \n\nI was wrong. Opening the door to Room 403 was very disappointing. The room is very, very small and dark. I assumed the curtains had been drawn but unfortunately the room faces a brick wall and is incredibly dark as a result. The room contains a queen bed with approximately 2\/3 of meter walk space around it. There is a small dining chair jammed in the only available corner and small desk and drawers taking up the rest of the space. No easy chair, no table, no space. \n\nI ordered room service and the gentlemen was at a loss where to position his wheeled dining table. There simply was no space for it. His best suggestion was for me to perch on the end of the bed and he would bring the table up to me. In the end, he took everything off and put it on the desk. He was outstandingly helpful in a tricky situation. The food was delicious, by the way.\n\nThe fittings - the desk, cupboard, minibar etc - are of exceptionally high quality. Leather-surfaces, suede-lined walls. Truly beautiful. A very bizarre juxtapose with the amount of space on offer. The bathroom on the other hand is terrific! Huge. Fantastic shower and some cool technology in there. Great amenities including Asprey's of London toiletries and a leather-bound amenity box.\n\nWithin a few minutes of my arrival into the room - peak disappointment phase, of course - the butler arrived with a charming handwritten welcome note, some bottled water and some delicious chocolates. It was another example of a bizarre juxtapose. I had no where to sit and relax in this dark little cupboard of a room, yet here was this delightful 5 star customer service alongside. It confused me. Another thing that confused me was a total lack of tea\/coffee making equipment in the room. I rang down to ask where the kettle lived and was told to either order tea from room service ($9 + tax + tray charge etc) or to come down to the lobby in the morning for a coffee urn. No, in a hotel of any class I expect to be able to make a cup of tea in the privacy of my own room.\n\nAnother issue was the position of the room right next to the elevator. There was a fair amount of noise from other guests and the ice machine. Usually with Starwood Gold membership, being near the ice machine and elevator on a low floor doesn't really happen, but at the Chatwal I was definitely way down the pecking order.\n\nWith hindsight, I should have booked a king rather than a queen. 5 star hotels are all about the experience and mine was severely dented the first time I turned the door handle of my room.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"SOLO"}
{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":1641016,"title":"Art Deco and loving it.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-09-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Staying at the Chatwal is an experience in itself--for better.\n\nYou'll be guided through heavy gated doors into a quiet art-deco style lobby. It's not the most impressive part of the hotel but still nice and cozy, especially the warmth from the colors and atmosphere against the blustery winter that New York hosts every year.\n\nYour trip to the elevators is just the beginning of your journey from the bustle of the city streets. It's a short walk from the lobby but with the sitting area and fireplace, you'll start to feel like you're really going home.\n\nThere aren't many rooms per floor so you're assured of a quiet stay. \n\nThe rooms themselves are appointed stylishly with something similar to Chanel's caviar leather--but this is plum (hoping that Maestro Lagerfeld will bless us with a caviar leather plum Chanel flap bag one day). The bathrooms are spacious--a must in my book. Give me a small room with a large bathroom and I'll be happier than if it were vice-versa. The bath towels are like beach towels, just how I like them. And very absorbent, not like the low-cotton count ones that most hotels have. \n\nSome rooms do come with terraces. Don't get your hopes up, they're terraces in Manhattan so you're really looking into someone's window across the way. But it actually does add quite a lot to your feeling of space. A nice cup of coffee with the paper out there in the morning is really pleasant--more so than I would've expected.\n\nThe beds. Wow. As a business traveler, I cover at least 50 hotels a year at a minimum. Many of them are the same favorites year after year. This hotel is one of them for many reasons including having fantastically comfortable beds. The sheets are so soft you would swear you were sleeping on your own at home. The pillows (ask for extras) are fluffy and large--perfect for feeling like you're cocooned for the night. \n\nTurn-down service is lovely, too. Who wouldn't want that. And they are kind enough to tuck in some extra bottles of water and a sweet treat for you. \n\nThe room is well accoutered with magazines like the latest editions of Vogue, GC, Architectural Digest, Virtuoso. Like books? They've stocked some in your room as well--some of the classics.\n\nDon't forget the butler service and the shoe polishing. Not something to overlook but easily done. Need your clothes pressed after some struggles with packing? Call your butler. Need to literally be put together and you're a bit lost on how? Call your butler.\n\nThe workout facility is not the height of ideal: two treadmills, one elliptical, one stationary bike, limited free weights, one all-purpose weight machine, and one bench--and all squeezed into the space the size of most of their guest rooms. But this is New York City! That's a lot of real estate as it is! There is a small lap pool that looks quite refreshing--haven't tried it but intend to one day when not rushing between work and play.\n\nThe spa (Red Door Spa) is pretty full service. After a reflexology session, I was ready to strap my Jimmy Choos back on and head out for the night. Lifesaver.\n\nOf course everyone talks about the location and rightfully so. It's half a block from Times Square and a block to the Harvard Club (not a member but it's still nice to be close to the Pall Mall of New York) and a couple blocks from the New York Public Library. \n\nAnd another great part of this all: Osteria al Doge is two doors down. Want pasta? Go there. Going carb free? Go there (calamari on the main menu (not the appetizer) is grilled and amazing and also the octopus). Want a place to hang out with good wine and an amazing ricotta cheesecake? Go there. Go there. Go there. Go there.\n\nBut what makes this place the jewel tucked away into such a crazy city: the people. The staff and caretakers at the Chatwal are the kind of people you want around you to help you bring yourself up to the better version of yourself. That in itself is priceless.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Despite its half-block proximity to TS the Chatwal is incredibly quiet as a result of fairly low thru traffic on W44th, solid construction and only a handful of rooms per floor (~70+ rooms total). To me it's a fantastic, high-end business hotel that also lends itself well for a family or couples getaway. \n\nStaff: From the doormen to management I've had an incredible experience with every member of the staff I've met. The doormen, bell staff and reception staff are inviting and responsive and the management I've interacted with have been helpful in addressing any issues that inevitably come up during travel. In particular I am grateful for Kyle one of the night mangers for his responsiveness and attention to detail. \n\nDining: Excellent in-room dining for breakfast (I'm sure for lunch and dinner as well though I've never sampled them) as well as restaurants and bars. The signature restaurant, The Lambs Club has solid fare with light pastas, seafood and meats. The property also has a small lobby bar (4 stools) and a large 2nd floor lounge with a large bar. I love the small plates\/snack menu and the bar staff make wonderful cocktails and offer an excellent selection of wines by the glass. \n\nRooms: The rooms are clubby and well maintained. The beds are comfortable but firm. The bathrooms are generally spacious and either equipped with a large walk-in shower or a tub\/shower combo. I find the tub\/shower combo  problematic as the tub lip is very wide making it difficult to get in and out of (very challenging for kids and I imagine a disaster for the elderly). That said, the showers and shower heads might be the attributes to the rooms. \n\nChallenges\/Opportunities: while the property, food and rooms are all first rate, the major issue I've experienced of late is with respect to quality assurance of the rooms upon new guest arrival. While the majority of my stays have been perfect\/without incident I have had a few recent challenges related to my rooms smelling of cigarettes. I primarily blame the prior, idiotic guests who choose to smoke despite a clear hotel ban and clear penalties for violating policy. I can only hope the hotel enforces the $250 cleaning charge and ultimately raises this fine. I'll admit to being a bit sensitive to the smell of smoke and while I do blame the prior tenants it is ultimately hotel management\/room QA that must make the call on the acceptability of offering a guest a \"smelly\" room. I've had an issue in each of the past 2 weeks related to my room smelling like cigarettes and while in both cases I was immediately moved it is always a bit of aggravation to have to move rooms after checking in. For my part, this bit of room QA is the only factor preventing The Chatwal from being a 5 star hotel in my book. ","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Bed and linens very comfortable, bathroom had plenty of mirrors and light.\n\nOut of all the hotels in the madness that is time sq. The Chatwal rises to the top.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}
{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":1641016,"title":"Beautiful, Classy and Extremely Professional Hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-08-16","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"My daughter, my mother and I decided to take a last minute quick trip to the city since my daughter (5 and 1\/2 yo) want to get away from the plain vanilla burbs of Pennsylvania.  I looked up my SPG account to see if I had enough points for an one night stay.  I have always wanted to stay at the Chatwal.  Finally, I had a reason to visit.  Fortunately, I had enough points for a night.  (30k points for the Chatwal vs 25k points for the Sheraton.  I picked the Chatwal).  What a pleasant surprise!  I cannot think of anything that did not meet expectation.  First, when we first got there, the check-in lady (I think her name is Lana) saw that we have 3 people from 3 different generations, she suggested that the room that I book may be too small.  And she offered an upgrade (for $150).  I hesitated but she said the room will be ready within an hour (btw, we arrived at around 11a).  So I took it.  While we waited, we walked around the hotel a bit and decided to venture onto the street for a few minutes.  I got a call from Lana within an hour.  We went back and the concierge was there ready to take us up to the room.  We were on the 6th floor Room 608.  Even though we are at the heart of Time Square, we could not hear a thing from the street.  \n\nWhat not to like about the room?  Nothing!!!  The room was huge in Time Squire area hotel standard.  The bed was comfy.  The concierge brought my daughter a junior welcome package (fancy chocolate, animal crackers, 3 big bottles of Voss water).  The bathroom was the fanciest I have seen.  Now i have been to many very nice hotels all over the world, this bathroom probably rank way up there.  The Toto toilet seat was great (don't really see them outside of Japan).  There was also a TV in the bathroom.  I found my daughter sitting on the toilet watching Disney Junior.  :)  The shower was your typical rainshower but it is huge!!!  The whole bathroom was decked out with black marble with silver speckles - my daughter noticed it right away.  \n\nSince the hotel was so nice, we ended up staying in.  Used the pool (small but no body there, so it was very private -  I wonder if guest really know it was there).  My daughter and I were at the pool for over an hour and half and no one ever walked in.  Now, it is small, kind of like a huge bathtub - maybe 10-15 feet long?  The water was salted.  It was actually quite relaxing.  There was a hot tub (very hot) in the corner too.  \n\nWe also ended up eating at the Lambs Club.  Pretty good though it is a bit pricey.  We sat upstairs.  Would have been nice to dine in the original downstairs dining room.  Drinks and cocktails were pretty strong.  Overall very good.\n\nThe next day we checked out.  The staff remember all of us.  They were all very nice and always have a smile on their face.  That made me want to go back for another time.  Love this hotel.  Will be back!!!","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It is on 44th Street, barely a block off the congestion and noise of Time Square, but once you are inside it is lovely and intimate, with a wonderful deco style.  There are only 76 rooms, and while it is an older hotel the remodel is top notch and luxurious. It is part of the Starwood Luxury Hotel Program. If you are attending the theater this is a great location.\n\nThis is not a budget hotel, so don't expect low prices, but it is a good value for what you receive. I booked a junior suite through Amex on their \"Fine Hotels\" program, and received the fourth night free and a spa credit. My suite was large and wonderful, with a big bathroom (they even have Toto power toilets and a television hidden behind the mirror), and it was very well-equipped. There is butler service, and a very nice small spa and gym.\n\nI have stayed at the St. Regis, The Mandarin, and most of the other uber-luxury hotels in NY, and prefer the intimacy and style of The Chatwal (as long as you are OK with they busy neighborhood - it could be off putting for some people).\n\nI will certainly stay again, and my only suggestions to the hotel:\n\nLighting is a bit difficult to understand.\n\nUpgrade the radios to include a built-in iPhone charger - it is always a nice touch.\n\nPut a Nespresso coffee maker in the room.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Rooms were a tad small for that price point compared to Langham or Pierre, but bathrooms were the real show stopper. Amazing rain shower and first japanese toilet I've seen in a New York hotel. Hotel restaurant is very nice and we loved our room service. You won't get much of a view, if at all, in this hotel. Concierge were very friendly, especially Sakura and Victoria, and were very prompt on all of our requests. One drawback which I thought was close to unacceptable for a five star hotel at this price point was the quality of the porters and doormen. There was no one outside when we entered and he was texting on his phone inside while I struggled to open the heavy door with three bags in tow. He apologized but then didn't offer to carry my bags in or take them to the room and remained at his post. The two other times I left and entered the building the porters were either too busy talking to each other or not there at all. When I left with my 3 bags again they weren't paying attention enough to help me or open the door and I did it myself again. Not a huge deal, but something you'd expect in a 3 star hotel, not a 5, only thing that soured the experience.\n","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Room 302.  We were given no upgrade options - which we would have loved to do ... but the exceptional reputation of the hotel made us accept the room we were given.\n\nI admit I was a little surprised.  The room had a queen bed and very little space.  It looked out on a brick wall with a few gloomy windows from a neighboring building.  It had a fancy toilet seat that could do all kinds of washing and drying tricks - unfortunately didn't work.

I was also surprised that there was no coffee machine or coffee making facility in the room.\n\nI understand that as a business it's simply not possible to give award the best room for free to those redeeming points ... but frankly the reason we have the points is because we travel ... and that's exactly why the points should give us a more luxurious experience - because we are more likely to come back and \/ or recommend as a luxury hotel if we have an exceptional experience.\n\nMust give a shout-out to the amazing bar tender at the upstairs bar\/lounge though.  No idea of his name - but he had amazing dreadlocks and looked a little bit like David Ortiz ... he clearly knew his stuff and it was a pleasure to watch him work.\n\nLocation to Time Square is great and the road is quiet in comparison to surrounding streets.

When we began looking for hotels, we decided early in our planning we were going to avoid the normal hotel chains.  The chains' cancellation policies were rigid and the rooms were unimpressive and expensive. \n\nWe were not naive and understood we were going to pay a pretty penny to stay in this location at the time of year we chose to visit. However, I can honestly say we did not mind paying for this top-notch accommodation.  They offered a super package which included a well-appointed room and breakfast every morning.  When we mentioned our special occasion we received a room upgrade which included a sitting room, balcony and a butler.  In researching this hotel, I had noticed some of the other travelers had been upgraded and didn't expect we would benefit from the hotel's  generosity at one of their busiest times of the year. \n\nBeyond the hotel's beautiful accommodations, the location could not have been better. We were in the heart of Manhattan.  Shopping, Central Park, Rockefeller Center and Broadway were just minutes away. We walked to all of these places, in December, without discomfort.  On the night of the Ball Drop, we were given instructions about navigating the area during the New Year's festivities.  We went to our party (see my Applebee's review) and made it back to the hotel without any trouble whatsoever.  As we shuffled through the streets back to the hotel, the confetti was still falling on Broadway. We grabbed some out of the air and off of the ground, only to find our balcony covered in the bright circles and squares when we arrived back at The Chatwal.  Truly a peaceful retreat in the bustle of the Big Apple. ","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I used a suite night upgrade and was put in the Serenity Suite on the 7th floor. The suite was very well furnished and as other writers have mentioned the rooms are very technologically advanced. The best part of the room was the large terrace which was furnished\/decorated beautifully. I honestly believe the Terrace alone makes the room worth it. \n\nHotel Differentiators Compared to Other NYC Properties:\n- Staff are always smiling, ready to help, and very attentive to detail from the front desk to housekeeping to the Lamb's Club\n- Rooms are extremely clean, bathroom products are excellent, technology in the room is the best I have seen in NY\n- Furnishings in the hotel as well as in the rooms are meticulously selected and if you are into the history of buildings this edifice is one of a kind\n- Noise level is slim to none, for a hotel being in the \"belly of the beast\" of NYC you would expect a lot of ambient noise but I could not ask for a more blissful night's rest\n\nI would definitely stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat, for anyone looking for a nice Oasis in the middle of the city look no further.\n\nThe only minute let down was that in the room there was a wonderful selection of coffee table books that I could not put down. The books indicated they were all available for purchase and when I asked to purchase one of them, \"To India With Love,\" I was told I could not purchase the book.

Now I'm not.  It is by no means at the same level it was; sorry to say, I would not return again. While it's pretty inside and convenient to the theater district, it no longer goes the extra mile to make the cost ($900\/night for a double) worthwhile.\nUpon arrival I realized I had forgotten my phone charger and asked the front desk whether the room had a charging station or if the hotel could lend me a charging cord for the night.  No on both counts -- as to a loaner, I was told \"We don't do that.\"  There was no further effort on the part of the staff, not even to tell me somewhere close by that I could purchase one:  they just didn't care.  Given the common nature of this problem, I was surprised at the lack of help.\nI was also sorry that the hotel no longer lends iPads to its guests as it did in the past, and that there are no longer hard-boiled eggs provided at the upstairs bar.  These were nice extra touches that I appreciated on my prior visit.  Finally, though the room was clean and handsome and breakfast was good, some of the staff, particularly the doormen, seemed uninterested in their jobs -- they either chatted with passing tourists instead of opening the doors or helping us with luggage, or were nowhere to be found.

Diese lagen als Beweis ausgedruckt ebenfalls dabei.\nLeider wei\u00df ich nicht wie die Dame hie\u00df aber nochmals auf diesem Weg meine Hochachtung vor soviel Gewitztheit und Charme und vielen Dank f\u00fcr die Selfies. Dank diese Erlebnisses wird das Chatwal immer ein besonders Hotel f\u00fcr uns bleiben!","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Dimitri was a most excellent guide to walk us through what the hotel offered as well as the lamb and it's restaurant. I apologize that I do not know the names of the hotel staff, but EVERYONE was concerned that we have were treated well, had what needed, and WANTED and I couldn't have been happier. I am not a wealthy person, but it did not matter to ANYONE. They all made me feel special, just by being there. The room was well appointed and QUIET. No, I did not have a view, we were an alley room, but being a country person, I had a TERRIFIC nights' sleep because it was so quiet. I di not take advantage of the butler because, frankly, I did not know what to do with the service, but if I had asked, the staff would have been happy to help me. \/the woman at the front desk was due to have a baby in July... I hope she has a healthy baby. I can not recommend this hotel enough!! Expensive, yes, but they ALL, from Front Desk to maids, to bell hops to valet, truly cared about how I was treated.

We stayed for 5 nights,  We booked a Junior Suite with Terrace.  Upon arrival there was a bottle of Champagne, flowers, a fruit platter and a very nice note for our anniversary.  I felt the room was on the small side and can't imagine the size of a regular room.  The terrace was huge and nicely decorated with planters.  We faced 44th street but there was really no view.  Woke up the first morning and phoned the butler to get me coffee.  She told me that I can get it myself in the lobby.  Really?? Ok so I did.  After getting ready for the day I felt that something was off with the bathroom, I specifically remember booking this room for the double sinks.  We only had one sink in the bathroom and it was very small.  I went and checked their website and it stated that with this room category had a bathroom with double sinks.  I brought it to the attention of the front desk and they adjusted my rate to reflect a deluxe king room with a terrace.  They did the right thing but I would have rather had the double sinks than the adjustment.  Asked to use the house car on Sunday evening and was told that the house car doesn't operate on Sunday and Monday. Really??? It should be seven days a week.  Never did get to use the car because everytime we asked it wasn't available.  We order room service for breakfast on the day of our anniversary..made this request prior to arrival.  Room service was delivered quickly and it was to be outside on the terrace.He set it up but never put a table cloth on the table.  Really??  Our room came with free breakfast and on the day they charged us.  Why I don't know.  Need to resolve that.  On our last night we went to the lobby bar where there is only one bartender that serves the restaurant and the lobby bar.  We sat there for ten minutes waiting for a drink.  Here's an idea...have two bartenders.  And  finally on the last night we never received turn down service.  Annoying....Also getting bottled water was always a production.

The Chatwal is a small luxury boutique hotel with an amazing deco style and attention to detail.  We were upgraded to the jr. suite, and when we got to the room we were in awe - the grey microsuede-like walls with amazing lighting-- leather wrapped door and closet handles everywhere, the all black sparkly bathroom (yes it SPARKLES!) with deep jacuzzi tub and gorgeous amenities. And the biggest surprise, a heated toilet seat with front\/back bidet and dryer-- WHAT?? insane!  \n\nThe closets were designed steamer trunk style-- with plenty of room and shelving-- definitely worth mentioning. The furniture was gorgeous, the bed was comfortable and the room even came with a private butler. Sadly, we were only there for a night, but it was a truly memorable stay. \n\nWe also had a great jazz brunch at the hotel restaurant called the Lamb's Club, which was delicious.  We are native NY'ers so we don't have a need to stay at a hotel in the city all that often, but next time and every time after that this will be the place.

Pierre also gave us very good suggestions on how to get around NYC and dining options. We are lucky to have met Pierre during our stay, he sure made our stay at NYC memorable. \n\nAs mentioned by other reviewers, Chatwal is a boutique hotel conveniently located steps away from the hustle bustle of Times Square.

We approached the Front Desk for an alternate recommendation. There was no empathy or even inquiry for additional details; the man only said that the restaurant is a different department and a lot of guests go to the Hotel next door. The doorman was the most sincere and said he would relay the concern to Management. We passed the desk twice again and nobody uttered a word.

I then did an 8 hour slate of meetings to be treated to the tiniest room I've stayed at in Manhattan (which is saying a lot) that had its desk outlets and phone inoperable. The bed is 3 feet from the curtains, which, after operating the fancy remote control drapes, reveal, wait for it, a wall with a tiny window looking into an alley! The room says it comes with butler-service, but at check in, it was not described how to call a butler or what services they provide, unlike the wonderful service at the St. Regis.\n\nThe night front desk manager was very friendly, but foreshadowed how awful the room is by eagerly offering to text me the next day if an upgrade became available. I will also say that the reservations staff was very friendly and graciously shortened my stay when I had my plans change despite booking the non-refundable promo. Nevertheless, unless a shoebox room like this should NEVER be offered at a \"luxury\" hotel with a normal rate of $650.

At check in, they congratulated us on our wedding, noted our SPG Gold status, and mentioned an upgrade to an incredible room of the street-side of the property.\n\nBellmen were quick and helpful. The room is a beast of tech and features. Their soft product is to die for. Sheets, towels, robes, slippers. I was in heaven. The room design is thoughtful and catchy. Everything evokes an era of 1920's\/30's, while still being luxurious and modern.\n\nService was top-notch. Our butlers, Brandon and Tinzin, were very rarely needed, but did what they said they would. I found the doormen and bellmen to be a standout, in terms of consistent helpful service.\n\nOnsite F&B is tiny, but well-executed. Dinner at The Lambs Club was quick, painless, and exquisite, despite one awkward moment where our dinner came well before our cocktails. The lobby bar featured incredible drinks, crafted by a stellar team.\n\nThe location can't be praised enough. We saw three shows and could stroll back to our hotel within minutes after each.

A fabulous hotel! We wanted somewhere special to spend our first ever Christmas away from home and we found it at the Chatwal! Before ever arriving they always responded to my various email queries very promptly. As it was Christmas I asked for a tree and decorations in our room and they obliged, it was so nice to have our suite decorated for Christmas. We had a two bedroom two bathroom garden suite with balcony. The height of luxury. Comfy beds and fabulous shower rooms! Twice daily room service. Very well stocked mini bars but very expensive so we tended to avoid using them. The whole team of staff were friendly and so willing to provide anything we needed. The hotel was spotless! Lovely decor. The hotel is in the heart of Times Square but the bedrooms are so peaceful it is hard to believe the hustle and bustle outside. There is nothing we can say negatively other than it is luxury and so you pay a luxury price. We had lots of activities organised so we didn't eat at the hotel. Breakfast and dinner seemed very expensive so we tended to eat elsewhere but also as we wanted to try lots of different places. Otherwise I could not fault it at all and we are very grateful for how well we have been looked after and we are so delighted that we chose the Chatwal at this special time of year. We only managed to visit the pool once as we had so much to do, although a small plunge pool and jacuzzi it was beautiful and the shower rooms there pure luxury!  We have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone who wants to visit.......thank you Chatwal Team, each and every one of you ;)","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This hotel has the 3 qualities that, for me, are important : a good bed, a good shower, and quietness. It looks obvious but it is not, also amongs 5 stars hotels. Many international hotels, especially in old cities (Paris, London...) are made in old buildings and when they renovate the quietness is not the first thing they have in mind. Insolation is not good enough and you can hear noises from street, from the other rooms or more often from the corridors and the other rooms (classical noise of the waiters or from the doors from the other rooms). Most of the time it would be enough to have a second door (also sliding one is enough) to attenuate the noises... But sorry it is only my problem as I am quite sensible... \nSo, as many other guest said before me it is very quiet, even if it is very close to Times Square. The only thing one should argue is that most of the rooms are a little bit too small, especially the bathrooms. Some of them don't have so much light too. I used to go there alone and it was fine, but when I went with my wife I started to have some problems (you know that women need some more space there to put there few things for make up). \nThe service is always good, position is very good in midtown. \nRestaurant is nice but overpriced. I use to go outside for breakfast as it is really too expensive there.\nAnyway my favourite hotel in New York.","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This was my first time staying at this hotel, and I was very happy with my choice. It's a boutique hotel in a great Midtown location. Some may be turned off by its proximity to Times Square, but don't be. It is not IN Times Square; it's just NEAR Times Square. I had a junior suite facing 44th St. and never heard any noise from Times Square. The street is surprisingly quiet and has very light traffic. I found it really interesting that the hotel feels like it's located in a quiet (albeit Midtown) neighborhood, but if you walk 100 meters down the street, you're in the middle of one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world. I thought that was great. And the location is great if you're in town for Broadway shows, since it's right in the middle of the theater district. I walked to both Book of Mormon and Hamilton in less than 10 minutes. And besides all of the touristy restaurants in Times Square, there are several great \"local\" restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, etc. right outside the door on 44th St. The Lamb's Club restaurant and bar are in the Chatwal, and both have great food, drinks, and ambiance.\nBecause it's a boutique hotel, the outside facade, entrance, and lobby are not overwhelming or too grand. Don't get me wrong, they are all nice. But none of them are going to knock your socks off like a few of the other 5-star hotels in NYC do. My most pleasant surprise was my junior suite, which was huge - especially for NYC. It was larger than most studio apartments in NYC. I was a little surprised there was no tub in the bathroom, but the huge rainfall shower, heated toilet seat, and heated tile floors more than made up for the lack of a tub (that I would not have used, anyway). The service is top-notch. Personal butler service comes with some of the rooms (maybe starting at the \"suite\" level of rooms), which is always nice to have. My only complaint is the price of room service. It is absolutely ridiculous. $8 bowl of cornflakes, $12 glass of orange juice, $25 hamburger, $12 for a side of french fries, etc.. And those prices don't even include the $6 room service charge and the gratuity that are automatically added to every bill. Those prices are CRAZY, even for a 5-star hotel in NYC. All in all, I really like this hotel. I'll stay here again. I'll just eat ANYWHERE except from room service. :)","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My husband likes to go to sleep early and I prefer to stay awake and watch TV.   This is rather difficult if we are both in the same room.  Although we had a junior suite (and a wonderful room with an excellent couch, I might add), the TV was still in the same room.   I had called The Chatwal several days in advance of our stay and asked them if I could connect a special wireless headphone to the room TV so that I could listen to the TV late into the evening while my husband slept.  After checking with the engineer, I was told that their TVs did not accommodate this type of set-up and they apologized.  After our first night at The Chatwal, the front desk personnel told me that they had purchased a wireless headset for our TV, it was all hooked up and was ready for me to use.  Well, you can imagine - I was so shocked when I was given this information that I could barely believe my ears!  Frankly, I never in a million years, expected The Chatwal to go out and purchase the wireless headset and base station.  Actually, I didn't even think the operator who originally took my call would pass the call on to the powers that be, let alone that the hotel would go to the trouble of procuring the device.  I know personally that there are various types of wireless headsets, each one of which only work on certain types of TVs (I know this because I have such a device at my home), so finding one that works is not a simple task.  I did not ask the hotel to purchase such a device for me...I was only inquiring if their TVs would accommodate such a device so that I could use my own headset while I was there.  To actually go to the next step - that is, to purchase the device so that my stay would be excellent in every way, well.... that is another story and certainly, an example of undoubtedly, the best customer service I have ever received from a hotel, let alone from any business.  I have stayed at 5 Star hotels all over the world and The Chatwal provided me with the best customer service I have ever received anywhere.  I would like to add that the front desk personnel, the concierge, doormen and everyone else at the hotel were entirely pleasant and helpful and made our stay the best possible.   We stayed at The Chatwal because we were on a short trip to NYC to see some shows on Broadway and The Chatwal's theatre district location make it entirely convenient - within walking distance to most theatres in NYC.  We will stay here again and will recommend the hotel to our friends, family and business associates travelling to NYC.","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were met at the desk by the most courteous personnel. Titus, who met us at the desk, was very friendly and helpful with directions on how to get to Times Square. We were trying to find a nearby drug store and he gave us very specific directions. He also told us about the Lambs Club Restaurant which is on the property. The beautiful Art Deco decor immediately caught our eye. My husband is an architect and I am an interior designer, so this was something which we really appreciated. Once we arrived in our rooms, we felt at home in our beautiful adjoining suite.. We ordered beverages, which were promptly brought to our room. The room service staff was extremely accommodating. We found the food downstairs at The Lambs Head Restaurant to be some of the best that we had during our entire stay in NY. We highly recommend it. One of our reasons for visiting NY was to attend several Broadway shows. The location of The Chatwal is extremely convenient for those wishing to attend Broadway Shows. One of the Shows we attended was \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch,\" which was playing directly across the street. That was very convenient. Most other shows are within a few blocks of The Chatwal. Pierre at the concierge desk was most helpful in finding tickets to the shows we were interested in seeing. One night, I didn't get home from getting my playbill signed at the stage door across the street until after 1:00am and was still able to order an omelet and a salad. I find that to be a big plus to be able to get 24 hour room service. The quality of the room service food is equivalent to the food in the restaurant downstairs. I also want to mention the bar downstairs. It was the best and the bar staff was attentive and on the ball. There is also a restaurant and bar on the second floor which is open late. That is really something we look for in a hotel, especially if we want to attend any Broadway Shows. In all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Chatwal and would highly recommend it if you are planning a trip to New York City. This hotel is close to the theaters and some of the finest stores in NYC. It is a feast for the eyes and has a boutique hotel atmosphere. If you are looking for that personal touch and that feeling that you have found a hotel home in New York City, this is the hotel for you.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Lovely exterior (colonial British) with a cosy lobby, the room is of great luxury with burgundy glittering mable bathroom, full amenities box, velvet wallpaper, leather walldrove with build-in bar and entertainments.   The room is not big but just right for 1-2 travellers.   If you want to expand your space, they have a floor with little balcony (7\/F) or you can take the Producer Suite (equivalent to a Presidential Suite) with a build-in staircase going to rooftop.  Their bulter service is rather attentive and they addressed me by name even I was just at the corridor.  The restaurant offers great quality of food, fitness center and pool are located in basement which were  comparatively small but still good as it's a boutique hotel (only 76 rooms).   They also have a SPA by Elizabeth Arden.   Great hotel for business or pleasure !!","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Service was not consistent.  The front desk, bell staff, housekeeping, engineering all displayed impeccable concern for our comfort and satisfaction yet the servers in the restaurant and bar leave a lot to be desired.  Drink orders at the Lambs Club took forever and were not correct.  No cocktail napkins, and no follow up.  We had to get up and get what we needed from the bar ourselves.   Service during Sunday brunch was very slow even though the place was almost empty.  Quality of the food was a strong point but again very expensive.\n\nRooms were very well appointed with all the tech gadgets, multi station control of all lights, hidden TV in the bath, motorized curtains, etc.  Motif is very dark leather, granite and chrome.  Bathroom needs better ventilation. Housekeeping is excellent and almost magically unobtrusive.   Isolation from street noise was outstanding but there is a problem on the lower floors with noise from the bar and function room.  \n\nValet parking was efficient and priced in line with what you would expect in Times Square area.  The entrance to the lobby is by stairs only with no ramps so the bell staff can't use carts and have to lug your bags in manually, which they do with a smile.  Guests with wheelchairs or walkers will have problems especially after hours when there is no front door person.  \n\nAgain, generally inconsistent with mostly really good stuff marred by some annoying stuff.","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Just came from my first stay here and it was delightful.  I came to the city for work and then my husband joined me at the end of the week for a quick getaway, and the entire staff treated us like royalty.  I used Starwood points to pay for the room, which was a standard queen room, and when I arrived they upgraded me to a King suite with a patio (which they totally didn't have to do, because I was paying with points).  The room was lovely, the bathroom luxurious, and that patio was a great place to have our coffee in the morning.\n\nThe service, again, was fantastic.  Everyone goes out of their way to help you at every opportunity.  One afternoon I had to work from my room, so I stopped at the bar first to get a glass of wine to bring upstairs...  one of the managers saw me heading towards the elevators with my hands full, and sprinted across the lobby to beat me to the elevators so he could push the button for me.  \n\nI only had a few complaints, and these were minor:\n1.  The curtains seemed to be on some sort of timer, so that they opened automatically in the middle of the night to let the sun in at sunrise.  My husband and I are light sleepers, so the sound of the curtains opening on their own startled us awake every night and really freaked us out.  LOL\n2.  I understand that minibar costs are higher than what you'd spend outside the hotel, but the minibar charges here made us laugh out loud.  $12 for a small candy bar?  We get that most people who stay here don't have to worry at all about the price of anything, but there's a point when you just have to say \"nope\".\n3.  If you have a bad back, know that the Chatwal beds seem to be on the firm side.  Super comfortable, and I slept well, but they're firm.  Unfortunately for me, the bed and my back didn't get along and I left the hotel on our final morning with a really bad back spasm.  Totally not the fault of the hotel or anything, just good for you to know if you need a bed that's soft.\n\nOh -- and back to a positive, dinner at The Lambs Club was delightful.  Fantastic meal, even the bread at the start was the best bread I've ever eaten in my life.  :)\n\nI will definitely be back in the future (but will bring a back support to sleep on)...  my new favorite hotel in the city!","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

(As an example, one of them actually hiked all the way over to 7th street to flag down a cab, as most of the flag downs ended up stopping at the Millennium before they got to us.)\n\nThe front desk staff was friendly and efficient and we are checked in immediately. The lobby is sharp and inviting, with lots of seating.\n\nThe rooms are incredible - good size for the price, all new and modern.  Terrific bathrooms with literally every amenity and a great waterfall shower.  I always enjoy the TV's built into the mirror!  All kinds of electronically controlled environmental controls were conveniently next to the bed.  Small and direct reading lights on built in flexible rods made it very easy to get a few pages knocked out before going to sleep. The whole hotel was  very quiet.\n\nWe also found a nice backgammon set in the closet.  Luckily there are game instructions in the guest services book :)\n\nThe desk included UK adapters, which I didn't need, but it reminded me what a pain this is when I go over there.  I'm sure international guests appreciate this little touch.\n\nIf you are a minibar fan - this is the place for you.\n\nThe door locks use the newer proximity cards and were super-easy and reliable.  The elevator uses the same cards.  For once I didn't have to go to the desk to get new keys after my phone \"demystifies\" them.\n\nTurndown service was quietly handled while we were at dinner, and there were even complimentary overnight shoe shine bags on the bed to remind me.\n\nThe bar (upstairs) was pretty good.  We ordered a snack and drinks which took slightly (but not annoyingly) longer than we would typically expect.  The Shishoto peppers are excellent. We also had drinks downstairs at the lobby bar, and they were terrific.  The bartender definitely knows his way around a Manhattan.  \n\nBreakfast at Lambs, off the lobby, was included in our rate. We opted for the breakfast parfait and pastries which were both very good.  I am a bacon and eggs man but I admit that the combination of Greek yogurt, granola, honey and plenty of fresh berries hit the spot. Maybe I was lulled by the fact that they serve it in a Martini glass!  The pastries were very fresh and there were more than we could eat. Coffee was worthy (very important!).\n\nI think I will stay here every time I am in the city from now on - its that good. The price was comparable to others I have stayed in l, but I'd call it a good value for the cost.\n\n","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

As soon as the doorman opens the doors into the quiet, air conditioned lobby, you are transported to a calm, relaxed atmosphere to unwind from a busy day of meetings and\/or sightseeing. The rooms are quite large for NYC, well appointed with exquisite linens, and offer plenty of storage. They are actually silent and can be made very dark with blackout curtains.  The room lights dim with the touch of a button by the bed. Next to each side of the bed is a convenient reading light. The bathrooms are sparkling (literally, the marble has sparkles in it!), the rain shower is spa-like, and the toilet seats are heated! \n\nBut where the Chatwal really shines is with its staff. I can't say enough good things about how accommodating and friendly they are. You are greeted warmly each time you step into the lobby. A big heartfelt thanks to Michael and Manpreet for making friends with our daughter - they made our stay so memorable! We left one of our daughter's stuffed animals in the room when we went out one night and the housekeeping staff tucked him into bed for the night. She was so happy to see that he was taken care of! We will definitely return to this wonderful hotel!","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Now I have stayed in hotels all over NYC and I had never had a room with a balcony in the city before. The hotel was also quite despite its proximity to everything. The staff was wonderful. A level of service that you rarely get outside of Disney. When compared to other NYC hotels on terms of service, friendliness and helpfulness - this place blows the Plaza and the Waldorf out of the water. One last thing, while the hotel is super classy, I was in a printed t-shirt when I got there as I was coming from a school thing.

I have to say though that we most enjoyed our recent stay at the Chatwal. From the moment we arrived, the staff was friendly and made us feel like VIP travelers. The building is in a great location, due to it's proximity to Times Square and Bryant Park. We were traveling with our dog, and the staff was very accommodating to her. We stayed in a junior suite which was spacious and very luxurious. The suede walls and the leather covered built in closets were the type of details that make this hotel special. The bathroom was amazing - the jetted tub, the incredible rainfall shower, the TV integrated in the mirror, and the best feature- the Toto toilet, with a heated seat and a built in bidet with heated water was something we never have seen in any hotel. There is also a touchscreen system in the room bedside that can control all the lighting, thermostat, and the motorized drapes. \nOur butler helped us with dinner reservations, getting us a last minute reservation at Nobu that we couldn't get ourselves.

The Sikh butler on my floor did not greet me but did respond promptly when I needed a toothbrush.  Actually, the fact that no one escorted me to my room or greeted me there was a problem, because the means of controlling the curtains (through the telephone or an unmarked remote stored in a drawer) was not easy to find or figure out -- similar to a problem I had with another Starwood hotel in Vienna, where it took me four days to discover a switch for controlling the electronic shutters in a closet housing a trouser press.  Also the Chatwal room service menu was essentially hidden in a closet and it would have been helpful for someone to show it to me. I was disappointed that room service could not deliver the afternoon tea featured in the hotel restaurant, but when I persisted they were able to substitute with a pot of tea, sandwich, and leftover scones from breakfast, and they offered hot milk with the tea, which most hotels do not do; Delivery was very courteous and astonishingly quick.  The bathroom was large, modern, trendy, and clean, with a huge shower with lovely soaps.  The bed was much too hard for me and I had significant back pain, but I need a softer mattress than most so this is unlikely to be a problem for the majority.  Overnight shoeshine, which was included, was only fair compared with professional shoeshines on the street.  Wireless Internet in the room was sometimes slow, as in other hotels, and was included in the cost of the room without any need for complicated sign-in pages.  After some initial miscommunication, the doorman was able to get a cab for me, even though this required him to go down to the corner.  I was not offered use of the hotel car.  Overall this is an elegant hotel with the potential to make guests feel cared for; the expense is probably worth it for a trip including many business or social activities and cultural events that would allow the guest to take full advantage of the hotel's service; it may be less worth it for a quick overnight stay.","travelDate":"2015-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

We enjoyed the 750 sq. ft. rooftop balcony the most and the views were amazing.  I would love to be there for New Year's Eve as you can see the ball drop from there.  What a place for a party!!  We were treated so well by all of the staff.  They make you feel like family - so welcome and they do whatever they can to please you.  I had contact with the concierge service well before our trip about obtaining tickets to shows and Pierre, Juan and Jeff were so helpful and got us the best seats  and are so helpful with whatever we needed such as tickets to the 911 memorial and dinner suggestions and reservations.  Our Butlers, Brandon and Manpreet are wonderful and do such an exceptional job.  The room service is divine and very timely.  The front desk staff, Rigel does a great job and always made us feel so welcome and was so happy to help with whatever our request may be.  The Guest Services Manager, Tammy Yu, was wonderful and made our trip especially wonderful.  She made us feel so welcome and gave us an upgrade which was a great surprise.  We had booked a wonderful suite with a terrace and were upgraded with The Producer's Suite.  The room was so beautiful that we hated to leave the room.

It's a fine hotel in a nice location--nestled right between Times Square and Sixth Avenue, so both central and quiet. And the service is generally top-notch, as frequent SPG travelers like me (I'm a 100-night Platinum) expect. But my stay was ruined by the proverbial bad apple in the bunch--the incredibly rude night manager at the Chatwal, Daniel.\n\nThe Chatwal's rooms are quite small and dark, because the hotel is surrounded by much taller buildings. So after checking in, as an SPG Platinum I asked the front desk to upgrade me to a room with a bit more light. I had the misfortune of being directed to Daniel, who rudely denied me any accommodation, repeatedly calling me \"difficult\" and \"unreasonable.\" It took just a ten-minute call to the Platinum Concierge to get arranged for an upgrade (several rooms were available), but Daniel's attitude and refusal to accommodate frequent Starwood guests was a bother.\n\nDuring my stay, I enjoyed the rest of the staff very much, who showed me into the lovely Mezzanine Bar for an Empire-era cocktail and live jazz. I also had a fine breakfast, also over live jazz. And it was easy to avoid the bustle of Times Square. For those looking to avoid the tourist traps there, just make a right out of the Chatwal and grab a taxi going north on Sixth Avenue!\n\nOne downside of the Chatwal is the absurdly tiny gym, which is perhaps 300 square feet total. That's mitigated a bit by the Red Door Spa that's available, and the little lap pool they have, but at these rates having only two treadmills in the hotel's gym is really a bit ridiculous. Still, my stay was enjoyable. I stayed long enough to get to know most staff by name, and they kindly helped me throughout a busy week of business appointments.\n\nUnfortunately, upon checkout I was once again confronted by Daniel. He complained that he \"would not have accommodated [me] if SPG hadn't made us,\" and refused to remove several incorrect charges from my folio. I've had to file a lengthy complaint with Starwood about him and my experience. Because SPG is usually so good to its frequent travelers, I expect they will compensate me appropriately, but I hadn't bargained for an hour on the phone with SPG's corporate customer service when I decided to stay at the Chatwal.\n\nOverall, I thought the Chatwal was a unique and lovely boutique hotel, with several nice touches. But to me, for a boutique hotel to be a success, the staff have to be exceptional. Not only did I not have that experience, but Daniel's rude resistance to taking care of SPG's most frequent guests convinced me never to return. There are too many fine hotels in New York--Starwood and otherwise--to put up with that kind of treatment, and I suggest that SPG Platinums stay at the St. Regis, the W, or another hotel where you won't have to tolerate folks like him.","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room service staff was kind enough to not get huffy over serving my breakfast in 2 shifts (coffee and milk pre-gym at 5 am and the rest more than an hour later),  the front desk printed out a 30 page document in color and slipped it under my door within minutes of receiving the file via email and not squibbling over charging me for it, etc. I felt taken care of.\nYou never have to beg.........","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Beautifully restored in New York Machine Age style deco, the lobby is an amazing welcome with its oversized clock and polished metal and bright red leather. The rooms are a little more understated but luxurious - in particular the food and wine cupboard (no way can i call this a mini bar as i am sure they would be horrified!) and the writing desk are works of art. The bathroom is all mirrors, polished metal and black stone. A pleasure every time you enter but wouldn't like to have to clean it! \nThe privacy and lack of crowds was the most appealing feature for me. It really does feel like your own private escape.  W 44th street is also an excellent location with a range of well priced bistro's (if u like heading out for breakfast), bars and quality restaurants all within 10 mins walk.","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My favourite area of NYC is actually Downton but if you're staying Midtown you can't wish for better. The rooms are lovely, big, amazing bathroom (heated toilet seats!), my only gripe is the lack of coffee machine in the room which a lot of big hotels do these days. Our favourite thing about this hotel is the wonderful Brandon and his excellent staff, year on year they look after us so well, anything we require is taken care of in a swift, friendly and professional manner. In fact he's so wonderful he makes notes of our requirements and they are left in our room the following yearn from kettles to ironing boards. The restaurants and bars are great, but as is normal, gets a little slow at very busy times. Food is brilliant, breakfast lunch and dinner.

As a returning guest I have to say that everything is still as good as it was last time. Rather small room (what you expect in NY?) but very comfortable. Perfect bed and pillows. The bathroom stands out. Unlike the room it's spacious and superb heated toilet seat. Room for 3 in shower with modern equipment, heavenly rain shower. All very comfortable. Biggest asset: it's quiet. It struck me last time it still is. Definitively a pro in a noisy city. Very helpful reception staff and concierge. One slight neg: it's so brown in the room. Makes an outdated impression. I had constant fight with the touch screen operated lighting and phone. Prefer something more easy to handle. You get excellent quality for this pricy hotel","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Very clean and helpful staff.  Walking distance to Central Park, MoMA, theater (obviously) make this a convenient location as well.  The spa is a little small, it is an Elizabeth Arden satellite and you can schedule treatments.  There is a small gym and singles endless pool to swim against current, if so desired.  The pre theater crowd fills up the cool lobby bar for the restaurant (Lamb's Club), but clears out when shows start.  Dining at the Lamb's Club is a treat, but not cheap.

We stayed their for 6 nights in February.  The staff is top notch and really get to know you from the moment you check in.  So accommodating and sincere.  The hotel is elegant with a bit of fun mixed in.  Lots of music in the background whether it's Frank Sinatra streaming through or whiffs of a live Jazz Trio coming from the Lamb's Club lounge, it's a lively place that you want to come back to after a day of museums or shopping.  We will stay at the Chatwal for all of our future visits to NYC.  And don't overlook the Lamb's Club.

The lobby was't very cosy and there was no lounge to sit and relax in, which would have been nice. Good wi-fi.

It's very easy to access shopping on 5th avenue and Madison Square garden. There are bunch of cute restaurants all along the street.\nIt was reasonably priced New York Hotel and we had a great experience.

Our room was street side, but we didn't have a lot of noise and was luxury with a capital L. The bathroom was bigger than most NYC hotel rooms and the rainfall shower head was delightful. Breakfast in the Lambs Club Restaurant was fantastic. The food was amazing and the service was quick and friendly. Drinks were quaint yet NYC expensive in the lobby -- with the only complaint that they stopped serving pretty early in the evening on Sunday. The whole place had great character, great atmosphere and friendly service. Probably my only complaint was that we could hear someone in another room watching tv. I don't know if they were hard of hearing and needed to listen to it very loudly or if the walls were just a bit thin.

Reviewing a hotel can be difficult if the stay is uneventful and pleasant, and can be fun and filled with vindication if not.\nThis will be a quick review.  The hotel is nice and pleasant, and leaves nothing to disappoint.  The inside (lobby, common areas and rooms) are clean, modern and aesthetically pleasing.  The rooms (at least mine) are very nice and clean, and the bathroom was large and filled with high end components (shower head, faucet, toilet\u2026).  There\u2019s also (in the bathroom) a television embedded inside one of the mirrors which you won\u2019t notice until you turn it on; if you\u2019re wondering why the bathroom has a TV remote\u2026that\u2019s why.\n\nThe staff is friendly and eager to please, and I didn\u2019t see any fault in this hotel.  It is high end, clean, spacious, and delivers in its promise to provide with a nice and luxurious stay.\nNote: The second room I booked (on a separate floor) was for a couple traveling with us, and they had issues with their room; apparently there was a loud party going on next to them, and also the automatic (motorized) curtains started going on and off starting around 5 am.  They called the staff which was responsive and tried to fix the mechanical issue, and in addition satisfactory restitution was made for the loud noise and trouble in general (which was called in several times during the night).  \n\nI bring this up not as a negative (in all fairness, my room was quiet and did not have any issues), but to point out the fact that the hotel was responsive in trying to address the issue for the other room.\nI highly recommend this hotel for its service and location.\n\nPros:\nGreat location (minutes from Times Square and Broadway theaters).\nModern, clean and updated look and feel.\nHelpful and friendly staff.\n\nCons:\nNothing is perfect, but stayed there only one night and personally could not find any faults.\nRooms are a little pricey though.\n\nTips:\nIf this is your first time in Manhattan, especially Times Square, things can get a little overwhelming.  Lots of people, a little chaotic, lots of neon and bright signs and advertisements, street vendors, street performers\u2026.  The biggest things to pay attention to are traffic and other people.

The room was quite spacious and I had a terrace that overlooked the city.  \n\nThe staff:  each person we interacted with was so personable and inquired about anything we might need, ready to assist.  Very well trained staff with high standards for ensuring guest satisfaction.\n\nThe location: can't get much better than to be steps away from Times Square and the Theatre district. \n\nThe room: Perfect.  Most rooms in NYC hotels have a fair amount of street noise - but not the Chatwal.  Even with my room facing the city and having a terrace, the room was so quiet and perfect for sleeping.  The sheets are so soft and amazing - they're ironed to the bed.  If you love crisp sheets that are still soft, you'll love the Chatwal sheets.  The bathroom is gorgeous - the lighting is great; the shower is fabulous with a wonderful rainfall shower; and the multi-function toilet with heated seats tops it off.  \n\nThe restaurant: The Lambs Club restaurant is outstanding.  Great service \/ great food.  We ate several meals there.  All great.  \n\nI plan to visit again over Valentines weekend with my husband.

Dark skyscraper canyons and massive crowds.  Oh well, it is what it is.  I didn't give this the top rating because, while very nice it wasn't spectacular.  The rooms are elegant, expensively furnished, but the decor rather dark, with imitation (not a complaint) leather covering the closets and desks.  It is to evoke luggage, and IS very clever, but still, dark.  The bathrooms are dark as well, but in a more inviting way.  Very beautiful black granite from floor to ceiling and thoughtful, effective lighting.  The bathroom mirror has a hidden TV which is VERY cool.  The toilet seats are heated and the bowl has hygienic washing...a nice touch.   The rooms are SPECTACULARLY clean!  \nThe lobby is small, nicely appointed, but not knock you socks off luxurious.\nThe staff is wonderful..everyone..without exception.\nThe gym-swim-spa area is small, and very nicely done.  The pool and jacuzzi are salt water, which minimizes the chlorine smell found in many hotel pools.  The pool is a lap pool, the kind with automatic current that you swim against, but room for only one swimmer at a time.  The two times I was there, there was no one else in the pool.\nThe restaurant is understated, and elegant.  It is headed by the famous TV Chef and restaurateur Geoffrey Zakarian, and is everything you would expect of this culinary icon!  Quite simply this is the best hotel food that I have ever had.\nThe location,  just off Times Square, and opposite the Majestic Theater, where Phantom of the Opera has been playing since 1988 is Broadway convenient. Traffic is nightmarish in the usual NewYork way.  It took over 1\/2 hour just to drive the few blocks from the Hudson River to its midtown location on 44th st., but it WAS 2 days before New Year's Eve, so all the hubbub of Times Square getting ready for the crowds exacerbated traffic.\nIf you want to immerse yourself in all things New York City, this is a great place to do it","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Most people passing by probably have no idea this small classy building is home to an amazing hotel. What\u2019s different you might ask? First, it\u2019s quite small, just 70 rooms, so definitely it doesn\u2019t feel like a huge business corporate hotel. I can\u2019t stand those Hyatt\u2019s or W\u2019s, there is nothing homy about them, just fake everything attitude. Whatever, whenever? Seriously? Not at the Chatwal. This is old school class with a smile. Maybe it\u2019s not hip, no tattoos here. But it\u2019s a great combination of style and friendliness. The crew is not huge, so you remember them all just after one day. A bonus - an amazing general manager, who is genuine and friendly, will respond personally to your emails and questions. A great, great guy. Sure shows how people working here are treating this place. They are lucky - they clearly love their work!\nThere is a lot of different rooms here, all different somehow. So if you have any specific need - don\u2019t hesitate to contact the hotel. There is one great junior suite with a terrace. Or a couple of larger suites with terraces. Some are not bookable online, so it really makes sense to ask.\nAll of them are super clean and nice. Classy with modern features. Bathrooms are very modern. Furniture is high end, we even commented how expensive it really is.\nLocation - well, you are on Times Square. That\u2019s right. Rockefeller Center - 2 minutes. 5th Ave - 5 minutes. Quite a location, right?\nI think this is one of the best NYC has. And it\u2019s quite affordable for what it offers. I know, it\u2019s not cheap, but for NYC, it\u2019s quite a bargain IMO. Many hotels which are not close to this quality of everything, are charging twice as much.\nStay here, you will not regret. And have a dinner at the Lambs Club. Quite a place.","travelDate":"2015-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We are at the right place indeed! Offered drink vouchers upon check in for the lounge bar (maybe due to our SPG status). Great, friendly, out going staff; we had to catch a flight, so we rushed brunch, and they were very accommodating in getting the food out quickly, and the luggage & our driver ready by the time we were done eating. Clean everywhere in hotel from common areas, to restaurant, rooms (spotless Junior suite), how ever the hot tub in basement could use a spot check. But the hotel does actually have a pool and a hot tub which is uncommon. EXTREMELY small hot tub, but I used it on two occasions with no one else in the pool area. Lunch and brunch at the restaurant were excellent. I absolutely loved the Junior suite, so many modern electronics in a classic Manhattan room, beautiful decorating and design surprises all over the room if you're curious enough to look and clever enough to find\/figure it out. Love the leather wrapped everything. complimentary wifi and Fiji water. I loved the big shower head, and the Jacuzzi bathtub how ever water ends up all over the floor of the bathroom as there is no full closing door, that wasn't fun. TV behind the bathroom mirror is indeed fun though! The lobby gets crowded before shows because it's a popular spot for theater goers. Great central location if time square & theater district is your thing. Was very fun! But this isn't our favourite location in town, so we would probably return to previous hotel we stayed at Central Park South. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it tough!!!

I manage Forest Travel Agency, a Luxury Travel Agency based in Miami, so you can assume I have traveled extensively and stayed at some of the world's best hotels, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived to The Chatwal NYC. The hotel has a very cozy Art Deco loby welcoming guests as well as people dining at the very traditional Lambs Club restaurant. The rooms are of good size, and the highlights for me are bathroom, very ample, and modern, with a large bathroom with modern (vidette inclusive) toilet, his and hers sink with a hidden tv in the mirror, and an amazing rain shower. I think its also important to mention the fact that you hear absolutely no noise, and the blackouts provide absolute darkness so you have a very good night sleep, which if you have been to NYC you know its one of the issues at night when you are trying to sleep and all you hear are taxi horns or ambulance sirens, and just a lot of noise.\nthe only think you must be aware of, is that it is not the hotel you would choose if you want a view of the city... it is not a high-rise building. but is the hotel you choose if you want to be in the middle of the NYC action, and just be pampered and rest after a busy day out.","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We reported a noise emanating from what we thought was a faulty electrical socket.  This kept occurring every few minutes during our first night.  We were promised that an engineer would be sent up to check on the fault.  Arriving back at about 10:30 on our second evening we immediately noticed that the problem had not been rectified.  We were told that an engineer could not spot any issue.  We arranged for the duty manager to attend the room.  Within 5 minutes he heard the problem and called the duty engineer.  He diagnosed the fault to a problem with the bedside clock and removed it.  The noise was exceedingly irritating and had kept us awake during our first night.  Despite this the hotel offered no reduction in the room rate.  They failed to address the problem when it was first reported and when i reported it again on the second evening they simply said our engineer could not identify an issue.  Interesting that the duty manager heard the problem within 5 minutes of of attending the room!!  During the afternoon on our final day a member of staff simply unlocked the door without even knocking.  So much for privacy.  Finally there was an error on our bill.  We were charged for a private bar usage despite the fact we had not used the bar.  Although the charge has now been refunded there was no apology offered for the incorrect charge.  There appeared to be no concierge on either of the two weekend days and when summoned by the reception staff, they never appeared.  We ended up giving up waiting.

Their go to place in NYC is the Four Seasons, but we decided to save a little cash and try The Chatwal.  We had a GREAT experience.  The staff was friendly, the room was very spacious for NYC.  We recently stayed at the W NY in August in a suite and that room was smaller than our Grand Deluxe King at here.  Loved the style of the room and it was SUPER QUIET.  Especially considering Times Square is literally 1\/2 a block from the hotel.  The beds are comfortable, not the most comfortable, but we enjoyed good nites sleep.  Turn down service was great.  We used the Butler to steam our shirts both nites before we went out to dinner.  Not sure what other services he does, but that is all we used him for.  Turn down service was excellent and they did it for us even after we left to go to dinner at 8:00!!!!  Also, the room is totally wired, so you can turn on and off lights, open and close the draps, etc. from a control by the bed.  \n\nThe hotel location is actually pretty good.  While in Times Square, you are halfway between mid-town and downtown and close to the subway.  We walked a lot while we were there and were able to get down to 31st and up to 57th st from the hotel with no problem.  Plus, while this is Times Square, it really isnt. . .it was a fairly quiet street.   If you are seeing Hedwig and the Angry Inch, the theater is across the street at the other end of the block.\n\nThere were two small drawbacks:  1. There was a slight Mildew smell in the bathroom when we first arrived that seemed to permeate and fill the whole room as we stayed.  We checked in on Friday and by Sunday morning, it was the first thing I smelt when I woke up. Not really 5 star.\n\n2.  We had booked a Grand Deluxe King, I am an SPG Gold and I asked about an upgrade. The gentleman at the front desk tried to convince me they had upgraded me.  I had to show him my SPG app on my iPhone which had my reservation and room type.  They apologized and promised that the next time I stay they will ensure an upgrade.

We made our reservations 4 weeks ahead, and emailed & called the concierge to get us theater tickets, since they said, they would do anything to make our stay a good one. Well, no replies from the concierge. When we got to the hotel, we realized the concierge was rarely on-site. So we never got any help from their desk. When we called the front desk, no one answered, and no one responded to vmails.\n\nThe fitness center was a complete joke - one bike, 2 treadmills. And the restaurant - the food was ok, but service was awful. We asked to get done in time for the show, and they assured us this would be so. Then we had to wave them down to ask for the bill, and they still hadn't brought dessert @ 7:45. \n\nThe room was nicely furnished with a comfy mattress, but the air conditioning kept blowing right on us while sleeping, wifi was awful. we're never going back!","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Mind you, if we had received the accommodations and service that we received at The Chatwal, at a Holiday Inn, for maybe ONE FIFTH the price, we would have been fine with it.  The Chatwal would have you believe that you will be treated to the \"Ultimate in Luxury,\" but that is so far off the mark, it isn't even funny.  Our room had a TV and a DVD player.  The only problem was that the DVD player is in the closet disconnected.  We had to have first the bellman and then the \"engineer\" come to hook it up and it still didn't work.  To make matters worse, the only place for the DVD player to sit was on our ottoman, with wires strung all over the place.  The air conditioning register was aimed squarely at my head when I lie in bed and there was NO WAY to adjust it differently.  I had to climb up and wedge a pillow up there to keep the cold blast of air off of my head.  The bathroom looked amazing, until anyone used the sink or the shower and then the room looked like a disaster with all the chrome and polished stainless steel.  The shower had no dam at the door, so a significant amount of water flowed out into the bathroom.  The shower was big enough to hold a party in, but there was no place where one could rest their foot while washing their feet or, in my wife's case, shave her legs.  In addition, there was SUBSTANTIAL and unsightly MOLD and MILDEW growing in the shower.  I complained the first day about it, but it was NEVER cleaned up during our stay.  The Chatwal advertises that guests will receive the services of a \"Personal Butler,\" but in the five days we were there, we NEVER saw or heard from anyone saying that they were our \"butler.\"  The closets come with trouser hangers, but the closet is designed in such a way, that you cannot hang trousers in there, without them hitting the floor and I'm not that tall.  Upon our arrival, the orchid in our room was wilted and dead.  On the third day of our visit, a woman came to our door and replaced the orchid.  Why wasn't that done BEFORE we arrived?  The exterior door to the hotel is cast bronze and must weigh over 500 pounds.  A good portion of the time, it is NOT manned by a doorman.  Just try getting that door open while carrying a bunch of packages or bags.  It was hard for me and just about impossible for my wife to open with both hands free.  One day when we exited the hotel and a doorman was present, we asked for directions to the Hells Kitchen neighborhood.  He said he had \"no idea\" where it was at.  As it turns out, the world famous neighborhood is THREE FRIGGING BLOCKS from the hotel.  Shouldn't a doorman at an \"Ultra Luxury\" hotel know something like that?  One day we rode the hotel elevator with another couple who were raving about the box of cookies that were waiting for them when they checked in.  Their room was smaller than ours, they were staying only two nights and had not booked any special package, and we are Starwood Preferred Guests, but we never got a box of cookies.  The Lambs Club is an absolutely gorgeous restaurant.  Unfortunately, that's where it ends.  We had horrible service, mediocre food and the chairs were some of \"THE\" most uncomfortable I have ever sat in.  I actually wrote all of this in a letter and included PHOTOS, to the Starwood Hotels C.E.O., Fritz Van Paasschen, but I never received ANY satisfaction from his office or from the flunky he turned the matter over to.  My wife and I have stayed at five star hotels all over the world.  We know \"Ultimate Luxury,\" and I'm telling you, that The Chatwal is all flash and absolutely NO SUBSTANCE.  On top of that, they just don't give a damn.  If you are going to NYC, I highly recommend one of the following \"luxury\" hotels: The Four Seasons, The Pierre, The Ritz- Carlton Central Park or the Plaza Athenee.  You REALLY don't want to spend the big bucks to stay at The Chatwal.  You'll pay a Rolls-Royce price and get only Ford Pinto service and accommodations.  The Chatwal is a JOKE!","travelDate":"2013-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We always stay in a different luxury hotel (setai now langham last year - awesome). We chose the chatwal for sept 19 3 night weekend. Recent Starwood luxury collection stay was june family trip to Phoenician's canyon suites in Arizona (heavenly). The chatwal is for those who want to stay in a small (76 rooms) luxury boutique hotel AND want to be in Times Square. For us, neither worked. We had an executive studio which was 2 queen rooms joined by a small hall way. Overall 600 sq feet. One had a couch and chair while the other was the bedroom (queen bed). Each room was claustrophobic by our standards and very dark. We were on the 6th floor located on the east side of building. It was very quiet as opposed to being in the front though which was likely somewhat brighter. A larger hotel has very high floors which can give you more light if not a view! Each room had a bathroom which was unnecessary but nice to have. The heated toilet seat with electronic bidet was a novelty but not one I'd pay for. Asprey toiletries were very nice. The maid was still in our room twice when we returned by 2 pm after leaving for the day at 9 am. Not ideal but it happens. We never heard a peep from a personal butler. But we never asked For anything. \n\nA sole reason for us to not stay here again was the bed. Believe the reviews - it is a HARD short  mattress. Low profile box spring too so very close the floor. Some people like that. I assume the majority do not just like no one wants a super soft mattress. We have a westin heavenly bed at home. We couldn't wait to sleep on it again unlike so many vacations where you want to take the mattress with you. \n\nStaff were friendly albeit slightly standoffish unless approached. The entrance door is huge and very heavy; there is no one there to open it 50% of the time. This was very odd as an older or disabled person would never get in! We missed the lamb's club as it was closed Sunday after brunch when we wanted a drink. We met a friend in the lobby instead. $80 for 3 cocktails is pricey when you don't get any atmosphere! And there was so much ice in the drinks there were 4 sips with a straw then done! \n\nTimes Square is always very busy and there is construction on 7th and 44th. Also on 44th in front of hotel. Disaster for walking. You can stay at numerous luxury hotels within a few blocks so for us, no need to be literally on top of the craziness. \n\nWe will try luxury collection again, but will not choose the chatwal. For others, it will be just perfect. ","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Firstly, its location is unbeatable if you are visiting New York to see Broadway shows, or if you need to be near Times Square for any other reason.  It was such a nice feeling to walk a half a block off the insanity of Times Square and enter a relaxed, luxurious oasis.\n\nThe rooms are beautifully and tastefully decorated.  The entire hotel has the feel of a 1920's luxury art deco cruise ship or transcontinental train from a bygone era. This decor is artistically on display in the hotel restaurant, the Lamb's Club.  In fact, on a previous trip to the city, we stayed at a different hotel and ate at the Lamb's Club Sunday jazz brunch.  I loved the ambiance of the hotel so much we decided to stay here on our next trip to New York, which we did this past June.\n\nAlthough the hotel is beautiful, luxurious, comfortable, and well-located, I think the best thing about it is the A+++ service, which extends from the management down to the housekeepers.  Everyone we encountered was top notch.  Some specific things that I can mention, I have a lumbar disc herniation in my back and I need a really hard mattress.  I did not think to call ahead and request it, but I often need panels of hard wood placed under the mattress of the bed I sleep in.  On little notice, the hotel tracked down wood panels from another hotel and had them placed under my mattress.\n\nI was extremely impressed that the housekeeping staff somehow magically knew exactly when we left our room and had it cleaned from top to bottom even though our daily schedule varied .... sometimes we were out in the morning but in the room in the afternoon, and sometimes we did not leave the room until the afternoon.  nobody knocked on the door or bothered us to clean the room at a specific time to fit their schedule .... everything happened according to OUR schedule, without us even having to say a word or lift a finger. This hotel truly made is feel carefree and I imagine there was a lot of work behind the scenes to make sure our experience was as pleasant as possible.  \n\nWe enjoyed our experience so much, we have actually made reservations to return later this year, and next year in 2015 as well.

The Chatwal Hotel reminds of a few perfect small hotels I love in Paris like The Montaigne.\n\nHaving made the rounds this summer to no less than 17 hotels in Manhattan in the quest for the right one, The Chatwal Hotel now holds the title as reigning champion, for now at least. My #2 is the Greenwich Hotel followed by.. hold it, hold it..... The Andaz 5th Avenue (by Hyatt, believe it or not. Forget everything you dislike about Hyatt and go).\n\nWHAT I LOVED:  \n\n- Sort of art deco\/40's\/30's style but not kitschy in an historic building\n\n- Bespoke everything.  They invested serious coin in this place.  Serious, like SPG had something to prove.\n\n- The Lamb's Club restaurant and mezzanine bar - smoldering style in red, black and white.  Alive, little jazz singer thing going sometimes.  \n\n-My room was 206, Perfection and I don't toss that around because everyone knows what a pain I am about hotels. Trust me on this I am not going into detail.  OK, a little.  The closet and cabinetry are fashioned after handcrafted luggage, similar to a LV steamer trunk as a concept.  So original, solid. Sets the place apart from the rest.\n\n - Washroom par excellence.  Toto, massive shower.\n\n- I had the outdoor patio. Looks nice but the sound of the aircon equipment and faux plants make it well, tacky. The only thing I found out of place so don't pay extra for the terrace, I'm my opinion.\n\n- Staff - super attentive without being obsequies.  Cool and reserved in NYC way but friendly.\n\n- Breakast pastries that could put La Duree out of business.\n\nMerci Le Chatwal, je t'aime.

The location of the hotel couldnt be better, very Close to times Square and Walking distance to a lot of good restaurants and sightseeing (Lambs club restaurant is actually in the hotel so that couldnt be closer). The staff is very kind and eager to help. Everything from smaller requests to late check out. We stayed in a junior suit which had a large and comfortable bathroom with big shower (rain-shower) TV in the mirror (cool) and a toilet with \"special features\" (cleaning you for ex.;). The room itself has a special design to it with lots of grey earthy colours and formed almost like a hallway that at first didnt do me anything but when you sit in the other end of the room you get the feeling. I dont agree with a Review i read regarding bad beds cause i thought they were nice. Housekeeping came twice a day, once for cleaning and one more time to prepare the bed for sleeping and changing waterbottles etc. Thanks housekeeping, very satisfied. \nTwo requests were not fulfilled.. first we asked for a iphone charger and an adapter cause we couldnt find it in the room.

We arrived at the hotel at around 11am but since the check in time was 4pm and no room was available at the time we left our luggage at the hotel and the concierge offered to message us upon readying our room which was around 3pm.\n\nPros: The Room is really modern in design and the details are very well thought of. The entire room's controls i.e. lights, blinds, drapes, temperature etc. all can be accessed via the room telephone system. The Room has a nice mini bar and for backgammon fans they have the board game in the room. The in room safe is equipped with a nice jewellery box to use and they also provide a universal plug converter at $35 cost in the drawer.The bathroom is also really amazing with electronic WC in place and a glass TV in the back wall makes it look very modern. The towels and napkins are well folded in a big vanity suitcase under the sink which makes it look very luxurious. \nThe hotel is very located, as soon as you get out on your left you have times square and a 3-5 mins walk you are on 5th Ave.\nThe staff at the hotel was very helpful they offered us all the help we needed with directions, places to go and bus travel schedules. Every night they would provide weather forecast to plan the next day. Infact one of the days while leaving the hotel, doorman offered us a hotel umbrella suggesting it would rain (and it did!).\nThe hotel also provides a free wifi service which is brilliant.\n\nCons: The Rooms are very small. We had 5 suitcases with us and once they were all in the room, the room felt even smaller. The room we were given had a view of the backside of another building and the windows did not open (Felt like a brick wall in the face). One of the nights after a point for some reason our room felt really warm and claustrophobic even though the AC was running at full capacity, we asked the housekeeping to check but they said theres nothing that can be done about the cooling and we had to request a table fan in the room, which was a relief!\n\nFYI: I noticed the property is run by some company called the Adams group.\n\nOverall we had a pleasant stay and the location was simply amazing.","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The quintessential New Yorker.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2014-08-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"When my wife and I were invited to join a friend for his 40th birthday in New York I suggested my wife find a smaller hotel as we have stayed in many big properties that tend to exacerbate the impersonal rush and crush that is NYC.  So she found The Chatwal on W44th Street from amongst the many Starwood offerings and booked us in.  From the moment we arrived we were blown away by the Art Decor splendour, the warm reception, the attentive personnel from many differnt countries AND the fabulous room.  The attention to authentic detail and furnishings of the room not only looked wonderful, but were functional as well.  When our friends came in to join us for dinner, we showed them our room (showed it off!) and one of them described it as like being inside a Louis Vuitton trunk.  The room was fabulously appointed with plenty of towels and every kind of amenity.  The air worked great as did all the electronics, and the bed was comfy.  It was also pretty quiet give the room fronted the street.  (The electric self-opening curtains were out of action but that didn't matter).\nThe overtly groovy bathroom was a bit of an exercise in trying too hard at the trade-off of functionality and the vanity didn't work too well as the components lost their edge after use with water droplets, etc. and bench space at a premium  And whomever spec'd the electric opening, self-heating toilet suite has gone ridiculously over the top just for the sake of it.  But that really is just being picky in my part, just needed to be said as the funky reconstituted stone would have worked just as well with traditional cabinetry.\nThe first night we were in (pure luck) was jazz night in the mezzanine bar.  We chose to have a few drinks there and stayed on to dine-in and the tucker was outstanding.  We learned the chef of the adjoining Lamb's Club Restaurant was a part owner of the property.  (See following restaurant review).  I ordered Chef d'bouff which was cooked to perfection and sensational.  The giant cut of meat could have fed four!.  A terrific selection of wines by the glass is available, and we had much amusement from the antics of the poseur purportedly the sommelier poncing around and splashing wines into the same just emptied glass and then getting titchy when I requested a fresh glass.\nAlso, I asked the concierge where a restaurant in the neighbourhood we had been to a few years back was, and he had no idea.  I also asked where there was a handy newsstand to purchase some plain wrapping paper.  In both instances he was so totally addicted to Google to find an answer, which is not what you expect in a hotel of this calibre.  Good local knowledge goes a long way.  He couldn't find the restaurant at all, but that's okay.  I did.  It was a few doors just down the same street!\nWe enjoyed our few days in NYC which I reckon has softened off and gentrified a lot post-9\/11.  \nThe Chatwell was a lovely bolt hole to retreat to after our action filled days or shopping, being tourists, dining and rushing around.  It's in an awesome location, just a block & a half from Times Square, walking distance to Penn station & pretty well everything else.\nAs reader of my reviews will see, I am a seasoned traveller and don't do budget.  I look for comfort, experience and style and The Chatwell oozes these in spades.  So, I have held off writing this review as I am torn about getting The Chatwal get too popular as I am already looking for a reason to head back to the USA to stay there.","travelDate":"2014-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We decided to spend our wedding anniversary in NYC and have the ultimate culinary experience.  We stayed here last year and were treated so well we wanted to return.  I pulled out all the stops and reserved a one bedroom terrace suite -- yes, a terrace one block off of Times Square.\n\nOur experience started with valet parking which was flawless.  We were greeted in a friendly and efficient manner and escorted to our room.  Several minutes later there was a knock at the door and our butler Manpreet introduced himself and the services he could provide for our convenience.  Kudos to him.  The suite was spectacular.  The terrace was surrounded with tall buildings and a glimpse of the sky but it is Manhattan, after all.  The decor is original and stunning,  The rooms were flawless.  The location could not be improved on.  Service was gracious and attentive.  My wife travels with medication that needs to be refrigerated and they were able to accommodate our needs. I almost ranked the Chatwal 10 out of 10, but a little upset during a departing breakfast lowers them down to a 9.9 out of 10.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1641016,"title":"Art Deco Stunner in Midtown Manhattan","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2014-08-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Stepping off bustling 44th Street\u2014through the iron gates of the Chatwal\u2014equates to stepping back in time to the days of a bygone era.  I am far too young to understand what the 20\u2019s or 30\u2019s in New York felt like but, if the Chatwal is any indication, I sincerely hope modern science advances to make time travel a reality.  Indeed, Fitzgerald himself might have chosen to install his iconic protagonist in this hotel had The Great Gatsby been written less than a century later.\n\nThe main lobby is small, private, and exquisitely appointed.  From the very first moment one steps into the space, it becomes immediately evident that the owner\u2014Mr. Vikrum Chatwal\u2014spared no expense when restoring this New York icon.  The walls are paneled in birds eye wood; in the corners, iridescent, floor-to-ceiling columns of light are finished with chrome hardware that only enhances the art-deco theme.  The registration desk, concierge podium, and four-seat bar are finished similarly with sleek, chrome wrapped horizontally around the curved edges.  In the seating area, custom bench seating disappears into the contemporary wall mural while subtle touches of red\u2014namely, the supple leather chairs and crimson-rimmed, integrated chrome light fixtures\u2014give the otherwise drab room room a vibrant spark of colour.\n\nThe lobby is brought to life by a dedicated team of service professionals which includes a Les Clefs d\u2019Or concierge.  Same day tickets to the Book of Mormon, you ask?  How does center orchestra sound?  \n\nAt registration, Angela was an absolute delight.  Prior to my arrival, Axel Fisher, the hotel manager, ensured I receive a room with two beds despite the fact that I reserved a king room by accident.  The bellmen were prompt and courteous when needed, but never intrusive.   Sadly, the vast majority of my stay was ruined by rain but, when I needed to brave the elements, the bellmen were always out front with an umbrella ready and a taxi at the curb.  Last but certainly not least, Diane Elliott, the sales manager, is an absolute delight to work with.\n\nDuring my time at the Chatwal, I stayed in room 406, a \u2018Grand Deluxe Room with 2 Double Beds.\u2019  The walls are wrapped in elegant brown suede and contemporary espresso leather.  All of the furnishings were custom designed for the hotel and several pieces were designed to look like vintage Louis Vuitton luggage.  The beds\u2014custom, handmade mattresses that, I\u2019m sure, cost a bloody fortune\u2014were among the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever experienced in a hotel.  Paired with 400-thread-count sateen linens, it was hard to get up in the morning.  The bathroom was a sophisticated combination of espresso-colored quartz, mirrors, and colored glass.  I especially appreciated the generously-sized Asprey Purple Water amenities, powerful shower, and Toto toilet with an integrated bidet.  My favorite part of the room, though, had to be the closets.  Custom, oversized, solid wood cabinetry with heavy doors nearly a foot thick scream of quality and attention-to-detail.  Inside, the lime green hangers offer a whimsical touch.  The minibar, also contained in the closet, is well stocked.  Among its offerings, I was shocked to find playing cards, candles, a backgammon board, and candy cigarettes in addition to the normal offerings!  The room was not without fault, however.  There was no view (nor daylight) to speak of, the touch-screen control panel rarely worked and the sleek, stainless steel sink in the bathroom is utterly impractical.\n\nDirectly adjacent to the lobby, one enters the iconic Lamb\u2019s Club Restaurant.  Once the most prestigious theatre club in Manhattan, the now-public restaurant is sophisticated and, rather surprisingly, simple.  The walls and floors are painted black, so as not to distract from the centerpiece of the room: the original fireplace.  Opposite it, a large portrait of nameless faces\u2014presumably influential producers and actors far before my time\u2014is carried around the border of the room by individual portraits of the original Lamb\u2019s Club members.  The custom benches from the lobby can be found once more in the restaurant\u2014this time, finished in a bright red colour that lends an air of romance to the dark, intimate space.\n\nFood and beverage service, sadly, was hit-or-miss.  I thoroughly enjoyed all three breakfasts I had at the Lamb\u2019s Club without fault.  One evening, however, the dessert I ordered was substituted (without my consent, mind you) with an entirely different dessert that I did not like.  The waitress apologized but charged me for the replacement as if it was what I ordered.  Similarly, I ordered a club sandwich through in-room dining on a Sunday Afternoon.  The club sandwich was listed on the \u201call-day menu,\u201d but the person who took my order told me that the \u201call-day menu\u201d wasn\u2019t available on Sundays so I had to order something else.  In short, the culinary team needs to provide greater flexibility at a hotel of this caliber, especially for such basic requests as chocolate chip cookies and a club sandwich.\n\nMy favorite amenity is the basement-level Red Door Spa.  While I was sadly unable to get a spa appointment during my stay, I appreciated the modern fitness center and amazing current pool.  While small, the area is rarely used by other guests and is such a rarity in Manhattan!\n\nOverall, this Art Deco stunner is the best hotel I\u2019ve found in New York.  It\u2019s excellent location, lavishly-appointed accommodations, and impressive staff are among its most impressive attributes.  What I love most, however, is the fact that The Chatwal lets you forget that you are just one block from the epicenter of Times Square\u2014arguably, the world\u2019s largest, filthiest tourist trap\u2014by transporting you back to a far more sophisticated era!","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

By 3:30 we had not heard anything so we called and were told our room was ready.  When we returned we were greeted by name and they said \"we would like to upgrade you to a suite, but we see in our notes that you would like the front of the building and we do not have any available there, would you still be interested in a suite?\"  Mind?  Not at all!!!  The queen suite had two rooms and two bathrooms which made our trip even more enjoyable.  The rooms are exquisite.   If they moved, I would feel like I was on the Orient Express in the most expensive pullman car.   A throw back to a more elegant and gracious time and filled with almost every modern technology imaginable.  The hotel is particularly proud of the bathrooms and I won't ruin the surprises, but, let's just say dramatic and efficient .  You have read about the staff and it is all true.  Genuinely interested in your day, your preferences, and in making it the most pleasurable stay.  While we did not require the services of the butler, he was always available and it was always a pleasure to speak with him.\n\nThe Lamb's club-  We ate there on Friday before the theatre and took advantage of the 49$  for a 3 course pre-fixe.  Food was very good-excellent and enough variety and choices.\n\nBreakfast-  We ate in the bar\/mezzanine dining room both mornings as it was included in our package.  On both Saturday and Sunday starting at 11 am they had live music.  A Bossa Nova band on Saturday and a Jazz band on Sunday.  What a treat!!   Young and talented musicians played at just the right sound  level to enjoy but not to interfere with conversation.  We will definitely return.\n\nThe bar at night-- The bar mezzanine \nWe don't usually frequent the hotel bars, but this one was too good to pass up.  How dramatic it looked at night!   After the theatre when we stopped to have a drink and snacks. (lamb meatballs and fried risotto were perfect )   The only thing that would have been better would have been one of the bands there for listening\/dancing.  \n\nThe Con's-  Perhaps the only negative is some of the restaurant service.  Should be sharper.    In the Lambs club we were shown to our table in a half empty dining room at 6 pm that faced the rest room door.  When I asked for another table , the young hostess asked us to wait a moment and would see if she could make a change.  She did, she then offered us the table in the corner right next to the door that  opened to the restroom.  Really???  I finally pointed at several empty tables in the middle of the room and she acquiesced .  The young lady who removes the dirty dishes tried to take our food away before we were finished(yes, I do want those last few sips of the champagne  I ordered).  She did the same thing at breakfast.  We had to rescue our plates from her on several occasions.  Just ask and we will tell you if we are finished.   Yet, even these are small  annoyances .  The restaurant staff while not always efficient or experienced, was always pleasant.\n\nWill we return to the hotel?  Absolutely!","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The moment you step in, everyone, I mean every staff member greets you, smiles at you, and will do everything to help you.  \n\nI wanted 11 o'clock AM check in and get into a room right away.  Done.\n\nI wanted four tickets to Book of Mormons on the day of check-in.  Done (Concierge rocks !)  This play is nearly impossible to get good tickets for.  Concierge (Juan rocks !!) got me four tickets at printed ticket prices ($260) and saved me $400 per ticket handling fee.  We sat 5 rows from the stage, center row.  I had not been able to get Book of Mormon tickets the previous 5 visits to NY staying at other luxury hotels.  \n\nTwo weekends ago, I wanted 3 tickets to Lion King on the day after check-in.  Concierge told me that \"Right now, this morning, I know for fact that there are great seats still available for tomorrow afternoon's show.\"  He told me that instead of buying through outlet hadlers or via internet, just walk over to the box office \"right now\" and buy them at the printed ticket price.  I did, and he was right, and I got the tickets for great seats without any added fees.  They aim to please, and they did.\n\nWhen leaving, I wanted to check out, store my luggage, go out for shopping, then have the Valet bring out my SUV, and have the bell captain load the car with my luggage, waiting for me as I returned from shopping, so I could just hop in the car and leave without having to wait, wait, wait, etc. (Like most luxury hotels).   Done.  The bell captain (Michael) rocks !!  He did exactly as I had requested over the phone, working with the front desk to time my arrival from shopping.\n\nThe Mezzanine floor Bar is wonderful.  Great martinis and staff who treat you like a movie star in the 1950's.  \n\nAttention to details is excellent.  I stayed in Junior Suites, and those are good accommodations with wonderful refurbished rooms.  Everything works as they're supposed to.  \n\nThe Chatwal in terms of their attention to detail to physical appearance and their staff attention to our needs -- far exceeds the other luxury brands in the city.  \n\nYou know what I also liked about this hotel is that although the staff, the hotel, and the ambience is highly upscale, I felt perfectly comfortable walking around in my blue jeans and just a black t-shirt, \"street-casual.\"  Very low-key and yet impeccably tasteful, respectful, and attentive to my needs as a guest.\n\nIf you want a Fifth-Ave or a Time-Square New York Stay, this is the place.  Once you walk through the front door into the lobby, it's so, so quiet that you'd not know that you're 50 yards from Time Square.  Sitting in the bar upstairs, you'd think that you're in the Upper East near the Central Park.

I love the hotels, but they are mostly expensive because they are historic hotels in major metropolitan areas around the world. As a business woman, mom and grandmother who has flown more than 4 million miles teaching, I always try to spend my downtime dollars well. When I booked a night at the Chatwal last week it was at the end of a business meeting when my husband could join me to belatedly celebrate his 73rd birthday. The reviews ranged from perfect to problematic. Because I am a Lifetime Starwoods Platinum Member, I always receive great service at SPG hotels. This time the great service started even before I entered the hotel, before they even knew \"my status,\" which is the reason for this review. It shouldn't matter who you are and how often you stay, although those of use who've slept over 700 nights in hotels expect some extras. I exited my cab, exhausted, and left my expensive leather satchel with my passport, iPad and other valuables in the back seat--totally my fault!. I realized it when the doorman welcomed my husband and me to the hotel. Johan, a valet, immediately raced at top speed a long block down the street where the cab was waiting at a red light and retrieved it. Bystanders along the street clapped as he raced back and delivered it to me. \n\nSo here's the point about the Chatwal for other world travelers. This is a boutique hotel that has a great staff, luxury amenities and an outstanding restaurant, The Lamb's Club, where we dined that night. John, our head waiter, served a truly memorable meal and I, like many travelers who eat abroad and in great US restaurants, am choosey! \n\nIn my opinion, the hotel's marketing challenge is the number of rooms and their size. I booked a junior suite. The hotel was booked full, so no upgrade, although I asked. My room was expensive, of course. (It is New York City and in walking distance of Broadway.) For frequent business travelers accustomed to booking large rooms in modern luxury hotels around the world, the comfort is here, ensuite bathrooms are the best, but the size of the room may be smaller, from another century actually, when renowned architect Stanford White designed the structure. When you choose this hotel, choose it for the staff, the restaurant, and the location. I needed a spa treatment, but had no time. The luxurious Red Door Spa is highly touted by my colleagues and fellow travelers. Next time!","travelDate":"2014-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

In a word, WOW!! We stayed at the Chatwal for four days and we were absolutely blown away. \n\nAs soon as we entered the beautiful art deco building we were greeted warmly by the front desk and were checked in and in our room within a couple of minutes. Literally two minutes was all it took. \n\nThe room, my word, I've been in some fantastic hotel suites but nothing that had the character of the Chatwal. The suede(i think?) walls with the fantastic light fixtures made it feel very 1920's luxe but it had just about every single modern creature comfort one could ask for as well. The amenities were thoughtfully set up. I especially loved the touch of adding a backgammon set in the room. \n\nOnce we were in the room; we freshened up, and were greeted by Manpreet, who got us started with a fantastic breakfast and made plans with us for the rest of our stay. We had been traveling for a while and were craving Indian food for lunch. He went above and beyond by not only making reservations at the restaurant but also accompanied us there to make sure we were comfortable. He even arranged a special evening \"chai\" with \"chaat\" in the room of his own accord (because we told him how much we missed Indian food). We even entertained some friends one evening and all of the arrangements for dinner to be served in the room were taken care of by Manpreet with absolutely no effort on our end. \n\nI think the thing that struck me the most, was the staff. As an example of the exemplary service, we were on our way out one time an Juan Franco, the doorman, actually looked up the weather forecast and suggested we carry an umbrella with us. Not only that, he actually went in and got us a couple of umbrellas for us. Sure enough it did rain a little later. \n\nI can be quite a demanding guest and the Chatwal and Manpreet shone through every time. One example was when I went clubbing with friends. We got to the club and found a massive queue of people waiting to get in. I called him up and he had us walk in right to the front of the line. Which is near about impossible to do in a city you're visiting for four days and dont have your connections in place yet.\n\nThe lambs club. I really should do a proper review of the place by itself but that is probably for another time. Suffice it to say, MIND = BLOWN. It really was pretty special. \n\nOverall, On my first visit to New York, I fell in love with the city. I felt I was a part of the city mainly because the people at the Chatwal made me feel at home.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

That being said, we decided to do something very special for our 30th anniversary. We have always wanted to go to New York and see a Broadway show, so we decided to spend 5 nights in the Theater District and chose The Chatwal for our accommodations. We could not have been happier with our choice! This place was absolutely amazing and the staff (especially the head Butler, Bernard) were wonderful. Expect to pay top dollar, but what you get is worth every penny. This place is perfectly settled close to Times Square, the major theaters, and the subway. We could not have picked a better \"home-base\" for our trip. We either walked or rode the subway to everything we wanted to do and see. Rooms were small but comfy, the bed was firm and with a few extra pillows, we slept like babies. The greatest thing (not kidding) was the bathroom!! What luxury. The \"rain shower\" was the perfect solution to a long day of touring and the bidet was incredible. Never used one before, but now have one on order with Amazon! All in all, this was the nicest trip my wife and I have ever been on. Perfect city, perfect weather and perfect hotel. This will be the only place we will stay when we come back. Thank you all at The Chatwal from Chris and Leslie","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I am happy to report that it was even better. We had a delay getting in to our room (although it wasn't check-in time) but we were given the option of waiting for an upgrade or taking a standard room that was ready. We opted to wait and walked to Bryant Park (2 blocks from the hotel) for some people watching. Our upgrade to a King Deluxe room was well worth the wait. The room was spacious with a walk in closet, 2 floor to ceiling windows, a sofa and reading chair. The Frette linens are top of the line as are the Asprey  products. But more importantly, the staff is warm and welcoming and helpful. The waiters, bar tenders, front desk personnel, butlers... everyone! The hotel is centrally located and it is an easy walk to Rockefeller Center and to Broadway, Fifth Avenue, etc. It is small, impeccably clean and well maintained. We can't imagine staying anywhere else on our visits to New York. We look forward to our next visit with pleasure.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From Catalina at the front desk to Pierre and Juan at the Concierge stand to Mumfree and Brandon our butlers the people cannot be more welcoming. \nI love the decor here - it's so deco-modern. The rooms have everything you need, bed is fantastic and some grooms have a terrace. The particular one we had had a large terrace overlooking 44th. It was a bit too cold to fully enjoy but with better weather room service can be taken there or one could host a small get tighter before or after dinner or a show. The only negative of this particular room (the suites all have 2 bathrooms) is that there is only 1 sink in the bathroom. \nSpeaking of room service we only had breakfast but the food is always excellent. \nThe workout room is small but any workout app that can give you a routine with dumbbells a bench and treadmill will help you through it. There is an excellent Elizabeth Arden Re Door Spa and I always get a manicure-pedicure when here.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was kept waiting for a long time while in line. That said, the room was excellent with great amenities and built in closets. This is not your standard hotel room. The bar was also very interesting with live jazz musicians. If you want a smaller hotel in the SPG chain near broadway, and don't mind paying more, this is the place for you.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Unfortunately, it has failed to live up to the luxury brand. Every room in the hotel is supposed to have a butler service but my butler never showed up to introduce him\/her self. Not that I needed one but my understanding of the butler service offered by some of the higher end Starwood hotels is the personal touch which Chatwal did not deliver. Swimming pool was out of service and front desk had to clue when it will be back in service. I had to go down to the gym to check it out myself.\n\nAlso, I booked a room with queen sized bed but received a room with two double sized bed. I did not go back to check-in to argue as it was late but that's in my view not acceptable for a luxury hotel at $500 a night.","travelDate":"2014-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
