The hotel is in a great location, located right in the heart of Times Square.  The theaters, Rockefeller center, etc. are all within walking distance.\nThe checkin is on the first floor, which is small and dark, so not a good first impression or initial \"wow' factor when entering.  The bellmen are very nice, and will hold your luggage, etc.  You have to take the elevator to the lobby, which includes a great restaurant (glass walls with surrounding views of Times Square).  The food was very good, including the breakfast buffet.  The restaurant (R lounge) is pretty small, so make a reservation for a dinner table, especially during the holidays.  The breakfast buffet is also at the R lounge, and there can be quite a wait, especially after 8-8:30 in the morning.  There is a bar, with good drinks and service.  Other than the room coffee maker, there is no where in the hotel that serves coffee.  It would have been nice to have a coffee\/beverage service area in the lobby.  There is a Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, and Duncan within one block of the hotel however.  \nThe hotel was clean and decorated very nicely.  The rooms are large for NYC standard (300 sq feet).  We had a \"king\" room with a chaise lounge (advertised as \"sleeps 3\").  You really cannot use the chaise lounge as a bed (more like a \"toddler\" bed).  They did offer to bring up a rollaway bed, but my child and I just ended up sleeping in the \"king\" bed   The king bed is more the size of a small queen however, FYI.  The housekeeping was good, and we had no room issues.  All elevators were working, and arrived in a timely manner.  We were on the 20th floor, with a full view of Times Square down below.  Although it is right on Times Square, the sound proofing was pretty good.\nThe location is fantastic.  There is a subway stop \"yellow line\" right outside the hotel entrance.  Although I was apprehensive initially, it was very easy to use the subway.  The stop right outside the hotel goes to the Oculus, 911, Statue of Liberty ferry, Union square, Soho (Prince street subway stop), Brooklyn, etc.  You can now use a credit card, which made it very easy.  Central Park is about 6 blocks away also, with the museums about 2 miles from the hotel.  We also walked to Grand Central Station and the Bryant Park area.  Bryant Park was ok, but we much preferred the Union Station market and shopping area.\nThe location is also perfect if planning on going to the shows.  The \"TKTS\" discounted ticket booth is right next to the hotel.  We saw two shows, and purchased really, really good seats, at a significantly discounted price at the TKTS booth.\nThe location really made it easy to enjoy all of the NYC activities.  It is a solid 4-star NYC hotel with very friendly staff.  You will walk out into the heart of Times Square, right into the hustle and bustle of NYC.  If you are looking for lodging on a quiet street, may want to look elsewhere.\np.s. the Hershey store is right across the street, highly recommend one of their loaded milkshakes and tollhouse cookie sundae.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

It will be noisy from outside activities like sirens because of the city life but I expect that must be true of most hotels in NYC.

We were so disappointed that this could happen in a so called 4 star hotel that was still advertising the bar on their website. There was an apology, but that was it ... no offer to compensate for the loss of service or offer any alternative. It was bad!!! On top of no bar seevice they did not even have a proper coffee machine to offer latte or capacchino. Again, very poor.\nSecondly, the lifts were really slow, and sometimes only 1 out of 3 seemed to work.

We returned to the Hotel lobby, this was small and dark, however, 2 floors up via a lift was the actual lobby. Here you could find the bar and restaurant and it was light and roomy. You also got the lifts to your room from here. We inquired about when our room would be ready and was told someone would be up to the lobby to let us know and give us our room key. We managed to check into the room just after 4pm. We chose a Terrace Room, what we did not know was that each 'Terrace' room had a different sized terrace, we drew the short straw and got a small balcony that could just about fit 2 chairs. I was also a little concerned about the state of the artificial grass, it wasn't the cleanest. Still, the room was large for NY and the bed very comfortable. The shower was great and our room was cleaned to a good standard each day.  The gym is good, there are towels and cold water available.

Not noisy at all, great views on Times Square billboards. Plenty of space in the room for 3 people and very clean.\nWe were celebrating 2 birthdays which I had flagged in advance and they put balloons and cake in our room, very thoughtful and greatly appreciated.\n\nVery central location. Subway station outside the hotel which was really handy (we managed to get directly from there to Battery Park\/ferry for Statue of Liberty in about 15 minutes).\nGreat lobby area and bar\/restaurant. \nWe had breakfast at the hotel most days and used our daily 30 USD credit.\nStaff in the restaurant were efficient and polite although at times we felt a little bit rushed to leave. Small buffet at breakfast but with different options each day and all the basics available (sausages\/eggs\/bacon\/waffles\/fruits\/bagels etc)\nDiner menu is a little bit limited but the quality of the food was good.\n\nOmar the concierge was absolutely wonderful and we regretted not having met him on our first day. He was so helpful and gave us lots of good tips and advice. \n\nOn our last day we left our suitcases at the hotel after we checked out for a few hours. Gregory got us a taxi right outside the hotel when we were ready to leave for the airport, no need to pre book.\n\nThe only negatives : the reception downstairs is very small and unassuming. \nA bit awkward to have to get 2 lifts (1 from reception to the main lobby and from lobby to the bedrooms).\nBathroom a bit tired (musty smell, and shower pipe worn and kind of falling apart, we had to get that fixed during our stay).\n\nAll in all a great stay and my daughter wants to return to Renaissance next time we are back in NYC!!","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"NONE"}

It is crowded, loud, dirty, and the novelty wears off very quickly.  You'll enjoy your trip more if you stay in Chelsea, SoHo, Gramercy, etc., even if you are, say, spending a lot of time near the Broadway theaters.  That said, we stayed in Times Square just to \"say we did it,\" and the Renaissance was decent.  \n\nPros:\n- Room was relatively large by NYC standards\n- Housekeeping was great; daily service, plenty of towels\n- Good location from a public transit perspective--i.e., close to almost all major subway lines\n- Room had a modern feel and seemed remodeled recently-ish\n- Good value (by NYC standards)\n- The $30 a day resort fee does effectively get credited back to you through meal credits, tickets to attractions, etc.\n- Close to a lot of cheesy Times Square attractions, which your kids might enjoy\n\nCons:\n- No bathtub in our unit (showers only)\n- Annoyingly have to take two elevators to get to street level.  Street level lobby is very small.\n- If you are on lower floors (i.e., 14 and below), you will hear the din from Times Square  \n- Restaurant is mediocre, and the staff pretty indifferent to your presence.  \n- Agree with other reviewers that the pillows are terrible \n- The first floor and second floor lobbies seem a little tired\n- Traffic (pedestrian and vehicular) is terrible in this area ","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It's steps away from Times Square, a subway stop is right outside the entrance, and cabs are constantly coming down 7th Avenue. Every staff member we encountered was super nice. The vibe is very zen and whimsical thanks to the appearance of dozens of sheep, both 2-D and 3-D.  And our room was pretty comfortable despite facing the street. Blackout curtains kept the glow of huge TV screens outside at bay, and things quiet down nicely at night, so the lack of sound-proof windows was never an issue for us.\n\nI have two critiques. First, the pillows were terrible. Both the feather and non-allergenic pillows collapsed to the thickness of a pancake when I put my head down, even when stacking them. I fell asleep eventually, but each morning I woke up with a stiff neck and shoulders. Also, the breakfast is okay but overpriced. It's a buffet with an outstanding view of Times Square for those who get a seat facing that direction.

You can come out the front door, turn left on 7th Ave and be out of Times Square in a block or so.  There are numerous subway stations close by, but I was counciled by my NYC friends not to ride the subway.  Right or wrong I took their advice but Ubers & taxi's added up.  \nChecked in at 2:30 and asked if I wanted high floor or low and opted for high, so FDA told me she had 2 bed room on 19th floor.  Fine, just me but 2 beds is ok, some place to put some of my crap.  I think they were 2 doubles rather than 2 queens.\nShe explained the \u201cdestination fee\u201d (see photo), which I hate but actually provides some value.  I used the F&B credit every day and actually used the free Guggenheim ticket.  \nBreakfast is provided during the week in the restaurant\/lounge and was a decent buffet. You can get coffee and water there too.  I also got vouchers for a free appetizer for 3 of the 5 nights from a limited list that included cheesecake, pizza, pretzel and salad.   I got the cheesecake 2 nights and took to my room for a late dessert.  \nOn Saturday morning I had breakfast at Junior's a block away on 49th (not the one by the Marquis).  Sunday I just got a muffin from the little bakery next door.  \nI am Titanium, no upgrade unless the upper floor is an upgrade.  Not a big deal, room was good and spacious by NY standards and had a view of the Edition across the street and some of the TS signs. It was not totally quiet of course but the noise didn't bother me too much and was mostly muted.  Those who are sensitive to noise would be better off elsewhere or bring earplugs. \nThe room had a safe, fridge, standard Marriott coffemaker and desk.  Bathroom was a decent size and had a tub.  I prefer no tub, but it was ok.  Housekeeping was done daily.  I think the rooms could use a refurbishment but they were clean and everything worked and there were not signs of extensive wear.  \nThe only issue I had was the safe didn't work because the battery was low.  I called the front desk and within 10 minutes maintenance and security were there to fix it.  \nThe highlight for me was the bar and particularly the bartenders.  Raffie, Atikul and one other gentleman who's name I missed were great.  Very nice and super service.  I will also all staff members  I encountered were pleasant and helpful.  \nIf you want a decent hotel and don't mind a busy location at a reasonable rate I'd recommend this place.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

The location and view of times square can't be beat.  It is a small hotel and the staff were nice and professional.. The display easel outside of the lobby elevators that listed the month's events had the month of November on there for our stay from dec 3rd thru 5th.  Not a good first impression.. We are a family of 3 with an early 20s adult daughter and decided upon the terrace room on floor 4. The room was very small and frankly not suitable for 3 adults. There was a small chaisse type thing that the 3rd person was to sleep on that was hard as a rock. No bueno for $800 + a night. The pictures on the site are deceiving for this room. We would up having to.purchase a 2nd room for $1200.. It is an updated room but the sink is in the room next to the bed and not in the room with the shower and toilet. The shower room had no exhaust fan.. There are no dressers to store clothes and very small area to hang clothes. Very disappointed in the room. The lounge was very small and crowded. Breakfast buffet was meh and at $30 per expected more. We were billed $12 for 2 bottles of Evian water in our room despite not touching them.  We.wont return to the Renaissance.

Check in was great and Louis was very friendly and made us feel welcome. Not a major problem but my Daughters hideaway bed wasn\u2019t in our room before arrival which was odd as booking clearly stated 2 adults & a child, however Louis promised it would be done pronto and it was.  I do feel though that rather than add an extra bed to the room the sofa could have been converted into a bed to save space. We were visiting from the UK to celebrate my 50th birthday so it was lovely to check into our room and be greeted with balloons, wine & chocolates compliments of the hotel. We were on the 11th floor looking out over the Morgan Stanley billboard. Some faint noise could be heard but not enough to interfere with sleep. Omar on the concierge team was fab. Always greeted you with a smile and more than happy to help in anyway he could. The restaurant has fab views of Times Square. We had breakfast at the hotel which was basic but plentiful. We also had dinner one night which was good. Our waitress was lovely but didn\u2019t get her name. She highly recommended the new cocktail, R Blossom and after tasting I can also highly recommend!!! Overall we enjoyed our stay and think the hotel is ideally situated for walking uptown to Central Park & downtown to approx Madison Square Garden area. The hotel is not dirty as others mention (I\u2019m a complete neat freak & germaphobe) and did not get any sense of poor hygiene or lack of cleaning. However, the hotel overall is perhaps a little tired in places and maybe due a freshen up but this did not distract from us enjoying our stay and we would definitely recommend this hotel and return for another visit.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This hotel might be for you if you don\u2019t mind bright lights in your windows or loud noises from the busy Times Square area. \n\nMy 2 star review comes for other reasons:\n- Our room 1602 was very loud at night with Times Square street sounds (cars revving engines at all hours, music, & garbage trucks)\n- You have to take an elevator to the lobby the transfer from there to the elevators up to your room. We waited for 10-15 min for elevators upon arrival because not all of their 3 elevators were operating. We waited for these elevators almost every time we went up to our room\n- The last two nights people beside us were slamming their doors until at least 1:45am. They had a screaming kid that we could easily hear through the walls. We called the front desk who sent up security. That did not solve the noise issue. We called the front desk a second time, and they offered to send security up again (at 1:45am) but said they could not switch our room bc the hotel was fully booked. We had to wake up at 4:30 to make it to the airport, so that was a torturous night. We paid a lot to stay here for an overall poor experience, and we are shocked the hotel did not offer to provide some type of reimbursement. \n\nTo be honest the sleeping here was miserable.

It is a real pain to then have to take an elevator down to the lobby and then another down to the front desk on street level.  It is also listed in our profile to be away from elevators and vending and yet they put us next to noisy housekeeping room.  They were in and out of that room early in the morning slamming the door each time. There was also no do not disturb sign on the inside of the door. I asked 3 times for one and they said they would bring it but never did.  On three mornings we had knocks on the door from housekeeping waking us up.  \n\nFinally, you have a bar and restaurant and it\u2019s not open past 10 pm most nights. You are a large full service hotel but when one wants to come back to the hotel for a late night snack or beverage you are closed way past when shows let out.  \n\nThe hotel is not what it use to be and I think it\u2019s time to look for a different Marriott property that is more focused on the guest.  Despite the great location and previous stays, something has changed with this property.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I visited the hotel this last week and I was so disappointed. The staff was friendly but the room they originally put us in didn't have a working toilet and the sink was stopped up. The room was also not clean and dusty. I called the front desk and was moved to a different room which was almost better but wasn't clean. In the room you could see dust everywhere, the shower was questionable. The following morning I notified the front desk of the cleanliness of the room. We were gone for hours touring the city to return with the room being clean but not what you would expect. Also, this hotel has two levels to get to the rooms. The first set elevators are on the first floor near the street then you take elevators up to the lobby. Only two elevators were operating and both kept breaking down. Someone became trapped in one and the fire dept was called.  I have always loved this hotel for the location and quick access to the subways, Broadway shows but this stay wasn't worth the money. The hotel needs serious renovation. When you are taking a shower and take a glance up and the top of the shower you can see the extreme wear and tear on the hotel. I  did like the concierge desk they were helpful and staff was friendly but the hotel needs some serious work and better cleaning services. ","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

We didn't mind the rallies -- it is part of staying in Times Square.\n\nFor the special weekend, we booked a suite. Concierge did help me with a treat bag and a few balloons to surprise my son -- I appreciated that!  The suite itself was underwhelming and really dark. The depressing lights in the living room either were broken or the room was meant to be that dark because it was just gray and totally drab.  Time for a LED upgrade perhaps??  Furnishing was quite dated as well, same with the bathrooms.  \n\nThe breakfasts were at the R Lounge and that perhaps was the best part of the stay. Options were plenty but the gorgeous view made everything taste good, and breakfast worth waking up for!  We also made a point to grab drinks daily at the R Lounge for the view!

Of course, I didn\u2019t expect them to award me Platinum benefits until my elite nights posted, but Michelle was nice enough to offer us 4pm check out since we had a late flight home from New York and upgraded us to a high floor room with a better view, which was greatly appreciated.\n\nOn the morning of check-in, my elite nights from my Paris stays had posted and I was at 47 nights. I contacted the hotel via chat to ask if I could receive Platinum benefits since I would hit night 50 during my stay and they said they would be \u201cdelighted\u201d to honor the benefits, which included breakfast in the lounge.\n\nOur midnight check-in went smoothly and me hitting Platinum status was acknowledged, and the front desk agent (I believe Valentina) was very welcoming and gave us all the information we needed for our stay. \n\nThe room was very nice. It wasn't the best view because of so much construction on that block, but it was a nice room with good amenities and very clean. Bed must have been comfortable because we had no trouble sleeping. I also appreciated the free Evian water bottles each day as a Platinum guest. \n\nThe views of the Times Square breakfast lounge were quite amazing\u2014they really have prime real estate and it was breathtaking. The breakfast food itself wasn't incredible, but it was decent enough and together with the views it motivated us enough to go down to have breakfast every morning. They had hot options like sausage biscuits or breakfast burritos and fried sweet potatoes, along with fruit bowls, yogurt, pastries, coffee, and juice. I expect food options may have been better pre-covid, but I wasn't complaining because I was just happy to be granted the free breakfast Platinum benefit.\n\nHowever, the level of service I received before the end of my stay really helped ensure our visit was memorable and will certainly have me more loyal to this hotel if I stay in Times Square again. In the middle of my stay, to my surprise, room service delivered a letter, a bottle of prosecco, and a small box of chocolates to my room. It was a very sweet letter from Michelle giving me an early congratulations on hitting Platinum status! It was very much appreciated being acknowledged for my loyalty and definitely makes me happy that I chose this hotel for our short stay in New York!\n\nThank you again for your amazing hospitality Michelle, and thank you to the Renaissance team for a great stay!","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Kind, respectful, patient, accommodating, and thoughtful - this employee is a true gem. He deserves a bonus!","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The bathroom was extremely clean with a modern design and  Aveda toiletry products (my favorite). They do not have parking, but we were given directions to a parking garage that offered discounted parking.

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":93534,"title":"Location is great","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-10-25","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Just returned from 3 nights at the Renaissance.  I'm a frequent traveler to NYC.  Prior to the pandemic I was visiting 6 or 7 times a year.  I usually stay at a hotel few blocks down 48th but it has not yet opened back up so I chose the Renaissance based on location.  I found things I  liked and things that really bothered me about the hotel.  First what I liked.  The location was great, 2 subway stations within 2 blocks and a short walk to the 42nd st station where you can get a train to almost anywhere.  The only downside to the location was that even though I was on the 19th floor it was very noisy as the hotel is in the midst of Times Square. The employees I encountered were all very friendly and accommodating.  I liked the fact that the Bonvoy app on my phone told me when my room was ready for check in  (it was available early which was great because i had an early flight in) and I was able to use it as a key to my room.  \nNow the things I didn't care for so much.  The whole vibe of the hotel was very dark.  Dark elevators, the decor of the rooms was very dark with gray walls and the lighting in rooms was dark.  The only overhead light was in the entrance to the room.  In the room itself were light fixtures that did not give off much light, maybe this wouldn't bother some people but it really bothered me, so much so that I would probably not stay here again because I did not enjoy this at all.  The bathroom was much brighter and I thought the mirror was very cool with the skyline of the city on it.  The restaurants were not open but I understand the reason for this and there are enough places to get food in the area so this was not a big deal.  I found it odd that there was no pen and pad in the room.  Once again this is not a big deal but I am used to having this amenity in a hotel, luckily I had a scratch pad and pen with me but it just seemed odd that a hotel of this caliber did not provide this.  The thing that bothered me most, although luckily it wasn't an issue due to the help of the front desk clerk, was the fact that at this time they are not holding luggage.  I guess I understand why they are not during this time but I am very surprised I did not find out they were not doing this until I came down the day I was checking out to ask where to bring my luggage as I would not be departing the city until late in the afternoon and check out time was noon.  I have never stayed in a hotel that does not check luggage and if they are not doing so I believe they should have communicated that.  As I said the front desk took care of the situation and was kind enough to allow me to have a late check out and leave my luggage in my room.  If he had not done this I don't know what I would have done.  I had plans for the day before leaving the city and bringing my luggage with me wasn't a possibility.  Lack of communication of this policy was the problem.  Had I known in advance I probably would have looked at other choices of hotels that allowed for this.  All in all I had a good stay but was not comfortable in the room as it was too dark for me.","travelDate":"2020-10","tripType":"NONE"}

If you don't care about the Time Square feel than this is not the location for you. There are lots of other options for you to get the New York feel. So only book this this is the place you want to be. \n\nThe good:\n- The room is larger than some Time square hotel. \n- The hotel lobby and check in is on first floor (not all hotel are like this in NYC)\n- Service is great \n- The breakfast room look onto the middle of Time Square, try to go early so you can sit by the window. For me this is the reason I stay here, enjoying a quite breakfast while over looking time square getting ready. From what I am told on New Years eve, the table by the window cost over $20k USD as it look directly at where the ball drops. \n\nThe not so good\n- When I was there... the restaurant was not open for lunch. \n\nOverall I would stay here again just to have the view for breakfast and be in dead center of Time Sq.

I can\u2019t imagine how much fun these rooms would be for the NYE holiday and when the world is normal again. The hotel was very clean and the front desk lady, I believe the manager on duty, and the security guard always made us feel safe and welcomed.

Kudos to Christopher for going the extra mile to quickly recognize me as a Platinum member and locate us a room within the hour. Christopher should be commended for making my first impression of the hotel which was negative and turn my experience into a very positive stay. Christopher is someone who provides the highest standard of customer service and treats you like family. The room was on the 17th floor and was extremely clean, comfortable and large by NYC standards. Even though it is located in the heart of Times Square, we never heard any noise. The location of the hotel is excellent and you can walk to Broadway shows and wonderful restaurants. The hotel was at full capacity but the elevators were always fast with no delays. Beautifully decorated hotel for Christmas. Bed and pillows were very comfortable, bathroom spacious and blackout curtains to ensure all the Times Square lights were blocked out for a good nights rest. I also want to give James a huge shout out for helping us with our luggage and getting us a cab. James is such a nice customer service oriented employee.

We planned staying the entire time we were in New York here, given my status and some reviews online I figured the hotel was a reasonable option over 4th of July.  Boy was I wrong.\nI attribute this hotel as a hybrid between a motel 6 and a run down Sheraton.  \nCheck-in: The process was rather terrible in the cramped lobby entrance and no recognition for status...  Ok, thats fine.\nRoom: The room was run down and looks like they paid a designer money to try and make it seem \"hip\" - new flash it isn't\nAmenities: Their lounge service is a drink coupon which covers absolutely nothing, quite disappointing\n\nNow on to the terrible parts - after the first night I came back to the room around 4pm and found that the room was well over the set limit (at 77 degreed) and it was climbing.  I dropped the set point which basically rendered the room an oven. Called the front desk who told me that is how hotels in NYC are (complete bull) but that they would send someone to check the room.  I get a knock on the door and there is a man holding a fan.  That was the solution to this problem, a FAN?  It was almost 80 at this point and it was only going to get warmer.  Side note: the hallways and lobby were also VERY warm, I think their AC went down and they refused to say anything.\n\nI called the front desk again this time speaking to a very nice woman who said she was the manager.  She basically told me they were sold out and that I was stuck in the room I was in.  I politely asked her to let me out of my reservation ASAP and I would find a hotel with suitable AC.  She did.  When I went downstairs to checkout we conversed and she apologized for the issues, etc etc. especially with my status and that she would deposit 45k points in my account as compensation for my troubles.  \n\nIts been 6 months I never saw the points and well frankly I never really got anything other than a crapy experience in NYC.  \nI moved to the Edition across the street and my stay in NYC was amazing as a result.  \n\nI caution you with this hotel, given it's location they care very little about anything.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"NONE"}

I had a room with two doubles, not ideal but certainly not a problem.  The beds themselves are comfortable, but the sheets could use an upgrade \u2013 they are a bit rough.  I actually gave myself a \u201crug burn\u201d on my elbow after rolling over in the night.  There are USB and AC plugs on the nightstands, plus an enormous TV that has a Netflix and Hulu option. There is a standard mini-fridge and closet, and the work area is adequate with a built-in luggage rack as part of the desk itself, which I really like.  Bathrooms are decent with plenty of counter space and a large tub\/shower combo, however the plumbing could use some work.  My showerhead was coming out of the wall (loosely), the faucet was clunky and the sink drain was very slow.  It\u2019s just not a good experience for the traveler and not up to par for the Renaissance brand.\n\nLOCATION\nI have mixed feelings about hotels in Times Square.  On one hand, the location is convenient for walking to several areas of Manhattan.  On the other, if you are on the Square side of the hotel, even with blackout shades, the monstrous lights on the buildings outside will creep into your room all night long.  You also have the problem of the solicitors and hecklers that are common in this area, so forget about walking in peace at certain times of the day, not to mention the immediate area has touristy, average-to-worse restaurant options.  Fortunately, it\u2019s Manhattan and walking makes a lot of sense, so there are more options not far away.\n\nSERVICE\nThis hotel had average service \u2013 front desk was nice and friendly, plus helpful.  I didn\u2019t notice anything special, though.  It should meet expectations.\n\nAMENITIES\nThere is a spa onsite as well as a fitness center, and the latter is certainly not bad.  It has a pulley station, dumbbells and benches, plus the usual compliment of cardio machines.  It also has kettlebells up to 45 lbs \/ 20 kg, which is always nice to see in a hotel.  The ceilings are also not low, which is common in urban hotels that I\u2019ve seen, so another added bonus.\n\nOVERALL\nWhile the hotel itself is nice, it\u2019s not overly so, and it has a few peculiarities, such as the elevator system.  From the lobby (which is tiny), you take an elevator up one level to what appears to be a full restaurant, then walk across a hall to get in another elevator that services all floors.  The location isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s not terrible.  There are aspects of the rooms that I like but others I didn\u2019t.  With so many other options in NYC, it will be a bit tough to get me to stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Room was surprisingly large with good lighting and a comfortable bed and good quality bathroom\/shower.  \n\nI had only two negative experiences:\n\n1.  I really don't like the automatic-off bathroom lights.  Not clear on what the timing is (no feedback, but clearly went off in less than 30 min).  I have no problem with visible timers, or with a card slot by the door for overall power control, but simply do not like automatic lights that go out without feedback or warning.  \n\n2.  I had the unfortunate sense of being cheated the entire time I was in the hotel.  I was there as part of a group, and had been warned that there was a $30 \"destination charge\" that was part of our rate, and that we'd get $30 each day worth of food\/drink if we used it.  I don't like these fees (does _anybody_?), but what was really troubling was how opaque it was and how it seemed they were trying to hide this (when checking in, I had to ask about it) and frankly cheat on it (when I did buy a cheese plate at the bar, it was charged to my credit card right away, and I had to deal with it at check-out; and it seems they were trying to double-charge sales tax, both on the destination charge and the food itself).  Similarly, they use obscure wording to make it less-than-clear on the water bottles in the room that they are included in the fee.  No one piece of this was hard to solve, but when you're paying several hundred a night for a room, it should come without the feeling of being nickel and dimed!","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Someone also removed $125 of cash from her purse wallet which was in the bathroom.\nWe reported to hotel management, and security came to \u201cmake a report\u201d.  When the security guard came to us he was acting as if we were an inconvenience to him. \nThen we get a call on Monday from \u201ccorporate claims\u201d and they advise that they did not find the money. Of course they didn\u2019t find the money because one of your staff members stole it. No call back from the direct management at the hotel to apologize or advise what they did to attempt to look into the matter. Absolutely horrendous customer service from Renaissance.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Da in der Stadt bekannterma\u00dfen der Durchlauf an Touristen riesig ist, sind die Hotels in k\u00fcrzester Zeit abgewohnt und dann auch noch teuer! Der Ausflug war nicht geplant, da uns aber das Erdbeben in Kalifornien zu einer Plan\u00e4nderung zwang, ist NY immer unsere Zuflucht wenn es irgendwo nicht so gut ist. Das Renaissance stand schon lange auf meiner Wunschliste aber bisher war es immer sehr teuer. So kurzfristig hatten wir Gl\u00fcck und haben eine super Rate bekommen. Dazu stand auf der Marriott Seite das es gerade frisch renoviert wurde. Als Bonvoy Member konnten wir einen Early Check in bekommen. Die Zimmer sind recht dunkel, sehr modern eingerichtet aber halt dunkel. Es ist alles da was man braucht, Kaffee Maschine, K\u00fchlschrank, ordentliches Badezimmer mit sehr gro\u00dfer Dusche. Auch die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Zimmer ist f\u00fcr NY Verh\u00e4ltnisse extrem gro\u00df. Es gibt einen Ottomanen am Fenster von dem man wunderbar das Treiben auf den Stra\u00dfen beobachten kann. Die Lage k\u00f6nnte nicht besser sein. Was ich auch super finde, mittlerweile nehmen die meisten Hotels im Stadtkern eine Fee von ca.30$ p.T. was ich schon frech finde bei den Zimmerpreisen. Das Renaissance gibt diese aber an den Gast zur\u00fcck in Form von Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck, Gastgeschenk und Ticket f\u00fcr die Big Bus Touren. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist f\u00fcr ein hochklassiges Hotel ein Witz und in jedem Homewood oder Fairfield Inn besser. Auch das Personal im Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksbereich war extrem uninteressiert.

We were promptly seated and enjoyed and the most spectacular view of Times Square from the restaurant.  Then, moments later \"The Most Delightful\" woman appeared.  It was Mrs. Marlene, the person who turned our disappointing day into a magical experience.  Mrs. Marlene had the best personality, the most giving spirit and she simply could not do enough for us.  Her positive words and helpfulness will never ever be forgotten.\n\nWhen we went back up to the room, we all thought of Mrs. Marlene and how blessed we were for having met her.

And always at least 3-4 bath towels (otherwise it\u2019s annoying when you book a room for 3 and they just give you enough towels for 2). \nLocation tight in Times Sq so if you dislike the noise and crowds it may not be the best location for you.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93534,"title":"Worst Location and Worst Renaissance","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-05-14","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I stayed at the Renaissance for work during the week of May 6th-10th.  I was on the 20th floor with a 'preferred room'.  \n\nTo be clear, there are issues with staying in Times Square (not the hotel's fault) and then things wrong with the hotel.  I've stayed at the W and Algonquin in Times Square before and if you must stay in Times Square, I would highly (highly) recommend those this property.  \n\nWhy?:\n1.  This hotel is on the exact busiest corner and the exact loudest part of the Square.  There was drilling setting up a new stage on 7th street from 10pm-2am!  This occurred for 3 of my 5 nights.  This is in addition to street noise that I could hear at 20 floors above.  And, lastly, any sign of a CVS\/Walgreens\/Duane Reed, etc was at least 5 blocks away.\n2.  My room was facing the M&M billboard--no matter how hard I tried and how tight I pulled the drapes, you could still see the billboard flash through the drapes.  It was like something out of a waterboarding video or horror movie.  \n3.  The room itself--dated in furniture (pillows were super uncomfortable).  The electrical power in the section where the coffee maker\/light switch was wasn't working.  \n4.  Construction--the walls of the hotel are razor thin.  There was a constant 'running water' noise from my bathroom (something from the other rooms?  building pipes?).  Anytime anyone left their room,the doors would slam and you could hear it as if you were in that room.  The lighting to the room was dark\n\nI will say, in the hotel's defense--the staff is very nice, the turn-down service was great and the lobby is lively.\n\nOverall, there are better areas to stay in in NYC--and if you must be in the square, there are better options.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was on the 8th floor which I thought would be too low and noisy but it wasn't bad at all. The windows are extra thick. There was a giant billboard outside my window but the black out shades worked pretty well. Good size rooms for NY and large bathroom with walk in shower. They hit you with a $25 resort fee but the good news is you can use that for the Big Bus tour which normally costs something like $55. So if you are staying 2 nights, you can get two Big Bus tickets included. The one thing I didn't care for is the fact that you can hear people in the hallways and their doors opening\/closing.

I mentioned it was their birthdays and the phone call was a really great beginning to our stay.  We arrived and had a rollaway sent up.  I noticed no bedding for the couch and text a request through their app and voila, we were back from the show and all was in place.  Breakfast was great for us.  The view was the best in the city overlooking time square and the food was good.  The best thing, it was available until 11am and free with our status.  We came back from a day of enjoying the city to find 2 stuffed bears and 2 bags of cookies and a Happy Bday card.  Fantastic.  Just fantastic.  I realized I had forgotten to request our late check out and was told not a problem, it was taken care of.  We still arrived late coming back and still not a problem.

We chose this hotel for it's great location and as we were celebrating my daughters 21st birthday we went all out. We were visiting New York for a hectic 5 day sightseeing trip. The location was right in the heart of the action in Times Square, well-placed for sightseeing and easy walking distance to the Rockefeller Center, Saks and most of the theatres. There is a subway right outside the front door for those attractions further away. On entering the Hotel you have a concierge desk on the left with security and a lift up to a very nice lobby, then you take a different elevator to get to the rooms. The room size was reasonable for Times Square, the decor is a bit dated and in need of upgrading but it was clean and the beds were really comfortable. Soundproofing could have been better, even though we were quite high up there was a disturbing amount of noise from the street below from sirens at all hours. The bathroom was quite modern and bright with a combination Bathtub\/shower, with complimentary toiletries were topped up every day and a good hairdryer. The bedrooms had air conditioning, a mini fridge, ample room to store clothes, a safe to store any valuables as well as tea and coffee making facilities but no kettle. Also, a Remote Control TV with Premium movie channels, Cable\/satellite and International cable\/satellite but we rarely used it. Beware there are two bottles of water in the room but they are not free. In the R Lounge area you get a great view of Times Square, seeing all the billboards lit up, lovely photo background, but this what your paying for to stay here, so use it.

The staff at the hotel are very friendly and always there to help with anything you need. One morning I went down as said that I felt cold when sleeping the night before and when we got back to our room there was a blanket left on the bed which is great to see that staff are reacting to your needs. We had breakfast at the hotel a couple of times and this was very tasty and there was plenty to choose from. Food was always being put out so if something was running low they would replace it immediately. In the restaurant area you are slightly higher up so you get a fab view of Times Square, seeing all the billboards and the lit up screens. The bedrooms themselves were great, everything that you needed. I would say hopefully they could do with some updating as the furniture: wardrobe, cabinets are a very dark brown which gives an old look compared to the rest of the room as the bathroom was quite modern. There were toiletries in the bathroom which were topped up everyday, a hairdryer to use which is good because we had brought our own hairdryer and it wasn\u2019t as powerful as the one that was in the room. Theres also a safe to store any valuables as well as tea and coffee making facilities. There are two bottles of water in the room but beware they are not free. We assumed they were free because in the middle of the night I needed a drink and my just naturally opened a bottle of water without realising that the tag around the bottle\u2019s neck said that its was $8.50! We made sure we drank the whole bottle, haha. If you fancy some drinks in the bar area of an evening it is a great place to be. One evening they had a DJ playing and the atmosphere was great and the music was really good. Make sure to remember about tipping waiters etc, as I know for us Brits this is a difficult thing to do \/ get used to as it\u2019s something we do not naturally do but they thrive for tips. Overall we had a good stay at the hotel and would definitely stay again if we were returning and would recommend the hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of New York.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Didn\u2019t even check for us. \nWe had notified the hotel prior that we would be celebrating a birthday and that we could upgrade on arrival but this was not to be. \nWe had mentioned to the guy on reception that we had a special birthday coming up and he had asked when so we replied, thinking we may of had a complementary bottle or even a note...no nothing whatsoever! \nI was disappointed as for a hotel of this class you would think it wouldn\u2019t be a issue to make their guests have a happy & enjoyable stay. \nIn all fairness the guys on reception are very friendly and helpful apart from the \u2018upgrade\u2019 \u2018no\u2019 incident. \n\nSo the room...yes the size was reasonable, bathroom was nice and the bed was very comfy. But that was it! The decoration is very dated in need of improvements, our head board was ripped in places with marks visible and electric wires exposed all around the floor which looked very messy and can be dangerous. \n \nOur housekeeper was sloppy at times, emptied the bins and through the sheets over on the bed and that was it. 3 days without coffee had to ask in the end and to top it off a item of clothing that I had left on the bed (same colour as the sheets) which we believe had been caught up in the laundry when changing the sheets. I had spoke to reception staff about this but nowhere to be found. I know this is my own fault but as a housekeeper you would be more careful.\n\nAnother thing which really annoyed me was the amount of private party\u2019s going on in the hotels bar and restaurant. So therefore guests cannot use these facilities then. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve paid so much to use a hotel bar when I like to be told I can\u2019t as a (sweet sixteen party) is being held!!! \n\nThe view from the restaurant at the R Lounge is fantastic and he location is spot on here.

So, I gave it three stars on average.  Its pros are also its cons.  \n\n1. Location\nPro: the hotel is located smack dab in the middle of Times Square.\nCon: the hotel is located smack dab in the middle of Times Square.\nThe location is great for access to everything and is in the heart of the \"action\".  This also means that it is very crowded outside the door, the lights and the noise also filter into the rooms.  Just know this going in.\n\n2. The lounge\nPro: the lounge in this hotel is the reason that we chose to stay here.  It has the most incredible view of times square and you feel like you are literally floating in the lights of the square.  Just gorgeous.  The main reason to stay at this hotel.\nCon: we stayed for four nights and the entire lounge area was completely closed to hotel guests for two of those nights due to private parties. Our first night there when i wanted my husband to see the view, the hotel staff would not even allow us in for one minute just to see it.  We were told that \"people paid a lot of money to book that room\" so we were not allowed in.  Well, we paid a lot of money to stay at this hotel just for that room that we were not allowed to enter.  Ironic.\n\n3. Breakfast\nPro:  breakfast is served in the lovely lounge with the great view of Times Square.\nCon: despite being told as Marriott Executive Elite members that breakfast was included, it is not included on weekends and costs approximately $50 per person for soggy eggs.  The food was not good.  Very little choice (small buffet area) and there was literally water running through the scrambled eggs.  Also, always a  long line to get in.  From what we saw, a lot of that delay comes from staff inefficiency.  We watched one hostess single handedly move tables around, clear dishes etc. while we waited to be seated at the free tables that were just sitting there.\n\n4. The Rooms\nPro: good size, clean, nice big bathroom with lots of towels and amenities.\nCon: walls are paper thin so you can't actually sleep if your neighbours chose not to.  We were kept awake almost the entire night for 2 nights of our 4 night stay. Our room had a door to link the room to the neighbouring room (if you needed a double room for a family I guess).  The door did not block ANY noise and we could hear the entire conversations of our neighbours at 3am.  Room tip: ask for a room that does not have the adjoining door.\n\n6.

We are long standing Marriott platinum elite members & were offered a package by Marriott Vacation Club confirmation # 71787500 for what was supposed to be a $199. package offered to Marriotts best customers to evaluate their time share package.  Shockingly, the $199 bait switched to $698 for 3 nights @ the Renaissance.  Although we booked a king bed, we were assured by hotel staff that we'd receive an upgrade to 2 beds as we are 2 adults & 1 very tall teen, which never happened.  On both my husband's & my Marriott membership profiles we both requested a quiet room away from elevators which is apparently \"Marriott speak\" for \"put my directly across from the elevator shaft as has happened my last 3 Marriot stays. Our room faced Times Square & was so loud that all night long we heard street noise, ambulances & sirens.  Our daughter who slept on a very tiny cot near the window didn't get any sleep, nor did we.  We complained loudly & were given a room on the other side of the hotel that was much quieter however, still didn't receive our upgrade to 2 beds for our teens b-day weekend.  The second surprise came when our valet parked late model Lexus 350 was returned from valet parking by ICON with a long curved scratch across the gas tank on the drivers side after paying $300 & never taking our car out of the ICON lot used by Marriott.  When we noticed the damage while filling up crafter leaving the hotel, we immediately called Marriott staff to report the damage.  It's been over a month & the only thing I've been told by Robert Nichols of ICON parking was the ridiculous statement that ICON was refusing to pull the CCTV footage from the day bc \"it was a curved scratch & my men would only be responsible for a straight scratch.

The Duty Manager we spoke to after the first night promised blackout curtains would be provided, however it took visits to three more Duty Managers and four more days before one blackout curtain was finally installed.  We were told that the curtain had to be taken from another room as there are no spares.  We agreed to have felt taped to the other half of the window so that we could get some sleep.\n\nThe rooms (2 couples, 2 rooms) were very old-fashioned.  The furniture was more motel than 4-star hotel.\n\nBreakfast in this \u201cluxury\u201d hotel was a farce \u2013 you are provided with paper cups for your coffee and tea. (After our complaints, on Day 3 a few crockery cups appeared, but were again hidden away outside the restaurant door the next morning!)  Only one four-slot toaster is available for the whole restaurant, and two of the slots did not work during most of our stay.  From the second morning on the toaster kept tripping the electrical circuit, however staff insisted it was not a problem.  On Day 5, the toaster was finally replaced.\n\nWith one stand out exception (Guia, who was friendly, polite and efficient), we were extremely disappointed with the service we received from staff.  The Duty Managers appeared very sympathetic to our issues when speaking with us face-to-face but failed to live up to any promises made.  Staff in the restaurant were quite unfriendly \u2013 on more than one occasion the breakfast \u201cgreeter\u201d did not even look up from her list, just asked \u201cRoom number?\u201d  When we requested to speak to a supervisor about the toaster and coffee cup issues, we were given a name and told she worked in the reception area.

I have seen this property on my searches, have walked past it almost every time I've been in NY and for some reason, always seemed leery to book a stay.  Maybe because it was RIGHT SMACK DAB in the middle of Times Square (too loud?; too busy?) or that it really doesn't look like a typical large hotel?  or maybe because Renaissance is not one of the more known brands for Marriott?  Regardless, I chose it this time as there was a very limited supply of hotels that week and even fewer in the Marriott\/SPG line that had not been jacked up to the $600-$800 per night range.\n\nLet me say, I was pleasantly surprised in so many ways.  Yes, you have to take an elevator up to the lobby floor (after check in) to access the room elevators but that happens at lots of properties. For my experience, check in was fast and easy.  I went up to my room which I found to be more spacious than the rooms at the Marriott Marquis or the Sheraton NYC and the overall service more personal.  Everything was clean, nicely appointed and very quiet.  I was on the 23rd floor, in the middle of the building so the view was not much to talk about,  but I imagine the end rooms would have been very nice.  The bathroom amenities are Aveda (nice) and the bathroom itself was quite large.  Even thought I have platinum elite status I don't believe I got any special room or recognition other than the points at check in (very typical of Marriott properties).  Given the location in Times Square, I expected it to be noisy, but I hardly notices any noise.\n\nI did not eat at the restaurant or bar, but did have a cocktail there both nights, once meeting a colleague and the second after a long work day. Service was very prompt and friendly both times and the prices for a Maker's Manhattan was reasonable if not typical and the portion was generous (I paid almost double, for a version half the size earlier in the evening at Zuma). \n\nSo given the opportunity and a reasonable price, I would definitely recommend this property and I would certainly stay there again","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was also conscious of mixed reviews and the general information that New York hotels were smaller than usual. Well I was really happy we stayed at the Renaissance. The location is right in Times Square, that may not be for everyone but it suited us really well to be able to get to all places we wanted easily and without any trouble. The whole of the square was open to us from the windows at breakfast and the electronic billboard landscape was there to behold. The room itself wasn't small it was a good size, very clean and better than I expected given some reviews and the information on New York hotels I had seen previously. I am sorry to say I didn't get the name of the great lady who greeted us at breakfast, just super friendly and made the morning just with her bright personality. Matthew at the concierge desk was more than helpful booking a couple of trips for us. The check in staff were efficient and friendly as were the porters. There was always a friendly wave every morning and a greeting at our return. Maybe the only downside the wait staff were a bit off hand.  Breakfast was included in our package and was very good with plenty of choices. The location may not be for everyone as it is right in the middle of everything but it suited us. I definitely would stay here again and  can recommend it as a place to stay if you visit New York.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

July 17, 18, 19th. This was our 4th visit since July 2017. Love the location. Love the rooms and the overall ambiance. \n\nA few people stand out in our minds as outstanding employees: JJ and Manny are two people you may come in contact with when you pull up to the hotel. They are so friendly and welcoming. And greet you with a nice big umbrella when it\u2019s pouring rain. ;-) \n\nHosom Ibrahim, at the front desk, was extremely helpful in resolving a small room problem and he definitely recognized and appreciated my gold status, my husband\u2019s life time platinum status and our frequent trips to this hotel.  Monet, although I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to meet her, we spoke on the phone and she was also very courteous, professional and helpful. Tammy, also at the front desk,had a big smile every time we spoke or walked by. It\u2019s this type of service, from the employees mentioned,  that keeps us returning to this hotel vs. going to others in the NYC area. With so many solid choices, service often sets hotels apart. \n\nOur one recommendation: we arrived at the bar for a nightcap just  as they were packing things up. It was a few minutes prior midnight. Based on our suggestion, our friends joined us and booked one night at the hotel  on the 19th. After dinner, we hoped to sit in the lounge. The staff was not friendly. Not helpful. And acted as though we asked them to fly cross country. There was no attempt to try to pour a glass of wine or even serve  a glass of water. This was unfortunate and it\u2019s not the first time. I understand it, to a point. They still had lots of work to do, no one else was around. They could have tried to accommodate us somehow. \n\nThat said, we are scheduled to stay on September 8th again. Thank you to the team who treated us so well. My husband is on The YES Network and this  is the second time we\u2019ve elected to have a staycation during the All Star Break.

Unfortunately, this will be my last stay. I checked in a few minutes early and was given the room type I requested - kind bed. As I settled and started working, I reported that the air conditioning was not working and the room was warm - nearly 80f. Nobody came to check on it. When I went out for a dinner meeting, around 6:30pm, I spoke to the staff again, this time at the middle floor - she took notes, said she\u2019d look into it and get back to me. I returned back around 10:30pm to find nothing had changed - still not air conditioning and no information about what was going on. I went back down the middle floor lobby to find nobody there. Went down the the lower lobby and was told first they had no record of the issue and that they could offer me a fan. Then, the clerk found a record of the issue and told me she could offer me a fan, again. I found it ridiculous that, after reporting the issue several times, I was offered a fan! I asked to change rooms for one that had working air conditioning (in July!) and was told they were sold out. When I groaned about the possibility of sleeping in an un-air conditioned room, the clerk magically found a room and gave me keys and sent me on my way - no offer of any assistance to move rooms, etc. The room provided was dirty and smelled. I asked for a manager this time and was told about the same by him - they are so busy, and he really seemed like he couldn\u2019t be bothered by a guest who didn\u2019t have air conditioning and had to ask for the issue to be looked at several times over the course of about 8 hours!  I asked to be moved to a nearby hotel and was told he\u2019d work on it and I\u2019d go pack my things. No updates for a while, so I finally had to call Marriotts customer care and express my frustration. The agent apparently was speaking with the manager, who lied and told the agent that I\u2019d already been in three rooms and that he had personally walked me to one - neither of which were true! The manager admitted he didn\u2019t know what was going on really and that he\u2019d just started his shift. Eventually, and magically, they found a room with working air conditioning. \n\nThis experience has ruined my perception of the hotel, which had been very strong. I am a lifetime platinum member at Marriott rewards. I was offered a boatload of points, which was also somewhat disappointing inasmuch as I really just wanted a simple experience and a room with air conditioning and a king bed, like I reserved and paid for. Instead, I got a world of hassle, exhausted, a shortened night of sleep, sweaty clothes and the \u201cprivilege\u201d of ironing twice. \n\n","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We've passed this hotel numerous times but this was our first stay here (typically we stay out of the direct Times Square Area). \n\nFamily friends of ours were using points to stay right in the thick of things for their first trip so we booked our (high priced) rooms to join them. The rooms were astonishingly larger than normal for a NYC hotel which was nice - we were in a Double bed room with 3 people and had plenty of space & a nice large bathroom with combination tub\/shower and sliding bathroom door. Mini-fridge in room, large TV, coffee maker, and lots of outlets (regular & USB) to accommodate everyone. There are 2 lobby's, the street level is a very small space where you check in before being led upstairs to the larger lobby, restaurant\/bar area, then another elevator up to your room. \n\nThe decor is... interesting. More night-club esk lighting than anything, and oddly placed sheep everywhere. Seems like they're going for the cool, mysterious, chic vibe but it's a hotel, not a nightclub. Didn't interact much with the staff besides our Waitress at the restaurant. Certain Marriott rewards members qualify for $25 free appetizer coupons each night when booking direct - so we snacked there twice. The flatbread pizza & chips were very good. (The charge is placed on your room to start and then credited back at time of check-out with your coupon). \n\nIt's location is central to just about everything; easy walks straight up to Central Park, Theaters, and regular tourist attractions in Times Square. The Times Square subway station is a couple blocks up for easy jetting around the city ($6 round trip out to Citi Field vs. $60+ UBER on game day). \n\nLocation does get busy, and depending on your room location you will get a lot of light flashing from the display LCD's in Times Square. If you need to have absolute silence to sleep, you won't find that here - stree noise reverberates up the sides of the buildings at all hours. Because it's in the middle of Times Square, it's a very crowded area. \n\nValet parking by the hotel will cost you $65 per day, and an additional $65 each time you take your car out. Better to get a Subway card and load it up if you plan to sight see outside of 34th (Macy's)-59th (Central Park Entrances) streets between 5th-8th Aves, or don't like walking that far.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The second night, after a long day and night of meetings, I came home and found it still hadn't cooled down.

It is located at the north end of Times Square on a little triangle of land bordered by Broadway, 7th Avenue & 47th Street. We took Lyft (under $10) from Penn Station to the hotel entrance on 7th Avenue. I requested a best view, high floor and none were available so they happily pre blocked me in a 23rd floor room (of 26 total) and we checked our luggage with the bell staff. The offer was made to call me when the room was ready-which actually occurred...kudos to the a Renaissance, so many hotels fail this simple task! The ground floor just consists of the check in desk, a few places to sit and the bell desk. You must take an elevator up to the \u201clobby\u201d level. Late at night no one without a key can get up to there as a guard was present.\n\nAfter a fantastic lunch at an Irish Bar (there are literally dozens in the area), we got the room in is ready call. Coming back to the hotel my key pack awaited me and my full Gold Marriott Rewards late checkout for the next day was added no problem. Our west facing room on 23 looked over a bit of Times Square, the Hotel Edison & Morgan Stanley WHQ. The room size was large by NYC standards and came chock full of conveniences. There was a laptop size safe, refrigerator and plenty of outlets both on the desk and on each side of the comfy king bed. USB ports can be found on the desk as well. WiFi on 3 devices worked well. There was a small sofa lining the window and street noise really wasn\u2019t a problem. The large bathroom had a spacious vanity and a large glass shower only-no tub. \n\nThe R Lounge and Restaurant has a stunning view overlooking all of Times Square-It is located on the lobby level (about 3 stories above the street). The bar wasn\u2019t that large and on a Saturday night it was packed with people as was the restaurant. The view really is spectacular. The hotel does not provide Gold & Platinum Rewards members with breakfast-which I knew ahead of time. We get extra points (not a choice). It being Midtown you can easily find somewhere to eat as expensive or cheap as you like, so we didn\u2019t mind at all. \n\nWe returned in the late afternoon to quickly pack and checkout-the keys still worked-again, so many hotels fail on this as well! We were on our way in no time to Penn Station in a regular taxi that the doorman happily hailed for us. It may not be the tallest or newest Marriott flag in Midtown, but the location and friendly can do attitude of the staff make this Renaissance a winner! ","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Check-in was efficient and welcoming, though it occurs in a pretty dismal, utilitarian, street-level lobby - but it's a trade-off, not having that activity with travelers and their suitcases hanging out upstairs in the more elegant lobby space.\n\nI remember when this hotel opened when everything was new and functional. Now the hotel is aging, especially the elevators which were only working on and off (mostly off). Staff were cheerful, helpful and apologetic when we had to use the service elevators. But the elevators need to be replaced, and management should bite that bullet as soon as possible. \n\nBut, as always, it was a wonderful stay.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Hotels in the ultra tourist districts can usually rely on their location to keep the rooms full and no doubt this Renaissance fits that.  The first issue was the room. It was a decent size and had a nice view, but the room itself was worn with stained drapes and old furniture.  On the upside, the mattress was very comfortable.  I had the same experience as many others with the lounge access issue and service (see my other review of the R Lounge).  It was closed for a private event and guest were forced to sit in a small bar area by the elevators.  And even the elevators were an issue, as we got stuck on them and when the doors kept jamming.

The major subway lines are a block away. You can get down to One World Trade or head over to Brooklyn for some great pizza. \nQuality: The room was very nice. Decent amount of space for NYC. The room was clean albeit the normal wear and tear. Shower and bathroom clean. Water pressure was a little low in the shower. The beds were super comfy. The elevators here were very quiet - no \"ding\" in the middle of the night like Courtyard. We had neighbors but couldn't hear them. \nAmenities: The cable TV really needs to be fixed. Most channels were fuzzy. You can get the major channels (ABC\/NBC\/FOX\/CBS), cartoon network and 3-4 ESPN channels but the others are fuzzy. Safe & fridge were in our room. Plenty of towels.\nLobby: Check-in at the ground floor. Concierge, restaurant and bar on the 2nd level (main level). We thought the main level was very cool and the views from the restaurant and bar window are amazing at night. The bar area isn't huge and the bar can fill up in the evening but it's worth a try as the service was very good the night I was there (a Tuesday).\nPrice: A little more expensive than other Marriott's (Courtyard, etc.) in the area but you're paying for the location. There is a $25 fee but you get a $25 food credit which I used for a bar drink. I think it's worth the splurge. \nSecurity: We experienced no issue. There is security at main level and we checked our bags with the bellman on the day we checked out. An excellent experience with the bellman - very nice gent.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Great location for theatre, subway and Times Square activities.  Check in is at the street level on 6th street and was flawless. Our room was ready although we arrived early. There was a nice expansive lobby on the 4th floor with restaurants on both ends. Unfortunately the south restaurant was closed for private functions on 2 of the 3 nights we stayed and the north restaurant was closed 2 of our 3 nights. Free coffee on weekdays but not weekend days. Front desk staff were great and housekeeping was outstanding. Room was small as usual in Manhattan but bathroom was more expansive with a large updated walk-in shower. King size bed was comfortable. Hostess at restaurant was not very pleasant and even kurt with us but maybe she was just having a bad day. The rest of the staff were all above average to outstanding. Be careful about the destination package. There is a $25 a day additional charge but includes a $25 a day credit in the restaurants and a free bus ticket. Would not recommend unless you are going to eat daily in their restaurants and there is better food nearby. There are no coke products available in the hotel and ice machines are not available on every floor....which seems to be the rule of thumb at my recent Marriott stays including JW Marriott.

Concierge and wait staff tend to tolerate guests, rather than offer genuine service. (This is such a constant, that I'm guessing the cause lies with working conditions in these departments more than with the personalities of specific employees.)

There is a coffee maker and a refrigerator. There\u2019s a closet, a desk, a comfy chair and a safe. The bathroom is stocked with Aveda supplies. There is no fan in the bathroom and the door is sliding glass door. Large vanity area. \nThe housekeeping staff was great!

It is a small doorway and you might think you are at the wrong place. Rest assured you are at the hotel. Once you go through the doorway the front desk is on your left. It is well staffed and check in is a breeze. The elevators are located across the small lobby area. The elevators take you up about three floors to the main lounge area. Here you will find the concierge and the restaurant bar. The elevators to the other floors are across the large lobby area.\nWe were on the 15th floor and our room looked out onto 7th Avenue. You really don't hear the traffic below except one night when there was some type of motorcycle event on the street.\nThe room had two large double beds (we didn't want to wait for a king). The bathroom is also large and well appointed. There is a deep bathtub that would be great for soaking. My wife had to ask for a hairdryer to be delivered to the room other than that everything was perfect.\nHousekeeping did a great job of cleaning up the room.\nThe windows had very thick drapes which came in hamdy for blocking the blinking lights from 7th avenue.\nIf you are eligible for the concierge level know that it is not available on the weekends. However lots of places close by to get a coffee and a roll before starting out for the day.\nNice staff, nicely decorated, not noisy.\nI would definiotely stay here again.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Even though I've been to NYC 40 times in the last 5 years, I felt like a tourist.\n\nPositives:\n\nDowntown NQR subway right next to the hotel. Uptown right across from the TKTS booth. Easy walking distance to 42nd street to get the 123, ACE (via the underground walkway), or the S to Grand Central for 456 trains.\n\nFriendly staff.\n\nFor a second I thought the first floor was the lobby, but soon found out that the real lobby is on the 2nd floor which had two computers, a bar and a restaurant. \n\nI had a red-eye from LA and arrived really early. While they did check me in at 6am, they didn't have a room ready till 10:30am which they provided a courtesy early check in.\n\nSo as a Marriott Platinum Elite, I was really worried having read online that there were no benefits at this hotel. However on check in I found out that there are benefits:\n1) Free breakfast buffet. It was a pretty standard hotel buffet with scrambled eggs, decent sausage, pretty gross bacon, breads, waffles, danish, bagels, water, orange juice, coffee, etc. It wasn't the best thing in the world, but it was free.\n2) Two free bottles of $8 Evian water that are in the room.\n3) One free $10 appetizer per night in the hotel restaurant.\n4) I'm sure they have room upgrades to higher floors, but that didn't apply this time because I took the first room available.\n\nMixed or no opinion:\n\nThey charge a approx 25 dollar per night resort fee. However, the benefits you get from this far outweigh the costs if you stay for a short amount of time. Those benefits were a $25 restaurant F&B credit and a Big Bus Tour 24 hour ticket (which is usually $50 bucks) and a day pass to Equinox (not sure value of that, but probably $20 - $25). I hate paying resort fees, but I can't deny that these benefits are really great for single person staying.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe carpet in my room was loose.\n\nBlackout curtains didn't completely close all the way\n\nShower only, no bathtubs\n\nNo room service\n\nNo rooms actually face Times Square but either Broadway or 7th Ave\n\nOh if there was supposed to be another Platinum Elite benefit (like a bottle of wine) I didn't get one.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This property is small. It's in the island between 7th Ave and Bway at a very narrow spot. This is pretty much the opposite of the Marriott Marquis just down the block where the wait for elevators can often take forever because of the sheer volume of people passing through. This Renaissance has a decidedly boutique-y feel. The decor is a little strange but still pleasing to the eye. The lobby is tiny and there are only two check in desks. We ended up waiting a little while because a bunch of ppl all arrived at the same time. There was no one available to do mobile check in and hand you the keys. No biggie, it wasn't that long a wait. \n\nWe stayed in a double room overlooking 7th Ave on the 24th floor. Nice sized room with plenty of space. It was definitely showing some wear, but it's NYC and these hotels get a lot of traffic.  Everything was clean. Water pressure is terrible and the shower head does not have adjustable stream so leave extra time to rinse the shampoo and conditioner out of you have long thick hair. \n\nOne thing I wish they had was Netflix access on the TV because the channel offering is pretty limited and it takes forever to surf.  There's a very long annoying delay between when you press the channel button and the TV responds. There is no channel guide on screen so it really was a waste of time. These days it's pretty standard stuff to be able to hit the Netflix button and log in with your account.\n\nThere is no room service and no Concierge Lounge here.\n\nOverall I liked that this hotel is smaller and easier to navigate the Marquis. However if you're looking for a full service experience, the Renaissance is not the hotel to choose.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It would have been nice if we had received at least an in room movie for free to make up for the trouble. We were also woken up very early in the morning by an alarm advisory from something happening on one of the floors, which I actually thought was great. It's good to know they have a way of letting you know when there is a problem. \n     They do have mini refrigerators, Evian water bottles ($8.00 each), and the view onto 7th Avenue is great.  The location is close to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, MoMa, Bryant Park, Penn Station, Macy's, Central Park, 5th Avenue, St. Patrick's Cathedral, and a lot more.  \n     I highly recommend the hotel even with its water issues, as I am sure this was an isolated event during our stay.

This has been my go-to hotel in New York for a while. I know, it\u2019s located in the very heart of Times Square.  But it\u2019s like an old shoe for me, I\u2019m comfortable here, the service is great, and the employees all know me.  And hey, it\u2019s hard to match the view.  \n\nCheck-in is always fast and easy and they usually have a room for me even when I arrive at 9am on a Monday morning.  \n\nThe rooms are nice and spacious with adequate room to move around, place your luggage and use the desk.  Carpet and furniture are relatively new and in good shape. Have large TV\u2019s.  Bathrooms are smaller but they do have a tiled\/glass door walk in shower (if you read my reviews, this is makes a hotel golden to me).  Of note, the last time I had a double room, the showers were tub showers\u2026 Warning to folks who might have multiple people in the room, the bathroom doors are barn doors and don\u2019t lock.  I have never gotten a suite at this hotel in my 8+ years staying there until I asked on week 2 of my trip.  Sure enough, week 3 they put me in a small suite. It was a normal king room with a little bit more space and in the corner of the building.  Really, the only difference was the extra room in the corner.  \n\nThe hotel does not have a concierge lounge for elites, but they provide you with a certificate for anything up to $15 on the food menu at the bar each night, and have a wonderful breakfast buffet for us in the mornings.  Breakfast location has maybe the best view in Times Square.  I might add, the flatbread pizza and the grilled cheese with tomato soup are very good on the bar menu.  The grilled cheese is a huge panini with bacon and very good cheese, I skip the soup.  The three guys that are always at the bar in the evenings are wonderful.  Always smiling and providing great service.  They know my order before I make it to their bar every night.  They also give out a free cocktail each night at 5pm sharp.  They mix a large bowl of a specialty drink and pour it until it\u2019s dry.  If you aren\u2019t there by 5:10pm you\u2019ll miss it.  \n\nOverall, solid hotel.  Great service, Times Square location, nice rooms, and good benefits for elite members.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

After that, you're on your own because there is no desk in the main lobby.  The elevator from the arrival lobby to the main lobby is painfully slow and there is no other alternative.  In all elevators, the lights are so low it is difficult to see the floor button and the music is beyond funky.  Feels like management is going over the top to demonstrate the hip factor.  These changes since my last visit a number of years ago were not positive for me.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Gentleman that assisted me was efficient and professional. Also the checkout clerk that assisted me was very nice. \n\nRoom (general): Spacious room (room 1917) overlooking the Hershey\u2019s store. Overall room was clean, except for certain stains on the bathroom wall (more details infra). Standard appliances in room such as TV, iron, mini refrigerator, mini coffee maker, etc. Furniture was generally clean and in good condition.\n\nBathroom: overall clean, modern bathroom. But one wall near the sink had very unsightly stains. See photos. One another note, the glass shower enclosure is very nice but is scratched in many places, perhaps from a bad squeegee. The hair dryer provided is a good Andis model. Ample counter space.\n\nBed: Excellent bed and pillows\n\nHousekeeping: Above average. Carpet was lint free, bathroom was properly stocked.\n\nRestaurants: I had an hors d'oeuvre at the bar my first night, specifically the pot pie. It was edible but not very good. I ate breakfast both mornings at the complimentary buffet for elite members. The sausage was stone cold the first morning. Fruit was excellent. See comments infra concerning offer of dirty ice. The cold sausage and staff offering me dirty ice are red flags concerning food safety. \n\nGrounds: Location is literally at the top of Time Square. So there are no grounds separate from the building. \n\nGym and Pool: Did not have time to view or use either. \n\nParking: Valet available, but who drives a car in NYC? I took Uber Penn Station. \n\nOverall staff attitude: generally good. The breakfast \u201cmonitor\u201d that checks elite member names was a bit surly. I arrived a few minutes before opening, and she made is very clear that nothing, including coffee, was available until precisely 6:30 a.m. Once admitted at 6:30, I noticed that the refrigerator that should have contained water bottles was empty. I asked her about water, and she firmly told me the refrigerator had water. I pointed out it was empty, and she seemed a bit peevish about that. Also, I asked for a cup of ice, and a \u201chelper\u201d setting up items for breakfast pointed to the ice keeping the yogurt cold. I explained that I wanted clean ice, not ice in contact with the exterior of the yogurt containers. Basic hygiene\/food safety should be a priority for any eating establishment. Never offer a customer dirty or potentially dirty food or water. I perceive that management needs to conduct some remedial training with its food service staff.\n\nMisc: photos are of room 1917. \n\nTip: Ask for a room facing Times Square for a great view. Street noise near Times Square can be loud. I could clearly hear crowd noise and road work (at night) in my room. So if you\u2019re a light sleeper, ask for a room as high up as possible.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

But perhaps the hotel could have housekeeping keep a few \"firmer\/ more supportive\" pillows on hand for guest to request if needed.\n\nAgain I know this is a subjective critique....but even doubling up the pillows really didn't help give any support to ones head\/neck\/ shoulders.\n\nOn our last night we were supposed to go out in Manhattan for dinner with friends, but it rained most of the day and evening, so we met in the 'R Lounge' with them for drinks and appetizers.

Happily as Marriott Gold Members we were able to upgrade to a high level floor and asked for a room on the Broadway side of the hotel for slightly less street noise.  As most people will tell you no matter what floor you're on in a hotel that close to Times Square you're going to have street noise.  However we did have a problem with a weird ticking\/clicking sound in the walls that was inexplicable and never stopped.  Possibly water in the pipes?  Once another high floor room was available the front desk was gracious enough to allow us to move rooms, but the weird ticking remained.  Additionally we could hear the neighbors in the adjoining room quite clearly.  Unfortunately because of this it is unlikely that we will return to the hotel in the future, but the staff did everything in their power to try to make things right.  Concierge was super helpful with maps and tips and helped to arrange our transit back to EWR.  Most people aren't looking to watch TV when they're in NYC, but be forewarned that there are only approximately 10 digital channels available with the additional channels in grainy low definition.  Enjoyed the Aveda toiletries provided.  Housekeeping was very attentive and helped with requests for more hangers and water when needed. (free bottled water in room one of the great perks for Marriott Gold level and higher!)","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It has so many different aspects of awesome and not so awesome.  It is a 2.5 in some respects and a five on others so I will try to detail everything so you have a good feel for the hotel.  I was there because I was given tickets to Hamilton and this hotel was 2 blocks away so it was convenient from that respect.  We entered the hotel to an unimpressive lobby and valeted the car.  Checked in and got into a relatively small and extremely slow elevator to go up one floor to the restaurant area.  Then we crossed over to the room elevators.  We had a larger room with a sitting area and two bathrooms.  The carpets were dated and I actually stepped on a sharp object left on the carpet.  One bathroom was clogged and the speaker system didn't work nor did the TV in the living room.  It wasn't to the point of demanding a new room because it was sufficient for our one night stay. Also keep in mind I am spoiled because I have travelled extensively and stayed in the finest hotels in the world.  We went to the play, came back and had dinner in the open area of the restaurant because there was no room in the main area.  We had decent wine and a very good meal, the menu is very limited but the quality was very good. The waiter Mike was so awesome I left an exceptional tip. We went to sleep and the next morning went to breakfast downstairs. Well here comes the \"feast\"...we ate breakfast IN the restaurant...it faces the ball drop in Times Square.  We had the buffet and admired the view for over an hour.  I was interrupted by a call from Moscow but returned to finish inhaling the view and enjoying the serenity which is so very rare.  Bottom line is the location is awesome, the view from the restaurant is unbeatable (would love to be there New Years Eve), the rooms need a little help and care from the staff to make sure everything works.  Try it, I doubt you will be disappointed but lower your expectations a little.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Personally, I thought it was central enough to everything that I needed to be close to (theaters, restaurants, bars, etc.), but also private enough that I didn't feel crowded out when entering\/leaving the lobby.\n\nRoom: I managed to get a room on the 26th floor which was excellent. Although I initially hesitated about the noise coming from below, I could not hear anything. This may not be true for other floors, but honestly, it was the best of both worlds for me - the center of everything, location wise, but also isolated from the noise, hustle, and bustle in my room.\n\nStaff: I traveled to NYC for the day to celebrate my 1-year anniversary. I had called the hotel to see if they could make a card to surprise us (read: her), but they went over the top and actually left a bottle of champagne in the room with two glasses for us. It was extremely unexpected, over-the-top, and was a very welcome surprise for the two of us.\n\nOverall: I think that this hotel offers something much different from the other more business-y hotels in the Times Square area. Its location was great in that it was close enough, but not in the middle of everything, and the hotel staff made the stay extremely memorable. I hope to be back one day and hopefully have the same experience as my first trip!","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Yes you can have a beer, but the atmosphere is definitely more expensive wine bar than anything else. The rooms were fine but we were on the 8th floor and you could hear a lot of noise from the street below at night, so definitely go higher if at all possible. The staff are helpful and I find it hard to criticise any of them, but really didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel other than sleeping.

The room is a good size for NYC as was the bath and shower.

Housekeeping was great and most of the staff were very friendly. We struggled to get service in the bar\/lounge on Saturday evening although they did admit they were much busier than usual.  The location really is in the heart of Times Square--which is good and bad. The good news is that you are close to all Broadway theaters and many restaurants in the area. The noise from the street is where things fall down for this reviewer. Every night, starting around 5 or 6, some guy across the street on 7th Ave was using a microphone and speaker to promote a comedy show. It went on for hours and was quite annoying as our room faced out to 7th ave. One night he was talking into the microphone until 11pm.  The hotel provided ear plugs on the side tables in the room; this should have been a red flag.  Please know I'm a fan of Renaissance in general, I think the circumstances of the surroundings were the issue for me for this trip.

The standard Wifi simply doesn't work.  Not even to browse to Google.  That requires a $3\/day upgrade to the \"premium\" service, which works and is relatively stable, but not particularly fast.\n2) The channel selection on TV was almost entirely SD (perhaps 5 HD channels), and even those were fuzzy and demonstrated packet loss in the digitial reception.  I don't come here to watch TV, but it was almost impossible for me to find a national news channel that was in HD or didn't drop because of poor reception.\n3) There was a particular odor to the room, which I determined emanated from the desk chair.  Body odor.  Bad.\n\nRooms facing Times Square do have some noise, and earplugs are provided on the nightstand if you need absolute silence--but you'll want to use the blackout drapes to dull the flash of LEDs from the Square outside.\n\nI do not want to knock this hotel--I do love the location and the welcoming staff.

On arrival to the hotel, when you enter reception there is no greeting from the receptionists, no welcome to our hotel, have you stayed before or smiles or any friendliness, they were just rude. No offer of help with our bags. Our room was very dated and due to this, the small light in the bathroom did not work, the toilet did not flush properly and kept blocking up, in the end we had to get the maintenance guy to come and unblock it, the paint on the light over the bed was peeling off, most of the sockets in the room don't work, the whole section of sockets next to the TV lifted up and didn't work, the TV had spots all over it and no matter what you did to the aerial it didn't work properly. The hairdryer didn't work properly, kept cutting out, the carpet was very sticky and the beds were incredibly uncomfortable and tiny. They are double beds and for two adults and 2 teenage boys sharing, it was not ideal. Each time we rang down to the front desk for help, they didn't greet you and then most of the time, they would just hang up with out saying goodbye, you could tell that it was inconvenient for them each time we phoned. I have a contact at the hotel and she always books the rooms for us, but it felt like we had just been stuck in this room (as if it was the only one left), the air conditioning was very noisy and not easy to use, it was always freezing in the room and freezing outside. The block out curtains don't work properly as you can still see the lights coming in from the buildings and the hotel is very noisy.

I'm a frequent traveler, I go to at least two countries in a year's time and this time my adventure got me staying at this hotel and believe me I was sooo excited. First of all, the view from my room was a \"sweet\" delight being right across both the M & M and Hershey buildings!  Not to mention, walks from Broadway and having the grandest view from the hotel restaurant's window ... Time's square was our vista!    Having drinks or dinner with Time's square as your back drop was awesome!   This hotel is truly quaint  but most convenient and conducive to working as well.    They  have a  common lounge area that gives you free wife, books to read or simply \"veg out\" if you must.\n\nThose of us who wanted to see the shows only had  to walk across the hotel and the tickets booking windows were right smack there!   The catch?  Well, all the convenience of a nice view, steps away from the Center of the hustle and bustle of course comes with a price.\n\nRooms were almost $600 a day I know just a bit more would've had us staying at a swankier one but hey,  it's modern -artish interior just blended really well with my \"Times Square\"and  living in New York experience.\n\nFood was pricey too if in the hotel but hello... you're In New York, there's so much cuisine you can have and the Street food like hotdogs, and pizzerias and even Indian food was all around there.  One just has to use their legs and sense of adventure!  I saw School of Rock while my colleague was able to catch Hamilton.  Both shows were excellent.  Anyway, I loved the experience but honestly  there are other quaint hotels you may stay at  further from Times square  that next time around I  don't mind checking  out because the few hundred dollars you can save can buy you two tickets to a show on broadway... Hurray!","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel first floor reception area is small. If you are with a crowd ask people to go the second floor lobby. Two elevators go to the the lobby. Get off the elevator and the  elevators to the rooms are across the lobby on the opposite side. View from The lobby bar of Times Square is amazing. Wine \ud83c\udf77 runs around $15. Drinks are expensive. Check to make sure tips are not already added. \n\nThe room I had was on the Twelvth floor overlooking 47th street. Large. Clean. Picture windows allows for a view of all the light and lit up billboards. If you are on a floor higher than 15 your view is the construction in the building across the street on 47th. \n\nThe room numbers are very large. Almost blind, no worry you can locate your room. As you enter the room, the light inside turns on so one does not have to worry regarding seeing the room in toto. The black out curtains work. Close them and th eTime Square light show disappears..\n\nThey offer complimentary  Starbucks 'wake up' coffee in the lobby on the second floor lobby. I found this out one day too late. Concierge, all, were extremely helpful making theatre tickets  and restaurants reservations. They ar the hotel best asset along with the room division who supply more than enough towels, and washcloths. They are happy to please and really break their backs to make your room comfortable.  Bring you own shampoo, conditioner as the ones provided by the hotel are second rate. \n\nI did not eat the resturant. Next time.

The location was excellent. The view of Times Square from the lobby-level restaurant itself was worth several million dollars, if not more. \n\nUnfortunately, the hotel just fell short of my reasonably expectations. \n\nI stay a lot of nights with Marriott. As a result, I have the top-level platinum elite status. I received zero recognition at arrival. Elite recognition varies by hotel, but I learned from a colleague, who was also staying here, that he received vouchers for appetizers in the evening as well as complimentary breakfast. He also received a welcome amenity in the room -- some wine and chocolate. Not did I not receive the evening vouchers, but I was never told about breakfast. I also didn't receive a bottle of wine or chocolates in my room. If there was a concierge lounge I didn't find out about it. \n\nI specified a king-sized room on a high floor away from the elevator. I received a king room on a low floor while my colleague, with the same reservation specifications, received a room on the 25th floor (the second from the top). My other requests -- extra towels and extra pillows -- were not fulfilled.\n\nThe room itself was spacious, but a little tired. Furniture was visible scratched. Some of the cabinets were broken. One of the two phones didn't work. The TV was a few years old -- it certainly wasn't the 52-inch TV you see in most Marriott hotels these days. The decor didn't really work either. It was a mixture of modern or post-modern and classic hotel styles -- a mixture that came off more as mismatched and cheap than premium boutique hotel, which is what it felt like this hotel was trying to be. I appreciated having a morning newspaper delivered to my room. The bathroom was also spacious, but housekeeping didn't replace the soap. No slippers or bathrobe were provided.\n\nOn the plus side, the wireless internet was more than adequate and the fitness facility was excellent. \n\nNo doorman was working when I arrived or departed (both times in the afternoon) to assist with luggage to\/from the taxi. There was a bellman inside, but I never saw them venture outside to help arriving and departing guests.\n\nThe lobby on the street level is really, really small. The line from the front desk often blocks the entranceway and obstructs the foyer leading to the elevator. The area where the lobby should be on the second floor is cluttered with excessive boutique hotel-style decor. \n\nMost disappointing was the restaurant.\n\nThe breakfast buffet was pathetically limited. No menu service is available. In the evening, the menu is mostly dinner and appetizers for dinner. Very, very casual. My business colleague and I made a reservation for a window table overlooking Times Square. The reservation was confirmed. When we arrived we were seated at a table in the center of the restaurant with zero view whatsoever. More annoying than the lack of a view, however, was the music. Not only was the music excessively loud, but it varied from grunge rock and heavy metal to 1990s pop music. \n\nAll things considered, I would not stay here again.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We were visiting friends for the week for a family celebration.  We checked in around 2:00 PM on Friday and were able to access the room immediately.  We were on the 10th floor in a 2 bedded room.  We faced Times Square.  There is a tall building across the street with bright neon lights that change color.  The drapes did not close all the way, and so we had purple, red, orange, green and blue light flooding the room.  If you are a light sleeper or are disturbed by music and lights, request a room not facing Times Square.  We used a \"white noise\" app on our cell phone and that drowned out the music\/cars\/yelling in Times Square. \n\nThe beds were comfortable and the room was spacious, especially for NYC.  There was room for a desk and wall unit with built in drawers, with a laptop size safe in the drawer; there was a night stand between the 2 beds, a small chair by the windows that had a TV tray type of thing in front of it (we used it as a suitcase stand) and the closet was an armoire built in to the wall.  There were plenty of hangers for 2 women, an iron and board and a mini-fridge.  The bathroom had only one sink but lots of counter space and a cubby system underneath to store towels, toilet paper, our toiletries, etc.  After the first night, housekeeping gave us 2 of each of the Aveda bath items, so that was very nice (we tipped $5 each night for housekeeping and got a thank you note from the housekeeper - nice.)\n\nYou check in on the ground floor, and then take the elevator across from check-in to the 5th floor, where the lobby is located, then cross the lobby to another elevator bank to reach the guest rooms.  There is a sign in the elevator saying that you need to insert your room key into a security slot to run the elevator, but we didn't have to do that the whole weekend, so I'm not sure why the sign is there.  The lobby floor has a nice bar\/lounge.  It was convenient when we needed to grab something quickly after shopping all day, before heading to our late afternoon family event.  They serve small bites like hummus and crudites, and other noshy things.  The bar overlooks Times Square, though, and so each time that we were there, people had commandeered more tables than they needed in order to have multiple people in their party be able to face the view.  Pretty rude.  The front desk staff were friendly, the concierge gave good info re: which subway line to take to our various destinations and the doorman got us a taxi.  This hotel is a solid choice for the Times Square area, especially if you want a little more space than most NYC shoe box sized hotel rooms.

We were a bit awestruck upon arrival as Times Square was a massive assault on the senses for us. You just say 'wow' when you see it - and the Renaissance is literally right on it. \n\nIt's a brilliant hotel with helpful staff. Our rooms were very clean, tidy and had comfortable beds. We were high up on the 21st floor. Some reviewers have said that it is a 'noisy' hotel with traffic etc...Yes, it can be busy and lower level rooms may be noiser but we didn't find it particulary noisy despite it being Thanksgiving. But look, you are in Times Square after all and for us it was all part of the fantastic NYC experience.\n\nThe restaurant looks out over Times Square. The rooms don't, they face to the side, but the billboard views are still fantastic. We decided to have the breakfast at the hotel and it was very nice with plenty of choice. You may have to pay extra for it if not pre-booked though.\n\nYou can walk to most of the main sites if you don't fancy the subway. We walked to Grand Central Station, Rockefella centre, Empire State building, Chrysler building and Saks 5th Avenue and Macy's. Central Park is only a 20 minute walk away from the hotel.\n\nWe took a yellow cab from the hotel to go downtown to visit the 9\/11 Memorial (approx $25-35 one way, including tip, as it's quite a distance). You simply have to visit this site, it is unbelievably humbling. \n\nThe one hour Hornblower Cruises around the Statue of Liberty is just around the corner from the 9\/11 memorial, from Pier 15. I would completely recommend the Liberty helicopter trip over the Hudson river. I have always wanted to do this. It's $199 for a 15 minute flight, but you will NOT regret it.\n\nIn summary; Great hotel, fantastic location, Brilliant place to visit. \n\nTIP 1 : it's well worth queuing for a table at Ellen's Stardust diner on the next block, just around the corner from the hotel. The waiting staff are all budding actors and singers who perform songs from famous musicals whilst serving the food. It's totally brilliant!\n\nTIP 2: An approved yellow cab right outside JFK airport will take you in to the city for a fixed fee, plus a tip. This works out at approx $65 each way for approximately a 40-45 minute ride, traffic depending.  It's a great way to get to and from the airport and the fixed fee lets you know where you stand fare wise. Look for the official yellow cab dispatcher outside the arrivals terminal.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

On the way the lift bumps along and doesn't inspire confidence.  \nThe bed is very comfortable but the room furniture has been well used and the hotel has a tired feel.\nAs with many large hotels it was not possible to open the window - it was completely sealed.  At well over $300 a night just for the room and a steep $30 for a fairly basic self serve buffet, it did not represent good value for money and i would not stay there again.

I show him my confirmation number, and he said he'll try to get me in since there are plenty of room left.  I told him it's my first time at the hotel, but he didn't even bother to tell me where the lounge is or how to get to my room.  The host on the second floor lobby said I should join them in the R lounge for 1 free appetizer for elite members.  However, they all neglect to tell me that I needed a coupon from the hotel front desk because the front desk guy did not give to me.  When I show up at the R lounge to see what it was about the next day, they said I have to be an elite member and have a coupon from the front desk.  The guys was extremely rude about it too.  They call and check the front desk, and confirm that I was an elite member.  But then, they told me I still have to go downstairs to get the coupon.  I finally went downstairs to get the coupons, but then they said it was only valid for certain days.  So Monday coupons only works for Monday and Tuesday for Tuesday.  This is just silly.  Appetizer is like $10-$15 or something, but I was so tick off, I didn't even bother to go there.  From the vacant seating in the R lounge, they could have used another customer for the dinner time.

We booked with points, so sometimes since we're not bringing revenue in on the room side, that can lead to subpar service, not at this place! We were quickly checked in, told where breakfast and the lounge were and led to the elevator. Bonus points for that! \n\nYou take one elevator from Ground to Lobby, then cross over to another elevator that takes you up to the rooms. This could have been a little better explained with signage, but not a deal breaker. The decor is just beautiful here, soft lighting, knick knacks and interesting things to look at everywhere. The lobby level even had a table with adult coloring pages and colored pencils! \n\nR lounge is the lounge overlooking times square with cocktails and a small bites menu. Great location, great drinks, bites were good, but service left something to be desired. We asked for waters, two beers and a cocktail. The waters came 10 minutes later alone. Then the drinks. Three ladies at the table in heels and makeup and they didnt offer nor bring glasses for the beers. Not a deal breaker, but it seems like the kind of place that should at least ask. Nevertheless! \n\nThe room itself was typical, nothing really stood out....except the speaker in the bathroom. This was a funny moment that I'm sure we werent the first to have! We turned on the TV and couldnt hear anything....but it seemed to be coming out faintly from across the room. Could NOT figure it out...til we opened the bathroom door and the sound was deafening! There's a little slider in there for the TV sound! Had never seen that before, and it definitely made for a laughing moment. I guess if you're watching something you can turn the sound off the TV and on in the bathroom to not miss anything? Hilarious. \n\nBeds were comfortable, clean and pillows as well.

I will not again.  This time, I wanted a very special trip so talked with hotel people several times. I asked for a high Broadway view near an Executive Suite, two of the more expensive rooms for 3 nights. Ended up they didn't have them on the same floor so I had to downgrade. The rooms overlooked a huge construction site across the street.  They can't help that, but be aware there are no rooms which overlook Times Square.  Broadway view is on the back with buildings, but that's better than construction.  I tried to get moved, but Customer Service seemed to care less. A good attitude would have made it a bit easier to take. The rooms are a bit tired; the towels are horribly stiff, no softener.  The Aveda products do not seem to be the normal quality, the keys of two people took about 5 tries to get them to work every time.  In short, it is not of normal Renaissance quality.  If you are going to spend the extra money, I recommend doing it somewhere else where you get what you pay for.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I went there three times in two days because you just have to see it at all the different times of the day! I recommend at night, but mornings are just as beautiful.

The drinks were good and strong and the bar has a nice view of the Times Square action.  All of the staff was hospitable.  My group had free coupons for one free drink and they were nice enough to honor the coupon after the allotted time period (some of us checked in late).  We were on the 25th floor and couldn't hear a thing from outside of the room.\n\nThe only bad part of the trip are the elevators.  They are slow.  We waited 15-20 minutes and that should've been a hint to take the stairs.  We didn't.  When we got on the crowded elevator (about 8 of us plus luggage) it stopped on every floor from 25 to 17, and then it got stuck.  We had to wait for about 30 minutes in that oppressively hot, claustrophobic space.  Some people became short tempered.  An older man became faint.  Someone kept calling us on the intercom every few minutes to ask if we were all right. They said the engineer was working on it.  After 20 minutes one of the guests called 911 for the fire department.  They arrived quickly and got us out.  I've never been so happy to see the New York fire department!  There were about 8 of them on the scene!  Management was there to give us free bottles of water (that they sell for an outrageous $8).  They were very apologetic.  My group had about 200 people and I guess we all descended upon the elevators at around the same time to meet in the lobby for a trip.  Still, it was a miserable experience.  At a later time during our stay, the staff on our floor (25) heard us by the elevator and let us (and other guests) onto the huge freight elevator which we all greatly appreciated!\n\nOverall, would I stay here again?  Absolutely.  The rooms were clean, the staff was professional, the breakfast food was pretty good and the drinks (apple martini for me) was nice and strong!  Great stay except for the elevator mishap.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

For starters, be aware that cab fare, Uber or even private limo services are going to cost you anywhere from $65-$85 one way from LGA to Times Square.  If you're paying more than that, you're either spending corporate dollars you don't care about, or you're not paying attention.  Find the right \"black car\" driver (as they're called) and he'll get you to TSQ faster than cabs by taking back roads to avoid traffic congestion and tolls.\n\nWhen you first walk in to the Renaissance, it's not exactly impressive.  But wait for it.  There's a little ground floor \"pre\" lobby that can't be more than 800sf.  This is where you check in.  From here you take the elevator up two floors to the real lobby.  :-)   This is a beautiful area that has a modest lounge, a great bar and a dining area that looks directly over Times Square.  The view alone for breakfast is indeed full of stimulus.  You'll love it.  \n\nThe rooms are standard Marriott rooms; clean, good bed, and great views.  The 4th floor has balconies.  It cost more money, but is a nice amenity. \n\nBreakfast Buffet is $30 pp.  Pretty good.  There are however a half dozen mom-pop breakfast nooks within a 2 minute walking distance if you're looking for something with local flavor and atmosphere.\n\nThe staff is one of the best staff I've encountered in my travels.  They are courteous, helpful, conversational and excellent at what they do from the door man to housekeeping to conceirge to the staff that check you in. Treat them as you would want to be treated and it comes back 10-fold.  Tammy was my person at the front desk check in.  Extremely charming, accommodating and efficient.  She made me feel like i was returning home.  That's not easy to do but she did it well.  It's a very comforting feeling that makes any potential small annoyances (which there were none) easily tolerable. \n\nYou're going to spend between $400 and $600 a night for the room.  But don't forget, you are in the very heart of Times Square which is the neon epi-center of tourism for NYC.  \n\nWalk north a few blocks and there's plenty of NYC iconic deli's, irish pubs and other attractions.  South a few blocks is the famous Carmine's restaurant (on 44th) as well as Sardi's lounge.  \n\nI would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Its located right on Times Square, my room on the 11th floor was never noisy and there was a lot happening down on TS, there is a subway station 49th street available a block away and also a couple of pharmacies 2 min away walking or less. The hotel once inside is simply beautiful and check in is NOT on the 8th floor like someone reviewed here earlier, you walk in and check in immediately, then take an elevator to the R Lounge\/consierge area and change elevators to your floor (if that's too much for you then sorry). The RLounge is simply elegant and the d\u00e9cor is pretty nice, excellent views of TS, I was given a voucher for a free item there but I was too busy to cash it in, sucks because the food I saw people eating looked delicious, I did have breakfast on my last day there which was amazing, plenty of good protein and carbs to choose from, worth the money. My room was really clean and smelled great, clean with plenty of accessories in the bathroom and blow drier too, I enjoyed the cabinet space and the size of the Simmons bed which was really comfortable, I wanted to take the pillow with me on the plane. The curtains are huge and dark so it prevents any light coming into the room from TS, I loved it, truly enjoyable. Everyone was real friendly and when it began to rain one of the men downstairs in the lobby offered me an umbrella so that was cool too. I would recommend that if you are getting a Uber, Lyft or taxi when you check out, walk a block over away from 7th\/broadway street because once you get on the car, you might be stuck on traffic for a while getting out to LGA airport. I had an 1115 departure, left the hotel at 0830 and barely made it because of the construction at LGA which is supposed to be bad for the next 2 years since supposedly they are tearing down Terminal B.

The location is right at the center of Times Square.  People can disagree about whether Times Square is a good place to stay in NYC, so I will not dwell on the location.\n\nYou enter the Renaissance at the street level.  The entry is a small room where you check in.  It can be very cramped, dark and crowded at times, depending on how busy they are.  You then go to the lobby by two elevators that go no higher than the lobby.  The elevators are very slow, and if there are lots of people checking in, it can take a long time to get to the lobby.  The lobby is a long narrow room with a concierge and a bar.  You must cross the lobby and go to another bank of 3 elevators to get to your room.  Again, if there are lots of people wanting to get to their rooms, it can take a long time to get to your room.\n\nI had a king room, and it was very small.  The headboard and furniture felt very worn, and the room felt very dark.  The bed was just fine.  Bathroom, soaps and shampoos were very good.\n\nOver all, the staff was friendly and helpful.  In fact, the staff was probably the best part about the Renaissance.\n\nWe had food brought into our meeting at the hotel.   Like a lot of \"meeting food\" it was just ok.  The bar\/restaurant has a GREAT view of Times Square, but one night there was a private event, and was denied access to the bar\/restaurant.  To me, this was totally unacceptable.  As a hotel guest, I felt like taking the entire facility for a private party was not fair to the rest of the hotel guests.\n\nFinally, the hotel did not have the \"posh\" feeling like I would expect at a Renaissance Hotel.  You expect above average accommodations.  At this hotel, accommodations and facilities were below average.  Stay there if you want to be ON Times Square.  But I expect that there are better options available in the area.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Had stayed here last Spring as well, did note changes since last stay, particularly re: access to R Lounge on 2nd floor...It is not accessible for food\/drink mid-day anymore - now opens at 5p.m.  If you stay on a club floor (or I suppose pay additionally for breakfast buffet @ 29.95), you do sit here for breakfast buffet which was included with our renaissance suite 25th of 26 floors) - staff extremely pleasant and helpful.  Food was tasty, but quite limited and pretty much the same each morning: rotated\/either: pancakes\/waffles\/french toast sticks;   scrambled eggs; pork sausage; bacon; FRESH fruit; dry cereals; OJ; breads\/bagels\/muffins; coffee\/tea.  Had cocktails here in the evening after show: VERY Expensive : $ 17.00 for a K1 on the rocks (YIKES); craft cocktails (e.g., mojito @ 15.50).  Bellmen were very friendly and engaging, apologized immediately for bags taking a \"bit too long\" to get up to our suite.  Suite had 2 full bathrooms (deciding factor in paying more for this vs. traditional room), though the \"master\" bedroom bathroom was handicap accessible, which meant that we had no bathtub, rather a wheelchair roll-in shower w\/ hand held water wand - did not expect this.  Also, the bathroom sink was lower to floor, with a very small (12\" in diameter at most) sink bowl, which resulted in water splashing down the front of vanity and on to the floor every time  you used the sink.  As with most hotels, and I still don't know why they do this, but there were NO (zero) wall hooks to hang clothes, towels, etc...I realize it's a handicap accessible bathroom, but NOT every guest who stays in this suite has a handicap. * There is NO view of Times Square from any (bed)room in this hotel, I don't think.. only views of side streets (7th Avenue- odd numbered rooms and Broadway  - even numbered rooms), so I would ask for even numbered room, better view of Broadway.  Though only 2 elevators from entrance lobby up to next bank of elevators to access hotel rooms, we never really had to wait too long for an elevator.  They did have a \"mini convenience store\" set-up on the 2nd floor outside the R Lounge during morning hours at least...bottled beverages, yogurts, fruit, sandwiches, etc. could be purchased (I don't remember them having this last Spring).\nThe location is AMAZING...Times Square is literally a walk across the street.  There is an Olive Garden right next door, same block as hotel; subway access as well.

They offer breakfast buffet or grab-n-go bags. It is nice that check out isn't until 12 noon. Good location right in the heart of Times Square but you can hear some street noise in room(we were on floor 22). Security lax. One night there was someone on street level door checking room keys as you entered but no one was there the next night. The elevators that go to the floors of the hotel has a card reader that is supposed to limit access to patrons only but it apparently didn't work.

So we finished our drinks and meal and got up 1045 pm to sit quickly at a front window so I could take pictures of my daughter with time square in the background and within minutes an employee came and asked me to leave that this table was now reserved ! I said I just wanted to take pictures and I was told earlier the restaurant closed at 11 pm! So a) why were we asked to leave? And b) I thought no reservations were possible for front row window?

The hotel rooms themselves are pretty standard and maybe a little tired. In fact, we had to ask to change rooms due to some musty smell in our original room(it had been hot\/muggy days in NYC, so perhaps this was part of the problem). The staff quickly accommodated the room change despite being almost full. \n\nAs a Marriott elite member, the Renaissance doesn't have a dedicated exec lounge, but uses the hotel's RLounge, with impressive views overlooking Times Square, for the elite benefits in addition to being the main bar\/lounge for the hotel. We did go to the RLounge on our late evening arrival for a glass of wine and some food. We were a little confused if the seating was just walk-in or if the seating was done by a host. It turns out there is a great hostess with mostest, Sylvia, that helped us get situated and took great care of us throughout our whole stay! We also had the privilege of being served two evenings in a row by Marlene, who is absolutely amazing - so attentive and personable. We really enjoyed getting to know both fine ladies (who work incredibly hard and long hours!) as well as the RLounge manager Dawson - they all really made our stay special. Please do ask for them when you go to the RLounge!\n\nHousekeeping staff was friendly and thorough.The Concierge was friendly in helping us figure out subways\/trains when we had a question. \n\nCertainly, we really enjoyed the central location and took advantage of the quick walk to TKTS right out front, the theaters, shopping, Hells Kitchen bars, and of course NYC Subway access to quickly get around town. \n\nWe will look forward to our next NYC trip and seeing the great staff at Renaissance.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Renaissance is located at the heart of times square, only two block from 5th Ave, 6 blocks from Central Park, and within easy walking distance of many iconic places such as Carnegie Deli, the Russian Tea Room, the Plaza Hotel. I doubt that there is a better location in Downtown. The entrance is funky as the street is always busy and crowded so parking is a real bummer. The check in desk is on the first floor and then you take and elevator to the next level where the main lobby is located and the elevator to the rooms are across the lobby.  It is done up in modern chic which I don't really care for but it is passable.  The room themselves are very comfortable with European style bedding.  Very soft mattresses which are super thick laid on a board, no box springs.\nThe bathroom is a little dated and could use some work but otherwise is sufficient.\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful and I would highly recommend this  hotel as a great place to stay in the heart of the theatre district.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Check-in is a breeze, friendly and accommodating check in clerks make your stay just what you expect.  Our room was smaller than we expected, but we should have anticipated a smaller room due to the fabulous location.  We loved our room with its black-out drapes and completely sound-proof windows.

Not only is it in the center of the major tourist attraction spot , you get to see Time Square view right from the Lounge . You get to see the NYC Time square red stairs(its actually the Broadway TKTS booking department below , but allows pedestrians to sit by having in as stairs above it - very smart way - and I absolutely love that place) and the awesomeness of the view cannot be described in words. Highfloor rooms are really amazing - it has these amazing sky scrapers view right from your very big glass pane - one side of the road facing rooms are completely made with glass allowing the beautiful view outside. The best part of Renaissance is its staff - they are really very sweet and friendly. I personally recommend Shamin who serves early morning in the Lounge. I have been noticing he is very caring with the people who enter lounge , give them water bottles , clean up the place and allow other people to be seated without making them wait long time and checks on you if got you all you need. I give him 5 out of 5 star. We need more people like that. the front desk staff is very friendly , down to earth and helpful with the queries you have.\nNo wonder it turned out to be my best place to stay if I am at NYC. Some very good restaurants around this place are  Indian - Pippali(129 E 27th st) ,Batti Grill , Sarvanaa Bhavan ,  Sake Bar Hagi(Japanese) , Toloache (Mexican) , La Masseria (Italian) , Tony's , Natsumi .","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Nothing special. The morning buffet was horrible. For $29, the hot food selection was limited to very poorly cooked eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. And, everything was cold. Worst breakfast ever.

After a short drive from JFK (just kidding), I dropped my bags at the desk and ashes for an early check in. The agent said she would do the best she could to expedite. Meanwhile, I'd take a walk around the block, grab a street dog, knock back a margarita and see a movie in RPX. \n\nPerfect timing, as when I returned, the room was ready. Now, while I'm not particular about being greeted as an Elite Rewards Member, I do expect to get everything that comes with the package. As I said, so far so good. \n\nYou enter on the street, then go up an elevator to the R Lounge area then swap over to the other elevator. \n\nSince there were 4 of us, 2 couples, and rooms in NYC are known to be small and we didn't want a double double, I got the Renaissance Suite, room 2302, on the 23rd of 25\/26 floors. It's like 2 rooms in one with. You enter into a spacious living room with sleeper sofa, TV, desk, bar, drawers, closest and full bathroom with a bathtub. Off to the left through double doors is a huge king room with chaise, plenty more storage space and huge full bathroom with spa inspired shower. The room was contemporary, clean, nicely decorated, great temperature and a city view. \n\nThe price was reasonable, alas, but it took some time. Here's a trick. \n\nTip: I booked this hotel in January for 4 nights through Marriott directly The rates varied each night. For all intents and purposes, it was about $2800. I was shocked, but comparing it to other rooms by location, square footage and style, it seemed reasonable. The only other room that came close was the Marriott Marquis. I also booked that suite to lock in and compare prices, it was a little smaller though and not as nice. I have a habit of continuously watching rates, so I checked the rates in February. The price went down, so I updated my booking, directly through the website. I checked again at the beginning of March and at the end of March, also updating each time. In the end, the price came down to $2000. All to say, if you book, anywhere, check back often as rates do change as demand changes. ","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I should add that a subway station is next to the hotel (on 49th) so getting around once you've arrived is easy.\n\nThe ground floor of the hotel consists of a modest reception, staffed but a rotation of wonderfully helpful staff. The lift takes you to a lounge, the bar and restaurant and further lifts that take you to the rooms.\n\nThe rooms themselves comfortably fit two double beds and are clean and do the job although lack a wow factor. The beds are wonderful. Despite the location, our room was quiet. The view from the bedroom consisted of a massive flashing billboard, which was blacked out when the curtains were drawn.\n\nMy wife cut her foot on the floor \u2013 nothing serious. The hotel responded with free breakfasts and fixed the floor immediately.\n\nWe were delighted with the free breakfasts \u2013 nothing special about the breakfasts per se, but the restaurant has a view of Time Square as good as any you will get. Worth checking out.\n\nSo all in all, great location, great staff, good service, rooms are fine. Perhaps we'd consider a hotel a little further from the action next time, but for a first trip with the kids this was ideal.\n\nBTW, sign up to Marriott rewards (as we did) for free wifi","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We made  arrangements in advance with another hotel that said could meet her needs. Sadly, when we arrived all of the rooms they stated were accessible were not. They made no attempt to assist us, so we walked around hoping against hope that we would find another hotel. We walked in to the Renaissance and asked if there were any accessible rooms, and if there was any chance there were any availabilities at the last minute. We were met by two very nice receptionists, one by the name of Fleridana. They immediately looked for availability and incredibly they not only found one but Fleridana  took us upstairs to insure that it was acceptable. The room was not ready but they assured us it would be ready in an hour. The head of housekeeping was in the room and showed my wife all of the accommodations. Fleridana was with us the entire time and came down to make the reservation. We were blown away by the first class customer service. The other hotel workers in the lobby were very friendly and helpful. The experience could not have been better for the two nights that we stayed.

As it was Times Square, you have to enter the small lower lobby to check in and then proceed up the elevator to the main lobby.  We are a Platinum Marriott card holder and checked in early at 1:30.  The Front desk associate was very accommodating by getting a King and two doubles close in location for our children, high marks for her.  However only one elevator was working to get guests up to the main lobby from the FREEZING lower lobby.  The rooms were nice and bathrooms updated which is nice for the price in NYC.  The lounges were our biggest frustration!!  We of course wanted to sit near a window and peer out over the square, as one does in a tourist hotel in Times Square.  This is no secret to the hotel staff.  However, we were rudely spoken to from the host and manager of the lobby bar.  We were told there was not enough servers to accommodate the guests.  Really?  No, I don't accept this when we are paying a huge surplus to be in that hotel.  Get someone from another department or call in staff.  Or, here's a thought how about the manager help out!!  He did nothing but tell people, \"no, you can't sit in that room.\"  Then they closed early on a long weekend and never gave us a last call.

One of the two lifts at reception level didn't work for our entire stay and on one evening both lifts failed...service stairs it is.....if you're thinking of booking because there is a gym - don't....the gym is out of action (they don't tell you when you book) so you end up on a running machine in a spare hotel room - weird.  Breakfast - $30 for a buffet breakfast....we didn't partake on the basis that breakfast would have cost us just under $100 a day - very good diner around the corner.....now the bar....their much advertised bar....nice bar but on our first evening as hotel guests turned away as we didn't have a reservation - the bar wasn't full.....asked if we needed to book for the following evening - told no - turned up - do you have a reservation?  No you told us we didn't need to book...eventually found a table - bar empty....very limited cocktail and wine list...and for a bar that thinks its great for its views, having a TV on one side of its glassed wall blocking the view is a bit odd.  The one evening the bar came alive it was for a private party which as a hotel  guest coming back after an evening out and wanting a nightcap I had to go through several layers of hotel security before then getting a drink.

I booked here for the weekend because I brought my adult daughter up and she wanted to see a show, A few days before arrival I called to get help booking theater tickets and Omar was amazingly helpful. Thanks, Omar. The Broadway theaters are within walking distance.\nIt takes 2 elevators to get to the rooms from the street which is quite inconvenient and off-putting. It would be great to know that from the website. The hotel also doesn't treat status members any differently than anyone else which is disappointing.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The rooms are well laid out with comfortable beds and a great pillow menu. The staff are extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the area. After checking you will take the elevator up one floor to a chic little lobby area. There is a great bookshelf and activities like a giant connect four game and some adult coloring sheets to keep you occupied during your downtime. There is also a restaurant and a lounge in the lobby area. Once you cross through the lobby head over to the elevators that will take you up to your room. \nThe only issue we had was the buffet for breakfast was overpriced for what you got. The hot meal items were lukewarm at best. Save your money  and walk a few blocks to Juniors.\nOverall I would highly recommend this hotel to couples and those interested in seeing the sights of Manhattan.

I also went to get a bite to eat when I arrived and the bar menu was really limited. I ordered 3 sliders which were ok, but they didn't give me silverware or condiments. When I asked, the woman grunted and slid some silverware my way and two McDonald ketchup pouches! Really, I mean first they don't have ketchup in a bottle and second they could give me 3 ketchups.
