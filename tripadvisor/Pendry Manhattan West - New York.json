The eye-catching facade is made up of undulating waves of floor-to-ceiling windows providing front facing rooms semi-circle window nooks. I admired my corner studio whose features included an open concept living plan with 1 500 sq. ft. footprint.  A cocooned window seating area was neat but the pinnacle amenity was the wall of floor-to-ceiling windows affording lots of natural light and superior vistas of the cityscape. The heavenly marbleized bath was outfitted with a soaker tub (by a window), walk-in shower and double vanity. A wide complement of eating\/drinking venues graces the Pendry. The sultry Bar Pendry is a classic waterhole where I enjoyed small bites and handcrafted drinks ......like the Moscow Mule.....kicked like a mule. The Garden Room is a casual relaxing space serving small bites, daytime coffee and evening cocktails. Zou Zou's, a well respected eatery, serves Eastern Mediterranean food-fare the likes of Duck Borek and fire roasted Leg of Lamb. I selected the Octopus Carpaccio, Smoked Cherry Baby Lamb Chops, Lemon Frozen Yogurt and Prosecco to wash it down.........a terrific food collage. Chez Zou is a premier cocktail lounge with unusual pairings like Bananas & Bourbon and Vermouth & Picked Cucumbers and others. The Vista Lounge is a modern dining space focusing on glorious breakfast food-fare for guests and locals alike. The Pendry wellness amenities feature a 24\/7 1700 sq. ft. Fitness Center and a Movement Studio with high-tech equipment and Peleton Bikes, the bikes can be requested in-room.\nSo, if you are searching for a Manhattan escape in high-end, California-inspired digs\n......................then try the .............Pendry..............a West Coast vibe in Manhattan.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

This very natural hotel setting which is clean and comfortable. The staff is easy going, kind, and helpful. \n\nThe environment is restful with a biophillic approach. Hardwood used on doors and drawers with a linseed type finish. Wool is used for the carpets and the beds have dust mite zipped covers on the mattress. There are no strong chemical odors of any kind. The doors are heavy and alleviated hallway noise. The housekeeping was excellent and turn down service thoughtful with children\u2019s slippers and macaroons complimentary every night. \n\nThe only thing I would say is the lotion and soaps are heavy with perfume so bring your own if sensitive. The bar soap was the only product we used. The lobby is a little cold in winter but on 4th floor you have comfortable cozy restaurant. They could fix this possibly this with entry heaters or supplemental in their garden lounge. The shared public restrooms are all male\/female which left a lot of pee on the seats. I think better attention could be spent in this area or designation for sexes would be helpful or plan on using your room if you have small children as I do. \n\nThe food is excellent farm to table options without organic listed. The restaurant staff including wait staff are very welcoming and polite. Reservations required for main dining Zou Zou. It\u2019s excellent! My only complaint here was watching the expediter touch things like a marker and items handed to her by staff then place her bare hands into the herbs and food bowls. I know I\u2019m a germ a phobe by many standards but this is how people get sick. \n\nLocation is near Hudson Yard with an emphasis on sustainability. The Edge is one of NYC\u2019s latest attractions which was worth the ticket price is not too crowed as when we visited the lines were not long. There is a Whole Foods with in steps of the hotel which was great for glass bottled water and necessary items. The Pendry uses plastic bottled water but provides plenty  in the rooms. \n\nThe nearby shopping is all the usual big chain suspects with high end luxury on 1st floor. Our favorite store is Falconeri cashmere on the 2nd level which had great clearance sale for winter goods at the time of our visit 1st week in January. \n\nApprox 20 minute ride to the West Village and Central Park but near the High Line. City Bikes offered right out the door. It\u2019s very easy to get a cab at the Hudson Yard Shopping district and of course easy to get an Uber from this location late night. \n\nWe will definitely stay here again.

I am not a New York expert in any way shape or form and there are obviously a LOT of hotels there, so I spent quite a long time looking for the right place.  I think the first choice most of us have is what budget we have to spend.  Do you want to spend USD200 - USD400 to stay in a Hilton, Omni,  Sheraton etc type of hotel, USD400 to USD600 to stay somewhere a step up from that or USD600+ to stay in one of the best hotels.  If you are taking that first step up and pay more than the standard then the hotel has to be worth it and I think the Pendry was!  My reasons why are below:-\n\nLocation - This was one of the most important factors for me.  Once again I am not a NY expert but I kind of figured out that most of the things I would want to see, places to go shopping or restaurants to go eat were somewhere between Washington park and the bottom of Central Park.  Given that there would be some days I might not want to walk or get the metro but get an Uber I wanted somewhere that was sort of in the middle of that area and therefore accessible via Uber (which is very expensive!).  The second thing was that reading reviews on here people would complain about coming out of their hotel around Times Square\/Midtown and being met by sights they did not want to see\u2026.The Pendry is in a quiet, clean street with high class offices and a business square behind it so was basically in a perfect and safe location.\n\nRoom - As we weren\u2019t planning on spending lots of time in the room it didn\u2019t matter to us to book a luxury room.  We stayed in the standard room which was spacious, tastefully decorated, with a nice view over the office square behind the hotel.  The shower was powerful and constantly hot.  The room was clean on our arrival and well cleaned during our stay there.  The room was also quiet, the bed was large and comfortable and the black out curtains cut out the light and the air conditioning was perfect so you could have the quality sleep there that you would expect from a hotel this level.\n\nThe rest of the hotel - We didn\u2019t chose to eat in the hotel and didn\u2019t use any of the facilities really but the gym was big and it had a couple of nice looking bars that would have been good to have a late night drink in.  Given the huge choice of places to eat in NY, perhaps the hotel could think a little bit outside of the box to incentivize guests to go and eat at the restaurant\u2026\n\nThe service\/staff - We aren\u2019t demanding\/fussy guests so had limited interactions with the staff other than at check in where Violet was very nice and efficient and managed to find us a room when we arrived early which was hugely appreciated and at check out where Luis was super professional and just left us with a great final impression.  The hotel also took a few different deliveries for us and held and delivered all of them for us efficiently and professionally.\n\nMy experience was that for the price band you pay for the Pendry there is nothing I could really fault the hotel for and did not regret spending the extra.  I would definitely stay there again and wish the hotel and all the staff there huge continued success!","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We were going to a show at MSG so if we\u2019d been provided a more realistic time frame, we would have skipped the order.\n\n* I called before we left the hotel to request the tray\/food be removed from the room. When we came back hours later, it was still there (gross)\n\n* the mini bar had a $13 restocking fee (!)  and sales tax applied on top of the (already very high) prices so the items were actually about 30% more expensive than listed.

The location was great, we travel to NYC by Amtrak and the hotel is just across 9th avenue from the new station, making it really easy to travel with luggage.  Hotel is very close to the Highline which we really enjoyed, and walking distance to The Edge, the Vessel, Little Island Park.   The rooms were spacious (for NYC) and the hotel is clean and new.  The staff is not at all engaging with guests and they certainly don't go out of there way to offer you any help, insights, or to check in to see if there is anything they can offer to help with your stay.  That aspect of the hotel is rather disappointing and which is why I rated it average.  The service doesn't even compare to that of the Ritz Carlton or the Four Seasons, or other high end hotels that would be in the relative similar price range.  We are staying at the Baltimore Pendry for the first time next weekend, I will be curious to see if the experience is different or similar.  \n\nOverall, great location if you are looking to stay near the Highline, Hudson Yards, or walking distance to Meatpacking district.

The bathroom in the Suite included a soaking tub, double vanity with drawers, shower room w\/both a rain shower and hand held shower.

Relatively new hotel with high end design located close to Hudson Yards and High Line. Really attentive and welcoming staff. Amenity\/Transition areas of the hotel are quite compact and seating around reception can get quite busy. Rooms are extremely well furnished and beds comfortable. Rooms have separate shower and toilet areas but the shower wasnt particularly hot. Our main gripe was most of the rooms are arranged around quite a tight lift core and despite being new the lifts appeared quite noisy and in need of a bit of maintnenace. Everytime somebody exited through the night you could hear the lift squeaking and dinging away which isnt particularly condusive to a good nights sleep. The hotel is located in an area of new office developments so the bars and restaurants always seemed quite busy and quite buzzy. We did however get refused entry to the 4th floor roof terrace one evening because of a drinks event. Its not particularly good when you seem to be prioritising non staying guests over staying ones particularly when you are charging circa \u00a3750 per night. All in all the hotel has potential but some of the basics informaing a good stay need addressing.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

If traveling from NJ via the Lincoln Tunnel, once you exit the tunnel, you are almost there.  This is especially great if you're not a fan of tedious Manhattan traffic before reaching your destination.  I'll be honest, back in the day, this area used to be a bit dodgy (sandwiched out between Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea), but it has now been redeveloped into a Swanky, Safe and Clean little pocket of Midtown Manhattan Heaven! Hudson Yards is just a block away with fabulous sites, shopping, restaurants and beauty salons.  \n\nThe Staff is PERFECT.  So welcoming, kind,  helpful, resourceful, respectful and discreet.  No judge zone here, and everyone goes the extra mile to make sure your stay is as comfortable as it can possibly be.  I will not begin naming everyone who I had the pleasure of meeting, as this will take up at least 500 more characters on this page - but you know who you are :)) !!  Thank you for making my 2 stays here so incredibly perfect!\n\nWhat else.  The Amenities are just FABULOUS.  From the Restaurant to the Bar with the kindest Waitstaff, to the beautiful Fitness Center with magnificent High Line and NYC views.  \n\nAnd then the Rooms.  OMG, the views are ridiculous, the beds are oh-so comfortable (not too hard, not too soft, just right), the bathrooms gorgeous with fabulous designer toiletries out of pump bottles, rather than the annoying little throw aways in the shower (because you can't get anything out of them).  At night during turn down, there are delicious little macarons nestled on your pillowcase, and there is always tons of really good bottled water, so you don't have to dip into the mini bar. \n\nLast but probably 'a quite important' for many .... AMAZING lighting and mirrors.  This does so much for your esteem to know as long as you wake up, stay, and go to bed here, you will look glowing, refreshed and a tad more slender than your usual.  Haha!  Big smile.  You can also change the lighting to daytime, evening, etc.in the bathrooms, and this is great for makeup application for those who wear make up.  They really nailed it with this one.  \n\nLove, love, love the Pendry Manhattan West and everyone who works there!  I can't wait to return!  <3","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Great common areas behind the hotel. Location is also great to access Hudson Yards. 4th floor bar terrace is beautiful and Zou- Zou is great. \n\nCons- lobby smells like a bbq restaurant at all times from the Zou Zou wood burning oven. 4th floor is frequently unavailable because of \u201cprivate\u201d events - without notice. Bar Pendry staff was less than accommodating 15 minutes before their stated closing time on a Friday night. Hotel fronts the tunnel entrance so traffic gets snarled there at times and getting a ride share\/cab or being dropped off can be really problemtic. \n\nWanted to love the experience given the reviews and accolades, but came away very, very underwhelmed. Not a good value for the price and they could use a bit more hospitality training to focus on client service and a 5 star experience. Had several borderline rude encounters with various staff (Bar Pendry) and 4th floor restaurant workers (the patio servers were great) that shocked us as guests of the hotel. \n\nWith other true 5 star options in the city and the glaring negatives, we will not be back.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The problem with this property is form over function. The staff were all so wonderful and so helpful and really went above and beyond. It's the room itself that's the problem.\n\nFirst of all please be very cautious because what looks like a refrigerator isn't really a refrigerator. Most of us know about the mini bar in hotels. This is different. If you take anything off of the shelf in the fridge and keep it out for over 60 Seconds you get charged for it. I think cokes were $9 Plus a 20% restocking fee. Waters with Pendry branding were either $12  or $14 plus the 20% fee. Repackaged drugstore candy like MnM's and sour gummies in plain little tins that hold maybe a handful of candy cost $18 between the cost of the item and the restocking fee.\n\nDo not put anything in this refrigerator. If you do you can throw off the sensors and end up charged. You have to contact housekeeping if you want a fridge in your room. \n\nI still have no idea how to get ice there, absent calling downstairs for it. I think they'd bring you a baby elephant if you asked. Maybe the Lost Ark, even. The service is \n great. \n\nThere is just no comfortable place in the room unless you like extremely soft beds. They are ok to sit on for a bit. That's it for me at least. I like\/need reasonably firm beds. I woke up every day in increasingly intense pain and with an ever-increasing sleep deficit that made me so fatigued I didn't have the energy to do anything while I was in New York. In fact I woke up so often during the night I'm not sure I ever got any deep sleep. The last night at about 5 in the morning with tears running down my face involuntarily, I pulled the velcroed-on cushion from a little bench in the room and tried to lay on the floor, but that wouldn't work either as it was too small. I think they have soldered the comforter to the mattress somehow so I couldn't lay on that on the floor either. \n\nThere is a little bench that's kind of built into the wall and looks like something you find in one of those tiny homes. There was only 1 chair, in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows that make up the whole outer wall. It is small, orange, and turns in a full circle. Neither the bench nor the chair are comfortable for sitting. \n\nThis was the most uncomfortable I have ever been in my entire life. It was worse than middle school. It kind of ruined my trip.\n\nThat being said, if you like extremely soft beds you may be okay. ","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

A house car was provided, free of charge, so we could avoid taxis\/Uber. The overall esthetic was incredibly warm, swanky, and sharp. \n\nI would like to make special mention of one particularly lovely moment. We had room service delivered by a gentleman named Rotimi. Rotimi and I had a brief but pleasant exchange where I shared it was my birthday, we were going to see a show, and that my fianc\u00e9e is pregnant. He was incredibly warm and kind and shared some words of celebration and congratulations. \n\nLater that evening, when we returned from the show, we found that Rotimi had arranged a little gift be sent to our room. If that wasn\u2019t special enough, he had left a handwritten note with well wishes for us in this exciting chapter of our lives. \n\nI wish there was more that I could do to show my genuine appreciation and gratitude to Ro. It was a simple gesture that had an amazing impact and was the cherry on top of a lovely stay with Pendry.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

What an amazing establishment. Service was 100% from beginning to end. Violet at the front desk was an absolute delight to talk to and she made sure we were well taken care of and answered all of our questions. The hotel is brand new so you can still smell the fresh new scent. The rooms are so amazingly clean and much bigger than other hotels rooms in NYC being that I\u2019ve stayed in different hotels in New York! Upon arrival they sent us a bottle of champagne to celebrate Christmas\/birthday with the most amazing note written by hand by McCord! He is so sweet and attentive. The common area with all the plants sets such a relaxing vibe to the hotel wether you\u2019re just chilling, reading or enjoying a cup of coffee. We did order room service and the entire experience was absolutely amazing, please try the burger or the pancakes or both!! The bar is a whole different vibe, what I loved about it was the intimacy of it. I really really enjoyed chatting with Chris at the bar and he made me a delicious drink which I cannot remember the name lol \nAt some point we got back to the room to drop something off and we crossed paths with the housekeeping and they asked us if we needed more ice for our champagne that we haven\u2019t yet opened and I told them in two hours would be great, and in exactly two hours we had a knock at our door by someone bringing us ice\u2026 it\u2019s the precision and attention to details for me. \nLastly I wanted to thank all the door men for being so helpful and attentive, and thanks to especially IsMael( can\u2019t remember if that was really his name) very sweet guy and very personable\u2026  We can\u2019t wait to go back \u2665\ufe0f\nThank you to the whole Pendry team","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

After considering many 5 star options we decided to stay at the Pendry and our only regret was that we didn\u2019t stay there our entire visit! From the moment we arrived we were greeted like family. Juan made us feel incredibly special, and we loved our welcome drink (with the optional \u201cspike\u201d from the bar)! Sasha, the hotel driver, took us to our lunch when it was \u201ctoo cold to walk\u201d, and the front desk staff, Paul, Violet, Aaron or John warmly greeted us every time we were welcomed back from our daily adventures. The rooms are perfectly appointed (I love the split bathroom concept) and the bed and sheets were heavenly. Every evening our rooms were turned down with the blinds closed for privacy, a sweet surprise and complimentary water (and slippers) next to the bed, and soft music playing with the lighting left on so we wouldn\u2019t have to stumble into a dark room. Lastly, there are fabulous dining\/bar options in the hotel as well as nearby, like Citizens and Whole Foods, and we visited the high line and Hudson yard during our stay. If you are considering Equinox or any other luxury hotel in Manhattan I cannot imagine a more perfect hotel than the Pendry. I, personally, will not stay anywhere else from now on!","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It starts with the great service when you walk through the door. I was so impressed that within 15 minutes of arriving every staff member knew our name. The check in was fast and perfectly arranged. The desk and door staff are incredibly attentive. The hotel has only been open one month and everything was perfectly curated. \nThe hotel is magnificent and so calming and relaxing. The lobby is an oasis of calm right in the middle of busy New York. It has a relaxed California vibe throughout with its muted tones and simple but luxurious comfort. The hotel is also super quiet with no crowds at all which is very welcomed during Covid.\nThe rooms are outstanding with light woods and muted tones. The beds are amongst the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The room size although not large was very spacious by New York standards. The technology and lighting are all state of the art.\nThe bathroom although not large was well laid out with a nice size walk in shower. The bathroom amenities provided are first class. \nWe ate breakfast in the lounge each morning of our 3 day stay. The surroundings are beautiful. The food and service was simply outstanding. \nThe location has you right in the middle of Hudson Yards which is an area of Manhattan that has been virtually re-built. You are surrounded by brand new sparkling buildings, shopping, eating and just about anything else you could want. Right around the corner from the hotel is Citizens food court with the finest food court food I have seen, Whole Foods is also there along with the Hudson yards shopping complex being a half a block away. If that isn't enough you can quickly and easily access the High Line. The hotel is also 2 blocks away from MSG and Penn Station. You are right in the middle of everything. \nThis is a first class hotel in every sense, it is the new standard in Manhattan. I will never stay at another Manhattan hotel after having stayed at the Pendry. It is a quiet, calm and beautiful hotel right in the middle of it all.  It is expensive but well within what 5 star hotels in New York will cost you. The Pendry is worth every penny, you won't find better. Well done Pendry!\n","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I'll start by saying Manhattan is so curious because you have those \"institutions\" or staples of hotels & restaurants that between us I find stale, antiquated and frankly extortionate for what you get in return (you know the ones 25 dollars for an unimaged cocktail with torn leather seats that hasn't update their menu since Nick Noltey was the \"sexiest man alive\" but people still like to been seen there for whatever reason ... you know the ones \ud83d\udc40) which is why I was buzzing to try a spanking new hotel. The space itself is actually really thoughtfully designed and despite being more modern (no dated drab browns or suffocating drapes here) it is still classic in a New York way. All the tones are calming and the common spaces inviting. I eventually hung out in the front lobby to do some work and the vibe was nice. I was in town just for a few days but concluded every evening with a drink at Bar Pendry, a cozy intimate bar complete with a fireplace. This hotel is what I use to love about some of the hotels here that IMO sort of lost their way the past five years (I won't name names but a few are in SoHo \ud83d\udc40) - it isn't pretentious but still has a special feeling to it, you feel * something * when you're there. The guest room itself was spacious and everything was conveniently placed. The rain shower and soaking tub are to die for - especially if you've had a long flight or busy work week. The location is great too if you're in town for leisure too bcs you're perfectly set in the middle whether you're in the mood to go uptown or downtown. The hotel is really what luxury New York hotel should be - buzzy but not overwhelmingly so, attentive staff but not stuffy or buttoned up, good food and drink - and of course a fireplace.

I am a 15 year veteran of the city and would never in a million years have thought this was a good location, but it somehow is! A block from Madison Square Garden, not on my usual list, but very convenient for my daughter\u2019s Harry Styles concert. Just up from the village, my favorite stomping grounds, but only a few blocks from the theater district, which should only be  visited for theater. The entrance to the Highline and Hudson yards are steps away. So, the location is actually quite good.  \n\nBut the hotel as a whole gives off a very warm feel. The decor is extremely calming and polished. The staff are exceedingly attentive and really make all the difference. As one would expect of a Montage property, they immediately remember who you are and what you like. However, I have discovered that even though I expect that level of service from many high end establishments, I rarely actually receive it, but I did here. \n\nThe rooms are lovely. Thoughtful floor plans in all of them. We are a large group and have 2 double rooms, a king room and a corner studio. All of the rooms are far larger than a typical NYC hotel room with an incredibly well thought out floor plan. But the kicker in these rooms is the rounded window. Photos do not do it any justice. It makes the room feel incredibly expansive and takes full advantage of those amazing NYC views.\n \nTo sum it up, this is an absolute treat to stay in Manhattan.

Even on departure, Juan (the bellman door gentleman) was so endearing that all the way to my car door I felt the staff were super happy to be working there and it showed. The design is so soothing (lots of light natural wood colors to their green plants that give NY the feel of California) and the lighting in the evening is super warm and inviting. Bar Pendry is very cool and their pebble ice made my drink look super fancy (never knew of pebble ice!). Evelyn at Zou Zou's is one of the bartenders that was super engaging and interesting!  Staff is typically what makes a luxury hotel and Pendry Manhattan West has both; service and design which makes the best of both worlds. \n\nI am not new to Montage, yet new to staying at Pendry brand and pleased to have! A must try!","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Loved the Pendry Hotel and loved the overall Hudson Yards area.  Whole Foods close by was so convenient.  Overall excellent experience at the hotel.  Very friendly, professional and knowledgeable staff.  Always willing to research further to give me a complete answer.  The rooms were beautiful adn felt luxurious.  Extremely cozy bed, spacious bathroom and good closet space. The best housekeeping experience I have ever had at a hotel - my room was sparkling clean and immaculate every day.  Very impressive.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was one of the first guests to check in and have to say, what I thought five-star hotels should be has completely changed. From the moment I walked in, everyone was extremely welcoming and accommodating. The hotel, the restaurant, the rooms are so luxurious and the service was impeccable. I have stayed at many five-star hotels and have never experienced service like what I had at the Pendry Manhattan West. I have cancelled my NYC marathon hotel and rebooked at the Pendry. I cannot wait to come back and experience it all over again. ","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The staff was warm and welcoming, the building stunning, and the location, perfect for events at the Garden, or conducting business in the nearby office buildings of Hudson Yards. The rooms are very spacious (Especially for New York), and have the latest tech available (GIANT TVs in all rooms, and very fast WIFI). If you find yourself needing a place to stay in this part of town,  I would certainly consider the Pendry!","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
