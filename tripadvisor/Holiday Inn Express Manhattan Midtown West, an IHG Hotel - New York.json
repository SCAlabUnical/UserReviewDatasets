The hotel itself was comfortable, clean and warm. \n\nRoom - Bedroom was a reasonably decent size and bed itself was very comfortable. There was a sofa in the room. There was a coffee maker and in room safe. Rooms were cleaned daily and there was a fresh supply of clean towels. \n\nFood - Food wise the hotel provided a hot and cold breakfast with a mix of omelettes, cinnamon buns (warm), scrambled eggs etc. Tea and coffee was available at reception 24 hrs. Breakfast was served from 630 to 930am . One criticism was that cutlery and plates were disposable ie plastic which felt quite cheap. During our stay the hotel seemed to be a base for a number of school trips which made breakfast quite busy often with queues for food. Seating also quickly filled up and on at least one occasion we had to go elsewhere. There is external seating but in February it was a little cold. . The reception also has a 24 hr vending machine offering drinks and sweets.\n\nRoom tip - One other small point was that our room was located next to the lift and also had an ice machine on the 9th floor so that made the floor quite noisy though we were often so tired after our days out that it did not overly disturb us. Ask for a room away from lift and not on a floor that has an ice machine. \n\nStaff - staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. We had an issue with our bath and it was  fixed shortly after I reported it. One thing to note is, it was not immediately obvious how the shower worked. There is an attachment under the tap in the bath which you pull down but we had to ask at reception. We noticed subsequent to our enquiry guests checking in were given a demonstration at reception of how the shower worked. \n\nStaff can also arrange a Town Car to the JFK airport for circa $85. \n\nLocation - The hotel was on west 48th street and circa 10\/11 avenue roughly 4 blocks from Times Square which was an average walk of 15 mins as was Port Authority. Nearest subway was 50th street.  For us the hotel was a little far out. Our personal preference is to be located a little closer to Times Square. \n\nOverall thoughts, setting aside our personal preference location wise, decent hotel with pleasant and helpful staff, comfortable and clean accommodation.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Molto comodo per l'Intrepid Sea Air & Space Museum che si raggiunge in 5 minuti a piedi. Per il resto esperienza negativa fin dall'arrivo dato che a fronte di una prenotazione per due camere (eravamo in 5) la ragazza della reception con fare saccente e scortese continuava a dire che ne avevamo solo una prenotata. Abbiamo perso pi\u00f9 di mezz'ora tra telefonate in Italia (dove era notte fonda) e solo dopo l'intervento del tour operator \u00e8 salata fuori la seconda camera. E qui altra nota dolente: camere minuscole con un piccolo armadio in cui non \u00e8 possibile riporre nulla dato che \u00e8 occupato dall'asse da stiro, moquette fatiscente e pulizia fatta a piacimento: per i primi tre giorni ci hanno pulito la stanza poi basta. Quando abbiamo chiesto spiegazioni ci \u00e8 stato detto che andava fatta richiesta alla reception il giorno prima. E i primi tre giorni come mai \u00e8 stata rifatta allora? A onor del vero molto comodi i letti e anche il Wifi funzionava bene. Gli ascensori sono due e presi d'assalto per\u00f2 ci sono scale comode dato che l'hotel non ha tanti piani. Ma il capitolo peggiore in assoluto riguarda la colazione: la sala \u00e8 minuscola per il numero di ospiti presenti e offre pochi prodotti che una volta finiti non vengono riforniti. Il personale non ha colpe, \u00e8 molto gentile e disponibile, se ci si lamenta alla reception ti rispondono che loro non centrano, bisogna andare a lamentarsi in cucina (!!!) ma possibile?? Noi siamo scesi in 5 giorni a orari diversi tra le 7:15 e le 8:30 e la situazione era sempre la medesima, una coda infinita che a un certo punto si bloccava dato che mancava tutto e bisognava attendere che arrivasse qualcosa da mangiare. L'ultimo giorno abbiamo rinunciato perch\u00e9 avevamo un treno da prendere. Se decidete di soggiornare qualche giorno in questo hotel perch\u00e9 il prezzo \u00e8 accattivante non prendete la colazione: eviterete uno stress inutile che potrebbe rovinarvi la vacanza.

I had a confirmed reservation for the night of July 19th as I had a meeting in the area on the morning of the 20th. There must have been events going on in the city as hotel rates were very high and it was impossible to find a cab. I finally found one and just as I was approaching the property, I received a call from George at the front desk telling me that the hotel was oversold and had no rooms available. I mentioned I was right outside and he said even if I came in, they would have no room to give me. I told him I had a confirmed reservation and reminded him of the IHG Guarantee which clearly states on its website the following \n\n\"Booking on IHG.com is the best way to guarantee your room. If for any reason your reservation cannot be honoured, IHG will provide you with a room and transportation to another convenient and comparable hotel. And, we\u2019ll pay for the full cost of the first night\u2019s lodging price, plus tax. Any advance deposit will be refunded to you.\"\n\nGeorge told me he could not help me and that he was cancelling my reservation and I was on my own to find another place to stay. I reminded him of the IHG walk policy and mentioned I was a loyal Diamond Elite member, but it did not matter. I ended up having to find alternate accommodations in an inconvenient part of the city. I had to pay for another taxi ride to the hotel late in the evening. I wasted considerable time and money as a result of the hotel's error.\n\nI am not sure why IHG has the above stated guarantee when hotels do not honor the policy.

On arrival we were seen swiftly and smoothly and given the key card to our room on the 4th floor.\n\nIt was around 6pm at the time so we went straight out to grab a bite to eat before having an early night ahead of what would be a busy first day in NYC.\n\nIn the morning we woke early around 06.30am for a shower prior to the complimentary breakfast before heading out. Unfortunately, our shower had no hot water coming from it but the water from the sink tap was boiling hot. We informed the reception in person when we went down for breakfast, and they advised that they would send an Engineer up immediately. At breakfast there was not enough tables to accommodate the guests that were eating and the selection was rather sparse, people were also coming in off the street from the salvation army hostel across the road helping themselves, so we grabbed a couple of yoghurts and headed back to the room to wait for the Engineer because we were extremely keen to get going so not to miss our pre-booked 9\/11 memorial tour reservation.\n\nA member of staff arrived around 08:00am and I\u2019m sure it was the same guy that had been restocking the breakfast bar. My husband demonstrated to him the water issue and then the \u2018so called\u2019 Engineer said that they would look at it while we were out. When we arrived back around 19.30pm at the hotel after a long and extremely cold day walking around NYC we found that no one had been up to the room to sort the issue with the water from the shower and so we still had no hot water. My husband went down to reception again to inform them and a different Engineer was sent up to look and was unable to fix the issue (second night with no hot water to the shower).\n\nIn the morning we had to use the sink to wash as this water was hot, but reception again advised they would fix the problem whilst we were out in NYC.\n\nwe returned from our afternoon out in NYC, we still had no hot water - day 3!!!! After raising this again with reception and another hotel handy man arriving to have another attempt, we asked to see the Duty Manager and was informed that \u2018Suzanne\u2019 would be at the hotel at 09:00am the next morning and we could speak to her about the water issue. However, the receptionist then informed us that we could move rooms. We reluctantly agreed to this proposal even though it was our last day in NYC. We then gathered our luggage and transferred (without assistance) up to the 9th floor so we could take a hot shower and relax without the interruption from the Engineer, and after another extremely long and cold day in NYC. The time now was 21:30pm and we have just entered the new room, tired, dirty, and totally exhausted!!\n\nUnfortunately for us our last day was again disrupted because we had to hang around until 09:00am to speak to the Duty Manager \u2018Suzanna\u2019 I also left a voice message on her voice mail, but she never had the decency to reply so I never got the opportunity to complain directly to a Manager even though we asked to speak to one on several occasions.  Suzanna didn\u2019t actually turn up!! and we were seen by a Deputy Supervisor who said she had been in the hotel the whole week and why didn\u2019t we just ask to move rooms. We explained that we had been constantly raising the situation with reception and at no time had we been offered to move rooms until the previous night.  She didn\u2019t seem interested and was quite rude and dismissive and as we were not getting anywhere decided to just leave the hotel for the day so that we could enjoy what remained of our holiday.\n\nOverall, it was an extremely disappointing experience at this hotel with us only taking one hot shower over the 4 days stay in NYC, and a yoghurt for breakfast!!  This place is by no means a cheap and cheerfully priced hotel to stay at. It is in a prime location 5-10 minutes\u2019 walk from all the main attractions. We expected so much more but were let down by the staff who most definitely require training in good customer care.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When my 21-year-old daughter got into bed she noticed on her sheet a large (unwashed) blood stain. We attempted to get help from the front desk and housekeeping. Nobody was available.

We were unable to get a hold of the manager Susanna McKoon (who started at 9:00 a.m. the next day) until late afternoon. Hoping to return to a clean room, we were sadly mistaken. The room wasn't cleaned until just before dinner. We had piles of dirt at the entrance to our room, a partial used condom on the carpet and filth everywhere. Nothing is cleaned properly, with a layer of dust on all surfaces. I was told by Susanna McKoon that we would receive a refund for a mere $200, which I find insulting and also yet to receive.

Had I been told that there is an option to waiting for a relocation, I would have not booked a place with sheer panic and urgency. Perhaps, I shouldn't utilize a third party booking system as they don't seem to communicate with the hotel for the sake of continuity for the customer. Sadly, I had to escalate via Travelocity and will update my review. Perhaps, this is a lesson to understand that communication has suffered over the years and to be wary of making such travel arrangements. \n\nMaking informed decisions based on communication is essential for functioning.

Only took 1 bus as it was almost as slow as walking.\nBreakfast was annoying, the dining area is way too small for the hotel, we went down 8:15 and there were no seats free and the place only got busier for the next hour. Something needs to be done.\nThe room was fine, fresh sheets and towels every day, popcorn and water during the afternoons at reception, although this seemed to disappear on a night so I ended up paying 4 dollars for a water at reception to take to bed.\nUnfortunately the coffee never seemed to get topped up late morning and only decaf was left.\nThe lifts were slow and we decided to walk to the third floor every time because of this.\nTV was good, used it once during a rainy day, got sports channels and movies.\nLuggage was stored until 4pm on our final day before catching our flight home which helped a lot.\nThere is a gym to the right of the lifts near reception. Popped my head in and found some kids bouncing on the exercise balls using them like space hoppers, pretty much pointless going in there. Think there was just a treadmill and another couple of cardio bits.\nTheres a fridge in the room.\nBed was very firm  with 2 big pillows and I found it hard to sleep with them. 1 firm one soft. Neither was nice.\nThe shower was amazing, very powerful, I think the water was very hard so take moisturiser and something for your lips if you're going in winter, mine chapped up in a day.\nOverall a decent stay but nothing special. Have to say the breakfast situation annoyed me the most though, standing with a paper plate waiting for a seat, queues for the pancake machine, and toaster. Rubbish.\nAt least you get a breakfast included and dont pay taxes ontop of your room fee.\n\nAverage.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Reasons below why we would not stay at this hotel again:\n- although expecting smaller room, we were shocked how small a room for a family would be. 2 adults and 2 teenagers with all our luggage was almost impossible. Room size would of been fine had it of been for 2 people with only 1 bed.\n- on first day we realised that the bath plug switch did not work to stop water escaping meaning we could only take showers. I know this is not the end of the world but given the miles of walking each day and sore feet, a hot bath at the end of it was preferred. Reported this issue to reception several times but nobody came to resolve in the 5 nights we were there. \n- we opted out of room cleaning on Christmas Day to give cleaning staff a day off, however, the sign sheet advised that reception would be available should you need anything. We required a fresh towel, which was requested and was advised it would be brought up to room, but it never arrived! \n- we were fully aware as per previous reviews that breakfast service would be busy so on the few days we got up extra early, we managed to get seats. A few days we opted to grab food to take back to room due to how busy it was, which we were happy to do but did not appreciate constantly being barged out the way by staff refilling the buffet items ( at one point being literally pinned against cupboard by cupboard door member of staff was trying to get something in to) \nAll above points above would\u2019ve been raised at checkout, however no \u201chow was your stay?\u201d Etc that we are used to when staying at other holiday inns so simply took that as last straw in us not returning the next time we are in New York. \nDuring our USA trip we went on to stay at 3 other ihg hotels and had great experiences so extremely disappointed that this is where we chose for our Xmas break when there several other ihg alternatives within the city. \n","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Knowing they were all in their early 20's and not wanting to rat them out, my roommate and I opened our door and asked them to knock it off.  They promised to - but didn't.  The next morning we noticed a sign that said there were quiet hours between 10pm and 7am , and there was a \"one strike\" policy. On our way out to start a VERY BUSY DAY full of appointments, I stopped by the desk where I was told this group was as loud on Thursday night.  Huh???

At 06.30h next morning we were awoken by a drilling machine\/pile driver on a construction site appx 100yds from our 10th floor bedroom.I asked reception to move us and was told to re-pack our cases and leave them at reception before 11am and we would be re-located.At appx 8am I saw a supervisor who them told me we shouldnt have been told that as they were fully booked and so no other rooms were available. I agreed to be moved on Thursday. Next day at 05.00h we were awoken by an alarm call that we had not ordered. Apparently it was an error by a \"colleague\" at the hotel. Each morning there was a queue of guests asking to be moved, some quite old all being the same thing. \"cases to reception by 11am \" but there were never going to be any rooms available. Dont fall for this one. Insist that you be moved. The site had been worked on for over 4 weeks prior to our visit so it was a \"known\" issue and will be worked on for at least 6 months. This is unacceptable as it is standard practice to advise on any issues that might affect a guests stay and allow cancellation if they wish. The hotel's response to Expedia (who I had e.mailed on day 1 and who called me back at 5am on day 3!!!) was that the construction was not on the hotel premises so was not their problem. Try telling that to a guest that cannot get to sleep past 6.30am each day. Also on morning 3 it was 5am when the first concrete trucks arrived. Rest of the stay was fine as was the room which was the spec that I had originally booked.I have taken this matter up with Expedia and am seeking some recompense for all the issues experienced. That will be a separate review. Good luck","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I agree with what most say here.  Yes, it's a packed breakfast area.  It's not as small as others, but it does fill up.  However, it really does depend on your timing too.   I was surprised by the elevator.  After reading the reviews and staying in other hotels, I thought it would be awful.  It wasn't that bad.  One night, there was a long line of a tourist group with all their luggage waiting their turn to get on the elevator.  I left my group and decided to take the stairs.  I wasn't in my room long before they joined me. We had a few hiccups in service, but those things happen and I felt like management understood and handled it very well.  I was disappointed in the fitness area.  2 machines were not working, but only one had a sign.  The manager came in to check on it.  The next day, neither machine was working, no sign on the 2nd machine, and then the 3rd one stopped working.  I don't know if any of the 3 were fixed.  Interesting experience on check-in.  I reserved 2 rooms under the same account, but we checked in at different times.  On the room paid with points, it was standard check-in.  On the room that we paid on our credit card, they really seemed to pay attention to us, offered us snacks, and treated us very nicely.  I don't know if it was points vs money or who was working or who was checking in or what, but it's disappointing that my entire party didn't receive the same attention that I received.  It was a good place to be.  The breakfast is your standard HI Express.  Neighborhood is fine.  Rooms are small, but probably standard for the price in New York City.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This ticked all the boxes. Many of the others at this sort of price are in china town and this area is so much better. \nIt wasn\u2019t exactly a warm welcome by reception and after putting a request on my booking and emailing that week in advance asking for a room at the back of the hotel... I got given one at the front. When I saw the room I went  back down and asked for a room at the back the reception staff said a request wasn\u2019t a guarantee which I appreciate but they should give if it they have it. It meant my my email and request was ignored.\nAnyway onto the room, 2nd floor at the back, no view but we didn\u2019t care so long as it was quiet. It was surprisingly bigger than I expected and have had before in NY so this was a bonus. We found it to be comfortable and being at the back of the hotel it was quiet throughout our stay. The room had a tub and a fridge which we used. For our 5 nights the room was kept very clean and the housekeeping staff ensured we were comfortable in our room each day. Our housekeeping lady always left us a little thank you note for tips we left daily which we thought was so sweet.\nThe location is great it always felt safe and it\u2019s a locals area so reasonably priced bars and restaurants. It\u2019s walkable to most midtown sights and the subway. It\u2019s about a 10min walk to the nearest subway but that\u2019s nothing. \nThe breakfast was well....busy. Go down early if you want hot food. We didn\u2019t eat much usually just taken coffee and a muffin or banana up to our room but that was fine for us and all we wanted. \nOn the last day we saw people taking popcorn from the reception area and asked them how much it was. They told me it was free!! We wasn\u2019t informed of this by reception on check in and that was a bit disappointing as it was our last day and it was all gone at this point. \nLift is always busy so take the stairs when you can\nAvoid the 1st floor at all costs. It\u2019s actually ground floor and right near the reception... It must be very noisy.\nThe heating could probably do with being replaced as it turns itself on and off, then suddenly it would come out cold so not very consistent. I see others have mentioned this too. \nA member of staff on reception, I think she was a manager happily prebooked a car to the airport when leaving, she was nice and the car \/ driver were great.\nI would recommend and stay here again if looking for a budget hotel","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We thought it was a very nice hotel.  The rooms were small, but such is New York.  The front desk was very helpful.  Check in was at 3 pm, but we arrived at the hotel around noon.  We were just going to leave our luggage in their storage room, but luckily, the room was ready, so we could check in early.  We were there for 6 days, and never had one issue.  When we check out, they held our luggage in their luggage storage room from 6:30 am till 5 pm, as our plane did not leave till 7:30. The place was clean, they had free hot breakfast, it was only a 10 minute walk to subway, and about 15 minutes to Times Square.  Would stay there again without hesitation.  I am not saying it is The Four Seasons, but it was a very good value.  Would actually have given it 4.5 stars, but was not given the option.  Only complaint is the room size, but we had two double beds.  I am sure that a room with only 1 king or 1 queen would have been a little roomier.

The staff were friendly and nice, happily looked after our bags on our last day while we waited for our flight home but that was probably the highlight. The room decor is seriously outdated, the bathroom needed a good clean and so did the walls. Found hairs in the bathroom and there was marks on the walls which looked like they could have easily been wiped off. The heating worked well but during the night would turn itself on every 30 minutes or so to maintain temperature and was noisy. The hotel was noisy in general and my sleep suffered. Im a heavy sleeper and can usually sleep anywhere but this was probably the worst sleep ive had in a hotel. Would wake every hour or so due to noise of either the heater, people coming into the hotel, sirens, cars, people rowing from outside the Salvation Army across the road. And this was being on the 11th floor. Maybe the hotel could provide ear plugs? The bed itself was comfortable so with earplugs it may have been a lot better. The hotel does not have a bar or serve food other than breakfast which is a little disappointing. The lift situation isn't the best either. 2 lifts for the whole hotel and they will stop on every floor when you use them. Breakfast was ok but the dining area is small. I would recommend either going early or late. Dining at 8am resulted in us having to share our table with other people as there was no where to sit. The location is ok. Anywhere you go from here will be a long walk unless you are happy to get a taxi. A few blocks over there is a road full of reasonably priced restaurants and bars which is the highlight for this hotel. Would I stay here again? No. I wouldn't recommend the hotel either unless it was to visit family or as a one night stay. Id rather pay more money and stay in a better hotel where I can actually sleep and have a civilised breakfast. ","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The street itself is pleasant enough, though the presence of a salvation army hostel directly opposite might put some people off.

This is good if you like local dining and nightlife areas, bad if you are homophobic (Hell\u2019s Kitchen is gayville central).  It is ~10min walk to either Time Square or Port Authority Bldg.  The best way to reach the hotel is Uber from the airport (~$50-60 from EWR and less from others) or you can take NJ transit train to Penn station ($13\/pp from EWR) then Uber or take airport bus to Port Authority (~$18\/pp.) and walk 10min.\n\nRoom & Bath:  Let me start with clearly noting that the room and bath are both undersized - even given the fact it is NYC.  We have stayed at many properties in the city (>8) and most rooms are smaller than average in general - but I would consider this property unacceptable.  You have basically small walking lanes around the bed and that is about it. The bathroom is undersized, particularly the sink area.  If you have any expectation to spread out your \u2018stuff\u2019 around the sink, you are in for a surprise.  This is one of my big pet peeves and would prevent me from staying here again.  The shower is reasonable but has the typical low flow HIE head.   Lastly, the bathroom door didn\u2019t want to stay open on our room and kept hitting me in the butt every 5-10sec. I had to stuff a wet hand towel on the floor to keep it open.  \ud83d\ude0a \n\nAmenities (wifi, gym, pool, etc.):  Didn\u2019t check the connection speed for the Wi-Fi but I would call it ok..  There is no pool of course.  Keeping with the theme of smallest, the gym at this hotel is basically useless unless you want to use a treadmill.   There is no room to even put a mat on the floor to stretch and no weights or exercise equipment of value.  \n\nFood & Beverage: They have a small area (undersized area for the room count) for the free breakfast.  It was very crowded whether we came near end of the breakfast period or 1.5hrs before.  There is a reasonably nice outdoor sitting area which is also used as overflow for breakfast seating.  That was nice, assuming the weather is nice enough and you don\u2019t mind eating with smokers\u2026.   They do serve coffee and tea all day long. \n\nStaff & Service Level: The staff were actually pleasant and did their best to answer my various questions (and request to check-out early).  The front desk staff would be the strong point here even though they do not have a dedicated concierge. \n\nMisc.:  For a beautiful view of the city (and expensive drinks), try the Press Lounge just down 48th street     \n\nWould I Repeat?:  No.  Even though I expect smaller rooms  in NYC, the room and bathroom here were just too small to be acceptable.  Spend another $20-$40\/n to move up to a full-service hotel nearby.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Room was a good size for NYC and had nice views. Bed was comfortable, cable TV was good and the 24 hour tea and coffee downstairs was a nice touch. Only slight criticism i have is that the ice machine was outside our roo. And every morning it would start up between 4am and 6am. Also there seemed to be a dog in the room next door on our last night which barked occasionally. Nothing tok serious and i still slept well.  Breakfast time was busy but then that's to be expected and yes sometimes it was difficult to get a table but we were happy taking it upstairs and having it in our room. Choices were bagels, toast, muffins, pancakes, fruit, eggs, sausage, bacon, cereal and cinnamon rolls. Room was cleaned and fresh towels left daily. Only a 10 minute walk to times square and just off 10th Avenue where there are plenty of places to grab a bite to eat. We didn't use the gym so can't comment on that. Lifts were a bit slow in the morning but again I wouldn't expect anything else for a busy NYC hotel. All of the staff in the hotel were great. The guys and girls that worked in the breakfast room in the morning did a great job of keeping everything topped up so there was always good available. Also the staff on the front desk did a great job of looking after us. Special mention to Josie who was lovely and very helpful.

This was a PERFECT location for walking to that activity, and it turns out it was a great location for most of everything else that we did.\n\nFrom our arrival, when Josie was super helpful and friendly (as she has been described in many other reviews as well), to the breakfast and cleaning staff, everyone here was very courteous and polite.  The room was not SPOTLESS (half a bar of soap missed in the back corner behind the sink) but we didn't feel it was grungy - I would say average cleanliness. \n\nRoom was the perfect size for the three of us, although the sofa bed was not super comfortable.  Adequate for a child to sleep on.  King bed was incredibly comfortable.  Pillows were only feather so they were super smushy but it worked for the 3 nights.  Longer term, we probably would have preferred foam pillows.  Biggest drawback for sleeping was our location right next to the elevator - please request a room away from the elevator - the noise definitely woke us during the night.\n\nTV reception was disappointing - directv keep cutting in and out, regardless of weather (we have directv at home, so we understand that heavy clouds can block the dish - this was not the case).  As a side note here - to operate the tv remote, point it BELOW the desk.  For some reason, that's where the receiver is for the directv.  Thanks to maintenance for their patience with us - lol.\n\nMini fridge and Keurig in the room.  No drawers other than one small one in each nightstand, small space to hang clothes.  Small safe in room.  \n\nBreakfast was average, but definitely helped as we didn't have to spend money each morning on breakfast.  Sausage, scrambled eggs (add salt), pancakes, breads, fruit, yogurt.  Definitely enough to fill up, and carry you through to dinner with just  small snack during the day.  As others mentioned, the dining area is small but we were able to find a table each morning.  Other guests were bringing food up to their rooms - the hotel provided trays for this.\n\nBack to the location - we walked to the Intrepid museum in about 10 minutes.  Times Square was a solid 15 minutes but we didn't mind.  Broadway (Gershwin Theater) was 20 minutes, and Rockefeller Plaza was just past that so maybe 25 min.  Subway stop (50th and 8th) was about a 10 minute walk, and then from there the subway was 25 minutes down to South Ferry for the Statue of Liberty, or 10 minutes Uptown to Museum of Natural History.\n\nIn the neighborhood, I highly recommend the Westfield Market, one block East on 48th and 11th.  We made a few stops there, for adult beverages, bottled water, lunch foods (delicious salads, sandwiches, warm foods).  We also had dinner at Patzeria (also up 48th about 1 1\/2 blocks) one night - it was so good, we got New York style pizza there the next night for takeout.\n\nIf you are considering a hotel in the Times Square or Broadway area, please consider this Holiday Inn.  We were thrilled with the great value we got here, and we would not hesitate to return here for another stay in NYC!","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location is a solid 10min walk to\/from \"Times Square\". We walked it as late as 12am and felt very safe. The room was a bit small but as the saying goes, we weren't spending a lot of time in the room. The bathroom was fine and the shower worked great. The breakfast was very good but crowded. We found a place to sit and people were coming and going often enough that there always seemed room to sit. The morning crew who kept the food plentiful were also very friendly. I would not have any problems staying here again and would recommend it to anyone who asked about this location.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was a typical Holiday Inn Express -- basic services, small rooms, clean, good service, so no complaints.  Summary:\n\n1) The location isn't TOO far away from Times Square and other popular areas but it is a bit of a hike to do too often.  The subway was about a 10-minute walk which is okay but not ideal.\n\n2) It's in a kind of quiet neighborhood, which seemed safe enough.  We typically like to be in a more bustling neighborhood in NYC so we wanted something about 2 avenues east, where there are many more restaurants\/bars (though there is a nice rooftop lounge just west).   But if you like quiet, this works fine.\n\n3) The rooms were small, which I guess is typical Holiday Inn Express \/ NYC.  It was okay after we figured out how to place the luggage; we weren't there that often anyway.  Beds \/ room were clean.  The noise level on the outside rooms (we were on 9th) were a bit loud but from usual NYC traffic sounds, not nightlife.\n\n4) The free breakfast buffet was better than most of these with scrambled eggs, sausage, etc.  There wasn't a lot else.  The main thing I didn't like was how small and \"competitive\" the room is -- go before 8am if you can.   Elevators were small and a bit slow.\n\nIf you're okay with all of the above, this is a very good value and like I say, good staff and clean.   Good work!","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We're from upstate NY, so we should know the area; but this was a bit further west than we realized.  Our fault, not theirs.  It's almost 11th Avenue and the street from 9th avenue to the hotel is quiet with people in doorways.  Nothing bad happened, but I wouldn't walk it alone late at night after a show.  We're also older, so the long block felt very long after a full day.  A good choice for a younger couple or male.\n\nThe hotel itself was great.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The room was NYC style small, but was fine.  The elevators has a sign about using them off-peak and I could see where two small elevators would be a problem if large numbers of people tried to use them at the same time.  It was not a real problem for us.  This is true in a lot of NYC hotels, so not a big deal.  The signs were a cute warning.\n\nBreakfast was Holiday Inn express standard.  It was completely OK, nothing special.\n\nI'm not sure that we would return because of age and location.  If we were 10 years younger, it would be different.

Something I really value. There is a gym, but I didn\u2019t use it.\n\nThe only downsides I found were:\n\n1(a). If one arrives after 08:00 for b\/fast, there are too few seats for the number of guests. Also some solo guests sit at tables for four, which often denies three others from sitting.\nI was proactive, when seeing no free tables, I asked one gentleman if I could share his large table, and he can consented, but I fear that many seniors would not be confident in asking as I did.\n\n(b) Also, some folk I found linger at the table long, way too long after they finished eating. Again, displaying a lack of courtesy to other guests.\n\n2. The hotel b\/w 10th and 11th avenues is a good distance from the subway at 50th & 8th (C and E trains). Guests may want to factor in cab fares to and from that stop. It was not enjoyable to walk in the snow.\nThat said, if you\u2019re arriving at or departing from Penn Station, the hotel is a short ride straight up 10th Avenue, some 14 blocks. \n\nJust like I found in February, the downsides are small and are outweighed by the good value rooms and sterling customer service.\n\nEven with the less than ideal location, I will be back.

First there were some stains on the bathroom wall that were a little icky.  Our room was113 - literally the closest to the lobby, some type of staff closet\/supply area, and breakfast area.  I realize that the hotel was also sold out that day, so choices were limited and somebody has to take the room but maybe something could be done for noise.  It was fine until about 2 AM, when I was kept awake by staff knocking and banging things around all night.  Then around 6 AM, the chairs being moved around non-stop in the breakfast area and people talking was a lot.  \n\nThankfully my husband had ear plugs so we could do something about it.  But maybe the hotel should provide this to these rooms or have courtesy signs asking people to be quiet.  Staff should not be making so much noise at 2 AM.

I was surprised at the size of the room as I'd heard that rooms in New York were on the small size.  We had a good sized wardrobe, but only 6 hangers, a desk, flat screen TV, fridge and a Keurig coffee maker.  The bed was made daily but I had to leave a note for housekeeping to leave us more coffee and I'm pretty sure that although they emptied the bins daily they didn't actually hoover the carpet.  Lovely big shower in the bathroom with good water pressure, nice white fluffy towels but only a small area around the sink to put our toiletries so we ended up leaving them in our washbags.  \nA buffet breakfast was include in our room rate and the food was basic but acceptable with a choice of a cooked meal as well as cereal and toast, muffin or bagel and even freshly made pancakes.  The coffee\/tea section was available 24\/7 which was useful when the coffee in our room wasn't replaced.  The breakfast area is small and seats are at a premium at least 3 out of the 7 days we were there we had to grab our breakfast and take it outside to the patio area to eat.  The weather while we were there was around 25-30 degrees so eating outside wasn't much of a problem but I wouldn't fancy having to do that any later in the year.\nLocation wise the hotel is opposite a Salvation Army hostel which I was a little apprehensive about but which was in fact absolutely fine.  It's about a 20 minute walk to Times Square and the nearest subway station and being in Hell's Kitchen there are plenty of places around to eat.  Eating in New York we found was very expensive but the fact that the room had a fridge meant that we could buy supplies from the grocery stores, keep them in there and then eat in our room.  The hotel had no problem with guests bringing back food and eating it either in their room or in the hotels breakfast area.\nStaff in the hotel from reception to housekeeping were all very pleasant and friendly.  The receptionist helped organise our airport transfer and also arranged for our luggage to be stored until we were ready to depart for the airport.\nThe hotel has vending machines and ice machines on every other floor and a limited range of drinks and snacks can be purchased from reception.\nIf you are looking for a hotel with a view then this is not it, however for the price I paid it was really good value for money and in a good location, if I had wanted luxury I would probably of had to pay 3 times the price.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The only small problem we had was when we tried to use one lift and it wasn't working, so we waited for the next one, only to be told by Sandra Anne ? That we didn't know how to use the lift and that there was nothing wrong with it. So back in it we went, waited two minutes for Sandra Anne to realize that in fact it wasn't working, like we had already told her, however It was back in service by the time we came back to the hotel later that day. I travelled with my 17 year old daughter and had a room with a king size bed, which was more than adequate for the both of us to share. We stayed for 6 nights. The fact that breakfast is included is a huge bonus and the variety on offer Is great. Toast, pastries, yogurts, hot breakfast (eggs, bacon, sausages, turkey sausage burgers) pancakes etc. we did get up early each morning 6.30 to avoid the breakfast rush. Tea and coffee are available all day and to our surprise, one hot day on return from our day out returned to refreshing home made lemonade. I really would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a base for seeing the sights of the New York and surrounding areas. The subway is about a 10 minutes walk to get to most places, but we enjoyed walking to attractions.

The breakfast is the same every day and heavy on the carbohydrate side, but guests should be able to find something to eat.  Some more fruit choices, cheese and some sort of vegetables would offer guests healthier choices.  The room was clean and large enough with a king bed that still had room for three checked bags and space to walk around.  We did find our room on the 3rd floor a bit noisy from the street (even though there is little traffic).  Our room was across from where cleaning usually started in the morning and the doors seem thin, so that could also be heard - maybe ask for a room at the end of the hallway or on an upper floor.  There are many restaurant choices 5-15 minute walk from the hotel.

We were booked as four guests and only ever had enough towels for two guests. Sofa bed is not comfortable for adults but was fine for two small children. Plus, didn't enjoy walking back to the hotel late at night from Times Square - few dark and dodgy streets! Location though is very good - ten minute walk to Times Square. They have no parking at the hotel but do a special rate of $32 with Icon Parking which is close by. Some local attraction tips - would not recommend Top View open top buses - long queues and packed buses. Also, they tell you two hr bike hire in Central Park is included which is untrue. It is actually two extra hrs after you have purchased the initial bike hire. Big Bus Company was who we went with last time in NYC - we were stupid not to remember them this time!! Also, Queen of Hearts boat trips to Statue of Liberty - ticket sellers charge more than they should including charging kids who should go free! This is what happened to us. Also, they pack the boat and keep waiting for buses to arrive with more people. We waited for an hr and a half from pier 36! Other boat trips are available from pier 15&16!

Data la buona posizione, la colazione inclusa nel prezzo e la camera con vista, afferro l'occasione e prenoto. Giunta in hotel mi consegnano le chiavi per una camera sita al secondo piano...e mi insospettisco...dove sar\u00e0 la vista? Ma certo! Sul muro dell'edificio di fronte che ospita l'esercito della salvezza...ovvero vista clochard...riprendo la mia prenotazione perch\u00e8 mi sorge il dubbio di aver capito male. Ma la camera prenotata era proprio con vista. Torno al front desk dove l'impiegata mi risponde che purtroppo per quella sera non avevano disponibilit\u00e0 per la camera prenotata e che avrebbero provveduto il giorno successivo a spostarci...peccato che io avessi pagato per una camera con vista. La mattina successiva faccio presente alla stessa impiegata che oltre ad assegnarmi la stanza corretta avrebbero dovuto provvedere al rimborso per la prima notte. Lei imbarazzatissima va a chiamare la manager...non vi sto a dire le urla che si sentivano provenire dall'ufficio, dal quale alla fine esce la manager che aveva sbraitato fino a un attimo prima, con un bel sorriso stampato sul viso...ed anche questo non \u00e8 stato piacevole. Da circa dieci anni utilizzo expedia per le prenotazioni di voli e hotels e non ho mai avuto problemi. Per\u00f2 stavolta, a detta della signora in questione, l'errore era stato di Expedia che non aveva comunicato loro la tipologia di camera esatta. Certo \u00e8 proprio strano perch\u00e8 sulla mia prenotazione l'indicazione era pi\u00f9 che corretta e la ragazza la sera prima aveva ammesso che il problema partiva dall'hotel che non aveva riservato la camera con vista. Allora le chiedo di lasciarmi un documento che attesti che l'errore fosse di Expedia ma lei si vede impossibilitata a farlo \"because they know\"...pessimo comportamento! Le dico che avrei scritto alla catena Holiday Inn per comunicare l'accaduto e avrei lasciato la mia recensione su tripadvisor. Al nostro rientro, al front desk ci comunicano che eravamo stati spostati in una camera ai piani alti, stavolta con vista, con omaggio di snacks, e ci informano che ci avrebbero rimborsato 50 dollari...cifra ridicola visto il prezzo pagato, ma almeno lo avessero fatto...stiamo ancora aspettando!  A posteriori ho letto recensioni di qualche altro malcapitato che a detta dell'hotel, per colpa del sito di prenotazione, si \u00e8 trovato senza camera...strane coincidenze! In sintesi non lo consiglio a causa della pessima gestione e della scarsa attenzione al cliente.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The nearest subway is 900 m - 0.6 miles (12 minutes walk) on the corner of 50th st with 8th av, so you walk 2 and a half large blocks crossings avenues and two more small blocks crossing the streets to get to the subway. Another option is to take a bus that makes the direction North-South along 10th and 11th avenues. For example  if you  go to Lincoln Center take a bus, much more practical and walks little. The stop is just around the corner. If you will stay 5 or more days BUY a 7-day ticket (used in bus and subway at will)\nThe strong point I found at the Hotel was the attendance of the staff. They are very helpful and just do not help you if they really do not have the conditions.\nBreakfast is a separate affair, very rare in the US. It has fruits, cereals, juice, milk, coffee, toaster, omelet, pancake (fresh made), yogurt, etc. With this in mind you save at least U$10-15 per person per day. The only lack for Brazilians is that they do not have express coffee. Coffee is american style, weaker. And if you need something extra, do not be shy about asking. I ordered chocolate powder and they brought me, I saw people asking for boiled egg, asking  to warm milk. They are very helpful, not \"ugly\" when you ask for something  extra.\nThe room is very nice, modern and comfortable. My only complaint for a perfect stay was the noise in the room. Incredible as it may seem it is not the noise of the street, but the noise of the corridor. There is virtually no soundproofing from the bedroom to the hallway. You hear everything that goes on outside and what bothers the most is the doors being closed, because they are in the style of pull and knock to close, with metallic  noise. \nMy advise is to take a pair of earplugs with you, just in case. If it were not for this, I would give 5.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Anesha and Josie are rock stars!!! I hope you're fortunate enough to have them help you if you have any issues during your stay. In my book, this hotel gets 5 stars all around for their excellent staff and their facility.\n\nThe extended version: My family and I (10 people total) planned a short trip to New York for my brother's graduation last week. Six of us stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Manhattan Midtown West. Since I currently reside in Tennessee where we're used to having space, very little street noise, and easy access to our cars, I was a bit nervous about coordinating this trip. I didn't want everyone to hate me if: a) we got stuck in a small room designed for two people and 0 suitcases; b) our hotel was surrounded by sketchiness, or; c) if we couldn't get around New York easily without having to take a taxi everywhere. Thankfully, this hotel was perfect for what we needed. \nFirst, the rooms with two queen beds were perfect for three; the king room with the sofa bed was also great for three. There was even enough room for our suitcases. For six adults with a short stay, this was perfect.\nNext, the hotel is not surrounded by sketchiness, woohoo! Instead, it's located near some good eats (W 48th and 10th Ave) and Ink48's sexy rooftop bar with a great view of the Hudson River (W 48th and 11th Ave). Yes, there's a Salvation Army across the street, but it doesn't make the area any more\/less sketchy than the rest of midtown.\nFinally, we could get around easily either on foot, via the subway, or with a Lyft\/Uber. How you get around just depends on where you're trying to go, and how much you're trying to spend. For my brother's graduation, we took an Uber to get to his school, but we walked or took the subway almost everywhere else. Especially when traffic is heavy, it just makes more sense to walk. Columbus Circle, where we entered Central Park, was 20 minutes on foot. Times Square was about a 10 minute walk. Broadway is less than 10 minutes away. Overall, the location was excellent in my opinion.\n\nHere are the tips that I'd recommend to help you enjoy your stay:\n1. Book early and call with any requests that you might have. We asked for a higher floor to minimize street noise, and we were placed on the 7th floor. The staff here will actually try to accommodate your requests.\n2. If you have an issue, let the staff know as soon as possible so they can help you resolve it. And don't be a jerk to them while they're trying to help--phenomenal staff members like Anesha and Josie will go above and beyond to try and get things to work out in your favor. \n3. If you want the complimentary breakfast, get there before 9. Yes, it's a little chaotic because there are so many people and so few tables, but they're trying to do the best with the space they have. Feel free to treat the seating on the patio as an overflow area if the weather allows it.\n4. If you have a late flight on the day that you check out, ask to leave your luggage behind the concierge while you hang out in the city. Anthony, one of the other awesome employees at this hotel, let us know that this was an option the evening before we checked out.\n\nThis is not a swanky boutique hotel, so if you're looking for a place with upscale accents all over, you're likely to be disappointed. But I found the service, space, and location to be great for this price point and at this time of the year.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel's location is not very convenient. While it's between 10th & 11th Avenues, it's closer to the latter, which means farther from not only the subway and major bus lines, but also from restaurants and interesting things to do.\n\nAt check-in, I got either someone who was in training, or just didn't care very much. Regardless, I was able to get into my room, drop off my stuff, and then head out to grab dinner. As a place to sleep in the city, it's fine. The walls\/doors are super thin, though, and I had poor luck in that I was next to some group who liked to keep their door open while chatting loudly.\n\nLuckily I was on the 11th floor. If you're not on that floor, good luck getting into an elevator during prime breakfast\/check-out times. On multiple days during the mornings, the elevator would pretty much stop on every floor, most of which didn't allow people to get on because the elevator was already packed to the gills. There are only two (slow) elevators servicing the entire building.\n\nAs for the service -- the maintenance\/housekeeping crew could use some work. On the positive front, the guy who brought me soap the first night came up pretty quickly. The negative side of it -- one maintenance guy couldn't be bothered to move to the side when I got off the elevator. I had to squeeze past him and his mop because he simply refused to move. Another instance of interesting staff attitude -- I got the elevator once with a maintenance guy (different person) who was mumbling and cussing like he was super angry.\n\nAnyway, this is a Holiday Inn Express, so it's not like one should expect much of anything. For this brand, this is about on par with expectations. I won't be staying here again, though, as the rates weren't even that good. I'd rather pay the same money but stay in a better location.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The on\/off button needed to be pressed a few times to get it to work. One can heat, not boil water by pouring water into the rear of the machine and not placing a coffee capsule in the front. Again, the water will be warm not hot.\n\nBathroom, small but clean and functional.\n\nUnlike many hotels, this one provides bath towel, hand towel and face towel.\n\nBreakfast\n\nToo many folk for the small space. Frustratingly crowded.\nI stayed 5 nights and not once managed to try the pancakes because the line at the pancake machine reminds me of the lines outside Soviet supermarkets on the one day a month they sold fresh food. Too long.\n\nCoffee urns ran out often and were not refilled until a guest pointed this out to a staff member.\nFior  Guminez  was splendidly proactive when this was pointed out to her.\nAs was an African American gentleman whose name I did not get.\n\nThe bad\n\nOnly one thing was not great about the hotel. That is, the three avenues needed to walk to get to the subway on 50th and 8th Avenue. Some guests say this is easy. Well, I suppose if you're 25 it is. I am late 40s and in the rain, without luggage was unpleasant. A cab to the subway cost $7 and close to Time Sq. cost $10\n\nSmall negative in the face of a lovely and well priced hotel.\n\nAll in all, this is a good value choice. Good prices and quiet well insulated walls between rooms. I had two women and a baby move in next door half way through my stay. I could hear the baby as they fumbled for the key to open the door, but once inside, I heard nothing.\n\nSpecial thanks to Susanna on check in and Michael who granted me a late check out.\n\nI will be back.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

No s\u00f3lo porque el precio es accesible, sino adem\u00e1s porque la ubicaci\u00f3n es privilegiada. Ni tan cerca, ni tan lejos. Est\u00e1bvamos a 4 cuadras de Time Square, a 10 minutos de una estaci\u00f3n de metro y muy cerca de bares y restoranes. El hotel es peque\u00f1o. Las habitaciones son estrechas, pero nada de eso es demsaiado importante cuando realmente la diversi\u00f3n en NY est\u00e1 afuera. Los servicios eran los adecuados. Muy limpio y todo funciona muy bien. El WiFi, a veces se saturaba un poco, pero de todas maneras funcionaba. Otro aspecto muy importante es que ten\u00edan caf\u00e9 gratis disponible a toda hora del d\u00eda y de la noche para los hu\u00e9spedes. Lo que en invierno se agradec\u00eda bastante. El desayuno era muy completo y variado. Tal vez aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 el \u00fanico aspecto bajo.

Imagino que en verano la situaci\u00f3n es distinta, porque el hotel tiene una terraza al aire libre donde sin duda debe ser un agrado desayunar. tambi\u00e9n hay que destacar que durante la noche est\u00e1 disponible un microondas para que quien traiga algo para comer pueda calentarlo sin problemas.

Nah zum Hudson, aber auch nah zum Broadway, Times Square und allen dort befindlichen Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten\/Skyscrapern. Wir waren eine Woche dort. \nDas Hotel selbst ist ordentlich, alles sehr sauber. Der Zimmerservice funktioniert sehr gut, einzig die Handt\u00fccher wurden f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack ein wenig zu oft getauscht. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist sehr amerikanisch, aber es ist eben auch in Amerika. Immerhin eines der wenigen Hotels mit Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksangebot. Was auch sehr angenehm war - das st\u00e4ndige Angebot von Kaffee und Tee in der Lobby. Kurz nach Silvester war es doch noch recht k\u00fchl dort und da haben wir das Angebot gerne genutzt nach der R\u00fcckkehr ins Hotel noch eben einen hei\u00dfen Tee zu trinken. Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksgeschirr gibt es nicht, alles Pappteller, Kunststoffbecher, Kunststoffbesteck. Die M\u00fcllproduktion ist dort horrend. Aber das d\u00fcrfte \u00fcberall \u00e4hnlich sein.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":3572583,"title":"Very good hotel - great overall experience","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-01-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We booked in to this hotel for a week as I had been sent on business to the National Retail Federation event and then we bolted on some few extra days for touring leisurely.  \nPositives:\n- Tea and Coffee 24\/7 downstairs\n- Good shower cubicle and decent shower head\n- Fridge (I'm diabetic, so to keep insulin cool the fact they provide a fridge is great)\n- Ice (it was cold when we were there so limited use, but when we left, again, as I am diabetic, being able to put some ice next to my insulin to keep it cool is a great help)\n- Safe \n- Access to microwave downstairs.\nNegatives\n- Internet was not very good - okay when it worked, but sometimes seemed to lose signal.  It was upgraded the day before we left, so we don't know whether things have improved.  Internet was always good in the breakfast area, but just that reception in the rooms was poor, so if the WiFi got upgraded to have better reach within the building then it should be good now.\n- No kettle.  They provide a coffee making machine, but a hotel is a home away from home and every home has a kettle before a coffee making machine.  Without a kettle you can't make tea, or a hot water bottle or have some warm water with you before you set out. \n- The room is very small.  If you're travelling alone, it would not be a concern and I'd give this 5 stars.  If you're travelling as a couple or as a family with a young child, I would keep it at 4 stars.  The walkable space in the room is very small.  From the table to the end of the bed is the width of a chair.  Once you have your luggage opened up and taken off your shoes etc, it feels like you feel very closed in with no space.  This can make you feel less relaxed at times.\n- Not good for women - some of this comes back to space, some of it that women have more stuff.  If we take the bathroom for example, there is no space for anything other than your toothbrush as its a small space, so my wife then puts her bag on top of the back of the toilet.  If you go into the main room, if the woman sits at the table, the lighting isn't good enough for her to do her makeup.\n\nIn terms of distance from the hotel, I chose this hotel because it was also close to the National Retail Federation event at Jacob K. Javits Convention Center as well as Times Square.  Times Square is about 12 minutes away at a brisk walk, or closer to 18 minutes with a stroller.  In hind sight we might have been better off getting a hotel in the centre of Times Square.\n\nFeedback for improvements:\n- When you serve breakfast, to ensure you have enough space, you remove the microwave.  Stop doing that.  You have a line of parents asking for either milk to be heated up for their children or adults who want to eat the porridge you provide which has a requirement to add water or milk and microwave for 2 minutes to ask the staff to microwave the porridge.\n- You provide 24\/7 hot drinks.  The problem is that the water always runs out.  You have 6 canisters of coffee but one hot water tap that is manually filled and easily runs out.  Can you not either get the 2nd one you use in the morning next to the porridge to be in use also or have something plugged in permanently with water and boiling facilities.  It's a waste of staff's time constantly pouring water into these machines if they've detected its empty.\n\nOverall, a great stay, but just one that could have been better.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We weren't sure what to expect prior to our visit, but the reviews seemed positive. It was a special trip as we had just gotten engaged and we were there for a week. At check-in we were upgraded at no extra cost to a king room. The staff at the front desk are extremely warm and helpful and good at their job. There are many tickets and tours available, so make sure to ask if you plan going anywhere, for example they have tickets for a private bus to Woodbury Common, a shuttle service to JFK etc. The room was a good size and well laid out with a place for everything. The bathroom was equally well designed and the hair-drier was good, which is handy to know before packing. The room was cleaned thoroughly each day. The breakfast room was well stocked each morning and there seemed to be something for everyone, young and old. This room was open all day and you could have a free coffee or tea at any time. The wifi was also very strong throughout the hotel. The location felt safe at all times and is just a 10 minute walk straight up 48th St. to Broadway and Time Square. There are plenty of places to eat on 8th and 9th Avenues and you feel like you are in the heart of the city. We are thinking of returning to New York for our honeymoon and we will definitely say here.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room had a queen size bed, plenty of storage, large tv, coffee maker and well equipped bathroom.\n\nWe headed out to explore and found ourselves on 7th Avenue within a 10 minute walk! We had an amazing time, we managed to get a table in a restaurant on 7th close to the Copacabana and whilst we did not have tickets to get into times square (which was closed from 2pm), we were still in the thick of all the action and had a great time without the need to pay stupid money to take pot luck on a club reservation. \n\nThe hotel itself is near enough to explore times square on foot yet far enough away to ensure you get a great nights sleep. \n\nThe breakfast buffet has so much to choose from such as sausage, omelettes, bacon, pancakes, scones, muffins,cinamon rolls, cereal, yoghurts, bread, bagels etc. The coffee station is open 24 hours a day and they have a fridge with fresh milk available. We had no trouble getting a table each day and enjoyed this great start to the day.\n\nWe spent the rest of the week exploring the city and caught the subway downtown to visit world trade and the statue of liberty. The Front desk lady gave us great instructions on which subway to go to and where to get off.\n\nThe room was cleaned spotlessly each day with fresh towels, toiletries and coffees replenished generously.\n\nThe staff deserve more than a mention. From the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out, each and every member of staff we encountered were really friendly and helpful. There were, by the way, plenty of staff at the hotel and they were all ready to help.  \n\nThis was our first visit to New York and we feel very lucky that we had such a great hotel in such a great location to call home.\n\nThank you to all concerned.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I traveled from Florida where I live to New York City the weekend of my 21st birthday. As an IHG CLUB MEMBER and front desk employee of another Holiday Inn\/former HSKP, I had high expectations and standards. Josie at the front desk was super sweet! It was just the day before I was to be 21 and she let me check in with no issues (I was very concerned about that prior to the trip). She also disappeared and returned bearing a little IHG bag containing a few snacks and candies, offering it to me as a \"birthday gift\" and I felt very special after that sentiment. \n\nThe room was absolutely lovely. I was upgraded to the King with Sofa Bed room and they put me on the 9th floor, close to the elevator and ice machine, and it was perfect. The room was very clean and spacious, with a mini fridge and Keurig. The TV selection wasn't great, in my opinion, and I had more trouble staying connected to the WiFi internet than it was worth, so I ended up using most of my data through my carrier which was annoying. Spent more time in the room just hanging than I thought I would, but it was just so comfortable and spacious, which is not typical for NYC hotels. I adored the bathrooms, too, even the bathroom door was very nice and interesting. I felt like the room was just very luxurious. \n\nI didn't try breakfast at the hotel at all, we missed it everyday oversleeping. \n\nWe walked down to the Kimpton hotel just down the block and took the elevator all the way up to the 30th-something floor to their rooftop lounge and though the drinks totaled $50! it was beautiful and well worth it. The view up there offered 360-views of NYC and the skyline was out of this world. Exiting the hotel and going the other way, there is a multitude of 24-hour convenience stores. On my first day I got a really good Philly Cheesesteak at one, and I grabbed a coupon yogurt granola parfaits to throw in the fridge for mornings. We also had dinner one night at this great Italian restaurant within walking distance from hotel, I think it was called Melograno. There was a liquor store AND a smoke shop just within walking distance too. It was perfect. \n\nOnly thing I didn't really like is that it was 3 LONG blocks from Times Square. Not too far but we only walked there maybe twice or three times. It was a trek and next time I'd prefer something more midtown, closer to the Empire State Building and IN Times Square. But overall good stay and I really enjoyed everything.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

While our room was small, you are not going to find anything large in NYC unless you're willing to spend a small fortune for that space, and it was still well-appointed and comfortable. Everything was conveniently placed in the room, and I was pleased to find a Keurig for my coffee fixes; there was, as is typical, also a breakfast area on the first floor that included 24-hour coffee. \nAs for this breakfast, it included a variety of hot and cold options and was surprisingly good. The food was tasty, and there was a nice variety of drink options, too. It is pretty rare to find hotels in NYC with breakfast included, so to have any at all is a surprise, to have a good one is shocking. \nIt is a little noisy outside the hotel at night, but because the area is full of apartments instead of restaurants or night clubs, it is much quieter than it would be closer to Broadway.

I have no idea....   We showed up (2adults\/2 kids - 8 & 12) at 11:30 at night, exhausted but ready to kick off the Christmas season by spending a few days in NYC.  I will say that a man who was working the front desk that night was great - very helpful.  First impression of the hotel - NO WAY.  Terrible lobby.  Small is okay, I get it - it's NYC and sometimes I actually like a small hotel; quaint, personal, but this was dingy and depressing.  2 elevators - 1 was broken.  A young gentleman who was working there said something to the effect of \"It's always braking.  Should be fixed by morning.\"  No thanks, we are not riding an elevator that is \"always breaking\".  Get to our room (or should I say cell?) and it was TEENEY TINY and the smell was AWFUL.  All I could think of was cat urine.  Back to the lobby we go.  Next room - well, it didn't smell like urine but it did smell like ridiculously heavy chemical laden \"cleaning\" chemicals, like a cheap, lemon air freshener.  Back to the lobby we went.  No other rooms available and it was now after midnight.  Having no place else to go it was back up to the \"lemon cell\".  After an awful nights sleep we checked out and immediately starting looking for a new hotel.  I would not reccomend this hotel unless you get it for a very cheap price and don't mind tiny, musty spaces.  Did I mention there was no closet in the room?  There was a very small armoire that was almost useless.  Again, I will give props to the guy at the front desk though.  I wish I knew his name - he was really great.  And while the hotel is nothing better than awful, in the grand scheme of things the location was okay. ****AND SADLY my daughter left her iPod in the room and now they are saying they don't have it.  Clearly their housekeeping staff must have found it because they were the next people to enter the room so where is it now?

Recommended!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-11-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We really liked the central location of this hotel. One can be in Time Square, Broadway shows, Michelin Star restaurants, the subway station, Lincoln center all in about 10-15 mins of walk. During my last visit to NYC, in order to save some money, I stayed in a hotel in Queens. Having stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Midtown location this time, I can now see what a poor decision that was. The most precious commodity that one has in a city like NYC is time. It is well worth paying a little extra and staying in a central location in Manhattan like this. We found the area around the hotel safe and even while walking back at 1:00 am we did not feel uncomfortable or unsafe. \n\nThe hotel staff was courteous and attentive to our needs. The complimentary breakfast buffet options were better than the staid free breakfast one finds in most hotels. Yes, the dining area did get crowded in the morning. But this is NYC and some of that is to be expected. The breakfast staff was attentive in helping us and keeping the victuals refilled. \n\nWe did find two drawbacks to this hotel. The elevators had a long wait time. The hotel caters to large groups and with so many people arriving or leaving at the same time, the lobby can get crowded and the elevator wait times can be a little long. Also the rooms are small. Because of this sound travels more easily from other rooms, hallways, and the streets. But these small issues did not bother us much. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel because of the central location, the breakfast buffet, and the attentive staff, and reasonable rates.

Most of the time I just grabbed coffee. That said, the room was clean, the staff was nice, the sheets and bed were comfortable and it wasn't as tiny a room as I thought it would be. We had a small fridge to store our leftover pizza, plenty of towels, more than just the usual local channels to choose from on TV, and temperature control. All together, it was quite comfortable. There were seats outside if you wanted to watch random people go by or fall sleep while your room was being prepared. I don't suggest falling asleep outside, just saying my friend and I were so tired when we got there that we couldn't help it.\n\nIt's not super close to anything major, but it's within reasonable walking distance of Times Square so long as you don't have any physical problems preventing you from walking comfortably. Transit isn't too far, but I admit that I found it unnecessary and walked an average of 9 hours a day, once going from the hotel to Chelsea\/ The High Line and back up to Central park before walking back down to the Comedy Cellar in the Chelsea area. That was a long day and definitely not for everyone. Still, it was nice to have a hotel situated between the major attractions without being close to the crowds and constant noise.\n\nReally close to the hotel on 46th and 9th are several nightlife options, including a piano bar where the staff take requests for everything from Broadway songs to Queen, an Italian restaurant, and a sushi place. All along 10th just up from the hotel are lots of deli options and places to eat or get a drink as well.\n\nGetting there from the airport (Newark) was distressing even via taxi and it was expensive. However, the ride to LaGuardia wasn't bad. Just hailed a taxi right out front. For anyone flying from LaGuardia, do note I didn't see a duty free store. If you want to bring anything like alcohol back, buy it before you get to the airport. We flew to Toronto for a connector flight and they advised me I couldn't use the duty free store despite having flown in from the United States. Quite the irritation.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The hotel is situated close to the Hudson River with the Intrepid museum just a couple of blocks away. Train stations are just a few blocks along and this hotel is also good for persons wishing to walk parts of the city. Recommend the highline walk which takes you down to the Chelsea district. Staff here were all very good and special thanks for Ashley Rolan on reception for giving us a voucher for money off the Intrepid museum entrance fee. The room was fairly small but this is New York and time should be spent outside enjoying this fabulous city. We had the front facing room on the sixth floor and being a light sleeper I did have problems with people coming out of local clubs at +3 in the morning. Spoke to other guests who heard nothing at the rear of the hotel so may be worth requesting a back facing room. Hotel although very busy served free breakfast which was more than adequate for me. In summary try to secure a room in the back and enjoy the hotels location and incredible staff. Tip for visitors who haven't used the metro...Buy a card 1$ and add say 20$ this will give rides costing about 2.50$ per journey regardless of length. One card can be used for two people or more and obviously each person who swipes will be charged the 2.50$.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":3572583,"title":"Depending on what you're looking for, this may or may not be a good place for you to stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-08-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Depending on what you're looking for, this may or may not be a good place for you to stay.\n\nI have not even checked out of the hotel yet (been staying there for 4 nights, 3 more to go), but I'm prepared to write my review - that, in and of itself, must speak volumes.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a VERY busy hotel. Not a day has gone by, so far, where I have not seen charter style busses up front, loading\/unloading people. This, I believe, is primarily due to the location (less than 2 blocks from a cruise ship terminal), and few blocks the opposite direction from Times Square. That level of business, more often than not, leaves the lobby very crowded. If you were, perhaps, staying here for only a night (waiting to go on a cruise) - or getting back from a cruise, and staying a day before you fly \"home,\" this might be an okay place to stay, simply because of the proximity to the cruise terminal.\n\nThe elevators (two of them) are atrociously slow. In my four nights, I have waited up to 10 minutes for an elevator to reach me, simply because the hotel is so busy, the elevators are so slow, that often, they work their way up (floor by floor) and empty out, and then start on their way down, filling up, floor by floor. There have been several times where an elevator does come after about 3-4 minutes and it's full, so you have to wait for the next one - or even a second or third one, after that. Morning and evenings are particularly bad about this - and it's really frustrating to be ready to leave the hotel, and have to wait so long for an elevator. (I've also seen the buttons already pushed by the time I reached the elevator, but whomever had pushed it had clearly given up as they were no longer there - and I've still had to wait 3,5,7 minutes for the elevator to show up.) Admittedly, I understand that the hotel has limited control over something like this - as the only real solution would be to replace the elevators with faster ones - and perhaps better logic behind how it carries people. This is, no doubt, would be an expensive endeavor - but in all honesty, given the volume of people this hotel puts through, I think it would go a long way towards making a stay more pleasant.\n\nBreakfast - HA! While the selection is quite good (as it is with most HI Express locations,) be prepared to wait a significant amount of time to get anything. So, if you want breakfast before you leave the hotel, for example, plan 10 minutes to wait for the elevator and another 20 or so to actually get your breakfast because of the lines. The staff does a decent enough job in keeping up with supply\/demand - but it's honestly not worth it to me (despite being free) after I'm already frustrated by the elevator wait.\n\nThe staff seem pretty hit\/miss. I've interacted with a few that have a good sense of humor and are friendly - and others who, when you ask questions, seem bothered by having to answer and\/or have a \"I'm right, you're wrong\" kind of attitude. The fact that they don't allow delivery people up to the rooms (to deliver a pizza for example) -- and force you to wait for the elevator to come down and get it, is also a nuisance. I understand there are some safety concerns - but come on - this is the hospitality industry. I'm staying in a HOTEL (that I'm paying for) -- and paying someone to delivery food to me. Why should you (the hotel) interfere with my paying for convenience? For that matter, anyone can technically walk on to an elevator and go anywhere anyway; so why stop delivery people and force them to give you the information of the customer, so you can call and ask them (me) to come down and get my food? If you want to call and verify that I have a delivery before sending them up, fine - I've had other hotels do this and it's perfectly reasonable. If you want to frisk them before they come up - that's between you and the delivery person, but don't interfere with my time by forcing me to do something (come down and get food) - when I've paid for the convenience of having it delivered. \n\nHousekeeping is also hit or miss. The A\/C filters in my room were absolutely filthy upon arrival. Who knows when they were last cleaned. There were crumbs of \"stuff\" in random room corners, and in general the room just seemed to have a lack of care. This lack of care further showed when I found a Q-tip (I had thrown it in the bathroom trash) in the toilet. As it was the only thing in the trash, did housekeeping just dump the Q-tip in the toilet (maybe or maybe not attempt to flush it down) and put the trash receptacle down so as to not have to change the liner? Also, after having my room serviced, I found an old pizza box still in my room, rather than having been discarded. Did they think I'd want to eat old\/cold\/unrefrigerated pizza 24 hours after having it delivered?\n\nThe room itself is small; I guess you could actually say it's about average for NYC - whatever. The bathroom is TINY - difficult to maneuver in there - and you can't close the bathroom door with the floor mat down, because the door catches on it. It's also worth noting that when I got to my room, the refrigerator was unplugged - not turned off - UNPLUGGED. In order to turn it on, I had to move it out of the cabinet it is in, and plug it in. While I'm all about energy savings, this is the hospitality industry - I shouldn't have to a) figure out what's wrong and b) when I do, move appliances to resolve the issue.  Other hotels have posted signs by their refrigerators saying something along the lines of \"In efforts to be green, the refrigerator has been turned off. If you wish to use it, please turn the knob inside towards X.\" I'm okay with an approach like this - at least I know what's going on - and in this case, if I want to use it, I know what action to take. If, for some reason, the hotel is NOT responsible for the unplugging of the refrigerator, it then goes back to my lack of care by housekeeping - because it would make me wonder why they didn't identify the issue and resolve it.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm not impressed by this location. There are other things I could say, but at over 6000 characters, I should just wrap it up. If this hotel were anywhere by NYC, I would value it at about $70\/night. In NYC, $100\/night. My rate, however, has been anywhere from low 100's to low 200's, depending on the night. I understand that rates fluctuate for a variety of factors, but given the amenities (or lack thereof), the age, quality, etc., it is generally not worthy what you are going to pay, unless you have very specific reason\/purpose to book here (i.e. - to be extremely close to the cruise terminal.)\n\nOne could definitely find far worse places to stay - (the bed, at least, is comfortable - and the A\/C works well, which is more a problem in hotels than one might expect) - but I'd likely not stay at this location ever again (even if I was cruising out of the nearby terminal.)","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":3572583,"title":"A real mixed bag: decent from far... but not up close","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-07-22","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"It's a bit of a mixed bag for this hotel but I will start with the positive:\n\nBy and large the staff are courteous and friendly. With the exception of our experiences with Housekeeping and one woman at the breakfast room, the Front Desk staff, bell staff and breakfast room staff were all friendly and efficient. The hotel is also very well located for those who don't mind a short walk to the main tourist drags. The Hell's Kitchen neighbourhood where this hotel is located has lots of great food options (try B Squared for great pizza\/pasta and Anejo for awesome Mexican nearby). The air-conditioning was excellent! We visited during a heatwave and the room's A\/C unit was used a lot and performed excellently.\n\nNow for the opportunities for improvement:\n\n1. The Wi-fi is hit and miss. It would connect and then drop repeatedly. Sometimes the wifi just wouldn't let you log-on. I was travelling with three others and we all experienced the same troubles. None of us were doing any streaming or downloading of large files we were checking Social Media or sending e-mails. This was ongoing throughout our entire stay and a real annoyance.\n\n2. The room itself is nicely decorated and makes the most of a small space but visitors should expect that its downtown New York so space is at a premium. The linens and terry in the room however are subpar. Their Housekeeping need should be looking at what the room attendants are putting in the room. Our towels were ripped and torn as was the sheet on the bed. Furthermore, the sheet was ripped throughout our entire stay. I don't expect a sheet to be changed daily as I don't change my home sheets daily, and I don't fault a Room Attendant for missing it the first time he\/she made the bed but for the Room Attendant not to see the hole in our sheet at any point when making our bed during our stay and taking the time to change it seems absurd. The shower curtain also had a rip\/hole in it and was never changed throughout our stay and the grout lines in the shower were brown\/red in some areas making me wonder as to their cleanliness.\n\n3. The Room Attendant didn't seem to take much time or attention with our room. On a couple of occasions both garbage cans were not emptied, only one. An ice bucket sat for two days with melted ice in it and the Housekeeping did not empty it and place it back. Further on an elevator ride with two \"supervisors\" according to their name-tags they were much more interested in their own conversation than greeting us or wishing us well\/hold the elevator doors as we left.\n\n4. The breakfast room is a bit crazy. Granted its free, so you need to go in with low expectations but the general layout of the space isn't ideal. It causes some bottlenecks and each time we went (at varying times in the morning both early and later) it was crammed. The food variety is quite good but one morning there was a woman there in a suit and a name tag (I think her initials may have been S.M.) and she was trying to organise things but seemed overwhelmed. At one point as she passed me she mumbled under her breath \"Oh jesus christ\" in reaction to the actions of others at the food bar which I found surprising. Now I am not a religious person but I thought someone in her position (I thought I read on her name tag that she was the Asst. GM but I could be wrong) should not be showing signs of such frustration in front of hotel guests. Comments such as those are probably best kept behind the scenes. Sonia the Housekeeping Manager on the other hand was there the following morning and was a great assistance to the flow and the guests trying to get breakfast and she managed it all with a smile... so kudos to her.\n\nUltimately this hotel was a real mixed bag. Some things were great, while others were very disappointing. I for one take exception to a hotel that charges Manhattan prices but doesn't think enough of its guests to provide them with towels that are in decent condition. Further it didn't seem like the Room Attendants really did much in the room aside form make the bed. Not taking the time to change a torn bed sheet is unacceptable. I'd probably try elsewhere next time I visited as the good doesn't make up for what I found fell short.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

My husband and I booked this hotel for two main reasons. One, because it was close to the cruise ship port and two, because it offers a FREE breakfast. Let me tell you, it was a great choice. The staff, particularly Josie, John and Susana whom we dealt with most during our stay were all very friendly, polite and extremely helpful. \nThe second day of our stay, I mentioned to Josie we were on our honeymoon and she became so excited and immediately began searching for a room on the upper floors. We hadn't unpacked yet so she told us to leave our things and they would have a better room for us when we got back from site seeing. True to her word, we went from the 2nd floor right up to the top floor with a beautiful view of the water and the city. \n\nOur mornings were made extra special by the sweetheart, John. He is the star who keeps everything stocked, cleaned and running smoothly during breakfast. Which by the way, has a vast selection of so many delicious foods (especially the cinnamon buns!!). The very first day, I asked John for 2 packages of strawberry jam because I couldn't find any. From that day on, he went out of his way to get me 2 packages every morning so I would have it with my bagel. He truly goes out of his way to make your morning special. \n\nWe had a great night sleep each night on a comfortable bed with nice soft pillows. We never wanted for anything because our room was always tended to after we left. \n\nI would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone that if you want a place to stay where you are pretty much right down the street from the hustle and bustle of NYC but without the noise, this is the place for you. You won't regret it.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It biggest assets are it's helpful and friendly staff and convenient location that is within 10 minutes walk of Times Square.

There isn't much on this part of 48th, which I thought would be a plus as it might be quiet at night - wrong.  Deliveries were being made across the street all night with lots of banging noise.

We had 2 clean and modern rooms, each with 2 wonderfully comfortable double beds. We all slept very well (once I realised the cleaners had opened a window making it noisy in the early hours, but not a problem at all when the window was closed!). Everything we needed for our stay was in the rooms and they were cleaned daily to a high standard, with fresh towels unless you choose not to have them. As mentioned by other reviewers the rooms are pretty cosy, but you will be missing so much if you spend that much time in them for it to be a problem!\nOn booking the hotel I asked whether they could do anything to make my husbands birthday a bit special and they very kindly provided a free upgrade to top floor rooms with lovely views. Thank you so much Susanna.\nThe hotel is in a great location, around a 10\/15 minute walk to Times Square, close to bars and eateries in Hells Kitchen.  The Intrepid Sea and Air Museum is a few blocks down on the Hudson if you turn left out of the hotel, we had a lovely stroll down late one bitterly cold evening. We found New Yorkers to be very friendly and keen to help us NYC 'newbies'. A local recommended the Press Lounge rooftop bar which is minutes away from the hotel, it's has great reviews but sadly one of our party was under 21 so we were unable to check it out. \nThe area felt safe and is within walking distance of subway. \nThe breakfast included is a real bonus, you can fill up on a good selection of tasty hot and cold food (loved the warm cinnamon buns..yum). It was so nice to come back from a long day to free hot drinks as well. Although the breakfast area isn't that big we always managed to get a table. \nThanks to the staff for their help in answering our many questions, sorting bookings and for consistently being polite and pleasant. Overall wonderful value for money and we would definitely stay again.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

First I have stayed all over NYC in various properties.  This property is really not all that bad, but it has bad things about it.  I found the service impeccable and the staff very friendly.  However the location for a Hell Kitchen hotel is not great at all.  If you are leaving on a cruise, then you would want to stay here, as the cruise ships are literally less than two blocks from the hotel.  If you want to buy a Lexus, just exit left out of the lobby and less than 100 yards you can buy a new car!  There is little to nothing around the hotel as far a restaurants.  Yes of course you can walk to 10th and find things, but next to the hotel there is nothing.  The Salvation Army location is directly across the street.  \n\nIf you are here for Time Square and the other sites, there are better locations and properties.  If you stay here, you will get your exercise as it is really out of the way.  There are two hotel elevators that are not at all sufficient.  If you can, request a lower room and use the steps, or if you prefer to wait 10 minutes for an elevator that is up to you.  You will make many new friends on the elevator  Breakfast is included with the price of the hotel, and it quite simply it is the largest breakfast circus I have EVER seen.  The food is not in the appropriate area causing traffic jams.  I don't know if they planned the breakfast area and this is the best they could offer but it is terrible!  The food is typical.  Forget about sitting, there is simply not enough seating.  You may want to head outside and eat if not too cold.  Expect large groups of people from tour buses.  This could be causing the traffic jams for breakfast.  They will tell you to come early, but listen I have stayed in other HIE's in New York and never saw anything like this.\n\nThe hotel has Dish Network so you get a boat load of HD channels.  The rooms are tiny, but I have seen smaller.  The room I was in girls.....had a bathtub.  It really has everything that you would need.  \n\nBottom-line not a bad property, but you can do better staying elsewhere.  If the price is right go for it.  You may want to try the 3 star row hotels on 39th and 8th, way better location and about 6 hotels in a row that are 3 stars similar type hotels to the HIE's.  It is by the Port Authority Transportation center and in the middle of everything.","travelDate":"2016-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It reminded me of rooms of Hong Kong hotels and cruise ship  suites.  .I guess my room size was about  180 sq. ft. \n\nThe staff was extra helpful. We asked for wine bottle opener. They sent a guy to the room with cork screw. I got rubber bands and a comb at the front desk.\n\nThe breakfast spread was nice. Had everything for everyone.

Apparently, this hotel does not have a service elevator for it's housekeeping staff, and me and my mother got squished in the elevate with three housekeeping staff and huge bags of their laundry. The laundry bags fell on us and they didn't even apologize! I went downstairs to get delivery brochures and the gentlemen at the front desk did not make eye contact with me and kept typing on the computer, talk about horrible customer service. On top of that, other staff (I presume housekeeping) were all talking to another front desk agent and ignored me as well.

They were nicer afterwards when we had contact with them but the first impression was poor and the lobby was empty, it is not like they were busy. This is a busy hotel with lots of tour buses with school trips and lots of tourists hanging out in the breakfast area. The breakfast was adequate but it is like a scene from the Hunger Games. Everyone has to line up and hope to get  a turn. The elevators can barely keep up with the demand. We walked down every time we left and a few times just took the stairs to our room. The room was fine with adequate space. We never had anyone come in to clean up but I did ask a cleaning lady one day if she could just change the garbage bags and give us clean towels but she seemed to be having a bad day and came across as quite angry so I just did it all myself. I did not want her in our room. I saw her again the next day and she seemed a little nicer. The location is fine, Hell's Kitchen is a great place to find great restaurants. The biggest problem with this hotel was that the internet never worked for us. I think so many guests logged on int he evening, the internet could not handle it. The hotel promises 2 things: Free Internet and free breakfast: Internet was not delivered upon and getting to breakfast was not pleasant.

I travel frequently for work, and have stayed in quite a few Holiday Inn Express properties.  I usually have a pretty good experience with them, so we chose to stay at this HIE.  In preparation for our trip to NYC, I read some of the dos and don'ts about travel in NYC.  One of the things I read was that the staff at the hotels were not usually very accommodating toward their guests.  This turned out to be a complete untruth when dealing with the staff at the HIE of Manhattan Midtown West.  Our flight was delayed, and we were late to check in.  The young man who handled our check-in on Monday evening was very professional and happy to help.  We did not immediately want to go to bed, so he told us how to get to Times Square for a walk and asked us how things went when we returned.  The following morning we asked for directions to the World Trade Center Memorial, and another young man was more than happy to give us the information requested.  He made certain that we understood where to go and that we were sure what we needed to do, as the subway system can be a bit intimidating.  However, the young lady who worked the last two mornings of our visit was the star of the show for us.  Her name was Josie.  We had several stops to make, and she wrote the whole trip's directions down for us and gave us tips on what to do when we arrived at each stop.  Josie gave us all of the tips and directions in her wonderfully authentic New York accent. The hotel was very busy the entire time we were there with at least four large groups, but that did not phase the staff.  The rooms are a bit small, but it is Manhattan.  We had a blast in NYC and I would recommend this property for anyone wanting to stay close to Times Square.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Somebody washed up from I am going to make a fun guess and say mud wrestling a bear because the shower was dirty and graced with hair. I'm certain this room was poorly looked over because the washcloth had enough time to be used and dry completely. The moment we called the desk mysteriously there is a double bed available in room 915 but we have to check out that morning. The next day (room 915 check out) I was outside talking to somebody when I returned to come into the building the double doors where you have to scan your card at night to come in was not opening. The lovely desk clerk looked me dead in the face as I am shuffling to figure out why the door wasn't possibly working then I took my key out my purse and had to scan in. Later in my stay at the same time I  watched to see if this was a problem for others. It was not then asking I learned the door can be locked behind the counter... so the stupid woman purposely did this to me..... nice. As mentioned I was checked out to now a single bed room again so I had to sleep on the blessed floor  (yay). The next morning we left to run errands (**it's a long stupid story **) the room gets clean and my personal property is missing. I tore the room apart and it's really gone. I call the desk curious on if it was possibly misplaced by staff and Mr Micheal was kind enough with a smug look to tell me when i get to the desk \"If it's gone... it's gone\" and scribbles a name on a card and sends me on my way. It's my last night here as I type this and just as magical as the first problem they find a double bed room for us... how useless\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661\u2661 \nI am too scared to ask for any service in fear of my property and my sister's. Stay of you want but I will not ever again. This has been a serious string of bad luck since we took the key.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

We stayed for four nights, 2nd - 6th, and it catered for our every need, comfy bed, nice clean bathroom, plenty of towels, and enough food at breakfast to set you off on the tourist trail around New York, which I have to say is absolutely amazing. Despite the cold our stay to celebrate a 50th birthday was fantastic, we used the big bus tour for our stay along with city pass, this in my opinion offers the best opportunity to view the city and experience the heights, it would be nice to visit again, maybe one day we will? overall could not be faulted, from landing at JFK to leaving. A little word too for the New Yorker, thank you. It is quite obvious you love your city, and so you should.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I contacted the front desk who sent security up, silence!\nI spoke with the desk that morning who informed me they had sent the students packing, way to go!!.\nThrough the disturbance I was informed we could have a late check-out, even without asking.\nMichael and his team go out of there way to make sure your stay is enjoyable and nothing is a problem. In the mornings they serve up a great breakfast, a little busy if you hit it at the wrong time (best going just after 9). The room we had was more than suitable with a king size bed, a small but manageable bathroom which had a fantastic shower and the room was cleaned daily. The hotel is situated roughly 15 minutes walk from times square with plenty of deli's and places to eat nearby.

My friend and I kept getting knocks on the door every hour or so, even though we put the do not disturb sign up.\n\nWe were checked out by Josie and Susana, both were very helpful and helped us check our bags at the hotel so that we didn't have to lug them around the city all day.\n\nThanks guys, good job!","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I'm gluten intolerant and if you just ask, the very helpful staff would provide me with a gluten free breakfast.

I arrived at the hotel early and they were kind enough to check me in early. They did ask whether I would be fine with a ground floor room. I did say yes. It was really kind of them to let me in early after a 10 hour flight from South America. I was really grateful.\n\nDO NOT DO THIS- get a room on a higher floor. My room was located next to the gym, by a staff room and opposite the breakfast room which was open 24\/7 with music as you could get free coffee. It was also right by the stairwell which lots of guests used and let the door slam. I am a very heavy sleeper and barely got any sleep here as it was such a noisy room. It has put me off ever coming back. The rooms on the upper floors may be a lot better.\n\nThe rooms are what you'd expect, clean, got all you need, no frills, but not that basic either. You got lots of towels, toiletries and a comfy bed. The rooms were fairly dated in their appearance but more than fine to stay in and represented what you paid. There is a sign up saying if you forgot any of the basics like toothbrushes you can tell reception and they'll give you one for free. Really kind and useful service. I picked up a sewing kit for a loose button.\n\nThe location of the hotel was good- three blocks to time square - a short walk to get in the thick of things. It was well lit at night to walk back to, and did not feel a dangerous area at all. \n\nOne of the great things about the hotel was the free breakfast. Expect to queue for 15 minutes to get a table (whatever time of the morning you try) it really is an asset to the hotel, but also frustrating when you just want to go out and explore.\n\nI have to say the staff were excellent here, made you feel really welcome and were very kind people \n\nThe hotel can order you a private car to the airport which is really handy as taxis don't really go past the hotel, I did this as I had so much luggage. This wasn't the hotels fault, but the car was over half an hour late with not even an apology and I had to help put my suitcases in the boot as they couldn't lift them. If you use them- make sure there is plenty of time spare and keep chasing the staff on reception to make sure the car comes. \n\nWith so many hotels in NYC I'd be loathed to stay here again as I barely got any sleep, the noise was relentless and it didn't leave for a relaxing holiday at all. The staff were good though, and that's why I gave it three stars, otherwise it would have been two.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

From the moment we arrived we noticed how friendly the staff were and how clean the hotel was, from the main entrance to the corridors to the rooms themselves. \n\nCheck-in was quick and easy and we were soon in our top floor room, which had a lovely view of the city to go with it. Rooms are small but not unexpected for New York and we still had plenty of room for two large suitcases and two small cases in our room without causing any hindrance.\n\nThe room was immaculate and housekeeping kept this standard up through the whole trip. The sound-proofing between the rooms and the corridor isn't wonderful as you do hear people talking, visiting vending machine, doors opening and closing but these are usual hotel noises. I am a naturally light sleeper so sleep with ear plugs in and I didn't hear anything (including the sirens and traffic noise outside!) to stop me having a good nights sleep! The amazingly comfortable king size beds also greatly assisted in this too!\n\nThe hotel is about a 15 minute walk from Times Square and the location is ideal for anyone who wishes to be close enough to the hustle and bustle of the main streets but far enough away for some relaxation when required. Be warned though you will walk miles whilst on holiday in NYC!\n\nWill remember every second of my holiday to New York (especially getting engaged!\ud83d\udc8d) and will definitely consider staying at the HIE Manhattan West Side for a return trip.

After my experience at both hotels, let me say this. The Holiday Inn Express was cleaner, brighter, more modern, and MUCH more service oriented than the place i subsequently paid almost double for. Sure, the holiday inn express doesn't have a cavernous marble-festooned lobby, nor is it a 30 second walk to 5th ave. But it is a short walk to many amazing restaurants, broadway theatres, subway stations galore, and the amazing hell's kitchen neighborhood. Oh and you could walk to 5th ave from it in probably 20 minutes. It's a safe area, and I walked in all directions to and from the hotel, including home from a show at night, by myself. Always felt safe. My room was cozy and well appointed and clean. Everything looked new. Everybody at the front counter was super friendly and welcoming, and I would like to give a special shout out to Wilneda and Ashley, both of whom went out of their way to advise me on routes and provide directions.

Free WIFI throughout the hotel with acceptable speeds.\n\nWe were a party of four, staying in two separate rooms, both standard kings. We were guests for three nights, Wednesday through Saturday.

With two large double beds and a large (for NY)bathroom it was more than enough space for me and my Mum. \n\nYes the neighbourhood isn't 'fancy' and maybe it's because we aren't particularly 'fancy' folks this didn't bother us at all-I very much warmed to Hells Kitchen\/Clinton area and felt more of a neighbourhood than the more touristy spots. \n\nThe breakfast in the hotel is more than adequate with a variety of food from cereal and bread to hot food. It does get very busy and seating is limited, but for complimentary breakfast I can't really justify that as a 'complaint'\n\nThe highlight for me was the staff, from check-in to breakfast every day, to the staff member who stopped me on our final day to say 'goodbye' everyone was really marvellous. \n\nWe travel to NY regularly and I'm hoping our next stay will be a return here.","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I am not a city person and travel only infrequently to New York.  The travel agency found this as closest room to Javits Center available on my dates.  It is walkable to Javits, but is a haul through a more industrial side of New York.   In a more residential\/industrial area.  Salvation Army is directly across street so there is always a crowd on the street.  It was there day and night and did make my 5th floor room a bit noisy.  It is NYC, so I expect noise.  This was people talking noise, spiced with the occasional disagreement.  Almost next store was a M4M strip club.  I never felt unsafe, but, day or night, I never felt completely relaxed either.  Mix of stores and small restaurants on 10th.  11th was mostly car dealers and repair.  Horses and horse drawn carriages overnight other side of 11th.  Room was utilitarian and on the small side.  Clean.  Hotel offers breakfast.  Never ate due to large crowds. Hotel was very full and appeared many were value driven travelers.  Staff was great.  Very pleasant.  Seems like staffing is at near minimum viable level.  Frequently there was a line waiting.  Cabs are present on street, but plan for some delay.  No line like at larger hotels.

If that was a queen bed then it was put into the room sideways which is the only way it would have fit in the room.  The result was that the room was, effectively, very small.  Given that, it was still a comfortable enough; however, it should be noted that the room did not have a microwave nor did it have a refrigerator ... something we've sort of become accustomed to.  The room DID have a very nice shower; however, there was very little (as in \"almost none\") counter space in the bathroom.  \n\nOur second stay was in a room with a king bed and THAT room had actually been designed with the king bed in mind. ;-)  That room was very comfortable, even though it,room, too, didn't have a microwave and the bath also didn't have much counter space.  \n\nIf you are looking for a luxurious place to stay while in New York, I would have to advise against this hotel.

Tratto di strada tranquillo in una zona piena di locali e ristoranti di qualsiasi tipo e sulla vicina 8th avenue possibilit\u00e0 anche di supermercati della catena Duane Reade oltre a diversi deli. La fermata metro pi\u00f9 vicina \u00e8 a 10 minuti a piedi (linea che collega al JFK), mentre Times sq. dista circa 15 minuti a piedi. Tenete presente queste distanze, perch\u00e9 su soggiorni medio-lunghi, camminando gi\u00e0  molto durante la giornata, possono pesare. 10 piani (11 per loro, ma il piano terra \u00e8 considerato primo piano). A noi \u00e8 toccato il secondo piano, vista retro davvero desolante. Camera ampia; letto largo ma corto (attenzione a chi \u00e8 alto), con materasso ottimo ma cuscini gonfi e morbidi (la testa affonda); numerose e ben distribuite prese di corrente; frigorifero vuoto a completa disposizione per riporre acqua, ecc. Bagno non molto ampio ma accessori ben distribuiti; lavabo micro, vasca\/doccia con tenda; asciugacapelli, a due velocit\u00e0, piccolo ma efficace. Azionare la doccia non \u00e8 affatto intuitivo: chiedete alla reception, hanno una stampa con cui vi mostreranno come metterla in funzione (foglio che potrebbero appendere sul lato interno della porta del bagno...). Pulizia della stanza: appena sufficiente. Un filo bianco sulla moquette presente al nostro arrivo \u00e8 rimasto l\u00ec per tutti i nostri 8 giorni di soggiorno. Il lavabo un giorno non \u00e8 stato per nulla pulito e in un'altra occasione \u00e8 stato pulito sommariamente. Un paio di capelli sulla vaschetta del wc sono rimasti per due giorni. Per due volte abbiamo dovuto richiedere la carta igienica, perch\u00e9 terminata non era stato lasciato un nuovo rotolo (la consegna di 2 rotoli nuovi \u00e8 stata effettuata in pochi minuti ma comunque \u00e8 una richiesta fastidiosa). La colazione, compresa nel prezzo, \u00e8 sicuramente positiva: varia scelta tra dolce e salato, con prodotti buoni, costantemente riforniti da personale discreto, paziente e cortese. Uova strapazzate, uova sode, bacon, mini muffin, yogurt, pane a fette e bagels (entrambi  bianchi o cereali), frutta (ottime le banane, pessime le mele), ecc ecc E, a disposizione, una macchina che sforna dei fantastici mini pancake ! Da accompagnare con salsa d'acero (con o senza zucchero) o burro d'arachidi. Non c'\u00e8, per\u00f2, alcuna variazione: quindi tutte le mattine troverete la medesima offerta di prodotti. La sala colazione non ha molti posti a sedere ma il turnover \u00e8 veloce, pertanto l'attesa, quando capita, non \u00e8 mai lunga. Nel corso della giornata, all'ingresso della sala, sono disponibili caff\u00e8, te e, sempre offerti dall'albergo, lemonade o te alla pesca con ghiaccio o acqua con frutta, e cos\u00ec via. In un angolo, due postazioni pc (lentissimi) e una stampante. Wifi ottimo in tutta la struttura. Personale alla reception molto gentile, disponibile e pronto a fornire ogni informazione. Check in e out veloce. Possibilit\u00e0 di deposito bagagli (gratuito).","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

However, the rooms are a little cramped and could do with some sort of soundproofing, as I could hear every car and person outside the building, in the room next door, in the hallway, and literally anywhere else in the world. Between that and the fact that the sheets are extremely thin, it's hard to get a good night's sleep, especially if you're here on a weekend visit. Keep in mind that this wasn't on the first floor; this was on the top (11th) floor. I heard people outside like they were outside my window on the 11th floor.\n\nThe shower was also weird--for one thing, we had a housekeeper replenish our toiletries with three lotions instead of a lotion, shampoo, and conditioner, but also, it was extremely difficult to figure out how to use the shower. (Hint: You pull down on the bathtub's faucet.) The towel rack is awkwardly placed in a way that makes you feel like you will soak all of the towels once you turn on the shower, as it is in the same stall as your shower and is about six feet away from the shower head.\n\nMost importantly to anybody who plans on using the internet, though: \"Spotty\" is an extremely nice way to describe the internet. In the twenty minutes that I have used writing this review from the hotel room, I have had the internet drop out a grand total of five times--in fact, I have had to adjust that number twice while writing this review!--and it's bad no matter what time of day you're using it. Midnight? Nope. Six in the morning? Nope. When it does work, it's slow and hard to do anything more than check your e-mail. If you have mobile data on your phone, you'll most likely get a wonderful 4G signal in your room, so it'll be easier to waste your data.\n\nHowever, the location is (for the most part) very well-kept and the continental breakfast was tolerable. It's a very convenient place to stay in Manhattan. You get a pretty good selection of DirecTV channels in your room--I believe you only lose pay-per-view and on-demand channels?--and the air conditioning works fine and doesn't suck the humidity from the air in the process. It's a clean, smoke-free environment.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to stay for cheap, this is your place. However, I passed quite a few other hotels while walking to Rockefeller Plaza and I'm sure that those would suit you better if you're looking for more than just an air-conditioned\/heated room to put your stuff down in and sleep in.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Noise traveled easily from the halls and the neighbors which interrupted sleep. They've got free soaps and shampoos in the bathrooms but they were small and not the best quality. Rooms had windows but not really a good view.\n\nOverall:\nThe hotel provided for a very nice and relaxing stay overall. Not exactly the most posh hotel around, and definitely doesn't have all of the bells and whistles, but acceptable for a short stay and small budget.

Every little extra thing we needed was gladly available to us (printing tickets in the lobby for free; holding our luggage for the day; having them phone a local pizza place for us) and the usual processes such as check-in, check-out, and room cleaning were handled professionally and efficiently. It is clear that the staff are happy and well trained. The hotel was about 10-15 minutes from Times Square and the savings were worth it. Not only that, but the free breakfast saved our family of 4 a lot over the course of 3 days we were there. My husband is quite a picky eater, but even he was pleased with the selection and quality (breads, cereals, scrambled eggs, bacon, oatmeal, fruit, juice\/milk\/coffee\/tea. Yes, it could be a very chaotic place in the morning, but just keep looking out for a table as you're getting your food and you'll find a spot. They have a wonderful outdoor area you could go to as well. One thing that very much impressed me is that they were still bringing out full trays of bacon and eggs with only 10 minutes to go for breakfast. As for the hotel rooms, they are small, but that is par for NYC. I found it wasn't as sound-proofed as some other hotels, but that was a minor complaint. We were usually so exhausted from our sightseeing around the city that we slept very soundly. The beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed having a mini-fridge and were glad we brought a cooler of drinks with us....snacks and drinks in the city can be expensive. Think about everything you want to do in the city. If you're only doing Times Square\/Broadway, stay there for convenience and to save time. But if doing a wide variety of attractions, stay here and save some money - you can still get to everything quite conveniently. The cabs are very reasonable in NYC so use them for any attractions that are a distance away. Another bonus to this hotel was how easy and quick it was to get to by driving - it was only about a 2 or 3 minute drive from the Lincoln Tunnel, so it was easy to get to and when you're nervous about driving in NYC, it's good to not have to go far.

The location is great just a few blocks from Times Square.  My only complaint was the elevator in the morning, took a long time to get down to breakfast.  I was moved to a room on the first floor no problem.  I would stay here again.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Took the train into Penn Station and the CE up to 50th. Its a good half mile walk from the train to the hotel so be prepared for that! I called while on the train to see if I could check in early, and they told me no. When I arrived at the hotel I figured I'd give it a try. Thankfully they were able to get me in! There were other people waiting in the lobby, not sure if they were waiting on a specific room. I was in room 501. There are two elevators and there was always a wait for the lift, but to be expected in NYC. The internet worked fine, my room was clean and fine space-wise since it was just me. The bathroom was pretty small and my room was just a shower, no tub. The water was hot and pressure was good so no complaints there. I didn't try to eat breakfast in the lobby, I assume its a mad-house. If you are at the hotel just for a space to sleep, then I think it would be fine. If you are doing more sightseeing, or have a family, I'd recommend a spot closer to a subway. I don't really mind the walk but with bad weather or a lot of luggage that would not be so fun.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I found this hotel after much research and booked it via Hotwire.  I couldn't have found a better deal I think.  \n\nFirst, the location - The hotel's location is exactly what I wanted.  Walking east a few short blocks and we are right in the middle of Times Square.  Two blocks to the west is the Pier terminal.  My kids and I actually were able to drag our luggage and walked right into the pier without having to deal with taxi.  Taxi to Central Park Strawberry Field from the hotel is $10 including tip.  Taxi to Greenwich Village is about $15 tip included.  Basically you can pretty much get places from the hotel easily with reasonable taxi fares.\n\nSecond, as everyone else has already pointed out - the staff is very helpful.  They were polite and cheerful.  They also let us store our luggage between checking out and boarding the cruise so we could see more of the city.  \n\nThird, the hotel itself.  It's nice, clean and pretty new.  I stayed there with my two teen daughters and didn't feel cramped at all.  The breakfast was plentiful and pretty good - just like any other Holiday Inn Express we have stayed before.  \n\nOverall, I was really happy to have stayed there, and will for sure stay again if we visit New York City.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Every morning I had to throw elbows for food, most of it was gone, I'd normally settle for a stale bagel. They need more staff to run breakfast if they are selling this as a feature. \n\nWe also had to ask twice to get our room cleaned the first day then the day we were checking out (11am checkout) she came before 9am to clean the room..really? You're going to clean it twice? \n\nThe rooms were clean and small, the doors are paper thin and there is only two tiny elevators for 11 floors which the staff use as well.

And I can tell you it was a great value.  Our team had 5 rooms at the property.  The rooms and the Breakfast were great.  The Breakfast area is small for the amount of people that stay.  However, there is nothing that the hotel can do as people hog tables and work on their computers.  You would think they would realize a ton of people are trying to eat breakfast.  There is enough selection for breakfast for everyone.  Hotel is in great proximity to everything including Times Square.  I did have one issue which was corrected by the Housekeeping Manager within minutes.  I told the Hotel Manager Yan that I need my linens changed and the message made it to the Housekeeping Manager and no further.  They did however address changing the linens within 15 minutes without issue.  Provided a nice note and some complimentary chocolates which was really nice.  I was quite impressed how they handled the problem.  Oh and I forgot to mention the gentleman who handles the breakfast was very sweet soft spoken and nice.  They have a good staff at this hotel.  We will definitely return.  One thing I do have to note is the slowness of the elevator slows down everything in the lobby.  For the price you pay this hotel cannot be beat especially because of the breakfast.  Everything you need is in your room.

Perhaps a bit too long to walk every day if you were elderly, but convenient for the group I was travelling with. The room was basic - we had a double bed and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was relatively uncomfy, but I was so tired from the jetlag and being out all day that I slept anyways. We also had a room near the lift shaft so it was extremely noisy throughout the night. \n\nThe staff were extremely helpful, and managed to deal with any questions of queries we had.\n\nDespite being a basic stay, I would recommend this to friends and family travelling to NYC. I would also stay here again. NYC is such a busy city that you don't want or need to spend the whole day in the hotel room - you need somewhere to sleep at night and thats it - and this hotel lives up to exactly that!","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Not only was he unaware and uninformed about his own hotel's policies, he also made almost zero effort to help us in this situation. He was unable to show us where it stated in our reservation the hotel's policy of same-day cancellations. He made 1-2 calls to other hotels to check their availability, and only did so after blaming us for this situation that we had no say in. After nearly three hours in the hotel lobby, we were finally able to find an adequate lodging situation, but only after missing our dinner reservations that we had made 3 weeks prior. We also arrived late to our evening plans as by the time we found our accommodations and traveled there, it was nearly 9 PM (we arrived around 5). \n\nI wish I could review the actual hotel as I had been planning on staying there for over a month, but unfortunately I had to scramble to find last-minute accommodations.

Unfortunately I had to fly out to LA and Australia the following day but if I'd realised how excellently positioned this place was I would have booked at least one night more.\nAs a single traveller on a budget I chose the least expensive option and it was more than adequate for my needs.  The room, although being quite small, had everything I required with a very comfy queen bed with an en suite bathroom which included a full bath. \nWith a very substantial breakfast included in the cost of the room and served in a communal dining room - make sure you get in early to snag a seat! - means you start the day with your stomach full of nutrious food. There's even a very nifty automatic pancake maker which only takes a couple of minutes to spit out two perfectly cooked little treats.\nMy room had an automatic coffee maker - a nice way to end a busy day trawling the streets of this exciting city - and everything I needed to make my stay very enjoyable.\nThis was an excellent hotel to base myself, being within very close walking distance of Times Square and the Broadway District.  I was pleasantly surprised when I went for a wander around the nearby neighbourhood looking for a place to catch a quick bite to eat and pick up a few supplies.  Located in the suburb of Hell's Kitchen - not quite a moniker you expect to be able to walk around quite safely on your own with a twisted ankle at dusk but I felt very safe and marvelled at the recently renovated apartment buildings lining the nearby streets.  There was no graffiti to be seen whatsoever and chatting with a couple of the residents was a delightful interlude along the way.  \nMy favourite surprise was happening upon a gorgeous little community garden right in the centre of this bustling metropolis and only a block from the hotel along W. 48th St.  It was the size of a pocket handkerchief and nestled between two apartment blocks.  The brilliant display of daffodils, tulips and other colourful varieties along with pretty bushes and a few garden seats nestled in amongst the foliage meant it was a delightful place to sit and reflect for a while.\nWith the hotel located in such a flat district, it's easy to get around even for someone with a sore ankle and I enjoyed being in the centre of this bustling place.\nThe staff were extremely helpful and friendly - and when the gentlemen on the front desk - regretfully I can't remember his name but a lovely African American with an unusual name and the biggest smile - found out I had twisted my ankle earlier in the day he was quick to provide me with a bag full of ice, towels to wrap around it and extra pillows for elevation purposes.  I was so very grateful for his help and those ministrations certainly made a difference to the swelling and pain.  I would definitely stay in this hotel again if ever I happen to have the chance to fly from my home-town in Brisbane, Australia across the world to New York City.","travelDate":"2015-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

This was my first trip to NYC and as a detailed-oriented person, spent a significant amount of time researching accommodations in Manhattan before my trip. \n\nOf course, there are a plethora of options, from hostels; to renting an apartment; to the hotels and more. I spent time searching on sites like VRBO, and found many of the less expensive options booked for my days. Ditto with the apartment rentals. And looking at hotels, found many to be quite expensive compared to what I'm used to here in small town Ontario, Canada. \n\nIf you are looking for comfortable, affordable (for NYC-NOT wherever you are from) accommodation, then please consider the Holiday Inn Express on W. 48th St in Manhattan. I booked it from one of the hotel booking sites as one of the \"secret\" deals where the hotel name and location is revealed after booking, and saved about 30%. \n\nThis Holiday Inn Express features a full hot breakfast daily. There was ample quantities of food, bacon, scrambled eggs, cinnamon rolls, juice, coffee\/tea, toast, waffles, fruit, you name it. \n\nThe room I was given had a king sized bed; workstation, and there was complimentary wireless internet. I had a private bathroom featuring tasteful tile and a glass walk-in shower. \n\nI did also go on Trip Advisor after booking this hotel and read some complaints. The main three were that the rooms were small; the rooms were expensive; and that it was a long way from Times Square. \n\nWell, let me set the record straight: first, it's NYC! Real Estate is a valuable commodity, and so rooms in most hotels are small in NYC. Deal with it. This isn't Boise, Idaho! Unless you are willing to spend a thousand dollars a night, you aren't going to get a spacious hotel room in Manhattan. \n\nSecondly, again, it's NYC! The rooms are going to be expensive. And this, for most of you, is going to be an experience of a lifetime, to visit Manhattan. Are you really going to quibble over a couple hundred bucks? If so, NYC is likely not for you. This isn't Dothan, Alabama, ok? There is a reason why millions of people want to visit NYC and most of you reading this have never heard of Dothan, AL (my apologies to those readers from there, but if it's any consolation, I've been to Dothan, nice place). \n\nSure, you could stay in Hoboken or Hackensack and hike it in on the MTA trains every day, and waste hours of valuable vacation time sitting on the subway, but do you really want to do that to save a $100 a night? Or, you could stay in Harlem or Queens or Brooklyn and face the same kind of commute. But you are there to stay in Manhattan, right?! So spend the $$. Look for deals. Skip lunch. Buy one less souvenir. But you can't put a price on a private bath and a safe place to store your stuff while you are out seeing the sights. \n\nLastly, about the distance to Times Square: it's about a 15 minute walk, yes. A little father than some with mobility issues might like. But have you priced out hotels on the doorstep of Times Square? Um. Yeah. I'm not a walker by any means, in my normal life here in Ontario, Canada. But at the same time, I didn't go to NYC just to see Times Square. I was all over that little island, Uptown and Downtown, East and West. It doesn't really matter where you stay. There is ample public transit if you don't want to walk. You can take a cab to Times Square for about $10-15 if you like. I walked most everywhere close by and am no worse for wear because of it. In fact, I've started walking regularly now since being home. \n\nThis hotel is on the doorstep of Hell's Kitchen. I ate in many fine restaurants there. It's a 10 minute walk to a subway that will take you anywhere in Metro NYC that you wanna go. It's 5-10 minutes walk from the Western side of Manhattan with the harbour. It's nestled nicely in this totally cool authentic NY neighbourhood. There is a wonderful courtyard outside that you can sit and enjoy and watch NYC life pass by the doorstep. \n\nSome other reviews were also negative about the crowds at breakfast and not being able to get seated or having to wedge around people to get to the food. HELLO! Ahem. It's NYC! OK? This isn't your palatial kitchen and dining room in your million dollar mansion wherever you are from. You aren't going to be able to have exclusive and sole access to the food. You are in a hotel. I've stayed in hotels around North America, and unfortunately, at breakfast, it can be a challenge to get your food, find a seat, and eat. GASP: you may even have to sit with a complete stranger and actually have a conversation with them! My God, isn't THAT horrible?! Seriously, folks! I'm not sure why some people even go on vacation: they don't seem to have anything good to say about anything on these reviews. \n\nLook, here's what you need to know: the rooms are clean and secure; they spray for bedbugs regularly, and laundry is picked up and cleaned daily. The staff are pleasant and helpful. The food is typical hotel fare. Considering where it is, the rooms are reasonably priced; and cozy. You'll have your own bathroom. \n\nYes, there is no pool. But are you really coming to NYC to use the hotel pool? There is no on-site restaurant, but there about 11,000 restaurants within a 30 minute transit ride in any direction. It's a bit of a hike to Times Square, but you'll get used to that by day two and besides, you didn't come all the way to NYC just to see Times Square, did you? \n\nBook this hotel, enjoy your trip, you can thank me later :)","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

Our clothes stayed in the suitcases which had to be squashed between the beds and the walls. Very annoying. The ensuite was fine, shower worked well, coffee and tea was provided in the room too. Breakfast was bedlam on each of the four mornings we were there. The area was far too small for the amount of people catered for. People were taking their breakfasts to their rooms as they had nowhere to sit. I would recommend this hotel as a short stay hotel only.

A few mins later we were checked in and allocated a very comfortable room on the ground floor.  My only issue with the room was the noise levels from around 5am, when the staff entered the pantry located next to my room.  I presume the pantry was used to start the breakfast preparations for a 630am start. I suppose the bonus of being woken early, meant that we avoided any queues at breakfast and at the major tourist attractions.  I am quite certain, had the early wake up call been a major issue to us, the staff would have allocated us a new room.  The service provided by every member of the team was fantastic.  Such a friendly staff in a hotel goes a long way in my opinion.\nThe hotel is located around 15 mins walk to Times Square and 10 mins to the nearest Subway.  There is a Salvation Army accommodation located across the street, however non of the residents there caused any issues and I felt very safe in the area (possibly because I was with my husband rather than female company).  There are plenty of restaurants located around the Hells Kitchen area.

It was affordable and seemed like a good choice for our visit.\n\nI have many positive things to say about the hotel.  The staff were very friendly.  We were checked in quickly and efficiently with smiles.  The real standout in friendliness was the breakfast staff who were constantly asking if we were doing OK and how our morning was.  Breakfast itself was incredibly plentiful and filling with good hot and cold options to choose from.\n\nOur room was small, which was to be expected after many New York visits.  I wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in the small room but it was efficiently laid out.  The king bed took up most of the space but there was still room for bed side tables and a desk\/closet.  The bathroom was fairly cramped but still very useable.  We had a nice blackout blind and well working heating\/AC controls.\n\nThe one negative aspect I have to say about the hotel is its location.  While we recognized it was on the west side, the long three avenue walk from Times Square felt especially tiresome at night with no good subway service.  We appreciated the bars around the corner (and their good happy hour) but 11th Avenue is about one avenue too far for our comfort and timeliness.  I'd probably stay somewhere a little bit closer next time.\n\nLocation\/distance aside, this is a very comfortable property.

Una buona colazione abbondante dove mangi di tutto e sicuramente lo consiglio per visitare New York, avrebbe bisogno di qualcuno che alla holl parlerebbe anche italiano... ma questo era solo un mio problema.Se dovessi tornare a New York tornerei tranquillamente in questo albergo sia per il prezzo, per la colazione che in giro \u00e8 costosissimo e sia per la posizione.

What makes this otherwise ordinary Holiday Inn Express extraordinary, is the amazing staff. From the folks at the front desk, to the hard workers trying to keep the breakfast bar stocked, to anyone I ran into in the halls or elevators, without exception, were genuinely the friendliest, most helpful & kind people I've ever encountered in my travels! It was kind of weird. I kept expecting the spell to be broken by someone losing their cool during one of the crazy packed breakfasts where they just couldn't keep up and there was standing room only in the lounge area, but nope, it never happened. My husband spent a whole day of vacation in bed due to being ill during the night & hadn't eaten anything all day so I asked if there was any chance they had an apple left over from breakfast at 9pm...not only did the awesome staff member give me 2 apples to take to my hubs, but also a banana & orange! Really, I just had the warm fuzzies the whole time I was there & never felt stupid asking for help or questions as a 1st time visitor to the Big City! Plus-hust around the corner from Hell's Kitchen-where we ate most of the time which I highly recommend!","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}
