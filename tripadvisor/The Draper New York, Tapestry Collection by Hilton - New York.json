However, it\u2019s worth knowing what you will get for $350 per night (the rate I paid).\n\nTapestry by Hilton are individual hotels operating loosely (very loosely) under the Hilton banner.   I am Hilton Diamond, and really only booked this hotel because it came under that banner.  However, the Hilton affiliation is meaningless as there are no facilities, room upgrade possibilities etc to speak of.    \n\nThis is an old building that has been give a makeover at minimum cost.  The bones are still very old, but painted and finished to a fresh standard.  Elevators are a bit beaten up and slow.  Plumbing took 5 mins to deliver hot water to the 16th floor when checking out in the middle of the night.  Light switches haven\u2019t been moved\/upgraded meaning you can\u2019t darken the room from your bed etc.  What you are left with is a Hotel Ibis standard with nicer finishes (a bit of nice wood, marble, tiles etc).  \n\nStaff are nice at the front desk, but uniforms are a bit shabby (better to go more casual than have those \u201850x dry cleaned\u2019 jackets).\n\nThere is a breakfast bar in the reception area, which seems to have some construction still ongoing to turn it into a cafe.  However, for now you eat in your room.  Food quality was ok, but it is done is a rather unprofessional air.  See the photo of the sign which sums up how what could be a nicely designed hotel is being operated in a shabby fashion.  \u201cWe are separate from the hotel!\u201d  Honestly?  I doubt they have ever had a customer who doesn\u2019t stay in the hotel, and I bet 90% of their customers are using Hilton Diamond $18 credits.  So what a way to speak to your customers.\u2028\u2028  \n\nRooms will not be serviced unless requested.  So trash etc is left in the room.  This stunned me at $350 per night.  Is that actually a thing now?  Housekeeping seems a bit slapdash.  My bedlinen had fresh biro marks on it.  I told myself if must have been a housekeeper\u2019s mistake - the linen looked clean\u2026  Clocks hadn\u2019t been adjusted for daylight saving changes (and wasn\u2019t clear how to do it).  Very poor when many guests will have changed timezone.  Setting people up to miss a flight.\n\nI was given a pass for free to use a v good Crunch gym 2 blocks away.  Great gym.  I was told this was due to Diamond status.  Not sure what the situation is for others, and I only got it by asking about a gym.\n\nWould I stay again?  The bed was comfortable.  The room was ok.  I could probably have found somewhere else in the area for a similar rate with a bigger room and more facilities - but those were things like \u2018Crowne Plazas\u2019 with zero character at the time I booked.  This had a bit of personality.  So maybe I would.  \n\nThe hotel just needs to take more pride in the details (like the fact that the cafe is strange, the door to the facilities office behind reception was never closed and therefore back of house was visible etc etc).  The concept was OK, and I respect them trying to renovate an old building at best value.  But it\u2019s a shame to see it being done without care.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Originally I was to arrive on Wednesday afternoon but due to an emergency of my long time family pet dying before my flight I had to push my arrival to a little after midnight. Already distraught from the pain and suffering of losing my pet of 20 years I was greeted by reception that took a very long time to check me and my fianc\u00e9 in. We were told the computers become slow around that time (there was no other guest checking in so I don\u2019t know how could your computers become slow at a period of practically no usage) so we were allowed to go to our room and complete the check in process in the morning. An hour after we were settled into our room to go to sleep we received a call from front desk to come back down to try the check in process again at 1am in the morning where I had to redress and make my way back down to the lobby. Later that morning me and my fianc\u00e9 was greeted to a loud fire alarm going off and then a PSA announcement stating that the little cafe downstairs had burned a customers item and that was the reason for the alarm being set off. They took forever to explain this reason rather than stating false alarm and proceeding with normal operations. As the days progress we notice the walls of the hotel room were paper thin. I could hear constant thumping of luggage all around me and noise in the hall way. The hotel only offers housekeeping upon request and only provided 2 small water bottles upon arrival and nothing further. In the room the mini fridge was such a loud disruption to my sleep I had to unplug the whole unit. The cafe they have downstairs had a very limited selection of food and beverage and also only operate from 8am - 1pm. I had ordered take out and received a bottled Coke to that required a bottle opener. When I asked front desk if they had one they told me that another guest had it in their room. On my last day leaving the hotel front desk asked me how was my stay to which I replied it was ok. The front desk agent proceeds to ask if I did not like the room so I politely told her no it wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience to which she chuckled and skipped the conversation. When I asked for the hotel to hold my luggage for a few hours since my flight was later in the evening I was told it would be $1 per bag we take cash only. I was honestly astonished and asked her why? She told me it was hotel policy to which I replied \u201cI\u2019ve never stayed at a hotel that would charge me to hold my bags for a few hours\u201d she waved her hands to other guest bags (which was weirdly placed up against the hotel lobby glass door for anyone walking by to see and told me \u201cwe have a lot of bags as you can see\u201d I replied I\u2019m not paying for something that\u2019s always free everywhere I stay and she reluctantly took my bags for me to hold. Upon returning to the hotel to collect my things I gave the same front desk agent my ticket for my bags to which she asked me to help her find them without even trying to look for my items. I then noticed my luggage that held numerous expensive items inside were put up against the glass door like all the other bags but what really surprised me was that the glass door was unlocked and she pushed my bags outside and told me to collect them in the freezing cold. I will never stay at this hotel again and they have shaped my perception of Hilton as a non caring establishment that only cares about profit than their guest.

The evening before her collapse, there were six of us hanging out on the balcony of our NYC hotel room.  We had spent two action-packed days seeing the sites in NYC.   We laughed and talked about what we had seen\u2014the Empire State Building (yes, King Kong was there), the reverence of the 9\/11 Memorial and Museum, the Observation Deck of the World Trade Center, and my sister-in-law chasing the infamous Naked Cowboy to get a photo.

Instead, while at The Draper Hotel, I watched my brother valiantly try putting his life-saving skills to work on his own wife.

Realise this is not the hotel's fault, but disappointing nonetheless.\n- Lack of instructions on how to use amenities in room\n- Bizarrely the only place to hang clothes was a clothes rail above the fridge and coffee making machine and doesn't provide enough length for dresses or trousers\n- Our TV didn't work, but realised it was due to missing battery and front desk staff happily replaced but would have been good if this had been checked when room was prepared\n- Air fan in bathroom did not work, which meant odours lingered\n- $150 security deposit taken on top of room charge (refunded in 5 working days after check out) - I can't see anywhere in my booking confirmations any mention of this charge so came as a surprise and not something I had budgeted for which impacted my spending while waiting for the refund\n\nFor me, the negatives outweighed the positives.  For the cost, I wouldn't go back and I felt like it didn't live up to the Hilton brand.  Overall, disappointing.\n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}
{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":20021058,"title":"What a disappointment!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-25","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I took my wife to The Draper to spend the weekend in Manhattan for her birthday. I chose The Draper because it was centrally located in Midtown and gave us easy access to many things (subway lines, Times Square, Macy's), and because it was a Hilton property (and I am stupid and loyal). I read the reviews -- I knew the room would be small -- but I was not at all prepared for what a disappointment the whole 'hotel' was, from beginning to end.\n\nThe Good\n\nHaving read the reviews, I was prepared for a small room, so I was delightfully surprised by the room's size. There was room to move around, and room for a luggage rack with an open suitcase on it. There was room for a king-sized bed and an aisle on both sides of the bed. I've stayed in smaller hotel rooms in NY. The 'closet' consists of five hangers over a mini-fridge, which is weird (photo included), but again -- space is tight in NYC. Not a dealbreaker.\n\nUnfortunately, that's the only 'good' thing about our stay.\n\nThe Bad\n\nNO CITY VIEW. I paid for an upgraded 'city view' room. You'll see our view in the attached photos. Apparently, looking directly into the windows of the building next to you counts as 'city view'. Very disappointing.\n\nTHE ROOM WAS SHABBY. I tried to capture it in the photos, but the room featured ceiling damage and unevenly half-painted walls. It's hard to see in the photos, but gloss paint had been rollered on the lower half of the walls with no consistency. It felt like we were staying in a room that they'd been working on fixing and then abandoned the fix-in-progress to let us check in.\n\nNO WORKING TV. The television turns on, but none of the channels are the channels listed in the guide and a full 2\/3 of them don't actually display anything at all. I went through every channel trying to find the local news, and I do not believe that they have any local or network programming (no NBC, CBS, FOX, ABC). I asked about this at the front desk and they acknowledged that, yes, the guide is inaccurate. No further action. I didn't come to NY to watch TV, but I sure would have appreciated being able to get a weather report, at least, to start my days. No luck.\n\nUNTRAINED STAFF. There are only two elevators at The Draper, and they are shared by the 'we only come if you ask for us' cleaning service. That's fine. It's a boutique. In and of itself, that doesn't surprise me. But on two separate occasions during my 4-day stay, while in the elevator, the doors opened, an employee stepped in and held the door open with his foot, waited for some time for someone else to appear, and then stepped into the elevator, pressed another floor. All without even acknowledging that there were guests in the elevator. Not even so much as a 'sorry', just -- nothing. One of the two times this occurred the gentleman holding the elevator was on the phone the whole time, and somehow used his fob to clear out the lights on the elevator and take him directly to the floor he needed, then we had to re-scan our room key to get to our room. I don't mind sharing an elevator. I get it. But at least train your staff they they are sharing it with guests. Oof!\n\nNO BAR. I called the Draper when I made the reservation some months ago to make sure there was a bar and restaurant at the hotel (so we could get late night and\/or early morning food and drinks). He told me it was beautiful, brand new, and scheduled to open a month before we arrived. Only it was still under construction when we got there. There was a coffee station with some convenience foods (packaged sandwiches, orange juice, etc.), but it was only open from 8:30-1:00p daily, and there was otherwise NOTHING available except water. And the coffee! A cup of coffee, at the hotel where I'm staying -- just brewed coffee -- was $6. I could get a better cup of coffee and a pastry on the block, at Dunkin', Paris Baguette, Krispy Kreme, or any of the many food carts in the area on weekdays for less. I'm okay with no free coffee (though most Hilton properties I've stayed at have free guest coffee in the morning), but to be the most expensive coffee in New York is unconscionable. \n\nNO LOBBY. There was never I time when I passed through the lobby and there was a place to sit. The lobby is a hallway with a couch on one side, and that couch -- 24 hours a day, it would seem -- was always full. I could sit on my bed in my room or leave, those were my only choices when at The Draper. I guess that's fine -- but that's not for me.\n\nNOBODY CARES. We checked out a day early on our pre-paid reservation. We paid for four nights, but we checked out at the front desk after three nights. Did the front desk inquire as to why? Nope. Did they ask if everything was OK with our stay? Nope. Did they offer to credit us for our last night's stay? Definitely not. They said 'we'll send you a receipt electronically and see you next time!' Yikes.\n\nREALLY. NOBODY CARES. Then they sent us the receipt, also included below. If I have any concerns about my bill or my stay I am instructed not to reply to the e-mail, but instead to call them. At 000-000-0000. For real. \n\nTHIS WAS NOT CHEAP. I didn't pick The Draper because it was cheap. Not even close! There were three hotels ON THE SAME BLOCK I could have stayed at for less. I stayed there because it was MORE EXPENSIVE than the Embassy Suites on the same street. Oof. What a mistake. I've been trying to decide for a while whether my loyalty is better spent at Hilton or Marriott properties. It looks like The Draper has made the decision very easy for me.

Room was tiny but that's expected in NYC.  Room was very clean and beds were very confortable.  Climate control was perfect for a good night sleep.

Elevators, whch tend to be a problem at NYC skyscrper hotels, were very fast, and we didn't have to wait long for one.\n\nThe only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the lack of breakfast options at the lobby cafe.  As a Hilton Diamond Member, I'm entited do a $18 F&B credit per guest.  To get this credit, you have to go to the front desk, and they will provide you with a voucher, which the rep at the front desk hapily took care of for us.  However, the options very very poor.  There were mostly hot drink options.  The food options were extremely limited.  No bagels, even frozen, no muffins, no fruit.  Just a few egg and cheese sandwiches that they microwave for you and some things that we didn't know what they were because they weren't labled.  To keep the Tapestry label by Hilton, the hotel should be required to offer a better breakfast.

A small desk and even a compact refrigerator fit inside.  The closet was an open rack above the fridge. \n\nIn the bathroom all bulk amenities provided to be greener.  Limited countertop space though.\n\nThere was no gym onsite but they did issue passes for a nearby one.  The onsite restaurant was just a small coffee shop with very limited seating.\n\nThe Draper worked out for my short stay.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

When I made the reservation, The Draper was affiliated with Choice hotels and during the time I made the reservation and the time for me to actually stay at the hotel, they became affiliated with Hilton hotels instead. I recieved an email from Choice hotels stating that my reservation may no longer be valid and I fretted about it quite a bit, especially since there was no other way to come in contact with the hotel than giving them a phone call. I did call them twice, the first time was the same day I received the email from Choice hotels, and a second time a few days before my departure, and both times they confirmed my reservation. \n\nThe hotel itself is located between Bryant park subway station and Herald square subway station and within walking distance from Penn station and Times square, so the location is great. 5th Ave is just around the corner from the hotel.\nI had booked a king room with a city view and I could see the Empire State Building from the room. The room was really quiet, I hardly heard any street noise and I either lucked out with quiet neighbors or the walls and roof were thick enough to not let me hear the people beside me and above me.\nThe standard rooms are small compared to regular US hotel rooms, but I really didn't think much of it because I'm used to staying in hotel rooms that size in Sweden and in Europe. For me as a solo traveler, it was sufficient, but it would be somewhat small for two people to share a standard room since there's not much room to move around. My suitcase almost fit entirely under the bed but there's really no place to put your large luggage other than trying to put it under the bed. There are two drawers under the bed but one of them is taken by the in-room safe and the other one is big enough to hold an empty or flat backpack. The rooms also have a small fridge, which was great as I could buy breakfast items at the nearby Whole Foods and eat breakfast in the room before venturing out.\nYou need to ask reception for housekeeping, which was fine by me.

I get it it\u2019s a boutique hotel, but so are most Kimpton\u2019s and they offer much more than this Hilton property. The Draper is more of a fancy dorm\/hostel. \n\nThere\u2019s no bar, no restaurant, no gym, no rooftop, no room service, no nothing. There\u2019s no app check in, so be ready to hang out at the front desk when you arrive. There wasn\u2019t a line when I checked in but somehow it still took the girl 15 minutes to give me my key.\n\nRooms are tiny. There wasn\u2019t a proper closet. No iron or ironing board. I asked for upgrade while checking in and was told there wasn\u2019t any. I got a 5th floor room with a view of a dirty fire escape and another building. Asked for robe and was told that\u2019s for guest staying in suites only. \n\nI wasn\u2019t given bottled water or a voucher for the breakfast cafe. Cafe is open from like 8am-1pm so if you have an early morning you\u2019ll have to go somewhere else to get coffee. It\u2019s funny the other reviews on here are like \u201cit\u2019s so close to restaurants and cafes\u201d. Hello!! It\u2019s Manhattan not New Jersey. Any hotel you stay at will be near eateries, attractions, etc. The hotel is east side so train options are minimal so you need to walk west towards Times Square for more options. \n\nOverall it\u2019s a no for me. No Diamond status perks and for the price I paid there are a million other choices within a 5 block radius. \n\nI usually stay at the Hilton Garden Inn a few blocks away on Park Ave but wanted to try something different. Big mistake! At least I get my hot breakfast and coffee starting at like 6am there, they have gym, laundry room, restaurant attached has rooftop, rooms are decent size and they always put me on a high floor, corner room with city view. \n\nOh and when most Hilton\u2019s are taking a $50 or $100 deposit this place is taking $150. A little steep for a hotel you can\u2019t even order room service from. What also doesn\u2019t make sense is that this hotel hasn\u2019t connected with one of the 20 different gyms in the area to give passes to guest so they can work out during their stay.

I asked to speak with a manager and it took three days to get a call back.

It was overall a lovely stay, and I've listed pros and cons below. Nothing egregious in the cons list, but just some little things that could have made the trip even better!\n\nPROS:\n-Great location\n-Friendly staff\n-Great view from our room of the Empire State Building\n-CitiBike rental just outside \n-Fridge and safe in the room (safe occupies one entire under bed storage drawer)\n\nCONS:\n-As expected, it's a very tiny room and has no closet. We appreciated the storage drawers under the bed (the suitcase space under the bed was not tall enough for my bag though.) However, like most women I need space to put my things in the bathroom. There was AMPLE wall space for more shelves or hooks, but the walls were completely bare save for one hook.\n-There were no outlets or chargers on one side of the bed\n-The website advertises shuttle service, but when I called to ask about it was told they don't offer it at all. It's still on their website as an amenity.\n-The coffee shop in the lobby seemed really lovely, but is only open until 1pm. Like many tourists, we liked going out in the morning and coming back before dinner. It would have been really nice to be able to grab a coffee or beverage\/snack in the afternoon.\n-The guide on the tv only showed the names of the channels, not what was on so it really wasn't helpful at all.\n-One morning, they were fire alarm testing (which we completely understand and are totally glad it gets done!) But the testing had gone on constantly for over an hour by the time we left the room. It was obviously loud, but my only issue with this is that the hotel has a texting system (I got messages the whole trip) and it would have been really nice if they could have let everyone know the system was going to be tested. Even a notice in the elevator or lobby would have been courteous to give us a heads up.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

I scored a deal on one of their most economical rooms, and it was newly renovated and very quiet, facing the back on a lower floor, with not much of a view but windows that opened and a really cool large shade that was easy to operate. \n\nBed was super big and comfortable-- I'm thinking they could go with Queen beds or even Fulls for a room this size bc most of the room is bed, and it's big even for two ppl.  Or maybe their parent company could experiment with Murphy Beds or similar, as per what is trending on social media these days. As someone earlier reviewed, the pillows are indeed softies but I like that, and coupled by the fact that there were like five, I was good.\n\nBathroom was freshly renovated, painted, lots of favorable lighting, perfect. Water pressure strong, water hot. Etc. Plenty of towels. I appreciated the full length mirror near the door, good for 'last looks' and errant food fails and such.\n\nI also liked the extra touches of room decor, good color choices, darker, patterned, with irreverent art work above the bed and little choices like this small green chair at the small desk that was so charming. Having a refrigerator (cold) and room safe (it's in the pull out beneath the bed) rounded out the extras, as well as a softly glowing alarm clock and back lighting on the mirror that doubled as a nightlight. very cool. \n\nThe front desk was professionally staffed and overall the hotel felt like a 'real hotel experience' in that way you're greeted (not always tho) when you enter and exit. I did not avail myself of their services but felt they were in charge and competent throughout. \n\nAlso echoing what someone has said about the elevators -- they are ridiculously fast. Never had a problem getting to and fro on those. Visited the \"Concourse level\" aka the basement for ice, and there was no problem at all going down six or so floors for this effort in my sweats. \n\nSetbacks included a TV that did not operate correctly or maybe was no longer synced to the cable channels etc. It kept saying \"weak antennae signal\" or something. But that's fine with me, I was busy and out of the room most of the day and night, and I also had my lap top. But seeing that the TV is another huge visual element  in the small room, the hotel could either get more bang out of it, or think about reducing the size altogether or going a different route.  \n\nAn element I am sensitive about is Wifi, and I was discouraged to see the hotel uses an open network approach, which is the least protective in regards to data breaches, and phising. A password protected Wifi would be great, especially as I needed to access some financial stuff that I didn't want to share with the global online community. etc.  \n\nAlso, when I first showered, the water pressure was so strong that it caused a little flood on the bathroom floor, I believe because the shower head is too big for the shower? Idk. But I was mindful and kept a towel there and there were no other problems. The handle t to the shower is also a tad modern for my preference, and it took a second for this Luddite to break the code of the hot\/cold levers and such. You'll see what I mean. Also could not source the trap for the sink, to shave, etc. but didn't pose any hazards there.\n\nLast setback for me was minor, but the hotel is located far closer to 5th Ave than 6th Ave, so a walk to the subways is two clicks longer than you'll want, but still reasonably close, closest subway is at Herald Square I believe, so that's a small note but I did feel that distance going back and forth from my meetings and such. Not a big deal. When I Uber'd around at night of course this issue was irrelevant. \n\nI'll def be back, booking a larger room on a higher floor. I like these little pocket hotels that bring sudden wonders. Have a look at The Draper.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

When I visit NYC, I typically expect (for my price range) that I will have a small, older room that meets my needs - not much more. This year we took the family, and we got two rooms at The Draper, both with incredible city views - the Empire State Building loomed just outside. The king single was modern and well appointed. Our suite was surprisingly large and modern, as well. The staff was incredibly courteous, there were periodic check-ins via text, and everyone was ready to help. The hotel is located right off 5th, so you miss the Times Square noise, but you lose a little of the convenience of the subway stop at seemingly every corner in the heart of Times Square. The stops here are a few blocks\u2019 walk, but it\u2019s easily doable, and you end up around Grand Central\/Bryant Park, so it\u2019s not bad at all.

They booked us a taxi when we asked and called the company multiple times to check where it was. They went the extra mild where they could and that is more than what you can hope for. The hotel was clean and the room was cosy. Our view wasn't too bad but considering we're in the middle of manhattan it'd be silly to expect an ocean view or anything like that.

Menci\u00f3n especial a Mohamed por su amabilidad, pero mis felicitaciones al resto de recepcionistas, que nos hicieron el enorme favor de quedarse con paquete que deb\u00eda recoger UPS para una devoluci\u00f3n de Amazon, que dicho sea de paso (y para evitar que pas\u00e9is por los mismos problemas que hemos tenido nosotros), hab\u00eda que estar esperando al transportista hasta que  tuviera a bien pasar a recoger el paquete, y estando de vacaciones esto es una faena, cosa que como digo, tuvieron la enorme amabilidad en la recepci\u00f3n de custodiar y entregar el dichoso paquete, as\u00ed que ni se os ocurra comprar nada en Amazon USA, y menos de valor, porque funciona fatal y s\u00f3lo te complica la vida con las devoluciones.\nEn cuanto a la limpieza de las habitaciones, tienes que pedir que te la limpien antes de las once de la ma\u00f1ana. Aqu\u00ed es donde el hotel recibe numerosas cr\u00edticas, pero para nosotros es una ventaja, ya que por nuestras costumbres preferimos que nos dejen a nuestro aire y no tener que estar con prisas, dejando la habitaci\u00f3n para que la limpien cada d\u00eda, entre otras cosas porque no es necesario limpiar todos los d\u00edas, as\u00ed que cuando te viene bien, lo pides y punto, menos molestias para todos, y la verdad es que limpian y dejan todo bastante bien.\nEl hotel no ofrece desayuno incluido en el precio, cosa que en principio puede parecer otra desventaja, y cosa que volvemos a preferir, para evitar prisas y molestias por el hecho de que hay horarios y mesas repletas de gente, y no tienes d\u00f3nde sentarte, mucho m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo en la habitaci\u00f3n.\nAhora bien, he de decir que por 158\u20ac la noche  que consegu\u00ed en el mes de febrero, el hotel es inmejorable, pero por los 400\u20ac que lo he llegado a ver, o los doscientos y pico, o trescientos, la verdad es que buscar\u00eda otras opciones, porque no creo que lo valga, la habitaci\u00f3n es peque\u00f1a, si bien en recepci\u00f3n nos cambiaron la habitaci\u00f3n el primer d\u00eda a una con algo de pasillo donde poder abrir las maletas, ya que en la primera que nos dieron, literalmente no pod\u00edamos pasar al ba\u00f1o con las maletas abiertas, y a pesar de que las habitaciones en Manhattan son peque\u00f1as, esto ya es para pensarse pagar m\u00e1s de 180\u20ac la noche, y mucho menos estando doce noches en Nueva York, aunque como digo, en recepci\u00f3n nos hicieron ese favor que ni siquiera pedimos, sali\u00f3 de ellos, as\u00ed que hay que decirlo.\nLa verdad es que hemos estado muy a gusto, pero hay un enorme inconveniente, y que no atribuimos al hotel, ya que cada vez que nos quejamos, hicieron todo lo que estuvo en su mano para poner remedio al problema, y no es otro que el incivismo y la mala educaci\u00f3n de la gente. En Nueva York se ha legalizado el consumo de marihuana, cosa que no me corresponde juzgar, si est\u00e1 bien o est\u00e1 mal, la cuesti\u00f3n es que es legal, y la ciudad huele a marihuana literalmente, pero es que los hu\u00e9spedes del hotel, a\u00fan habiendo depositado 150 d\u00f3lares en concepto de prohibici\u00f3n expresa de fumar en las habitaciones, se lo saltan a la torera y les importa un comino si eso molesta o no al resto de hu\u00e9spedes, a\u00fan a riesgo de perder 150 d\u00f3lares, es mucho m\u00e1s importante drogarse y molestar al resto, y si no queremos drogarnos, nos aguantamos y nos drogarnos todos, y el humo se filtra por el conducto de ventilaci\u00f3n del hotel, que a pesar de que se puede cerrar, la intensidad del humo es tal que hasta que al indocumentado de turno no se le termina el porro, tienes que estar oliendo a marihuana en tu habitaci\u00f3n, y esto no puede ser, y es raz\u00f3n suficiente para m\u00ed para no volver m\u00e1s si no le ponen remedio.\nOtro detalle que no me gust\u00f3 nada de nada es el hecho de que cobran un d\u00f3lar por maleta cuando dejas la habitaci\u00f3n el \u00faltimo d\u00eda, y que evidentemente no vas a estar cargando por la ciudad, y menos si tu avi\u00f3n (como fue nuestro caso) sale a \u00faltima hora de la tarde. Me pareci\u00f3 un detalle feo que hizo que cambiara mi opini\u00f3n final del hotel, y que en realidad no s\u00e9 si les compensa que por un detalle como \u00e9ste, la valoraci\u00f3n que se haga por parte de un cliente, sea inferior a la que ten\u00eda pensado poner antes de que le digan que tiene que pagar nada menos que cinco d\u00f3lares por cinco maletas, y tengo que decirlo, lo siento, es que me parece un detalle muy, pero que muy feo.\n\u00bfVolveremos al Draper? Por menos de 180 d\u00f3lares la noche, y teniendo en cuenta que el hotel carece de gimnasio, cosa que siempre agradezco, quiz\u00e1s, pero lo del olor a marihuana me echa para atr\u00e1s.\nNo obstante, y si el hotel me lo acepta como consejo, yo no seguir\u00eda subiendo los precios como lo est\u00e1n haciendo (y esto va por todos los hoteles del distrito de Manhattan), porque si en trece d\u00edas que he estado all\u00ed he visto s\u00f3lo a dos parejas de espa\u00f1oles, cuando otros a\u00f1os me cruzaba con m\u00e1s de cincuenta, creo que os est\u00e1is haciendo un flaco favor y v\u00e1is a acabar con el turismo en Nueva York, ya que encima me rompieron la maleta en el JFK para inspeccionar en interior, teniendo la opci\u00f3n de abrirla con la llave TSA que deben tener, pero que se ve que les costaba mucho esfuerzo utilizar y era mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil cortar la cremallera con unas tenazas, y eso tambi\u00e9n tengo que decirlo, ya que el trato que he recibido por parte del NYPD en la frontera del JFK (y no fui el \u00fanico, ya que hubo otras cinco maletas en la misma situaci\u00f3n), fue sencillamente deplorable y fuera de lugar, por supuesto, he hecho una reclamaci\u00f3n, pero que todo el mundo sepa c\u00f3mo te tratan en el JFK, sin educaci\u00f3n y sin respeto, cosa que espero hagan por igual a los turistas estadounidenses que vengan a Espa\u00f1a.\n","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I booked this hotel for its central location, good reviews and reasonable (by New York standards) price. The hotel is located mid town on West 37th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues so it\u2019s good for a first visit to NYC as a lot of attractions are within walking distance and ideal if you want to go shopping on 5th Avenue. It\u2019s a very busy area and if you are looking for a hotel in a relaxing area maybe look elsewhere. There are lots of places to eat and drink nearby but obviously nowhere cheap. You can stroll up to Times Square, Central Park (beautiful in the autumn), Met museum, Empire State etc. Grand Central and Penn stations close by.  34th Street Herald Square subway station is 5 minutes away and very useful as lines B D F M N Q R and W go through here. An unlimited 7 day metro card was just $34, great value, felt very safe too although we didn\u2019t ride late at night. We had a room on the 12th floor with two double beds. It was clean and modern, the bed was comfy (bit soft for my liking but that\u2019s just my personal preference), the shower was very good and  I liked the fact that the window in the room was able to be opened (so many hotels now have sealed windows). Our room overlooked the street however the street noise wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it might be. However, the room was very small and lacked virtually any storage. No drawers no wardrobe. Just a strange sort of rail about 18\u201d long positioned directly above the coffee machine which is a really strange and impractical design choice. There was no net curtain on the window, so you had a choice of either pulling down the blackout roller blind or the people in the offices opposite being able to see straight in. On the plus side, there is a proper fridge. Note that the safe is in a drawer under the bed, we didn\u2019t find it until we enquired at reception as to its whereabouts. This hotel has over 20 floors. There are just two lifts and no service lift and they are quite temperamental. They also bong loudly and the noise from them is audible in the rooms and can be quite annoying, especially at 5am. Also note that housekeeping is on request, which I actually quite like because it saves me having to nag the daughter to tidy her stuff up; for some reason housekeeping chose to clean the room and change the beds the day before we left, not sure why. I would like to say a big thank you to the staff on the front desk who were always very professional, friendly and helpful.  I would say that with a few design tweaks this could be a very good hotel. Final note, a yellow taxi from JFK will cost about $70 with a tip. The hotel can arrange a car to the airport for $85 plus tax plus tip ($85 is not the total price, despite what they tell you on reception!)","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It is a totally fine place to lay your head down for a night, but it really feels like a 2 star hotel that is trying to be nicer than it is.

The second also had issues, so it took 15 minutes to initially get up to the room and I got trapped on the 15th floor for awhile trying to get down.  I assume that is a temporary problem, but there are other permanent issues: no privacy shade (just the blackout curtain or nothing), no iron in room, no closet (just a hangar over the coffee), most of the tv stations did not work, the elevator dinged loudly all night (not just when it came to the floor, but it reverberated throughout the hallway and room each time it stopped on any floor), no bottled water in room, etc.  Also, even by NY standards, this is a very small room.

And in the $400+\/night category easily the worst. Other than the location which is very convenient and the water pressure in the shower which is great, everything else is shockingly bad. \n\nThere are so many things wrong I barely know where to start but I'll go with 1 of the 2 elevators in the 23 fl building being out of service for 3 full days causing 15 minute waits to go up to the room or down to the lobby. Not to mention that there's no service elevator so the cleaning staff uses the guest elevators causing even longer waits.\n\nNo closets or drawers, only a bar located above a coffee machine so that pants or dresses hung on it drape into the machine. And hooks randomly strewn throughout the room so that when you hang your clothes on them it looks like a college dorm.\n\nNo soap in the shower -- some random combo of shampoo\/body wash -- and if you buy a bar of soap or have other shower toiletries (razor, etc) there's no place to put them other than on the shower floor -- no basket or shelf.\n\nRooms and common areas that look dilapidated because the hotel isn't maintained.\n\nHousekeeping only upon request but they don't tell you that when you check in (after traveling all day you're supposed to note the small sign at the front desk). And the request must be made the night before or by 11am day of. So on your first day by the time you realize no one has made up the room it's too late to get service -- we were so vocal about how annoyed we were by this that they did send someone.\n\nNo food or drink available other than what's stocked at a tiny pastry counter. And not a single glass in the whole place -- only plastic cups. \n\nA staff that is woefully untrained in hotel management, customer relations, hospitality and the basic functioning of a hotel, in particular the manager who is full of excuses for the abysmal guest experience. My 83 yr old mother was staying a floor below my husband and me and we were not able to reach her bc her cell phone wasn't working, the room phone wouldn't dial room to room and the front desk had no idea how to put a call through. \n\nIt's unfortunate bc it wouldn't take much for The Draper to be an ok place -- some upkeep, a decently trained staff, a service elevator, some food.

I'll give my pros and cons to help decide:\n\nPro:\nVery good location - as others state close to the sights we wanted to see, but far enough from Times Square to make it not so crazy.\nStaff at the front desk - the only staff we met - were professional if not overly friendly.  Check in was efficient but it would have helped to have 2 persons at the desk, which we never saw.\nBeds were very comfortable and the shower worked well.\nHVAC worked well and provided a soft constant fan noise which I like for sleeping, especially in cities.\n\nCon:\nRoom was tiny.  For the price I guess I expected something bigger.  Think it was a King bed and it filled the room.\nThe bed had side sconces instead of table lamps - that's fine - but we could not find any way to switch them off individually next to the bed - someone had ta get out of bed and flip a switch besides the door, which shut off both.\nThe only other light, on the desk, would turn on and then start flickering 30 seconds later.\nThe 'closet' consisted of a bunch of metal tubes balanced on top of the refrigerator and not secured to the wall - anything you put on the hangers caused the whole contraption to lean.\nThere were no shelves in the shower and only the sink top in the main bathroom - very little space to put things out.\nThere was no sink stopper so if you shaved you pretty much just left the water running.\nThere was no bathroom fan so post-shower you needed to open the door to relieve the steam.\n\nNone of the 'cons' were deal-breakers but as I believe this is a new establishment it makes me wonder at all the poor design decisions - especially the annoying sconces.

With all the positive reviews of the Draper, I thought I would try it. I was aware of and accept the tiny room\u2014this is NYC. But no luggage rack, no iron, fake creamer, and you have to get up to turn off the bedside lights\u2014there are no bedside switches\u2026really. Also USB port in the clock by bedside didn\u2019t work though the sockets did. I had to unplug the lights around the mirrors to get the room dark\u2014there was no switch visible to do that either.  Also the desk lamp kept flickering on and off\u2014checked the bulb, the switch, etc.  nothing made it work as another option for a light I could control in bed, so to have light before bed, I still had to use the bedside lights and go to the door to turn them off. There is no easy place to plug anything at the desk in case you are using your computer unless you switch the plugs around\u2014there is only one socket available at the desk. Resolution for any call to the front desk was that they had to send someone to my room.  I checked in before 11 pm\u2014I was not going to have some stranger come to my room at midnight (when I discovered the problems) with me in my nightgown.  The few positives\u2014I do like that the room has laminate floor instead of carpet. It is also very clean and neat. Bed a bit on the soft side. Check-in people nice. However, for the price I paid for 2 nights, I would rather stay at the Kixby or Kitano which are similarly well located. Those hotels are also much roomier and better appointed. I travel quite a bit for work\u2014if other NYC hotels can provide the things I mentioned above, why can\u2019t the Draper? While this hotel might deserve its great reviews for a leisure trip, for business, I am not a fan and will not stay here again.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The king bed was extremely comfortable and the A\/C worked great! Two things that were very important to us. The other reviews are correct, there is not a closet in the room.

There are also hooks and knobs strategically placed to hang items.  By NYC standards, there was also plenty of room for the two of us. The location was perfect. Far enough from the hustle and bustle of Times Square but close enough to enjoy it. Bryant Park, MSG, Penn Station and the Empire State Bldg are just a short walk away. There's a great German Beer hall across the street and a wonderful steakhouse a few blds down. Highly recommend both!

I booked a king bed with city view. Was on the 18th floor and had a pretty nice view. Room was nice and average size for NYC.

States there is a bar\/lounge- not true. They have the setup for one but when checking in the lady told us that it wasn\u2019t ready yet. Why list it, if it\u2019s not available. Also, listed is a clothing steamer- not available either. When I fly and pack to save the most money on bag fees then often my clothes get wrinkled. I liked that they said they offered a clothes steamer but when I asked they said oh we can bring you an iron. To me an iron and a steamer and two totally different items. \n\nAnother warning is that there is only housekeeping upon request. I asked for towels and washcloths to replace my used ones and they brought two towels and 6 hand towels and not a single washcloth. \n\nOverall a nice hotel in a good location.

We were not disappointed on that front. A quick 10 minute walk got us to the concert and it was a quick, safe walk back when the show ended after 11pm. We reserved a standard room with a King bed.\n\nCheck-in was quick and easy even if the person who checked us in was a little condescending when I misunderstood his initial instructions. It's NYC. I'm a New Yorker so I let it pass but if this is his manner with visitors who already think NYers are rude, then his attitude can only support that belief. The remaining front-desk personnel were mostly friendly and welcoming.\n\nThe room was small as expected but clean with no carpet. The housekeeping staff we encountered was very pleasant. The bed was comfortable and the AC was quiet and worked well and evenly. The walls are a bit thin so we were awakened at 3am by a person laughing and speaking loudly one of the days but otherwise the floor was quiet within minimum noise. We like hotels that require the use of the key card to access the floors for that extra level of security which this one has. \n\nThere is no closet but the side tables have drawers and there is a drawer at the foot of the bed frame for clothes. Ample hangers to hang clothes above the cupboard containing the small fridge. The only true complaint I have about this room is the bottles of soap\/shampoo, lotion and conditioner in the bathroom are refilled instead of individual, tiny bottles (this part I appreciate since it is more environmentally friendly) but they are not tamper-proof so unless they are completely switched out between guests (which I assume not) then it gave me pause to use them. \n\nPros: Proximity to MSG, Grand Central Station.

Ideally located in the heart of Manhattan, easy walking distance to Times Square, numerous Subway stations, loads of restaurants, and plenty of shopping in close proximity. \n\nDespite being in such a good location - pleasantly surprised that there was no noise at night. \n\nThe reception staff were really helpful and attentive. Check-in very quick. We had a late evening flight on the night of check-out, and they were happy to hold on to our luggage for the day until we left for the airport. \n\nBoth JFK and LGA airports were easily accessible from the hotel. We opted for air train, mainline and Subway rather than sitting in a cab in the traffic.\n\nI would best describe the hotel as boutique - it's clearly recently undergone a refurbishment. Nice decor, clean and fresh rooms with en suite. \n\nThe layout on each floor appears to be the lift shaft surrounded by 6 rooms. You can hear the ping of the lift arriving on your floor, and the bedroom doors are heavy, with a substantial locking system on them, so it's not really possible to close them quietly. The whole hotel is not particularly spacious, but perfectly acceptable for a long weekend stay, and in comparison with other hotels in the same road and vicinity - I think very reasonably priced. \n\nI would definitely recommend, and if ever the opportunity arose to return to NYC, I wouldn't hesitate in booking The Draper again!","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Also, all the included soaps (hand, shampoo, etc) are very scented which wasn't a problem but I know people who it'd bother a lot. \n\nFront desk staff were super friendly and helpful, and location is nearby lots of great food\/sights.

Opted for 23rd floor suite for a girls' trip to give us ample space. The room itself was fantastic with a great view. Beds were comfy, all was clean, and most of all we had plenty of room -- hard to come by in NYC. Not having daily cleaning service was not an issue for us, but I can see where others would find this as a missing element. The staff in the lobby were extremely pleasant, helpful, and accommodating. The only major downside was not having the cafe available in the lobby. The ability to grab coffee or a pastry or something for breakfast without having to venture out is something I would definitely prefer for a future trip. We ended up door dashing a few times to make up for this, which served its purpose... but when the photos of the hotel clearly feature a cafe (which looks amazing!) it should be up and running. The \"not available due to covid\" doesn't fly as a valid excuse for me anymore. Overall, we had a great stay. If the cafe were open I would stay here again WITHOUT HESITATION but provide this feedback because I think it's important to allow businesses the opportunity to hear honest feedback in a competitive environment, and this is the only thing that falls short of 5 stars.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

They are a decent size to be comfortable. The beads were super comfy and provided great rest  after walking the city all day. The rooms has a small fridge which is convenient. Nicely located near many attractions and walkable sights. \nMy feedback would be about accessibility within the rooms. Sitting space when not in bed is limited. There isn\u2019t dresser or counter space to set items on. No suitcase stands. I hate putting my items on the floor. There is no type of closet. They do have 4 hooks on the walls but they don\u2019t provide sufficient space for any type of storage. It made for a tight fit in our room with all of our suitcases, small stroller and anything we bought while visiting. No closet meant no iron or ironing board. Called down for one and was only given the iron. The bathroom is the biggest let down. It\u2019s tiny tiny with NO space to set any personal items. The sink doesn\u2019t have a ledge or anywhere to place items. The tub has NO where to place items. While you shower you have to put a towel down and put your soap dish on it after you\u2019re  done. They could\u2019ve added shelves or shower caddy for items. It makes for an uncomfortable shower experience. There aren\u2019t even hooks in the shower for wash cloths.

My first time at The Draper. Tiny rooms, even by NYC standards. Not thoughtfully outfitted. For example, not a single hook, rod or shelf in the bathroom. Fridge in the tiny room was really noisy, I had to turn it off. Shades had to remain down on full length window since view was directly into another occupied building just feet away.\n\nSeemed clean. Bed is okay. And shower fine. Location is good. Being close to 5th means you've got to walk a few blocks for any quick services, snacks, bodegas. \n\nIt's a small hotel, so you can hear the hallway and elevator from even the furthest room. Not well insulated. It was busy, and very noisy. Some hours the elevator would ding and open multiple times a minute (not normal).

No food in the hotel (pastries and coffee etc are due to be available from September) but the 3 or 4 minute walk early in the morning to the Paris Baguette shop (turn left out of the Draper) set us up nicely to enjoy their delicious pastries & coffee.

Reviews of hotels in NYC are scary.  The Draper was not so.  Easy check-in with courteous staff.  Nice, clean lobby.  The room was great.  2 double beds were comfortable, clean sheets.  The A\/C was really quiet and worked well.  Plenty of room for 2 people and our 5 large bags.  The under bed drawers and storage are a great feature.  I was surprised at how quiet the room was with little to no noise from the street below.  View was what it is, another building across the street, but we enjoyed watching the activity on the street below and taking in the sounds of NY with the window open.  There was also a really nice lounge area on the first floor and even a little outdoor space for sitting in the courtyard.\nBathroom was very clean with a great shower and soft towels.\nThe front staff arranged our cab to the airport for us on checkout day.  Nice touch.\nOnly downside is that the cafe and bar are still closed.  I understand, but the website seems to feature this part of the hotel and it was a bit misleading.\nThis place is in the Garment district and was pretty central to everything.  You will be walking at least 10 minutes to the metro, but that wasn\u2019t a big deal.

The whole hotel - hallways, elevators, etc - was very well-maintained and clean and pleasant. You really can't ask for better, given the very reasonable price plus the Manhattan location.\n\nThe hotel staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating as well - five-star service. Shoutout to Max at the front desk, who checked us in and provided excellent, friendly service - we booked a room online directly through the hotel's website  and came early just to drop off our luggage, about three hours before check-in time, and he offered us an early check-in without us even having to ask, and waived the early check-in fee. Fast and easy check-out as well. I also appreciated that on the morning of our check-in, we received a text from hotel staff that allowed us to ask questions\/clarify any details via text as well. \n\nThe hotel's location is also perfect for visiting Manhattan, with a lot of standard NYC tourist attractions and great restaurants within easy walking distance, and metro stations nearby - Bryant Park is very nearby, and Times Square, Broadway theatres, the Empire State Building, etc. are all walkable as well. Despite being conveniently close to all the fun stuff, it was quiet at night for sleeping, and I also didn't feel unsafe walking alone (as a young woman) back to the hotel later at night either. \n\nBasically: everything was great!

There's not much room to hang or store clothes, the desktop is the size of a cafeteria tray, and if two of you are staying together, there'll be a lot of choreography involved when moving through the tight spaces.

I had booked a deluxe king with a city view ,which is what the first room was and then we were downgraded.\n\nThere was hairs on the bed linen and after asking for it to be changed there was still more hairs , asked for new linen to be sent up , checked them and more hairs, after shacking the linen and making the bed our selfs it was OK. Definitely need a new linen company.\n\nHygiene standards was not good at all,housekeeping vacuuming the room would actually be a big plus as the floor was not clean at all. I would say they spend max 20 minutes cleaning the room.\n\nWhat I've taken away from staying here that if you are booking and the housekeeping problems are solved is that don't pay for a city view as one side you have the city and the other side you have a view of them Empire state building. This is a LOUD hotel the elevator doesn't stop dingING and you can hear people in their rooms and alot of creaking from your own room.\n\nStaff aren't too involved at all didn't seem bothered by the bedding complaints.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We enjoyed the Draper very much. We arrived on an early flight and our room was available so we were able to unpack and get on with our day. As with all NYC hotels the room was small but adequate.  There was no closet but there was a small rod with hangers over the mini fridge and hooks for coats, scarves and purses to hang on. \nThere was a full size desk with a mirror which we used as a vanity to dry our hair and do make up. We really appreciated the 4 outlets on the desk so I could have my phone laptop and watch all charging on one side of the bed  while she had more plugs on her side for her electronics. The bed was very comfortable and a true King not a smaller \u201cNew York king\u201d many hotels try to pass off. The bathroom was spotless and seemed to be newly re-tiled. They did not have daily maid service which I prefer during this Covid era. I don\u2019t want anyone in the room breathing on my things and I was able to get fresh towels everyday. The front desk staff were so helpful directing us to different restaurants and helping with transportation. I loved the location near Times Square and  Bryant Park which I fell in love with on this trip. We had a late flight and they held our luggage for us until our flight. \nI would recommend the Draper to anyone who loves boutique hotels this is the finest one we have stayed in.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It's close to Bryant Park and a reasonable walk up to the Rockefeller Center \/ Broadway area.  \n\nOur city-view king room was large for a standard room in NYC.  Our view looked out over 37th street and noise was never an issue.  That's where the positives end. \n\nThe heating \/ air conditioning unit was inoperable.  The unit could NOT be shut off.  It continuously blew old cold air for entire 3-night stay.  Neither the front desk or maintenance were able to fix the situation.  In fact, right after I checked in, an unmasked worker got into the elevator with me holding a small ladder and complained to me about how this hotel doesn't care about air conditioning.  No follow the next day from management or an apology were ever received.\n\nHairs not belonging to me or my wife were on the bed.  There were also lipstick stains on one of the pillows.   I tried calling down the front desk but couldn't get an answer.  On my way out to a show later, I told the front desk about the issue but it was never handled.  Upon returning to the hotel we were too tired to inquire again so we did our best to clean off the bed with our bare hands.  We also didn't feel like packing \/ unpacking again.\n\nIn the shower, their own soaps are provided in dispensers.  That's fine - a lot of hotels are doing this now.  The problem is there wasn't a little shelf for personal items.\n\n  \n\n","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Wanting to take a quick nap to reenergize before some work meetings this afternoon, we pulled back the (neatly made) sheets to find...a french fry. A FRENCH FRY. IN THE SHEETS. The sheets also had several yellowish stains.\n\nThere are two possibilities:\n1. Their laundry service is horrifyingly subpar. How yellow stains and french fries can make it through a full wash and dry cycle is beyond me.\n2. Their housekeeping is horrifyingly subpar. Did they just re-make the bed with the sheets that had been on it, without changing out the sheets?\n\nWe called the front desk to notify them, and they said they would switch us to another room, which they did. (Their quick response is the reason this review is two stars instead of one star.) However, by the time this all got sorted out, our window for napping was gone, and we had to run to our meetings. So, I haven't checked the sheets on the new bed yet...but here's hoping we don't have to move again.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I am blonde and haven't used it.. obviously not mine. Go to the front desk to ask for cleaner room and get another room #2. Go with the attendant to make sure its clean before I accept and black hairs all over the bathroom. Ew. Go back down and ask to see another room. Room #3 with attendant. Check room, black hairs all over the shower again. Nice. Go back down and he insist this room is clean. Ok. Room #4 with attendant go and see nice long black hairs all over the bathroom floor. Wtf. Four rooms and not ONE with a clean shower. I am not even asking for much...just to not have other peoples filth in the room I am sleeping.\nSO I ask for a refund and to leave. He says they can't refund me and that this is just how the housekeepers clean here. I.e. they don't?
