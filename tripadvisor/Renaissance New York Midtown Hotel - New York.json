It seems unnecessary to have music blaring at 6.30am.\n\nDue to the above, I can't really give this hotel more than 2 stars for the price.

I didn't pay the premium for a room with a view so I expected to look out directly into another building (the norm in NYC), but actually ended up with a corner (two windows) and a nice view!  I was really surprised!\n\nThe bathroom door is a sliding glass door which was a great idea to save space in the room, but was poorly thought out for privacy. Just be aware that if you use the bathroom, shower, etc. Anyone else in the room will be able to see you. Hopefully the hotel will replace these doors with something more practical.  They definitely look like something an interior designer would pick (they look nice) but must be a nightmare for the cleaners and maintenance.\n\nAfter the concert, traffic was a nightmare so I was very happy to be walking back to a hotel. This also meant that there were a lot of sirens and horn honks. The room TV is also set up with several white noise elements - rainfall, beach, etc. - to help drown it out. \n\nMy room was 2503 near the elevator but I never heard it or another person. The room was very quiet, except for the traffic noise which is expected.\n\nThe bell station\/baggage check on the first floor is very friendly and check in was easy. We checked our bags before check in to do some touristy stuff.\n\nWe had some extra time before the concert and took the F Train from Herald Square to Delancey to eat at Russ and Daughters and visit the Tenement Museum - a great way to learn about the City's immigrant history. Liberty Bagel is practically nextdoor for breakfast - don't be intimidated by the long line - it moves quickly because they have an efficient system.\n\nI don't recommend eating at Versa.

It was so easy to get  around to many desired locations. We could walk to Times Square, Broadway, the Empire State Bldg, many restaurants as well as concerts at Madison Square Garden.  The hotel itself is pretty nice and well kept.  The restaurant provided what we needed, pretty good food and several TVs so that we could catch our favorite games.

I am an avid traveler for business and pleasure (Bonvoy Ambassador Elite) therefore my perspective is far reaching.  I can say without a doubt that my time at the Renaissance NY Midtown was MADE due to the outstanding service and attitudes of the staff.  Javonne Washington and Duke Perkins on the Events and Navigator teams made me feel like my family mattered!  Javonne was quick to answer questions over the weekend prior to my arrival (during his personal time) and Duke\u2019s personality, knowledge of the property and neighborhood truly made my family feel like we were at Home.

Ordered room service for the first time in a long time with great anticipation. I assumed a four star, $300\/night hotel would wheel up a nice spread with a bit of a presentation as I fondly recalled from past experiences. Called down my order of two poached eggs, some toast, potatoes, a fruit plate, side of bacon, couple of sausage and orange juice. I was literally fantasizing about the meal that would soon be rolled in and presented with covered plates, pot of hot water and tea bags, a carafe of OJ and all the condiments I might need. I put on the terry cloth robe that was hanging in the closet and got ready to watch TV while I ate. Shortly there was a knock at the door and when I answered it I was greeted by an employee who handed me a paper bag. I might as well have ordered Uber Eats or Door Dash. I ate room service out of a paper bag with food in boxes and a plastic fork at the computer desk. No plates, no silverware, no salt and pepper, no napkins. When I visited the Ritz in Berlin recently every room received breakfast for free. There was literally 14 different cold cuts, prosciutto sliced up. A chef cooking waffles, pancakes, eggs. Ever scoop out honey from a live honeycomb in a frame? I did that day! Yogurts, any type of topping you wanted to sprinkle on top. Any kind of fruit drink; apple, orange, blueberry juice, there was a multi-vitamin drink. Free bloody marys. But there I was eating poached eggs out of a box! Then I would have to open another box and get my toast and another box for bacon. There's all these greasy boxes in front of me. How is that service? It was the worst room service I'd ever gotten. I'd rather not have room service. I could have gone downstairs and grabbed this at any place on 35th street and brought it up to my room for ten times less than that cost me.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

We went to NYC for a long weekend for a concert at MSG. We picked this hotel partly because of its location to MSG & partly due to cost & partly due to being a Marriott Bonvoy Member. I booked a Lowe floor king bed room & I did use Marriott upgrade nights to get a high floor city view room. We ended up on the 34th floor looking out over MSG & Lower Manhattan & could see the Statue of Liberty from our room - amazing view, well worth using upgrade points (not sure I\u2019d pay the difference for the room if I was just going to sleep there & be out of the room all day, but maybe). The entry area was nice & the lobby good. Also had a nice Club Level Room with drinks & appetizers (didn\u2019t use it as much as we maybe should have). The room with a king bed was a good size for 2 people. I can\u2019t say it was a large room, but we never felt like we were confined by the space. Very large window wall with a small lounging sofa in front of it to take advantage of the view. Nice sized bathroom with a pretty big walk-in shower. This was by far the nicest Marriott brand hotel in Manhattan that we\u2019ve stayed in. 2 blocks from MSG, but also easy walking distance (for 2 relatively healthy 50 year olds) to Times Square & Rockefeller Plaza.

A curious layout with reception on 6th floor with a bar really didn\u2019t work to me.  Reception desk staff seemed disengaged generally.  Our double Queen set up and bathroom were okay but furniture was tired with knocks to woodwork etc unrepaired.  The bathroom looked to be more recently modernized on face of it but clearly poorly maintained.  First night\u2019s sleep broken by persistently leaking and dripping shower.  Following morning we asked for it to be fixed whilst out for day.  However after a second night kept awake with same shower problem it seemed apparent the requested maintenance hadn\u2019t been performed.  On return to room that evening our room had not be cleaned or made up and shower remained unfixed so we had to revert to reception to ask to be moved to a different room - always a pest when u r all unpacked.  The second room made us realize that the shower problem in the first room created a very weak shower experience in comparison!  No further problems with second room.  Breakfast experience was one not to be repeated either and we only had breakfast in hotel restaurant once as a result.  The venue for breakfast was incredibly dark and more like a bar atmosphere.  Whilst the food was ok a side order was missed and we needed to request again which then appeared late after other food finished.  However - the worst was a staff member who in full view of the room placed his hand down his trousers to rearrange his nether regions before immediately putting on his apron and then proceeding to handle clean cutlery into receptacles.  Revolting behaviour.  Hence we ate out for rest of stay for breakfast.  ","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We just moved from very busy Times Square area, so wanted to have a little peace here (I know that Penn 34th is not so much different), which seemed like a case at first. But we paid more for the two nights here than the three nights in the TS, so you can imagine I was expecting better. It seemed like it in the first glance. Lobby was peaceful, staff were polite and efficient. It seemed like a right choice only until 5pm when our nap was disturbed by crazy vibration and club music. I thought at first there was an earthquake as the room was literally vibrating. But shortly after with loud club music, I realised that something terrible was going on nearby. I called the reception where the staff very casually said \u201cOh there is a party on the 5th floor. I will ask them to turn down the music.\u201d Don\u2019t they think they needed to warn us when we checked in today??? Fortunately (?) we went out for a dinner shortly, but to our dismay, the loud music was continued when we came back at 9:30pm. When we called AGAIN, they said the party was over at 10pm. Obviously it wasn\u2019t and I received a call from a manager at 10:30 who said that he had no control over the party at the restaurant that he could only ask them to turn down the volume. \n\nSo, the staff didn\u2019t know what was going on in their hotel, and the manager did not have the authority to end the party that is clearly disturbing the guest. \n\nThis is not a four star hotel that I was expecting and paid for. I would obviously haven\u2019t come here if I knew the hotel had a terrible sound proof system with parties in the weekend.

As you would expect from an expensive, high end hotel in Manhattan.  Rooms were clean and modern and decent size for NYC.  Nice view from our upgraded floor room.  Great location near Penn Station.  But the Marriott\/Renaissance experience is so inconsistent.  The whole purpose of creating a brand is to have a consistent experience across properties (or restaurants, or retail locations, or gas stations) so that customers know what to expect.  I understand that the properties are independently owned.  But if you provide a breakfast benefit to elite members, you need to provide it consistently.  I never know what I\u2019m going to get at a Marriott.  Hyatt doesn\u2019t do that.  As a Globalist, I get breakfast at a Hyatt property.  Full stop.  No question.  Marriott, I don\u2019t know.  Renaissance Platinum benefit is breakfast.  Or maybe not.  Depending on if that property wants to give it to you or not.  Like that is literally the policy.  You get breakfast unless the property doesn\u2019t want to give you breakfast.  This one told me at check in, no breakfast on the weekends.  Instead, they chose to give me 1,000 points.  Worth $6 or $7 in my opinion.  When I got to the room, there was a card offering paid breakfast in the morning.  So it\u2019s available, they just chose not to give it to me.  Question to the manager.  No breakfast.  Question to the Platinum call center.  Ask the manager of the property.  At least with the low-end Marriott properties I know I\u2019ll get a mediocre breakfast.  I\u2019m pretty close to lifetime Platinum.  Not sure why I want it.  Hyatt treats their loyal customers right.  I know where I\u2019m staying next time.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We visited last June for a quick overnight coming back into the country from overseas, and noticed the condition of the rooms has deteriorated a bit - furniture was a little beat up and our shower didn't drain. Not a huge deal.\n\nWe returned in January with family and I took care of booking our rooms - it was \"hotel week\" so I was able to score a rate that offered 10K bonus points per night, which, if you're a Marriott Rewards member is a pretty sweet promo. There was a Renaissance in Chelsea that was about $160 cheaper, but the point bonus made up for the price difference in my opinion.\n\nThings quickly went downhill at check-in - they couldn't find our reservations (though they were showing in the app and I'd been able to check-in online) and the individuals checking us in couldn't have been more unfriendly\/uncaring. It took over 30 minutes just to get keys to our rooms only to find they'd rebooked our reservations incorrectly and we had to get new keys. They also claimed they upgraded us like they'd done us this huge favor, until I pointed out they'd given us City View rooms which is exactly what we had booked to begin with. And then I had to go back for new keys again after we couldn't get into the lounge (which, after pointing out the keys weren't working, I got a snooty \"um, you're gold\" - I'm Platinum btw, so don't expect any status recognition here either). Lounge is also not open on weekends except for a beverage fridge that was almost totally empty every time we went in, and their compensation for no breakfast was 1K points - which I never received.\n\nNaturally I had concerns regarding any of this getting credited to my account, despite multiple assurances from the manager that he would get everything resolved. I requested email copies of my folios multiple times (which should have come automatically) and sure enough those never showed up and I only got standard credit for one of the rooms. I've been going back and forth with Marriott since trying to get this corrected, to no avail.\n\nPoints\/credit situation aside, my main issue was the complete apathy that the hotel's team showed. The ladies checking us in acted annoyed with us even though it was an issue with their system and were just generally incompetent, and the manager, while very nice, did not follow-through on his promises to ensure things got resolved on the back end. We also didn't have any hot water our first day (which to their credit they did get fixed, but that's two stays in a row now we've had issues with the showers).\n\nAs long as you don't have high expectations of the staff and\/or any sort of status recognition or perks like breakfast or a functional lounge, the location is solid and the beds are comfortable. But after my last two stays at what was once our go-to hotel, I have to say this location is trending towards simply mediocre with bad customer service. We'll be trying a new location on our next visit.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Definitely better.\n\nRooms at this hotel are spacious, especially for NYC.  Appointments are quite nice, and the bathroom is large with a big shower.  You have plenty of AC and USB power near the bed, and on the desk as well, making computers useful.  The bed is comfortable although I'd love to see some foam pillows as an option.  For some reason my Marriott profile that states \"foam pillows requested\" is never done when I'm assigned a room.\n\nLocation:  excellent.  I love this location for proximity to my office.  It's also not far from a ton of restaurant options, and about 45 minutes from LGA with minor traffic.\n\nAmenities:  the Bonvoy Platinum and above free breakfast is pretty good.  Fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, plenty of pastries.  My only complaint were the beverage options - only bottled water and sugary sodas in the mornings.  This could be much better.  The main restaurant has good variety and the bar service is efficient.  I had some meatballs and soup - both good choices.\n\nWhere I'm torn on the amenities offering is on the Planet Fitness access.  Planet Fitness is not a very good gym in general, but I assumed it would be better than a standard hotel gym.  This is really not the case, especially with the layout of the Planet Fitness.   The sheer amount of unnecessary cardio machines takes up almost all the floor space, so if you offer dumbbells and kettlebells, you need to offer real estate for people to use them.  This gym consumes all its floor space with the aforementioned cardio machines, some pulley stations (good feature), and about three adjustable benches.  No bench, no rack (except a Smith machine) ... just not a good gym except if you want 57 treadmills and ellipticals to choose from.  Although this shouldn't be a review of Planet Fitness, I can't help criticizing it since the hotel doesn't have its own gym.  Believe it or not, I think I'd rather use a hotel gym that has one pulley station, dumbbells and kettlebells.\n\nOverall, I would return to Renaissance Midtown for all the positive reasons I listed.  I'd like to see them create their own gym space, but as long as their partnership with PF remains intact, I don't see an incentive for them to do so any time soon.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

After spending the week at the Moxy across the street (rooms too small for me) I decided to stay the weekend at the Renaissance. Arrived at 2pm and no problem checking in early. Upgraded to the 29th floor with an amazing view due to my platinum status. Getting a car in\/out of the hotel for luggage is very difficult as the street backs up and cars stay parked in the circle. Lobby is a bit dated. Rooms are small but they are renovated and very functional. I like them, especially if you have a high floor with a view. Part of the value proposition of this hotel is its \u201cdigital\u201d experience. Well that\u2019s very disappointing. The QR code wouldn\u2019t work for me and did not send a text to my phone to kick off the process. The alarm clock was also set at the wrong time. Had a really nice night sleeping and the black out blinds are useful. Waking up the next morning I was ready for breakfast. When I arrived I was informed they don\u2019t serve breakfast on weekend in the lounge and I need to go to the restaurant. Even worse they don\u2019t offer a credit for the restaurant and force you to take points as an elite member. Nothing is mentioned about that on their website. I\u2019ve stayed in many Renaissance hotels and that\u2019s not the customer service I expect. Anyway, I went to the restaurant. The espresso was made the size of filter coffee and the service was slow. It was a beautiful unusually warm November morning and they had closed the outside section of the restaurant for \u201can event\u201d. No one was preparing for an event and they crammed all the guests into the inside section for their convenience I guess? The food quality was ok. Bottom line:  the high floor rooms are good but the service and attitude especially to elite members is very average for a Renaissance hotel. Perhaps given it\u2019s location it\u2019s just focused on the volume tourist $ and not the frequent travelers. Idk if I\u2019ll be back.

Overall our stay at the Renaissance Midtown was excellent. We were looking to book a hotel close to Penn station in order to take LIRR to the US open(Port Washington line, 2 stops, 20 minutes) and close to activities in Manhattan. I was split between Courtyard Marriott Times Square west and the Renaissance but decided to go with the Renaissance based on the excellent reviews. The Renaissance in located in Midtown, just one block from Penn station for easy access to almost any subway or LIRR routes.  The area around the hotel appeared clean and safe. The service at the hotel was superb from check in to check out. We took the valet for our minivan(drove down from Rochester, NY) which although expensive was convenient(95$\/24 hours). Absolutely no waiting at check in. Bell man took our luggage up to the room.  The room itself was smaller than we were used to with Marriott  but considering it was Manhattan, was a decent size. We had the 2 queen bed, higher floor, city view which was nice. Overall for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids(13 and 10) we have enough space. The rooms, beds and bathroom was very clean. The rooms were cleaned every day without requesting it. The bathroom was a decent size with a spacious shower. The interesting thing about the bathroom is that the walls are frosted glass! It Provided enough privacy but solid walls would have been nicer for privacy.. When we needed room service for towels etc, the service was pretty quick. Room service for meals is available for breakfast between 6:30 to 10 AM from one of the insight restaurants My Belly's Playlist. We ordered some omelettes and waffles which were pretty good and served in to go boxes. There is another restaurant Versa on site which he didn't go to but had a decent menu and open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is no complimentary breakfast however. There is  a bar in the lobby with live music on some nights. The elevators were very quick and we never waited more that a couple minutes to get an elevator to the room or to the lobby. I was a bit concerned as to whether this was kid friendly hotel. Overall we had no issues and the kids enjoyed the stay, but I did feel that the hotel was more geared towards adults and teens\/young adults. But we did see a few other families with kids. The rooms were very quiet and despite all the traffic and busy life on the streets, we couldn't hear much more than the occasional siren of ambulances.\n\nFor US opens fans: Great place to stay with convenience to Penn Station and Port Washington line every 30 minutes. After a late night match on Arthur Ashe that finished well after midnight it was very convenient to get back to the hotel via LIRR to Penn station with a one block walk back to the hotel. Even at that late hour it felt very safe.\n\nRegarding the area around the hotel, I would say that its overall decent. There is a really nice bagel place right across the streets and several restaurants steps away from the hotel. Times square is 5-6 block away where we saw Aladdin on Broadway and visited Times Square at night. \n\nWe are vegetarian and were happy to see vegetarian options in both on site restaurants. There is also a great South Indian Restaurant, Sharavana Bhavan, on Lexington and 27 which is just a 15-20 minute easy walk. \n\nOverall excellent place to stay when visiting NYC is you need easy access to Penn Station or Madison Square Garden  and  access to all Manhattan has to offer.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Great views from our corner room on the 24th floor as well. The location is great for getting around all of NYC but it's very central so very busy and you're gonna encounter homelessness, drugs, weed vans\/shops and the like a fair bit, much more so than other parts of town.

We consulted him about any and every thing from broadway tickets to trains to Belmont Park.

This one is by far the worst even though it\u2019s TripAdvisor rating is good.\n\nThe room is really tiny, especially compared to other similar Marriott properties like Renaissance Times Square, Westin Times Square, Westin Grand Central etc. The room also doesn\u2019t have adequate lighting.\n\nThe floor plate is small and the walls are thin, which means the hallway noise is very loud. The air conditioner noise is as loud as loud can be. I actually like white noise, but even then I think it\u2019s unbelievably loud.\n\nService was nonchalant. I had a terrible laundry incident where I called in the morning for laundry pick up, which was confirmed but never was. So at night I asked what happened and I was told \u201cyou need to drop that with the bell service\u201d. First of all, I wasn\u2019t told. Second of all, I have never experienced a hotel at this price point asking guests to deliver own laundry. Then I was promised they will get this done and return the laundry back to me by 3pm before my Platinum late check out. Then of course the laundry never came. By the time it\u2019s 7:15 the laundry is still not here and I had to leave for the airport.\n\nLuckily the gentleman Ed was being super nice and helpful, trying his best to either send it to me or even get that to the airport. He showed empathy and helpfulness not seen in others at the hotel.\n\nThe worst thing about the hotel really is about the service attitude, not to mention everything else. Btw, I was asked \u201chow was your stay\u201d and I replied, \u201cit was just ok\u201d. The reply was \u201cwe look forward to seeing you again at the hotel\u201d.

Overall, it was a mixed bag my visit and I'll describe why.\n\nFirst, the lobby was interesting in that there isn't one when you first walk in off the street as it's just like a clerk desk and you need take the elevator up to the 6th floor to reach the actual lobby to check in or do anything else.\n\nThe elevators are great, they're the smart variety where you punch in on a control panel what floor you want and it tells you which elevator to go to and that car will take you direct to where you need to go with no buttons present inside the actual elevator.\n\nThe service was pretty attentive once at the lobby and in subsequent times I visited the lobby. Even if employees are standing around talking to each other, they quickly broke out and asked how they could help me. They were also nice on the phone when calling for any needs.\n\nBut, there also was times that the call wouldn't get picked up, especially by room service. I called down one evening for a breakfast order and they never picked up and I left my order and asked them to call me back to confirm. They never did and I called before I sent to sleep to confirm and they said good thing I called before they don't check their v-mail (??). I put in my order and she confirmed. The next morning after the time range they gave me for delivery was already passed, I waited a bit in case they were on their way. After they were about 10 mins late, I called to see if they were on the way and they said they had no breakfast order for me (!!!). \n\nI have a customer meeting to go to and I don't have extra time for this kind of nonsense. That's the whole point of calling in the order way in advance and confirming twice. SMH. The good part is they said they would get right on it and they did deliver it pretty quickly from that point.\n\nFood, by the way, was decent. Not bad, not great. Not a huge selection  or variety, but decent quality and choices.\n\nThis is NYC and as expected the room was pretty small. I didn't take a star away for that, but it was pretty tight. They decorated it pretty well, but nothing special.\n\nThe other reason they got 3 stars is because there was no housekeeping done. First, a hotel of this caliber and price set to do housekeeping only on request is silly. Second, I specifically asked for housekeeping the next day when I realized it's request only. Guess what? I come back to the room after a long day and ... no cleaning done (?!?).\n\nI paid, literally, over $2K for 3 nights and what they delivered was far from a good value, even despite the location.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel was near capacity, and everyone (check in staff, housekeeping, etc) seems overwhelmed.   We completed online checkin and requested early check in, something that\u2019s customarily given to Marriott Platinum level guests.  The front desk could not find my online check in and, of course, no early check in.  When finally checking in, they forgot to offer me the choice of 1,000 points or the food credit.   Under the Bonvoy rules, this entitles me to additional compensation.   I did not press the issue \u2014 I just wanted my room.     \n\nWe declined housekeeping but asked for fresh towels and additional tea bags for the room.  Both were an adventure and required several calls and texts within the Marriott app.  Finally got the towels.  Never got the tea.  We gave up.   New York has lots of tea.  Renaissance Midtown \u2014 apparently not.   \n\nOn checkout, I requested a copy of the folio, which was a zero since it was an award stay.  It was correct.   But 5 hours later, when back home in Washington DC, another bill appeared by email.   This time, it was for over $320 and in my wife\u2019s name.   Several calls and texts later they acknowledged it was a \u201cmistake\u201d and would be corrected.   I asked for an email confirmation.    You know what\u2019s next \u2014 no email conformation.  So more texts and finally a zero balance invoice, but still in my wife\u2019s name even though I booked the room in my name, and I\u2019m the platinum member.   So more calls\/texts, and I\u2019m finally back to where I started the day \u2014 a zero balance invoice in my name.  Pretty ridiculous.    \n\nMy credit card still shows this mystery $320 charge.  It\u2019s not an authorization \u2014 it\u2019s a charge.  I assume this will be reversed.    \n\nSo bottom line \u2014 a confusing and frustrating experience in an otherwise nice hotel with good rooms and good public spaces.

We arrived later than expected due to a cancelled flight but upon arrival found out that the double queen room we requested are no longer available for the first night (of a 2 night stay). To compensate tho, they upgraded us to the King suite for the first night! so I will mention some general feedback and specific feedback for each types of rooms. \n\nGeneral: The staff was amazing, from front desk to the bell hops. Everyone was very helpful and very attentive to details. The ground floor staff (lobby was on ~6th floor) was always available to help open doors or press elevator for you if you had your hands full. They also have \"smart\" elevators which some folks did find difficult to use (you enter the floor and then instructed to use one of the 3 elevators). Hotel also offered free water bottles unlike our second hotel (Luma) that we stayed at. Unfortunately they had run out of slippers during our stay and were awaiting shipment. The location was 7-8 blocks from Times Sq and a bit too close to Penn Station but it was very close to Korean Town for all the good food options. \n\nKing Suite 3602: The views are amazing especially with floor to ceiling windows. Nothing beats waking up to the Manhattan skyline or falling asleep to all the night lights from your bed. The swanky and stylish sitting area, leading into the king sized bedroom was very nice. The bed was as comfy as expected with automatic curtains, tv in both bedroom and sitting room, and a huge bathroom and frosted glass shower window to the bedroom. Again, hard to criticize anything about this room \u2013 it was amazing. The only issue we found was the sofa bed, which had a sorry excuse for a mattress. \n\nDouble Queens 3003: It was a corner so had south facing views and while not as grand as the king suite, the views were pretty nice itself. It even had a nice sitting table in the corner, affording a nice place to sit and enjoy the views. It did not have automatic curtains but everything else was excellent. As with the other room, the safe was a drawer safe with ample space for multiple full size laptops. It unfortunately did have a broken shower door hinge which was a bit annoying.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

A quick 10 minute walk to Times Square and quiet enough that you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in the middle of chaos. Macy\u2019s was also a two minute walk and there are pubs and restaurants on every corner. \n\nCheck in was a breeze and the front desk agent, Matthew was professional, kind and relatable. \n\nOur room was very nice and clean. The bedding and pillows were heavenly and the room was complexly modern.  We loved the decor\u2026except for the bathroom door. It has a super sexy sliding door; however it\u2019s frosted glass (you can see someone\u2019s silhouette while they\u2019re using the toilet) and the door doesn\u2019t close completely or lock, which impacts privacy. The hallway on our floor was also incredibly warm - we could have done hot yoga in it. \n\nMy only other comment would be that housekeeping seemed a little\u2026 off, I guess?Housekeeping was scheduled for every third day, with a small refresh on the in-between days (change garbages, restock shampoo, etc.). For our first day, we had nothing - the garbages were full, no restocking, nothing. On the second day, they changed our garbages and gave us some additional towels, but that was it. No refreshing of in-room coffee pods and supplies, our in-room glasses and coffee mugs weren\u2019t changed. For the third day, they tidied the bathroom, changed towels, made the beds, and changed the garbages, but still didn\u2019t get new glasses, mugs or refill of coffee pods and cream. We really don\u2019t think we\u2019re snobs about this stuff\u2026 but kind of would have expected a bit more attention to detail on this.

We\u2019re walkers so this location is just perfect for everything we like to do. \n\nMy only complaint and the reason I only gave 4 stars was that I used suite upgrades, which were confirmed, yet when we reached the hotel we were told that the suite wasn\u2019t available and I needed to call Marriott to have them reinstate the awards to my Bonvoy account, which I did. As a result, we were given a standard room that didn\u2019t have the great views others have raved about and we were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, which was noted on the reservation. Suffice it to say that as a Lifetime Titanium on the cusp of becoming an Ambassador by year\u2019s end, I wasn\u2019t happy. But, fortunately, my wife loved the location and the decor of the hotel so much that she didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it, even though I thought it was for such a special occasion.

Zero mention of a nightclub like their sister property in Chelsea. Well after a long day exploring the city and returning to our room around 9pm to finally sleep and get an early start, we realized that was not the case. There was loud thumping music and people screaming. This was not just a little background noise it was so loud that we had to have our TV on a level 30 to even hear it. There was zero chance of sleeping as people were cheering and screaming on top of the music. We requested earplugs and they were all out. After calling the front desk we were told it would continue until midnight and this is the case every Friday and Saturday night. Being that we were exhausted and wanting to get an early start in the morning, this was an awful night. \nOverall, nice hotel and location.

The shower has an overhead  showerhead and a wall\/body showerhead, you cannot use both at the time time. If you have hair that you don't want to wash, you are forced to use the body head which is mounted quite low on the shower wall (and I am very short). The water pressue stunk.

I was made to feel welcome, and valued, from the moment I walked in on the ground level, and that was only with Security. Clear directions were provided for my check-in (located on Floor 6) and that's where I met even more excellence. Although I arrived earlier than requested via the app, they advised my room was already available, thanked me for being an Elite member, provided some food\/beverage info, suggested I contact them with any questions, and then \"let me walk you over to the elevator\", all with a smile. It's these little things (that don't cost them a dime) making that first impression a VERY positive one.\n   Everything in my assigned room (Floor 35) was in perfect working order. Another reviewer commented this property felt a bit boutique-like (due to minimal number of rooms on each floor) and I totally get that now. The hallways, like my room, was very clean.  I enjoyed the city skyline view from my room, and will admit that even on the high floors it is possible to hear some activity of sirens during the day\/night, but I totally expected that considered where I was staying within the city. It was not extremely loud at all and caused zero problems during my short stay. The Aveda toiletries they provide are some of the best at any Marriott property.  The shower is designed without a 'lip' which avoids any trip hazard, and it totally works.  I figured the chaise lounge would go unused, but I was wrong.  A great addition right there at the window for relaxed viewing.  \n   The elevators, like many things in this hotel, use a digital smart technology to access your room. Enter desired floor info, tap your key\/device, and voila you're on your way . . . and rather quickly I might add.  Like so many hotels, in-house food service is currently shuttered with the ongoing travel challenges, but they offer numerous alternatives, and, hey, you're in NYC where there are many options within a short walk.  I was advised of this pre-arrival, so not surprise or disappointment there. \n   You are very close to the main NY Penn Station hub (as well as several street access points) and also the new Moynihan Train Hall.  Even if you don't need it, go visit the hall, which is superb. You are also so very close to the huge Macy's Herald Square and also the Empire State Building.  With any vacation location, you absolutely must use common sense when out and about. and I can say that I did feel quite safe in most of this area.  The positioning of security on that lower level also seems to assure great safety while in the hotel too.  \n   I didn't need to visit the front desk during my brief stay, but in addition to doing mobile check-out I went by to turn in my card and offer a Thank You before departing.  Before I could say much I was referred to by name, and making sure I'd enjoyed my experience.  Again, those little things making a now perfect final impression.  I hope to make this my Go-To hotel in NYC for any future travel.  I normally prefer to try a different location on each arrival, but they truly were that impressive.  \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" right??  VERY easy to recommend Renaissance Midtown to others.  I hope your experience will be as wonderful as mine.  Another big THANK YOU to the entire team. \n[caveat: I work for a huge hospitality company that provides some of the best guest service training in the industry, and can be quite picky.]","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Floor to ceiling window in the room and...the bathroom. Yes, the shower is exposed to the room (there is a shade you can pull down for privacy. There is a comfy chaise in front of the window so you can daydream or read. The desk is long if you need to work. The room has a mini-fridge and coffee maker. My only complaint with the room is the really dim lighting. \n\nThe hotel is a 5 minute walk to Madison Square and Penn Station. Depending on the time of day, there are many eating options within a short walk. Macys is a 2 minute walk. \n\nI would recommend for anyone who needs to be in a comfy room for a night or two.

The hotel did not know how to handle it - to the point in which I had to just call an Uber to take myself to the ER while they were still figuring it out. I'm not even upset about their inability to handle the situation. i'm more upset that to this day, I still have not received resolution. I gave some leeway because 2020 has been a crazy year, but this is quite some time to take in not resolving it. I made several calls and exchanged many emails with their insurance company only to find out that my contact left the firm, and months later I finally got a new contact.

What makes the Renaissance NYC midtown unique is its commitment to professional personalized hospitality. Every staff member goes out of his\/her way to make you feel welcomed and appreciated. Tinisha answered many questions I had regarding visiting during the pandemic the day before I arrived. It was a pleasure to meet her in person as I checked in. The hotel has instituted a temperature check for each person entering the building. Elex, the doorman performed this procedure quickly and cheerfully as I walked into the lower lobby. My room was as beautiful, comfortable, and clean as I have a experienced during past stays with some pandemic accommodations. It is now possible to control the large screen tv from your smart phone rather than using remote control. Versa,the property restaurant, is open for lunch and dinner. Although the menu has been shortened, Dave my waitperson was excellent. The food was delicious and the service was prompt. Renaissance gives its concierges the title of \u201cNavigator\u201d and I had the pleasure of getting expert advice from Daniel Garcia. Daniel may be the best concierge in NYC.  He is a real treasure and great resource. When I checked out I enjoyed the personalized service provided by Caleb.

To be very honest, I was surprised since I stayed at different marriott-bonvoy hotels and I didn't always get \"special\" treatment.\n\nThe other thing that I LOVE from the hotel is the view!!! I specifically booked for a room with a skyscraper view and I was blown away. It was raining most of the time when I was there, but when it clears up, you can see the city, the lights, everything!! It was MAGICAL! Love it!!!\n\nThe bed was super comfortable, the room is a bit tiny, but also this is New York so I didn't expect too much. I love that they have bluetooth speaker in the room.

I chose this hotel for this very reason, plus its Midtown location, and a large Planet Fitness gym on-site.  On these counts, I was not disappointed.  \n\nThe room in which I stayed - 2208 - offered a nice view of the Manhattan skyline, across adjacent rooftops to distant skyscrapers, and this summed up the quintessential New York experience for me.  The bathroom of grey-veined white marble offered a space-effective design, with excellent shower pressure and instant hot water.  Plentiful supply of quality Aveda toiletries.  The bedroom itself was equally well designed, with a king-sized bed, chaise longue beside the floor-to-ceiling window, fast, free and stable Wi-Fi and individual heating\/cooling.  \n\nThe downsides which I encountered:\n\n1. Noisy air-conditioning - the compressor unit appears to be situated inside the room, and made a racket every time the thermostat kicked in, especially when in Auto mode.  I frequently adjusted it to low fan speed mode just to reduce the noise.\n2. Bed was far too soft - I respect that this is largely subjective - many people prefer a plush sleeping surface - but for me, it didn't offer enough support\n3. Wet patch on carpet directly under the dripping AC vent\n4. No bottled water\n5. Powerpoints in the room (and there were many) do not cater to plugs from other countries - when I rang to ask for an international adaptor, I was pointendly told to go buy my own from a nearby electronics store\n6, No kettle.  One has to use a small coffee-maker to boil water - this dispenses water in tiny spurts,  and if there are 2 occupants in the room, you can't enjoy a hot beverage together\n\nStaff overall friendly and helpful.  Planet Fitness gym large and well equipped, offering free access to hotel guests.  \n\nMidtown West location very convenient, with the Subway trains very near, as were countless shops, restaurants, theatres and Macy's department store.  Easy to walk everywhere, including Times Square, which I tried to avoid as much as possible due to the crowds and sensory overload of lights and noise.  \n\nAs I had booked several months in advance, I enjoyed a good-value rate, so I can't complain, but I noticed that rates are otherwise quite expensive (over USD 400++ per night).\n\nGiven the vast choice of hotels in NYC, I would explore other options on my next visit, but overall, the Renaissance Midtown is a solid choice.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

That hotel was very personable, where the \"welcome\" at the Renaissance felt more formulaic. It felt like we were just being processed. The bartenders at the outside terrace bar ignored us until we gave up and went inside where the service was better. The bar was nearly empty, it made no sense. \n\nThey said they'd call when our room was ready but they didn't. Our room was nice, but I HATE those sliding barn doors on bathrooms. No privacy. The view was good and the lounger by the window was fantastic. The sleep was comfortable and quiet. \n\nThe location is close enough to Times Square and Penn Station to be convenient for tourist spots and catching the subway. The hotel itself is VERY secure, however, it is in a pretty seedy area. The smell of urine just outside of the hotel is so strong sometimes you can't breathe, and in the three nights we stayed there, I saw a crack deal in plain sight, two people selling stolen CK jeans, and a man strung out and locked up on heroin, all in the same spot by the phone booths between the hotel and 7th avenue.

If I had paid for the room, it would have been over 300 dollars and I would not stay for that price.\n\nThe hotel website mentions that it's a high-tech hotel but not sure what that means. Nothing in the room has anything to do with technology except for the Internet TV.\n\nThere are double shades which I thought would be controlled with a remote or switch but you have to reach behind the standing lamp and pull the chain. Even with double shades, you will still hear street noise.\n\nThe switch next to the bedhead looks like a master switch for the room but it's just for the bedside lamp right over the switch and you have to turn the lights off individually or turn off the master switch placed next to the door, which will also shut off other electricity thus stop phone charging. There was also a knock on the door at around 9:20am on Sunday morning 'checking.'\n\nThe water pressure is just so bad but I liked Aveda amenities.\nThe elevator is the worst - it's the kind of elevator that you press the floor first and then you get assigned to one. There are three that go to all the floors and one just between the lobby (6th floor) and the first floor. Pretty sure that it's programmed to run the minimum number of elevator - everyone gets assigned to a single elevator and I have seen people not being able to get in in spite of all the waiting.\nThere are also just not enough people in the lobby and the bell desk. \n\nThe location is pretty great though - close to Penn station and major touristy areas.

At check in we were told they had a rooftop lounge we could go to, but when we tried to we were told it was closed for cleaning after a private event.

The only thing we wish we would have known is that there was an entrance\/exit on 34th street as well.  An employee told us that as we were leaving (giving us the quickest way to the train station).

I didn\u2019t interact with the staff very often, but I didn't have any issues while I was there. The room was a bit small for my personal preference, but I think that\u2019s kind of the norm for New York City. I\u2019m sure there are rooms which are much smaller. The shower and bathroom, however, made up for it! They were excellent! I loved the climate control mirror so when you got out of the shower it wasn\u2019t steamed up. I didn\u2019t use any of the food and beverage outlets so I can\u2019t attest to them. They also had smart elevators which were relatively new at the time.\n\nThere are several points of interest within walking distance. Madison Square Garden was one block south of the hotel. Penn Station was about two blocks away. The world famous Macy\u2019s Department Store was about a block away. Times Square was only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. You also had great views of The Empire State Building each time you left the hotel. Not exactly sure how far the hotel is from the ESB, but I imagine no more than a 15 minute walk. \n\nThis hotel is perfect for anyone who might be traveling for business or pleasure.

We have complained to the front desk for in each of the first two mornings and after being shown other Standard King Rooms at different levels and sides of the hotel that seemed to have the same noise issues we decided to stay in the original room. We were asked to pay for an upgrade as a solution even though we were happy with the room but not the noise which we declined as the solution seemed exaggerated. The first person we spoke to on the Front Desk can do with a bit of training, he was not very good at speaking with customers. The rest of the people we have dealt with were nice and much much better at speaking with a customer. We have however made a written complain and on our third morning and by the evening we were upgraded to a Skyline Suite with 1.5 bathrooms on the 36th floor and we were given a $30 voucher to use at the Versa restaurant. The suite was much quieter (not completely quiet), so we could sleep much better for the rest of the nights.

The Terrace was a nice touch to enjoy outdoor space but it was not very private, which is okay. I can also imagine that if people use it to party or for gatherings, it could get noisy.

Very friendly and made sure I had access to the Club Lounge to get some work done prior to our room being ready (I was there by 11 am so this was not unexpected).

The hotel itself was excellent. Great location. Very close to the Empire state building, times square, rockerfellar centre and You could also walk to Central Park in about 40 minutes. Check in was very efficient, you enter the hotel at street level and check in on the 6th floor. During check in we were given a voucher for two complimentary drinks at Versa which I thought was a nice touch. The room was very good, you get exactly what you see on the hotel website. We could see the statue of liberty in the distance and Madisson Square gardens was just across the road. Housekeeping were very good, I think we only bumped into them once during our 1 week stay and the room was always perfect on our return. Didn't dine in the hotel so I'm unable to comment on the food options. Read some negative things about the hotels lift\/elevator system you have to pick your floor and scan your key before entering the lift as there are no buttons to select a floor inside, everybody who just jumped in without picking a floor seemed to take it in good humour. This is the only negative I have about our stay and it was in Versa on the Saturday 1st of June. We had checked out and had booked a taxi for 18:00. We had been in Versa a few times previously during our stay. It is a good big bar\/restaurant. Bar staff very good, great selection of drinks. We had returned to the hotel went to Versa and ordered some drinks and went outside to the outside terrace area which was quiet because most people were watching the football. Ordered a second drink and had just started this and a female member of staff approached and informed us the area we were in was closing for a private function but we could move to the area at the top of the terrace to continue our drinks. This was fair enough but within 5 minutes of sitting down in this area a male member of staff a guy with a tartan blazer now said we would have to leave this area also. His attitude wasn't great he had more of a bull in a China shop approach to customer care. We were eventually able to finish our and leave via the main Versa area and not down the fire exit as advised. Overall we had a great stay at this hotel and the experience was good. Only the bit at the end tarnished it a bit. As I said earlier the photos you see on the Web of this hotel are pretty accurate. I have only attached one photo and this was the area we were allowed to finish our drinks on the last day. For a bit of balance I've also attached one of what you can see from the terrace.

What a great experience.  However, it gets better.  My AMEX was in fact charged for a 2nd night stay.  I called your hotel the next day and spoke with \"manager\" at the front desk and I explained the above to her.  She seemed to have empathy and assured me that she would refund the amount but I also asked her to provide the name of the person who made the decision to charge my AMEX; she stated she would call me back.

The public spaces and rooms are beautiful.\n\nWe have booked a room with a view. We have been assigned a fairly spacious room on the 32nd floor with a magnificent view of the New York skyline. The only problem in the bedroom is the lack of storage space. There is no chest of drawers. Only one shelf in the cupboard can be used; the others are reserved for the safe, the fridge or the coffee machine. For one person, it can be fine. With two, it's difficult to settle in properly. \n\nWe tried to have a drink at the hotel bar on the 5th floor. In addition to being crowded, the noise is unbearable. The restaurant is adjacent to the bar; needless to say, it is not a relaxation area. It's more like a W hotel than a Renaissance. At breakfast, the place is pleasant. The menu is a little off the beaten track and the prices are correct.\n\nThis hotel is located just behind Macy's and is close to several metro lines. The reception is located on the 6th floor. You must select your floor before taking the elevator. The system shows you the number of the elevator assigned to you. It's a little complicated at first, but you get used to it quickly.

And the bathroom was very nice, especially the rain shower. For breakfast, I recommend forgoing the $26 breakfast buffet (no offense, Marriott Corporation!), and heading across the street to Best Bagels, where all the bagels, other baked goods, and breakfast sandwiches are made fresh. There's also a Starbucks on the corner and a good diner (Andrew's) right across 7th Ave from that.

I know you avoid a lot of street noise being 27 floors up but we heard nothing above us or even from the hallway. We also appreciated the efficient and fast elevators- a common issue in NYC hotels. \n\nThe club lounge is a great feature of this hotel. It is frustrating when the lounge is tied to having a room on a certain floor. You then feel like you're at the mercy of your complimentary upgrade. The lounge was very spacious and the offerings were impressive. We were only able to grab breakfast so I can't speak to other times of the day.

Would I stay here again.....probably not....small rooms and difficulty getting Uburs who want to cross town to get here.....problematic and I would choose a quieter location next time with larger rooms!

The location is excellent if you are going to the theater, visiting Hudson Yards, Chelsea, the Village or anywhere on the west side.  It is down the black from Penn Station\/MSG\/Macys and convenient to every subway line.  Since it is a congested area with tons of foot traffic, having the lobby on the 6th floor is very wise.\n\nSebastian checked us in and was friendly and accommodating.  He explained the workings of the hotel in detail.  Our loyalty to Marriott was recognized and we were upgraded to room on the 23rd floor.  The Club Lounge staff was considerate and helpful.  The food choices were perfect for us - healthy options and small plates.   The \"greenness\" is also appreciated.  Larger bottles of water as opposed to so many tiny bottles and no Styrofoam in the lounge; master switch in rooms for electricity, ceramic cups and glasses in the rooms as opposed to Styrofoam cups.\n\nThe hotel and rooms are designed to reflect the location of the garment center -- totally authentic and beautifully decorated.  The bed was very comfortable and towels were somewhat plush and large.  Aveda toiletries are a nice touch.  Even the shower was superior.  Glass sliding doors which were installed properly.  The shower floor is flush with bathroom floor and all of the water stays in shower.  \n\nThe hotel is in a very congested area of NYC and surprisingly quiet.

I SO wanted to fall in love with this hotel. A representative reached out to me a week before my trip, making an impeccable first impression. However, this advance first impression quickly diminished upon arrival at the hotel. Where do I begin? Let\u2019s start at the unhelpful bell hop personnel who stood around by the front door and watched my associates and I struggle to pull our luggage inside without even doing so much as holding the door. Frustrating. Following our encounter with the front door service (or lack thereof) we made our way to the lobby. The front desk employees were friendly, helpful, and greeted us as soon as we exited the elevator. This made up for the subpar service we initially received upon entering the hotel and is partially the reason why I\u2019m even giving this hotel more than 2 stars. We checked in early, came back at 4 and still had to wait an extra 30 minutes after standard check-in time for our room to be prepared. We were told the extra wait time was due to a surprise being set up for one of my associate\u2019s birthday. Plot twist- there was no surprise. I had to talk to the front desk reps for the third time for a thrown together presentation to show itself in the room in the late evening. I could go on and on about where this hotel fell short with service but I\u2019ll stop here. Long story short, this hotel is GORGEOUS- the rooms are spacious and clean, the bathrooms are tidy and functional, and it\u2019s in a great location in close proximity to MSG.

In search of good service and a nice bed, I booked the Renaissance through SPG (now Marriott)  knowing nothing about it. I was pleasantly surprised to discover the unique design elements of the hotel upon arrival. I was checked in by the AMAZING Sebastian, who was so friendly and kind-I asked for a quiet room, and he completely delivered. Honestly, he was one of the most helpful hotel employees I've ever encountered. Ever. And I travel a lot. He also gave me a nice voucher for the hotel restaurant Versa, which to be honest, I'm not sure I would have tried otherwise. But I had it, so I invited my friend...and it completely over-delivered. Food was AMAZING, great service, good drinks. Food was actually so good I ate there again a second night and my friend (who is a prominent NYC designer) commented that he would eat there without staying at the hotel. Beautiful outdoor patio that is heavily heated in the winter-it was hopping both nights, which is saying something for a Renaissance hotel.  If you are Platinum, there is also a really lovely club lounge with comp beverages off the lobby. The lobby bar also seemed chic and was very popular both nights I was there. Rooms are compact as per NYC space, but so well designed with floor-to-ceiling windows and gorgeous design elements (thank you marble shower and rainfall shower head), that it seemed almost spacious. My new go-to in NYC. Don't hesitate to book here-you won't regret it.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I want to start by saying that the hotel itself is beautiful, the rooms are really nice, modern and clean.  The location of the hotel is also perfect (pretty much right at 34th St and 7th Ave, in the heart of the fashion district).  We had a room on the 26th Floor with a perfect view south to downtown.  As amazing as all of this was, I have to say that the even more amazing part was how great and attentive the staff were.  We were dealing with Ariel at the Front Desk who was excellent at her job, very friendly, and a great help to us.  In addition to to Ariel, the crew on the main floor at the front door who were holding our bags, etc. were excellent as well, as was the staff in general.  An example would be where one of the LED lights in our room wasn't working so we called the front desk to have it repaired (really, this was not a huge issue in my mind).  Not only did they fix it but they bent over backwards to make sure we were totally satisfied with the repair.  Again, the staff at this hotel is second to none.  We just want to say thank you to the team at the Renaissance New York Midtown Hotel for a very enjoyable stay and we hope to stay with you again the next time we're in the great city of New York.

We didn't ask about checking in, but the lovely receptionist looked to see if she could give us a room. She had a city view on the 25th floor but said it was next to the elevators. Just grateful that we could check in so early, we said that would be fine.\n\nThe room was a nice size for NYC. It was clean, well laid out and had every amenity that you would expect from a nice hotel including a safe, coffee maker, mini-fridge and Aveda toiletries. The Internet connection was easy and worked well. The king bed was comfortable and the bathroom had a great walk-in rain shower that, unlike most glass enclosed showers, didn't leak. The only minor problem in the room was that the reading lights by the beds didn't work .\n\nBeing by the elevators did not bother us at all. Noise was a minimum until the 7am traffic and trucks started in the morning, but even then it wasn't bad.\n\nBeing a platinum member, we had access to the Club Lounge, so we headed there the next morning for a bite to eat.

At first there was nowhere to sit, but a couple of stools along the window soon became available. There was a small, but very nice, selection of hard-boiled or scrambled eggs wrapped in tortillas, bread\/pastry items and fruit to perfectly start your day.\n\nAfter checking out we were allowed to store our suitcase so we could spend the day unencumbered by luggage. When we returned we enjoyed a glass of wine in the lobby bar prior to heading back to the train station. The gentlemen at the bar could not have been nicer. The whole staff were extremely nice and helpful.\n\nWe usually stay in Times Square at the Marquis or Renaissance, but we enjoyed this smaller Renaissance, its location, rooms and staff much more. This will be our new hotel for all our future visits to the big apple.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have stayed at countless hotels in New York (mostly Starwood) and am usually, if not, disappointed, then at least underwhelmed. Most hotels are dark, cramped and show signs of age. This property is one of those lovely surprises that catches you off guard.\n\nUpon arrival, I was a little disappointed by the lack of staff to welcome me or even assist with the elevators. The bell staff just stood around as I tried to figure out the confusing elevator situation (complicated to use at first, but makes total sense once you figure it out). The front desk staff were very friendly upon check-in, or anytime I needed them for anything. Ariel always had a smile on her face and was lovely in assisting me. The rooms are extremely well-designed, with modern woods and tiles. Of course, the rooms are small as it is NYC, but the layout and design techniques make these rooms feel more airy and spacious. The bathroom was just fabulous with a glassed-in shower and great bath linens and amenities. \n\nThis hotel doesn't have its own gym - but even better, it is directly attached to a full-service gym that hotel guests get free use of during their stay. This was such a nice surprise for someone like me who works out and never knows what to expect at the different hotels.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't try any of the hotels bar or dining venues due to so much amazing food in the city. The hotel's location in Midtown is perfect and within walking distance of so much.\n\nI will definitely be back. Depending on price (as the pricing fluctuates wildly in NYC), this is my new go-to property in the city. Marriott\/Starwood has a real gem with this hotel!","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

I was highly impressed. To preface, I currently work in a 5 star, 5 diamond Marriott (Ritz-Carlton) property so I know a thing or two about service and as far as NYC standards go, this particular hotel definitely doesn't disappoint and exceeds expectations on multiple levels. As soon as I arrived, Justin downstairs immediately took my bags and notified me that rooms weren't ready yet. At lobby level check in, the clerk (a beautiful blonde girl) told me the room wasn't quite ready as well but will call me once it was. I waited less than 1 hour and it was ready before noon. She and Ranie were exceptional! My room on the 10th floor was perfect for me- beautifully appointed, very modern and clean with a great view overlooking the roof top and Midtown NYC. I needed 2 champagne glasses and while that took some time, I walked down to the lobby bar and Marisa was just setting up for the day. She gave me the most solid list of places to go to while I was visiting- she was great! Each of them were exactly what I was looking for. While the roof top restaurant isn't affiliated with Marriott, I must give a MAJOR shout out to Barry at the bar. He worked the \"tequila focused\" satellite bar and he was amazing. He made the perfect Casamigos Margarita's and was so pleasant to chat with while enjoying a nice cocktail with a view. The location of the hotel is perfect. Close but far enough from Times Square, right next to Madison Square Garden and walking distance to the Empire State Building. When I return to NYC soon, I won't even think twice about staying here again. Beautiful modern hotel, great staff, awesome roof top and well-appointed, clean rooms!

My wife actually timed me and said it took 19 minutes to go and fetch ice. Most of this time was spent waiting on the elevator. I did have to go to two different floors as the ice machine on 26 was out of order, but still...\n- The complimentary breakfast buffet on Saturday was very disappointing.

I sometimes gravitate towards historic hotels, but the 2 near Penn Station, the New Yorker and Hotel Pennsylvania, did not look that great, and the Hotel Penn had some pretty lousy TA reviews.  I ended up booking at the Renaissance because it looked pretty good online, was a block from Penn Station, was a good value, and because I have Marriott Gold Level status.  This was my first stay at a Renaissance branded hotel.  Although I was only there about 9 hours, the stay was a joy, a pleasant surprise.  Service overall was very friendly.\n\nI find the area around Penn Station rather gritty and has never been my first choice for lodging location.  Macy's and Madison Square Garden are very close, and the Theatre District is about 7 blocks away.  The Renaissance's main entrance is on 35th St. between 7th and 8th Ave., but also has an entrance on 34th.  The ground floor only has a bell\/security desk.  The Lobby is on the 6th floor, along with a public bar\/lounge and the Club Lounge.  The main restaurant and bar (indoor\/outdoor) is on the 5th floor, meeting rooms are on the 7th.  Elevators are the touchscreen kind where you indicate where you want to go and the screen tells you which elevator to wait for.  Access to room floors requires a key scan as well for security.  The lobby and bar\/lounge\/library areas were stylishly decorated in a contemporary fashion that I found quite appealing.   Throughout the hotel are clever homages to the area's garment district past and present.  In the lobby, this included dressmakers mannequins.  In the Club Lounge, there were bolts of colour-coordinated fabrics lining the walls.  In the room, there was a sculpture of a sewing machine and a dish for knick-knacks shaped like a button.\n\nAlthough I had booked a standard room, I think I was upgraded to a slightly larger room with a view on the 20th floor (I think the hotel has just under 40 floors).  The room had floor-to-ceiling windows on one and 1\/4 of the walls.  I again loved the contemporary style and modern design.  I always look for electrical outlets and USB ports conveniently situated by the desk and bed; this room had both.  There was no minibar, but a very convenient minifridge instead.  The bathroom was well-lit, with a large shower with rain and hand-held heads.  I liked the stylish bean-shaped sink.  My only complaint would be that the towels, although stylish, were more like kitchen towels than fluffy, absorbent bath towels.  \n\nAs a Marriott Gold member, I had access to the Club Lounge, which is open 24 hours for access to a fridge full of water, soft drinks, juices, milk and yogurt from which I stocked my room fridge.  The Lounge is not large but again, very stylish.  A small breakfast buffet is served starting at 6:30 am that included warm items (bacon, sliced-up burritos filled with scrambled eggs and cheese) plus continental breakfast fare.  I'm not sure about food offerings later in the day.\nI took a peek at the hotel's restaurant and lounge which was called Rock and Reilly's, but has now been renamed Versa.  It's a large space with indoor and outdoor bars and dining.  The outdoor lounge is apparently quite popular.  \n\nIn spite of my thoughts about the area, my stay at the Renaissance was surprisingly nice.  I would definitely return here, hopefully for more than 9 hours.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The bathroom overall is clean and beautiful with a modern design and marble finishes.  However, the outside wall of the shower is glass and faced the living area so anyone there could watch you shower.  The glass was frosted but it still left little to the imagination and was negated if you got close enough to the wall.

Hotel was clean and decor was nice, family and I felt safe. No complaints on overall stay. Hotel restaurant Rockin Reily's was good (ate their for dinner and brunch) Walking distance to Empire State Building and Herald Square. Slightly confusing elevator system and not much assistance from ground floor employees. With the exception of Nadia in housekeeping ( I really hope that is her name, who was WONDERFUL ) I think all of the staff was just okay, no one seemed to really want to be bothered to assist. ie: my niece lost a ring and we believed it was in the business center, when I asked the ladies working the desk neither of them responded right away (again having a conversation among themselves just like the 1st floor employees always seemed to be doing) One of them did call security, who did not answer and her response was \"I think I saw them all on break\" - my response was \"good thing this isn't a real emergency!\" Never found the ring but that is no fault of the hotel. Again just lack of effort from all of the hotel staff. I would stay here again because I rarely interact with hotel staff minus check in so that is not a big deterrent but it is cause for 4 stars.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Rooms are extremely small which is somewhat understandable given it's midtown location. Rooms are definitely too small for a family of four. Lobby very small. Elevators take forever to arrive .Even though I have elite status, lounge was closed during the week leading to Easter, no room up grades and way too crowded. I really wanted to change hotels midweek but it just would have been a pain by that point. We arrived around 2pm Fri afternoon, check in was long and no rooms were available yet (understandably given 4pm check in). I was told we could leave bags downstairs by bellman. We later called as we went to dinner and asked if it would be possible for bellman to place our bags in our room as our room was ready at that time. After dinner, we went back to hotel to find our bags still downstairs. The woman who checked us in told me that I could check tomorrow for an upgraded room. Next two days I checked for room upgrades only to be told that there wouldn't be any upgrades and that all rooms are the same size (wish the first woman just told me that so that we would have looked for another hotel earlier in our trip). All in all just a disappointment.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I chose the Renaissance because at the moment it was the best rate from all the options on marriott.com. \nI can say I will definitely keep choosing it for every stay in NYC. \nA few days before my check in, the Guest Service Director, Justin, reached out through email with details of my booking, plus recommendations and pointers about the hotel. \nOnce i arrived, the guys on bell desk were very friendly and helpful with my luggage and any questions I had. \nI went to check in, but my room wasn't ready (I arrived earlier than Check In time). So they told me if my room is ready before 4pm,  they will text me. And it was. I had my room at around 1pm, which was great since I had a red-eye flight. \n\nThe hotel: I loved every inch of the hotel. It is so chic and trendy! The decor and design is amazing, very fashion-ly. The halls to the rooms, the industrial-kind of look on the rooms, the paintings on the wall, the decor. All of it!\n\nBars + Dining: I had a 'welcome myself' cocktail at the Thread the first day I arrived. Found it reasonable pricing and with many cocktail options if you're into the cocktail trend. Also, I had brunch on my last day at Rock & Reilly's and found the $ as being very reasonable \/ normal compared to any other restaurant outside of the hotel. Plus, it was amazing food! I had the Norwegian Eggs Benedict <3 yumm! It's recommended to reserve to make sure you don't miss out.\n\nElevators: It is a little tricky at first, but then you get the hang of it. I never experienced 'traffic jam' at the elevators but I've read that there is high traffic between 3pm-6pm.\n\nFitness people: You have a Planet Fitness 24\/7 in the 2nd floor, and it is complimentary for hotel guests. Will most definitely use it next time!\n\nClose to 34th St. Penn-Station Subway: Took the E Train for a direct trip to JFK and viceversa.\n\nOnly one thing I did not appreciate very much was with the A\/C. It was programmed to be turned on only as \"Auto\", which means that once it has reached the desired temperature it turns off for a little while. This is a minor issue for some, but for me it interrupted my sleep every time it turned off. :(","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

There are lots of delis and restaurants around that are excellent.  We chose this location over the one in Times Square Face on other TripAdvisor reviewers.\nCheck in was quick and easy, our room was supposedly upgraded, but still was smaller than average.  We phoned housekeeping and asked for more towels to be sent to the room, we left the hotel room for a couple of hours and came back and the towels were still not delivered.  We phoned down again and asked for another robe and mouthwash as well, in addition to the towels.  Towels were brought up, but not the other stuff. As we were leaving for the night, turndown service was offered, which we gladly accepted.  But funny, on the second day of our stay, we did not receive turndown service. After our phone call to inquire why we didn't get it the second night, we were told that we didn't ask for it.  But we didn't receive it the first night, and got it automatically.  They said it might be requested every night??  How does that make sense?\nThe club Lounge was a nice area, and was fully stocked with a variety of beverages except at night when they took the tea Station away??  Not sure why they do that when everything else is available.\nThe elevators!?!  I understand the need for security in the hotel, but the elevators are not a great experience.  You have to punch in your floor, and it directs you to one of the four elevators. You can only access that particular Elevator as there are no buttons in the elevator.  Numerous times we were left waiting for our assigned elevator, will other people that had arrived after us had come and gone.  They definitely aren't efficient. There was only once that we went top to bottom with no milk run.  \nNot sure if there was a convention or something going on in the hotel but the lobby was quite noisy as the bar is in close proximity.\nOur room was located close to the elevators, but was okay as we only heard people access them in the morning.\nI would stay here again, as front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating.

This hotel is a sleek and modern in design. We arrived on a Thursday evening and the bar on the check in level (6th floor) was  hopping with activity. Normally, that would be a concern but it was a nice welcome to the city. We asked for a quiet room and were given 3312 which was on the 33rd floor. I thought the room had ample space with beautiful decor. It turned out to be incredibly quiet. There was a safe and small empty refrigerator for use in the room. The elevators were a bit tricky to figure out since you had to swipe your room key, then select your floor before entering. Once inside, it took you directly to your floor with no way to change the floor you entered. It\u2019s a nice security measure with a little bit of inconvenience. One of the features of this hotel that I really appreciated was the Planet Fitness on the second floor. Unlike most hotels that have 3 cardio machines and a weight rack stuck in some back, windowless space, this hotel housed a completely separate gym for members and allowed the hotel guest free use. It is located on the 2nd floor of the hotel. It has about 25 treadmills, a section of bikes and stairclimbers and plenty of weight machines. It wasn\u2019t crowded when we were there and we had plenty of options for machine use. The only miss was the coffee bar in the room.

The speed of the elevators was super quick vs. most other hotels I have stayed in.\n\nAs a Marriott Elite Member I got Lounge Access and the breakfast buffet in their restaurant on the weekend. The restaurant staff was amazing and the breakfast buffet was more than filing. The normal lounge breakfast felt very bare in terms of offerings vs. the restaurant.\n\nThe ice machines are only on certain floors and I couldn't find anything in the room to tell me where they where located. I actually had to check TripAdvisor to figure out there is a directory menu built into the TV with the ice machine locations.\n\nThe bathrooms are very luxurious and so is the walk-in shower. The tile on the shower floor can be a bit hard on your feet if you have been exploring the city for the entire day, but not much you can do about that.\n\nThe only part of the hotel that needs improvement is the App communication and e-mails.\n\nI had requested an early check-in prior to my arrival and used the App for a mobile check-in with my early check-in time. Check-in is 4 PM and I had not received any communication that my room was ready by 2 PM, so I used the App to message and ask if my room was ready. I got a response saying \"My room is not ready yet and if there was anything else that they could assist me with,\" and not \"eta\" was given for when a room would be ready. I did end up heading down to the hotel, and when I got there a room was ready for me. Almost felt like had I went down to the hotel earlier a room would have been ready for me vs. asking in the app messenger. Then being an Elite member one of the privileges is a late check-out up to 4 PM. I had a confirmed 1 PM check-out booked (instead of 12 PM,) and used the app the morning of my departure to ask if it would be possible to have a 1:30 PM check-out instead and I got a response saying \"I'm confirmed for a 1:00 PM check-out and if there was anything else I could be helped with.\" Felt like my message was not even read or they could have at least said \"sorry, we cannot accommodate a 1:30 PM check-out instead of ignoring it.\n\nBefore my trip I received an e-mail asking for my information which I responded too and never got a response back (not sure if I was supposed to get one, or just even a \"thanks, we got your info.\" A few days after my trip I received another e-mail saying \"We hoped you enjoyed your stay and to let them know of any issues.\" I responded about the \"app\" issues but again never received a follow-up e-mail (not sure if I was supposed to, but figured I would.)\n\nThis is an amazing hotel and I absolutely loved my stay here and the staff I met in person, but it felt like if it was not face-to-face communication, you were not given the same level of service, especially using the App.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

It's right across the street from Madison Square Garden, Macy's Herald Square, and is a 10 minute walk to times square. The Neighborhood is VEERY noisy, we had room 1407 (14th floor) and heard things all night. \n\nHotel Common Areas: The hotel lobby is on the 6th floor. It has a very modern, hip, design vibe. The restaurant (Rock and Reilly's) located on the 5th floor is very good. I recommend the nachos, and the classic burger. Finally, the fitness center (A Public Planet Fitness) is located on floors 2, and 3. Very clean and well maintained.\n\nRoom: The rooms have a Modern, Industrial design, and are very large for the midtown area. The bathrooms are huge, with a walk in shower, rainfall shower head, and a full size vanity. As for noise, we heard no noise from the inside of the hotel, but the street noises penetrated the room like we had a window open. Maybe rooms higher up are quieter?? Quick side note, during our stay the in room freezer went into a defrost cycle, and began to leak. We also had access to the \"club lounge\" they served complimentary evening horderves, breakfast, and drinks were served all day.  \n\nOverall: This is a very nice Midtown\/ Times square\/ Fashion District hotel, with good proximity to MSG. Rooms are large, bright, and brand new. Insulation, and street noise reduction could use work though. Lastly, the elevators could use some work. They were fast and equipped with a destination dispatch system. On the other hand, they were quite buggy, not accepting calls, and once taking me to the wrong floor. I have seen this same system working better at the Boston Marriott Copley place, and when working is quite useful.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The king size bed was comfy, the armoire featured a nice rob and slippers, the bathroom was a decent size and featured Aveda products you find throughout the Renaissance brand. Two of my kids live in the city and visited me in the room, and got a chuckle out of the frosted glass on the bathroom wall that looked out toward the bed and window, but there was a shade there and it wasn't an issue. However, there was an issue with the malfunctioning ice machine on the 34th floor. The next closest one was on the 30th floor. Overall, not a big deal. The elevator system was confusing to a lot of people. You punch in the number of the floor to which you want to go, then are told which of the four elevators to enter. There are no buttons inside. \n\nThe staff were friendly and remembered me when I checked out, even inquiring how my one son's musical performance at a club went.

I seek them out as I travel the US on business.  This is their new flagship hotel remodeled to show off their new \"Fearlessly Chic\" design direction. The public spaces and the rooms feature a very industrial, modern, and cold look, which is just not my style.  It feels like a very large boutique hotel, not an upscale luxury brand.  The staff all had an aloof trendy attitude, and except for housekeeping and the bell staff, were less than outgoing. I suspect Marriott is targeting a millennial audience, which I completely understand, but it's not what I have come to expect from the Renaissance brand.  There is no executive floor or lounge for Rewards members, just a business center type space off of the lobby that is apparently accessible to all hotel guests. The hotel's location is great: bordering the garment district, next to Madison Square Garden and Macy's, and a short walk from Broadway & Times Square.  The outdoor deck off of the bar and grill looked like it would be a great space in the summer.

In the public spaces and hallways, they did a great job of decorating with pictures and props related to fashion and the Garment District.

We could even see Lady Liberty from our room, which was cool.  The beds were very comfortable, and we appreciated the robes and slippers.  The one odd thing that may keep me from returning is the bathroom.  The frosted glass door slides shut but doesn't lock, and it also has a gap which means you can see someone sitting on the toilet when you walk toward the bathroom.  The glass offers absolutely no sound-proofing, either.  I could hear my husband fiddling around with the shampoo bottle while he was taking a shower.

Now having stayed at Renaissance Midtown NY, I can safely say it was a well informed and thought out decision!\n\nCheck in was extremely easy as hostess was very informative with regards to local amenities and explaining all details of the room.\n\nThe room itself (King room with city view) was a fantastic size and looked exactly as it did on the website which is always a bonus these days! Large, comfortable bed, ample sized seating area, long desk, big TV, massive bathroom with walk in rainfall shower - exactly everything we wanted down to a T.\n\nIn terms of locations I believe we were perfectly placed. Times Square was a 5-7 minute walk which meant we were away from the hustle and bustle in our own peace and quiet. Madison Square Gardens was a 10 minute or less walk in opposite direction. Penn St Station (main train Line) was less than 5 minute walk. Empire state building was a 10 minute walk. \n\nWe had a fantastic all day breakfast spot on top of our road accessible in 1 minute along with a Starbucks and a few other smaller cafes. The world's largest Macys (as they advertised it) was a 2 minute walk from the hotel as well as a ton of other designer shops and numerous restaurants.\n\nI honestly cannot fault the hotel in any way as the stay was near perfect from start to finish.

Not your typical hotel, with the elevators as well as the decor.  I want to point out that the elevators worked well; we did not wait 15 minutes for the elevators.  You select the floor you want to go on the screen and it'll tell which elevator to take (there are 3 elevators you can take from the 6th floor to your room; from ground floor to 6th floor you have 4 elevators), you get in and it'll bring you to the desired floor. Kind of hi-tech.\n\nRoom is on the small side (this is NYC, what do you expect) with a nice view (we were on 27th floor).  I can see the Statue of Liberty far in a distance.

I wasn't able to experience the lounge for breakfast, as I tended to sleep in (it was the weekend and the nights were all long ;)). I will say, that the lounge is kind of smaller compared to other renaissances. They also have boxed water. Something that was a new concept to me. The annoying thing about it is, if you go in to the lounge at night to grab some water---there's almost never any left. It's like someone takes the entire crate of them back to their room. Go in the morning or afternoon, and stock up on a few (or hey, take a crate since that might be the thing to do). The only other issue I had with the hotel was that my keys stopped working--so upon getting a new key, I realized it wasn't configured to have lounge access. So I then had to get it re-programmed again. Nothing too crazy. The room was pretty cool. It kind of had this modern\/re-designed feel to it. I was a fan of the waterfall shower. It was also surprisingly quiet\/sound proof despite being in the heart of midtown. I was expecting sirens to be heard all night. The outdoor bar area was awesome. I was able to catch some football and have a few beers the sunday I flew out. It seems like it draws a crowd of not just hotel guests, but locals as well. Uber\/lyft were all really easy to access by the hotel as well too. I was also told that they didn't have any suites at all at that hotel. Something that was strange, since every Renaissance I've been to had some suite rooms. I think the best employee btw was the valet.

The rooms are new and very clean.  They think of everything including the ability to leave your cell phone plug at home and just use their many ports built in to the room.  Shower was huge.  The room was very spacious and came with a nice robe and slippers.\n\nNow the downside - We had to run the shower for about 15 minutes to get hot water.  Trying to get it from the sink was even longer.  What a waste of water!  We were on the 15th floor.  Not sure where the hot water tank or heater is located but wow.  You have to plan for your time.  No quick jump in and get your shower.\n\nThe second downside was the lack of towels.  We booked the room for two adults.  They gave two towels, wash cloths, and hand towels.  Most places we go, we get four.  Because of the hot water issue, we postponed a shower until later in the day because we had to get somewhere in the morning.  When we got back to get our shower, the room was already done so only the two towels.  We got our shower for our evening event.  Then the next morning, we did not have clean towels.  Yes.  We like a new towel and wash cloth with each shower.  \n\nThere was a glitch with the key system that they could not issue keys when we tried to check in.  But they worked with us and escorted us to our room so we could get ready for our evening out on the city.  By the time we got back to the hotel, they were up and running again and we could get our keys.  They handled it the best they could.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

For us, it's enough out of the craziness of midtown and convenient to what we usually do in the city.  This time around more of what we were doing was in midtown and south, so we opted to stay at the Renaissance Midtown for the first time.  I don't care for that area generally as it's too loud and crowded for our liking, especially in December, but our agenda had us there.  Our expectations were high for this hotel and we expected a similar, excellent experience.  We almost got that.\n\nThe double queen room was wonderful high up on the 35th floor with a view over Madison Square Garden and the Statue of Liberty off in the distance.  It was a quick run out of Penn Station across the street to the \"back door\" of the hotel and its lobby.  The reception area is up a few floors and is quite loud and rowdy due to the bar that is right off the reception area (we checked in around 5 p.m. on a Friday).  Our room was ready and off we went.\n\nThe room was more spacious than expected.  The bathroom has frosted glass walls, which you will certainly want to pull the curtains for if you intend to sleep while anyone is in there.  The shower is waterfall and good quality water pressure.  Beds are comfortable and it was a quiet sleep, well away from elevators and other guest noise.\n\nWe ate at the Rockin Reilly's restaurant onsite.  I'd tried to book it via Open Table a few different times over the weekend, and it said it was fully booked but we were able to walk in and be seated for two dinners and breakfasts.  All meals were reasonably good and at NYC's usually inflated prices for the quality that it was.\n\nWe found the staff friendly and competent, but for the bellhop on check-out.  We left the hotel at 10:00 a.m. and made plans for him to have a car for us to go to LaGuardia at 2:30 pm.  He wrote our room number down and took our luggage for the day while we went to museums.  We returned at 2:25 and he had no recollection of us, our luggage or the car he was to get for us.  A bit of a scramble ensued and I think we ended up with someone else's car.  While minor and not fatal, it's that type of service mistake that ended our weekend.  And we know it would never have happened with the excellent bellhop we always have at the Renaissance 57!  I did bring this to the service manager's attention when he checked in with us after we'd returned home, and he said he'd bring this up to his staff as a training issue, which I think is fair.\n\nAll in all, a decent stay for a holiday weekend, but nothing to sway me from staying at the tried and true up on 57th next time.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I decided to stay in the city for the weekend before going up. I\u2019ve always wanted to do Christmas in New York, so I couldn\u2019t have planned a more perfect weekend to come. It was magical. \n\nBut if it had not been for the Renaissance Midtown, my visit wouldn\u2019t have been so delightful. I travel a lot and I\u2019m very picky about where I stay. Some of the things that are high on my list are contemporary furnishings (check), club lounge (check), hip bar or restaurant (check), bed made of clouds (check) and a rainfall shower (check). \n\nI debated going back to the Ren-Times Square, but since I had been there and done that (and it was great - see my review), I wanted to step it up. This hotel is really cool (as at met my expectations of the things I look for in a hotel) and was very \u201ctechy\u201d. I know NY gets a bad wrap on hotels being pricey with small rooms, but you get what you pay for depending on whether you are there for business or pleasure. You could come to Midtown for either. I found the location superb as I had quick access to all the places I wanted to go. And all of the clientele coming out of the hotel looked super savvy. This made me feel safe and comfortable. \n\nThe room was gorgeous, with an ultra comfortable bed, great WiFi, TV (I got to watch a little - channels I don\u2019t have abroad), the view was nice (which the staff recommended and picked for me)... and the shower was YAASSSSS! I could have just stood there forever! I really wish I could have stayed longer and spent more time in the lounge and gym. While most people travel think of hotels as just a place to sleep or pass through, to me it\u2019s a destination in and of itself. If you pick s great one, you really never have to leave. \n\nDavid and Nate truly have inspired the staff to collectively execute the vision of the hotel and brand. While not perfect, it\u2019s Excellence! Well done! ","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

I put a lot of time in effort into choosing a hotel when traveling and as a gold elite I look to book at a Marriott first when we travel. I cannot stay at their chosen hotel and use my points as I had planned for 2 of my 4 nights, So less than 3 weeks from my trip and a lot of back and forth emails and phone calls, I either pay more for another hotel or cancel our entire very anticipated trip.

All of this came in very handy and on the back of the recommendation we made reservations and I am pleased to say that they did not disappoint. The other purpose of making contact was I was wanting to have some tickets delivered to the hotel prior to our arrival and I wanted to make sure that this would not be a problem and that they would be kept safe. As before Ranie responded promptly and provided the necessary reassurance that the tickets would be kept safe and on arrival these were duly handed to me without any need to ask.\n\nThe hotel is situated a short walk from Penn Station, on arrival we were greeted by the Bell Hop who promptly took our bags and assisted us up to the 6th floor which is were the reception is based, from here check in was very smooth and efficient with minimal hassle which after a 12 hour journey is just what you need. As instructed we handed over our bag ticket and were then directed up to the 27th floor.\n\nWithin minutes of entering the room our bags were then delivered.\n\nThe room, what can I say, floor to ceiling glass windows with views out towards Times Square and the Chrysler building. This for me is definitely what made the room even more special. The room itself was well appointed and was of a modern design in keeping with the rest of the hotel, it was well decorated and very clean. The bed has to be one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in. Yes the bathroom has a frosted glass panel but there is a blind which can be used if you want and to be honest this is just one of the quirky features that the hotel has to offer.\n\nWhilst in the hotel we made use of both the hotels bar on the 6th floor as well as Rock & Reilly's which is the hotels bar and restaurant located on the 5th floor. the service in both of these as well as the food was very good and we have no complaints, all of the staff we encountered appeared to be happy and went above and beyond putting our needs first always.\n\nOn departure day, check out again was smooth and efficient and the Bell Hop (Martin Vega) took care of our bags for the day as well as organising a private car to take us back to the airport in style.\n\nOverall the only negative is that we had to leave, yes lots of people commented about the strange lift set up but as long as you request the lift and get in the correct one then you wont have any troubles.\n\nThanks again Renaissance New York Midtown for making our stay in New York even better.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is perfect, a 3 min walk from the lights of Times Square and many nearby attractions, on a quiet (ok quieter) street than the very busy one parallel to it. We opted for a skyline view room on the 30th floor and the view really did not disappoint - uninterrupted view of Chrysler building and Empire state with floor to ceiling windows. However, a few negative points. The hotel experience was was relatively detached and cold, much like the bare stone walls in the room. For example the lobby is on the 6th floor and they were not overly friendly. In fact we only interacted with hotel staff at check-in and check-out, which is fine for some people, but i felt the personal service was lacking a touch, and it was more like a furnished appartment we were going to. Secondly the elevators.....a disaster. There are 3 elevators on ground floor and they are not very big. With the bar on 6th floor, they are often full of drunk people going up and down, so not great if you are with families. By the 3rd day we were fed up of the elevators. The room itself was quite small but just about enough room. However there was very little storage space or even where to put luggages which we ended up putting on the floor in the corner. The bathroom was spacious but there was a very thin door meaning a lack of privacy, and also no toilet brushes.\n\nAll in all i would recommend this hotel primarily for its location and better suited for couples (without children) or for business.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Now I understand why the reviews vary so much. The Renaissance Midtown has a very specific vibe, in keeping with Renaissance's brand of originality at each location. I enjoyed being in a chic, high-energy atmosphere, but if I had wanted a tranquil getaway, I wouldn't have been happy here. The ceilings and some walls are bare concrete, and with my skyline view upgrade, I had fun pretending I lived in an industrial-style loft apartment. About the glass bathroom wall: the architect clearly designed this so that the wall lines up with the room's window; I was able to see the beautiful skyline view from the shower. If I hadn't been traveling alone, I could have pulled down the very stylish roller shade to create privacy. The rooms are clattery; you'll hear everything going on in the room next door, and you'll hear street noise. This is not unusual in Midtown. Bring earplugs and run the fan, and you won't hear the noise anymore. The common areas, elevators, and dining areas all have high-energy music piped in, and there are big-screen televisions in all of those areas. I didn't mind it, but I scheduled client meetings at a restaurant around the corner so that we could have a more sedate atmosphere. That said, I had brunch in the hotel restaurant, and the food was outstanding: fresh, delicious, inventive, but with sports bar atmosphere that was not a good fit for me. There are no drawers in the room; instead, you get a beautiful, very long shelf. The closet space was ample.

On entering my room there was a bottle of champagne, strawberries and macaroons, the staff were so welcoming.\nAs we had dinner plans for most of the time we were there we decided to use the  voucher for breakfast and I'm kind of glad we did...... my pancakes (when they arrived were lovely ) although falsely advertised, should have come with a fruit compote but was just fresh fruit but I could live with that ! \nMy husband ordered an American breakfast I'm sure this was brought out to another diner about 20 minutes earlier as when my husband got it it was cold, they assured I him they would prepare him another ....... 5 minutes later it reappeared !

Caught the train into Penn (its about a 10 minute walk if you want from Grand Central) and it was a few minutes stroll away. Its across 7th avenue from Macys and next to the herlad sq subway and Penn st as mentioned - a walk to central park is about 15 minutes. \n\nWhen I figured out where the lobby was (a sign mightn't be a bad idea?) I worked out the lifts and got to check in. Although I was early (2pm) I was checked in without any drama. I was given a room with 2 twins beds even though I pointed out I was alone and they could have shoved me somewhere smaller. \n\nThe room was great! 2 really comfy queen beds, lots of space, great bathroom and the view of 35th st which just oozed New York. Room is contemporary, no false ceiling so you are staring up and solid concrete which some may not like but I thought added to the place. Good TV, plenty of glasses etc for a refreshment and a mini fridge to use - everything you could ask for. One other huge plus it had for me was the USB charging points in the beside lights - too often I complain about having to charge the phone overnight in the far side of the room but not such issues here - loads of charging points (this may sound frivolous but a big plus for me)\n\nThe bathroom as mentioned was bright, roomy and plenty of towels but the toiletries deserve a special mention - some sort of minty shower gel which was surprisingly great :-)\n\nI had dinner in Rocky O'Reillys which was packed. Food was ok - nothing great and the lighting not great for reading the menus but the atmosphere here is hopping. Expensive and average quality wise but well worth a trip.  I also had breakfast here as I wanted to watch an early morning soccer match and they couldn't have been nicer. Breakfast was reasonable value but taste wise was superb.\n\nI requested late check out and was given a stay until 1 which was really appreciated. When I did check out I left he bags with the bell hop on the ground floor for the few hours I had left. He also organised a car service to take me to JFK (and helped me find my luggage key later when I dropped it!). Really great service here. \n\n5 stars for this place in my view. Service, quality, location, value - its got it all and really couldn't find any reason not to give it 5. Will definitely come back if the price is right on future trips.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

Close to Macy\u2019s, 3x Starbucks, the Manhattan Mall and the Empire State Building. It\u2019s v close to Penn station which had many of the subway lines coming in and out. \n\nCheck-in: this was a disaster for us. We arrived at 1.30pm having requested an early check in and went back numerous times after it was promised our room would be \u201c30 minutes\u201d, and \u201cbefore 4\u201d. We were exhausted by the time we got our room at 4.10pm. Luckily I am a Marriott Gold member and we went into the lounge for some refreshments while we waited. The team also stored our luggage so we had less to carry round. \n\nLifts: the lifts were quite self explanatory... we did experience one day of problems which caused delays. \n\nRoom: we had a twin room with two comfy queen beds. The room was well decorated and had a decent bathroom and wardrobe, safe, fridge etc. There was not much vacant floor space however to put your suitcase down! There were some niggles with the room such as the tap in the shower had been put on back to front so trying to turn to a rain shower squirted is with the hand held one. Additionally they had obviously put the sink taps on against usual users as the fixtures were v loose from being turned the wrong way frequently. I\u2019ve seen some comments about the frosted door, however this did not present us with any concerns during use. \n\nFood: we ate in rock & Reillys for lunch and breakfast. The food in general was good and I recommend the American breakfast and the burger. I don\u2019t recommend the mac & cheese - too creamy! \n\nWe also used the lounge for breakfast and drinks etc. They only serve food in the lounge during the week (not at weekends). The range of drinks available at all times was good. I\u2019d like them to also offer fruit in line with other lounges from Marriott. The breakfast was generally nice with a selection of hot, pastries, bagels, fruit and other bits and bobs. The fruit selection was disappointing though with the same fruit salad choice every day. The snacks served in the evening were also nice. They were generally meat, cheese, salad etc. You could had dinner in there most nights with the selection available. The only downside of the lounge was it\u2019s location, it was too visible, and there was not a door person like in the Marriott East Side. I felt that pretty much every time we used it there were people hovering to follow you in once the door was open, they didn\u2019t appear to have access themselves. \n\nWe also tried the room service which was disappointing. One night we were just too tired to move, however the choice was too fussy for my son and I didn\u2019t find that anything jumped out at me as being exactly what I wanted to eat.\n\nStaff: bell staff were super friendly and helpful... great! The front desk staff were friendly but often sounded unsure or a bit vague. We did have a few problems with housekeeping who only did a partial clean two of the three days without removing plates, cups, etc. ","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

You do not encounter reception \/ concierge \/ check in desk unless you specifically go to the 6th floor. All the risk of client service falls on the bell desk. These guys are super!!

As an example one evening we wanted a taxi... I asked Richard where the best place to catch one was....he went out and disappeared around the corner...next thing he has got a taxi for us and told the driver where to go. Justin new the quickest way to get to anywhere and organised our car back to the airport with every detail sorted.

Right by office, right next to Penn Station, right next to Macy's,  You can also enter from 35th or 34th which is big plus especially on our last day there when it non-stopped rain.\n- Rock-n-Reilly's is a great bar and restaurant option attached to the hotel\n- Planet Fitness is the workout facility, we used it several times and beats your normal hotel gym by leaps and bounds.\n- Rooms - Clean and modern and for us a wonderful balcony skyline view facing South and East.\n\nCons:\n- Elevator - As most have mentioned, the elevator situations is a little strange but once you understand how the system works, it's a no brainer.

My second stay at this one.  Great location in the city.  Close to Penn Station & MSG (3 mins walk) and easy access to subway.  There's a Starbucks on corner outside hotel.\n\nYou arrive on ground floor (bellman on ground level), go up to 6th floor for check in.  \n\nVery friendly welcome on arrival.  Nice trendy lobby area with large bar off to the left - massive windows, lots of casual comfy seating.  Reception was buzzing with life.  Fun place to hang out.  The Marriott Lounge for members is also just off reception and one of the nicest I can remember for atmosphere and decor.  It had the usual selection of drinks, (plus some bottled waters you don't see in all Marriott Lounges) and a good nibble selection on display - enjoyed the samosas.  Again, a very comfy area to sit and relax, with big windows, so plenty of daylight.  Breakfast buffet for members in that room was very good too.  (We stayed on a mid week night - may be different offerings at the weekend).\n\nWe booked a midtown standard King room.  Decent size, big floor to ceiling windows.  Roller blind for privacy and second blind for blackout.  Comfy bed, clean white bedding.  Big chair to sit in with small table so you can look out at the view, plus desk and swivel chair and a long foot stool.  We had a great view from only the 15th floor over to MSG looking downtown.  Imagine higher up would be even nicer.  Room had a few items that were there for interest as a nice touch (model ceramic sewing machine and button). Aircon was efficient and not noisy - an added bonus!\n\nWardrobe with light, ironing board, full length mirror, fridge and 'pull out drawer' safe.  Not much room to unpack if you have lots of clothes for a weeks trip (no chest of drawers), but fine for an overnighter or long weekend.  Bathroom a good size.  Clean, white and bright with Aveda amenities (shower gel\/handwash, shampoo, conditioner) and rain shower.  Shower, with sliding frosted door, was really big.  The glass wall from bathroom to the bedroom is frosted but there is a pull down blind for privacy - in case your sharing the room with a friend!  Plenty of room to store stuff in the bathroom by the sink and underneath.\n\nLiked the changing projections on the walls in the foyer and lobby.  Offered great flexibility for changing the atmosphere, rather than the standard framed pictures.  I liked the way the elevators open out onto each floor and you see straight into that level.  So we saw the restaurant on 5th (Irish Pub) and also the Gym (on 2nd?).  It looked massive with lots of equipment.\n\nElevators are a bit weird until you get used to them.  You have to pay attention or you miss the screen saying which elevator to go up in and the doors shut really fast.   But you do need a key to go beyond the 6th floor - good for security if a lone traveller.\n\nOnly thing I didn't like - the exposed cement ceiling in the bedroom. I didn't mind in the corridors and other communal areas, but would have preferred, in the bedroom for it to have been sealed off with a shiny finish or maybe a trendy blueprint design on it, rather than just exposed grey concrete. Purely personal observation.  Overall I liked the room.  Would definitely stay again.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

While there is lots of potential here, and lots to like about the property, a few drawbacks lowered my opinon of this hotel. \n\nFirst, the hotel is new, and the design is modern yet comfortable. Everywhere from the lobby, to the lobby bar to the expansive outdoor bar was spacious, well designed and had a nice look and feel to it.\n\nWhen I entered my room (#1506), I was impressed by the size, the spacious bathroom and the well-thought out design. There was ample lighting in the room, there were plugs\/USB ports bedside. The bathroom had a nice rainshower and glass enclosed shower. \n\nUnfortunately, when I first arrived in the room, there was a very large clump of blond hair in the shower. I'm not sure how housekeeping could have missed this, but it immediately made me wonder what else was overlooked during cleaning.\n\nThe next morning I ordered room service for breakfast. I left the tray in my room and while the room was cleaned, the tray was not removed--for 2 days. Again, this is just lazy and I'm not even sure how it was overlooked.\n\nOn Thursday morning, I was extremely upset to be awoken by VERY loud drilling right above me. I understand that hotels must take on projects throughout the day to keep the property functioning and looking great. However, at no time should very loud and disruptive projects be started at 7:30am. \n\nI wanted to like this hotel, and there are several great things to like, but ultimately questionable cleanliness would keep me from returning.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

As soon as I find one that I think will stick, it's on to the next for a variety of reasons. That said, I really do hope to be returning to the Renaissance Midtown on all of my frequent business trips to NYC. \n\nFirst of all, the location, with an entrance directly across the street from the northerly entrance\/exit of Penn Station is difficult to beat. Despite this central location, the hotel is quiet. I, for one, am a fan of the lobby being up on the 6th floor as I think it creates necessary separation from the hustle and bustle of the street. \n\nI arrived fairly early with a numbers of my colleagues as we had just taken the train in from Boston. All of us have some level of elite status with Marriott and were given rooms ahead of check-in time. Nate, the front desk supervisor, was friendly and put me in a really nice upgraded city view room. Marta, another front desk agent, was also very warm and welcoming. \n\nAs a new hotel, it is in great shape. Beyond being in great shape, it has a lot of touches I have not seen before in a Marriott. All of the walls on the first floor have digital projections that change through the course of the day. Many of the interior walls, both hallways and in the rooms, have exposed concrete. While small (although fine by NYC standards), I found the room to be laid out very well and had some unique touches to it (such as an old fashioned sewing machine for decoration). Other than the normal NYC street noise, the room was quiet and clean. It offered me a great night sleep both nights. \n\nThe Club Lounge was definitely a highlight. I've been in countless lounges and the beverage selection in here was definitely in the top two or three of those I have seen. Very few lounges offer Perrier and San Pellegrino in addition to the normal selections.\n\nAs others have said, the hotel has Rock & Reilly inside, I really enjoyed the food for lunch and thought the service was solid. \n\nI also was glad to take advantage of the Planet Fitness that is on the lower levels of the hotel building. While crowded, I had no problem using the equipment I wanted to. I know a management response previously addressed the lack of water and towel service so I do hope that gets figured out as my only frustration was having to go back to the hotel to get some water to avoid paying for it at PF. Also, note, don't plan on leaving your ID in the room as they require it for access.\n\nI'm looking forward to my return stay in less than 3 weeks!","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We couldn't possibly be any more pleased with our stay.   From the second we entered the hotel, we were greeted by smiling, eager to please staff.  Our room was very nice, with a super city view.  It was not huge, but I don't expect a NYC room to be huge unless I spring for a suite, and we didn't.  It had plenty of room for my husband and I (and quite honestly, we weren't there to spend time in our room!)   The room was SUPER clean, modern, and everything was new and worked well (including the iron, hair dryer, and other small appliances). The rain showerhead was fantastic. \n\nOur room was made up promptly each day, and we received extra towels, as requested. \n\nWe had a nice meal in the hotel restaurant--not a gourmet meal, but very good, served promptly, and at a reasonable NYC cost. \n\nThe location of the hotel is fantastic.  We had tickets to see Eric Clapton at Madison Square Garden for two concerts. It was less than a 5-minute walk, so no hassle with getting a cab or train after the show.   It's an easy walk to Times Square and MoMA. We took a cab to Central Park and then visited the Guggenheim and Museum of Natural History and actually walked back to the hotel, stopping to eat around Times Square on our way back.  It was a good stretch of the legs, but do-able for two out of shape folks who are not used to walking very much.  We also took a short cab ride to Greenwich Village.  The hotel is located in midtown, so it's not far to anything.  Much better than staying on one side of town and having to take a long cab ride to get anywhere.  \n\nThere is a fabulous place right across from the main entrance to the hotel that came in second place for the best bagels in NYC, and I can't believe they didn't come in first! The bagels and croissants were excellent. You can get coffee, sandwiches, etc. for breakfast and lunch.  The line may look long, but don't let that fool you--they move everyone through quickly.  \n\nInstead of flying in and having to pay a huge cab fare to get into the city from the airport, we took the Amtrak train into Penn Station. We came out onto 34th Street, about a block from the hotel!  No need for cabs, again. \n\nI can honestly say that this was one of the most relaxing trips we've had, and a lot of it was due to the location of the hotel, the absolutely fantastic and attentive staff, and the hotel amenities.  We loved it and will definitely be back.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying their stay here, but then you just can't please some people!  We've stayed at the Ritz and other \"five star\" hotels and have had crappy service, old rooms, and lousy locations in town.  This place might not be five-star, but it beats all the five-star places we've stayed in recently! We'll be staying here every time we're in town and will recommend it to all our friends!","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When my wife said it was our 20th anniversary he looked at us and said, \"Well, maybe you'll find something in your room when you return this evening.\"  Nothing was ever left, which really disappointed my wife.\n\nWe went down to have a drink at the hotel bar, but when my wife asked for a certain drink the waitress said the bartenders do not like to stray from the menu.  She did not ask for anything they did not have on hand.  The next night we went right to the bar and they had no problem making her drink.\n\nWhen we checked out they said it would take about 30 minutes to get our car.  We received a call that it was out front an hour later, but it was not.  They said to contact the bellhop, but he was too busy talking to a girl.  When I finally asked for assistance he just laughed and told me it's coming.  Another 45 minutes passed before it arrived.\n\nI am a Platinum Marriott member and have never had a bad experience at their hotels (and) I very rarely leave negative reviews, but seeing my wife's disappointment annoyed me.\n\nOn the plus side, Daniel the hotel concierge was very friendly and genuinely seemed to want to help, but I would think twice about staying at this location.\n\nA 20-year anniversary is a special occasion and should be treated accordingly.

Upon early check-in, Marta was able to get us a room right away so we could rest for a few hours after our red-eye flight and we were upgraded to an amazing skyline view room. We chose this hotel since it was one of the few that had two queen bed rooms and it was well located. The room was indeed a very good size for our family of four and the location was very ideal for sightseeing (close to many subway lines and walkable to many main attractions). While the room had a closet, there were no drawers. Housekeeping was excellent and even left kind notes welcoming us. As this is a relatively new hotel, beds were comfortable and the shower had good water pressure. The hotel had a Club Lounge which offered weekday breakfast, evening snacks from Sun-Thurs, and a refrigerator filled with beverages any time of the day. On weekends, the hotels gave us vouchers for the breakfast buffet at Rock and Reilly's which was very good and ended at 11am. I wished the weekday breakfast at the lounge also extended to 11am vs. ending at 9am.  The modern elevators did enhance security, but they were a bit challenging to catch some times.

The hotel is modern, clean and the service is very good.  However, the neighborhood makes it a bit difficult.  Although very well located, right next to Macy's, MSG and Penn Station, when you walk out of the hotel the streets are dirty and extremely crowded.  I get the feeling that over time this neighborhood will get better, but you should be warned.\n\nSome of the other highlights, the lobby is very well done with a nice bar that is quiet compared to the sports bar one floor below, which is also great but can be very crowded.  The lounge is also very nice, with a good breakfast and snacks at cocktail hour.  The rooms are comfortable but a bit small, which is not at all unusual in NY.  The showers are excellent with rain heads.  The only real issue I have with the hotel is that the elevators are a bit slow, which again is not unusual in NY.\n\nOverall, it is my favorite hotel when I am in NY.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Our hostess, Ariel, was fantastic, and sent up a bottle of sparkling wine as a treat. \n\nOur room was on the 24th floor.  Even though our Marriott room profile states away from elevators, this room was right next to it, and we didn't mind since the walls are concrete and never heard noise.\n\nThe safe in the room was inoperable, and for who knows how long.  The room view on the 24th floor was very nice, and mesmerizing.  The room size is bigger than most NYC hotels, and fairly efficient.  I would have liked to have seen a luggage rack.  The iron had black gunk that came off on our clothes when used.  The carpet either needs replaced or cleaned, as it was a bit worn.  The seam between the carpet and hard wood had debris and a penny wedged in it.  The box spring cover on the right side of the bed was stained.\n\nThe bathroom was very clean.  No stray hairs or funky mold. \n\nSome days we got the right amount of towels, and other days not so.  Some days we got a shower floor towel, other days not.  This is really important to have since the floor can be slippery.\n\nThe hotel pricing is based off of need, but varies so much.  I wish we were told that there was a back door that opens to the Penn Station street, rather than walking around the hotel every day.  Funny we found about this as we checked out with our luggage.\n\nThe hotel smells nice, but not overwhelming.\n\nMajor CON:  no coffee in the Club Lounge!  Even lower priced Marriott chain hotels have coffee and hot water out in the lobby most hours of the day.  Here, not so.  This is very odd.\n\nWe ordered room service two nights, which consisted of the Chinese Salad each time.  It was just the right amount of food, if you're looking for something light, perhaps after having a big lunch.\n\nOverall the room was great to come back to after spending all day out and about the city.

Beds were very very comfy, and showers etc excellent, as was the coffee pod machine.

Tony the bar manager realized we were 'new faces' and made a beeline to welcome us and sent over some drinks when he knew it was our wedding anniversary. Bar food looked wonderful, the buffet breakfast was good but not exceptional. My only negative (and its a very small one) would be at busy times you can wait a few minutes extra for a lift but given the surroundings, this was not really any hassle.

Hallways could be cleaner.\n\nWe had an interesting two night stay at the Renaissance New York Midtown Hotel. I called a few days ahead to get an early check-in, but when I arrived at 2:30, there was nothing available and we had to wait until the regular check-in at 4. I understand the early check-in is not guaranteed,  but we were still disappointed. The front desk gave us a drink\/appetizer voucher while we waited so that was nice. He also said we would be upgraded to a city view. \n\nAt 4 pm, I went back to the check-in desk and they said the city view room was not ready yet but a standard was. We took the standard because we needed to get going. When we went the standard room there was crumbs on the ottoman and a booger on the bedspread. I went back downstairs to ask for a new room and they said we could get a city room but at an additional cost. I said the first guy said he was already upgrading us, but didn\u2019t say anything about an additional cost. I agreed to pay extra because as I said we needed to get going. Once we got up to this room, we were not happy that it was the first room off of the elevator and not told about that. We did not want a room that was at risk of being loud, especially one that I was paying an expected upgrade for.  So I went back downstairs and they there was a standard room that we could have. When we got to this room there was hair and crumbs on the side of box spring. It was gross. I called the front desk and the manager came up and said there was a city room view that we could stay in at no additional charge. She would take us up there to make sure the room is good. When we got up there we noticed a white stain on the side of the mattress and the nightstands were also not completely clean. At this point, we were almost running late so the manager, who was very, very nice agreed to do a deep clean while we were out. That was fine because as I said we needed to get going. After coming back that night, the room was great; nice and clean and nice note and treat was left for us. As I said, the manager, was very nice and she made sure things were right.\n\nOn to the next day. We went out for the day and when we came back to the hotel we noticed our vehicle parked in the valet. We were shocked to say the least!! We didn\u2019t call for it and have been out for the day. I went right to the valet and no one there knew who called or why our vehicle was there. This was very sketchy and quite disconcerting. Our vehicle should not be just sitting in the valet, especially without an explanation. Furthermore, someone should have called us to tell us that our car was sitting there if they brought it around and we never showed. \n\nWe checked out the next day. I said there were definitely some positives and negatives to staying here.

Many of them are extraordinary\u2026 And this hotel is among that group.\nNew York is a tough market\u2026 Very savvy guests, very difficult labor market, very high prices.  It seems that this property overcomes those difficulties in a very special way. I credit my extraordinary stay to management here. They have been able to create a culture of success beginning with the Bellman, to security, to the front desk, and on to housekeeping.  I am not speaking of the patronizing \"hello\" that one receives in most hotels. I am speaking of sincerely happy, content, and hospitable staff. Kudos to the GM and AGM for inspiring their staff to make guests feel welcome.  (it was July and a little bit warm in my room. David the housekeeping director, took it upon himself to go out and to purchase a fan for my comfort.)\nThis beautifully styled and new property in Chelsea is a most welcome improvement to the hotel scene.  A streamlined front desk process, a beautiful and chic bar area, elevators with state of the art technology. Rooms are new and beautifully appointed with great technology in them. Apple TVs allow you to sync your mobile devices and stream video on demand.\nThe executive lounge is perfectly acceptable. I've read the reviews about the lounge and must disagree. The food is bountiful and despite not serving alcohol, there is a beautiful bar not more than 20 steps away from the lounge.  I did not find it inconvenient to buy a glass of wine and bring it into the lounge.\nMost likely the bigger issue with the lounge is the lack of exclusivity. It would seem as though there is unlimited access to all levels of the Marriott program. The net result is a feeding frenzy at 5:30 PM.\nPersonally, when in the Big Apple, the greatest city in the world for food, I prefer to explore the culinary seen around town.\nAll in all, I cannot wait to return to this property.

We had two rooms booked and both rooms had worn carpets and some of the furniture and walls had not worn well either. The lounge, while nice, offered some of the worst breakfast food I've had in years. It reminded me of when I started my career and stayed at the 3 star hotels I could afford. I wouldn't say don't visit this place but with the amount of options nearby I'd be weary of the prices. For example, one block away is another Marriott property, Fairfield Inn, and it offers a rooftop terrace and the rooms are clean and tidy.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Here's why:\n\nTHE STAFF - 5 stars: About a week before we arrived, Justin, director of guest services, personally contacted me to ask if we had any special requests or if we were celebrating any special occasions. My son was actually turning 4 during our stay, and the day following our arrival one of the lead navigators, Daniel, delivered balloons and a few Hot Wheels to our room, wishing our son a happy birthday on behalf of the staff. My son loved it! I was already impressed with the pre-arrival communication (we travel quite a bit, but this was a first), but the whole staff really went the extra mile to make our entire stay top-notch. I also highly recommend using the hotel's car service - Antonio's. The Uber driver that was supposed to be taking us back to LGA started giving us the runaround when we called to see where he was, and within 5 minutes, Antonio's 12-passenger Mercedes van was ready to go, and cost us roughly the same as what we would have paid the Uber driver (+\/- $5). The bellmen were also extremely helpful with getting our bags, stroller, etc. situated. Everyone was very polite and accommodating. \n\nTHE ROOM\/HOTEL - 5 stars: The room was spacious, modern, comfortable, clean and offered amazing views. Going into this trip, my checklist included finding a room that had 2 QUEEN beds (not doubles, as most NYC hotels have), about 350 sq. ft., large windows and unobstructed, skyline views. This hotel checked every box, on top of being affordable. On a previous trip to NYC, we decided to be cheap and stay at Hotel Pennsylvania, and it was a huge mistake. Trust me, spend the extra $100 or so per night and stay here. You will not be disappointed. I also recommend booking the hotel through Marriott's website and signing up for the free rewards program. You'll get free WiFi and cancellation up to a couple days before arrival, and if the price drops, you can rebook the lower rate and cancel the previous reservation. I made sure to monitor the rates and shaved off about $400 from the time I originally booked to about a week before our trip. The hotel is also ideally located and has a beautiful garden-like, open-air restaurant (retractable roof). Great all-around. \n\nAs previously mentioned, I can't say enough good things about this hotel - from the building itself to the room, location and employees, this place is truly one of the best. Please send our warm regards to the staff.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It took me forever to earn enough points so this was a huge treat (and Marriott does great job)!  I have stayed at Courtyard a few blocks away so was familiar w\/ this part of town - not the prettiest but location is hard to beat to get up and downtown.  W 35th where hotel is located is one way and actually a somewhat quiet street.  \n\nWe had early flight so dropped bags w\/ bellman (free but do tip them) at 10 am and headed out w\/ promise from front desk to call when room ready.  They did, in fact, call when room was ready later that afternoon.  \n\nThe room was very comfortable and quiet.  I asked for room w\/ bathtub as I read they were most private and it worked out fine.  I understand they're installing blinds in bathrooms so privacy issue should be resolved.  The room had everything we needed including bathrobes and good-sized refrigerator.   The view was fine - nothing spectacular but perfectly fine.  Two small complaints were the black-out blinds did not work properly and the Smart TV did not allow us to watch movies on Netflix using iphones - tech said there was a glitch w\/ Apple products.   \n\nMy son enjoyed working out at attached Planet Fitness.  I had a drink at beautiful indoor\/outdoor bar\/restaurant.  It was quiet since it was Memorial Day weekend and locals were not around.  The lobby is also beautiful w\/ a little bar area and loads of seating. \n\nYou're two block over from Penn Station\/MSG and Macy's.  Again, this is not my favorite neighborhood but we felt safe walking home from late dinners.  We easily walked back from dinner at Chelsea Market and from fav Mex restaurant at W 54th & 9th.   There's a super popular bagel place across the street - you'll wait in line but once you order, they're very efficient and bagels quite good.  I really like Andrew's Coffee Shop a block over on Broadway for good basic NYC breakfast (again, expect to wait a few minutes but food will arrive very fast).  We love The Smith for brunch (make reservation-15 min walk to NoMad location).  It was also an easy walk to Broadway shows from here.  \n\nI was pleased to see security stationed ground level most of the time because you don't need key to access elevators.  \n\nI reserved house SUV to get us to JFK for early flight - $75 flat rate inclusive of tip. Taxis are $52 flat rate w\/out tip to JFK.  Penn Station is also right there to take subway.  \n\nThis is a beautiful, new hotel in a central location so can't imagine you'll be unhappy staying here.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It is quite close to many attractions in Midtown such as Macy's, Madison Square Garden, and the Empire State Building.  Major transportation at Penn Station and 34th street train lines are also near.  You'll have to be located on the upper floors to get views of the Chrysler Building.\n\nThe lobby is on the 6th floor from the lobby and you have to choose it on the display before you enter the elevators as there are no buttons within each elevator.  The restaurant is on the 5th floor.  If you are able to get into the concierge, it is 24 hours with ample supply of soft drinks, boxed water, yogurt, along with 2 mac computers for internet usage.  The staff was accommodating as our toilet got clogged and our mini fridge appeared to be turned off (it is energy efficient so the display does not always remain on).

Booked this hotel for my 50th birthday week in NYC and it certainly didn't disappoint.  My husband emailed ahead and some lovely cupcakes were delivered to our room which was a beautiful touch.  Not expected but hugely appreciated especially as the first 10 hours of my birthday were spent travelling!  A big thank you to Daniel for that.\n\nWhere to start, on entering the hotel we received a fantastic welcome from the bell boys who have a desk on the ground floor - and this was consistent throughout our stay, always smiling always helpful and an absolute asset to this hotel chain - they were on hand to navigate you to the elevators and show you how they work.\n\nIf you get a few minutes spare, have a play on the interactive concierge at the end of the lift corridor - really cool!  When you walk along the wall facing the lift sometimes if you run your hand along it the pattern moves too - release the inner geek!\n\nLobby is on the 6th floor and yet another smiley welcome from the team there.  Who were fantastically helpful, informative.  Really loved the 'Attitude is Everything' artwork in reception and that ethos is certainly in play at this establishment. \n\nIn fact, whenever you came into contact with hotel staff there was always a smile, hello and someone asking how your day was going.  So refreshing.\n\nRoom - we did ask if we could exchange our room but only as it was a special occasion and I really wanted to have a bit of a view.  They were so accommodating and I know they were extremely busy which made it really appreciated by us.  We were given the same level room but on a higher floor and opposite side of the hotel.  Heaven, I had a view of the Chrysler building morning, noon and night, my favourite - loved it.  \n\nThe room itself was spotlessly clean throughout our stay, towels were amazingly soft with lots of essential extras, which are not always there in other hotels, like free wi-fi, fridge and nice amenities.  The bed linen was high end and the bed and pillows were to die for and we slept like babies for the 5 nights we were there.\n\nWe were there when it was really hot so the air con was an absolute gift. Perfect.  The safe in the room was more like a drawer and a more practical square shape which was far bigger than the average hotel safe and big enough to hold all our valuables.\n\nThere is a bar\/restaurant on the 5th floor which always seemed really popular and busy - we popped in briefly and it seemed to have a really good feel about the place but it was so busy seats were at a premium - never seen a hotel bar looking so lively which, if I am honest, is indicative of the buzz about the hotel.\n\nLocation wise, you couldn't ask for better.  Easy travel links with Penn Station being just around the corner, or block, and if its your first time in NYC it has a plethora of the big attractions in walking distance which are so easy to navigate to.\n\nMacy's, Levi's, Victoria Secret and all the major stores within a five minute stroll and, what seemed like, a Duane Reed on every corner!  A lovely seating area at Herald Square behind Macy's which continues for a block or two which is great to sit down, have a coffee and watch the world go by.\n\nThe madness that is Times Square lies only 10 minutes walk in one direction whilst the relative peace and quiet of the Flat Iron lies just minutes in the opposite, so something for everyone!  Empire State Building again 10 minutes max. and not forgetting MSG which is seconds away! \n\nPlenty of places for cheap eats and snacks nearby, a couple of doors down there is a 2bros Pizza - 2 slices and a can of soda $2.99, including taxes a real bargain!  Al's deli around the corner does excellent food around the clock and always cooked from fresh, very reasonably priced and the breakfasts and lamb kebab come highly recommended, if you are eating in sit upstairs as it is nicer, quieter and easier to do a spot of people watching!\n\nAll in all, I had a fantastic 50th birthday trip and this hotel played a major part in that.  So thank you!  \n\nOnce you have stayed here there will be no going back to anywhere else in Manhattan.  We will be back in the Spring, see you then!","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This was a combined work and leisure trip...I chose this hotel based on the online reviews and that its a newer property in NY as Ive stayed in many others in the Marriott family over the years.  As a Marriott loyalist, and a fan of their newer brands of boutique type hotels, like this Ren, the Autograph Collection, Edition, etc.., I hoped this would be a great place to stay and experience the city. \nI was not disappointed!  Before I even arrived, I emailed the Guest Svc Manager and he helped me with some special requests to make our stay more memorable. \nI upgraded our stay to a suite w\/ a balcony...if you want to see NYC like you've never seen it before with views of the river, skyline and surrounding areas, this is your ticket!  The room itself was beautifully and tastefully appointed- I'd say on the artsy side, but not overdone or gaudy.  We ate dinner on the spacious patio and enjoyed taking in the views of the city from the floor to ceiling glass all around the room.  \n\nThe room had all the touches you'd expect in a high end hotel...mini fridge, luxury soaps, fluffy towels, very nice bed and linens, and of course being a suite it had a nice couch and lounge chair.  The living area TV also had its own surround sound and BluRay player, but heck who's gonna sit around watching BluRays in NYC?  But in case you want to, its there!  Having an extra 1\/2 bath was also convenient and I'd imagine if we'd have our kids with us, it would come in very handy.  The couch I believe also had a pull out bed, so I think it could sleep 4 for sure.\n\nThe public spaces in the hotel are equally beautiful...they do have an Exec Lounge but it was not serving food or snacks on the weekends, so keep that in mind if that's important to your stay.  We usually like the access to the lounge and we certainly got water and drinks, but it would be nice if they kept it open with all the services over the weekend as well...maybe as they get up to speed and get more requests for this, the management will consider doing this on weekends.  In lieu of the lounge food, the hotel gave me vouchers for breakfast at the Irish Pub which is in the hotel.  I was skeptical b\/c over my 25 years of travel, getting a voucher for a bar in the hotel to eat breakfast has led me to some nasty buffets and cold eggs, but not so in this case.  Like the upper floors and lobby, the pub was nicely appointed, had a great breakfast spread and you could order off the menu as well.  My wife had the avocado toast with eggs and it was very tasty!  The special thing about the pub that made it fun for us was that it has a retractable roof that they open when the weather is good..since it was June we got to have breakfast al fresco...not something you get to do often in NYC, unless you find a bench in the park!  We like to hit the gym when we're on the road and there is a full service Planet Fitness attached to the hotel, included at no extra cost, and easily accessible and fully stocked to get in a light workout or pump some serious iron.  \n\nFinally, the service, from my initial contact with the manager, to the front desk staff who checked me in, to the friendly and helpful bellmen out front, was all impeccable.  I'll add that the tone wasn't stuffy or contrived, but they seemed genuinely concerned and wanted to help make our stay memorable.  I've stayed in plenty of hotels that had so-so facilities , but the staff more than made up for that in service.  In this hotel, my experience is that you'll get a beautiful hotel and public areas along with exceptional, guest focused service that is worthy of the Marriott moniker.

Loved this hotel.  Two blocks from Madison Square Gardens and down the street from Empire State.  Euro sleek rooms, great views, very comfortable beds, awesome shower and bathroom.  Common areas very well done.  Ate at Rock and Reilly's.  Amazing space, with indoor and outdoor seating.  Place is packed.  Do not go without dinner rez.  Consistent with other reviews, yes, very noisy.  No way around it.  Great, friendly staff.  Hip, cool, tasty.  Went back later in the evening after a concert for a drink and it was sane and enjoyable.  Bar off lobby works well too.  We will go back to this hotel for sure.  We used points but $189 a night in New York is excellent.  Especially right next to Penn Station train.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Everyone raved about the hotel, and I personally experienced the most outstanding hospitality.\n\nROOMS. Gorgeous rooms with terrific views of the city. Rooms are in perfect condition and extremely clean, although small square footage (not unusual for NYC). Note that bathrooms have frosted panels between showers and beds -- great for a romantic couple, but intimate for friends!\n\nHOSPITALITY. Justine and Ranie were both incredibly helpful to me. Justine helped me to pay for all my wedding party's rooms in advance of the wedding weekend, even though the accounting process took about 20 minutes, but her attention to detail was great! She made a point of saying hi to me when everyone checked in and was super helpful. My husband and I checked into a regular king for our wedding night, but when Ranie found out about it, she gave us a free upgrade to one of the luxury suites on the very top floor! She was overly hospitable to us as newlyweds -- we felt like we were treated like royalty. The rest of the staff was great too -- they brought up a stool from the bar for our makeup artist to use in the getting-ready suite and even retrieved a dress I left behind when I changed rooms.\n\nROCK N REILLYS. Very spacious restaurant was great for the morning-after brunch my in-laws hosted for about 20 of their family. Didn't have the food, but they were flexible and easy to work with in coordinating the event.\n\nCOORDINATING A BLOCK. My only complaint was working with Mashariki in the sales department to coordinate the block. She often did not return my e-mails and it was hard to get updates on how full the block was. But I imagine most guests are not working with the sales department, so this is probably irrelevant for most.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

She recognized my platinum-elite status with Marriott and brough out a wheelchair I had previously rented through another company for my mom.The food at their restaurant was excellent and the staff very friendly and would go out of their way to please. The lounge breakfast however was a little disappointing as there were very few items to choose from. \nThe breakfast at the restaurant though was very good with many choices. I had connecting rooms and the corner views of the city are wonderful.  The rooms are roomy with elegant, modern marble bathrooms. The best feature for us was the proximity to Macy's.

Probably not the thread count of the sheets or the size of the TV, although these tings matter. What really counts is the people, because they make everything work. Marriott's Renaissance Midtown, on 35th between 7th and 8th (just two blocks from Penn Station) has great staff members. Yes, the higher floors have knockout views of the Manhattan skyline, yes, the rooms have a cool, edgy vibe, yes the elevators are fun. But when something slips, or when you need advice or assistance, it is the people who matter. We had two minor things go wrong, one a minor misunderstanding and the other something not directly the hotel's responsibility. In both cases, the desk staff's attitude seemed to be \"let me do something to make this situation better--I may not fix it, but I can ease your distress.\" Part of the issue was power: the management trusts the desk staff to take initiative. Because no senior manager can be at the front desk or on the phone or in the lobby all the time. But hiring good, caring staff members, and giving them reasonable authority, extends management to the individual guest.\n\nGood people make a good hotel, and the staff at Renaissance Midtown have made this one stand out.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff were extremely professional, friendly and helpful which always makes the experience so much more pleasant. There are 4 lifts to get you to your floor so there is never a long wait so you can get from room to street level quickly and without hassle. We were on the 19th floor which didn't feel too high for my partner and I who are both a bit iffy about heights! Room was very stylishly and modernly decorated and felt spacious. I loved the white marble shower room and liked the frosted glass partition, although when it came to using toilet you did feel a little exposed although you couldn't actually be seen! The robe in the closet could have been a nice terry towelling one as when I went to use it after I'd come out of the shower I discovered it felt quite synthetic and bobbly like it had been used and washed many times. All other extras in the room were good though like the coffee and tea (a filter coffee machine is provided), the hairdryer was decent and the toiletries were Aveda. \n\nThe bar area in the hotel is very nice and trendy feeling and gets quite busy at times (probably at the weekend) so there is a good atmosphere on a Saturday night. Decor throughout the hotel is of a really high standard and makes you feel like you're in a really top notch hotel. We ate in the restaurant one night but there was too much salt in my main (pasta dish with mushrooms and truffle shavings) so wasn't very impressed with this. My partner wasn't bowled over by his either.\n\nAnother word of warning is the bottles of water sold at the bar are extortionate! There is a small newsagent just two or three doors along so get from there.\n\nHotel is fantastically central, so for sightseeing and shopping this is an excellent hotel to be based. Macy's and Victoria's Secret are around the corner as is the Empire State Building. Times Square only a couple of streets away. There's a tube station at the end of the same street. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC. I think there are probably larger grander hotels in the city but I liked this smaller more understated hotel.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's also right next to Penn Station so if you're flying into or out of Newark the trip is just so much easier.  \n\nOne thing to note though is that we were in a King room and the partition separating the bathroom from the room itself was glass.  I'm not sure if this is the case for all King rooms, but it definitely would have been a little awkward if I wasn't sharing a room with my husband.  \n\nI would definitely stay here again in the future and would recommend it to others without any hesitation.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We arrived early at around 8am and room was not ready. While waiting for the room, we were offered coffee and water. We did not wait long and around an hour and a half later, our room was ready. \n\nOur room was located in the higher floors (26th). The city view was lovely. The room itself is very decently sized for New York. There are USB ports in every strategic corner of the room. As most have written, the bathroom may not be the best for non-couples but we were fine with it. The water pressure was good and the had a large sink area for two to get ready in. One gripe we had in US were air conditioning were not the best in most hotels. However, the air conditioning here was good and does actually cool the room. As New York is a very noisy city, you should expect the room not to be silent like a library. We weren't bothered by the noise at all. \n\nHousekeeping generally did a good job in maintaining the room during our stay. No bed bugs during our stay. \n\nWifi is fast and reliable. \n\nBeing a Marriott Gold member, we had access to the lounge for breakfast and standard drinks throughout the day. The breakfast was very good considering it's part of the Gold privilege. Bagel, croissant and bread were fresh. The 'cooked' dishes does vary such as chicken and waffes. The selection of non-alcholic drinks were great - coke, diet coke, sparkling water, water, chocolate milk etc. You can even have Chobani yogurt as a snack or for supper. Coffee is just your standard black coffee. They even have soy milk for your coffee. The only feedback we had was to label the different milks at breakfast.\n\nOn weekends, breakfast is served in the restaurant below with plenty of varieties again. \n\nAlthough we had little interactions, service from the staff at check in and check out were great. Always genuinely helpful. Check out was guaranteed at 4pm for Gold members and we had to remind the reception of this. \n\nLocation-wise, very good in Midtown and walkable to most places like Times Square, High Line as well to the variety of subway stations. All the big names such as Starbucks, McDonalds, Shake Shack, Macy, Madison Square Garden, Walgreen (supermarket\/convenience\/pharmacy) are very close to the hotel.\n\nIf we come back to NY, we will definitely consider this hotel again!","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The lobby and bar area was my favourite part as it had a buzzing yet relaxed vibe, and the bar food menu was way better than most other hotels i've been to (make sure to order the garlic fries - they are honestly amazing!)\n\nThe staff are lovely and helpful.  In particular, Jade was very helpful at reception, and our waiter Shuba, at the bar was so friendly. The team even arranged a limo to take me to the airport, for the same price as a taxi!\n\nThe rooms are very comfortable, the beds are super cosy and the housekeeping staff did a great job.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":8541913,"title":"Great Midtown location","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-04-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Great new property in midtown if you want ease of getting around NYC or close to Javits. I was there for work at Javits and the quick 15 min walk straight down the street was much easier than the previous location I stayed at over the years. The entire facility feels more on the boutique side of Marriott even more so than some of the boutique properties they have been opening. Lots of exposed concrete and raw materials throughout the facility. \n\nThe rooms are on slightly above average for NYC - there is room to move around and still store your stuff. There is little to no storage though other than one hanging bar and no drawers other than the safe there. This is similar to a property I stay in Chicago at and not sure why they have chosen to switch to this setup - makes it hard for more than one person to have their stuff just on some shelves. \n\nThe higher floor (38th) did still yield some street noise so would recommend higher if you can, the view was spectacular though, having a property look out towards the north unobstructed was really amazing. \n\nThe other noise complaint would be the blinds on the windows, they were awkward to operate and you could hear your neighbors open and closing them they are so loud. \n\nI think this room is not really for families though(see picture) as the bathroom is only separated by a frosted glass and when the light is one you can still see quite a lot! Also I was getting up early for work 5 or 6am and turning the light on in the bathroom illuminates the entire room which was not ideal for my wife staying with me. \n\nOverall its a great location and well done hotel with a few quirks if you are solo or a couple would recommend but hard to imagine families staying here sharing the rooms with the privacy issues of the bathrooms. \n\nOne last comment would be - would be great if inside the elevators there was a screen showing where the stops were on the trip up or down, many conversations were had where exactly the elevator was going after getting in!","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":8541913,"title":"Family Review","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-04-17","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"This review is written specifically for families.  We are a family of four.  Our children are 12 and 10.  We were looking for a hotel in a central part of NYC as we had a daughter performing in a classical ballet competition with venues all over the city.  The hotel is very central and all subway lines are easy to access from this location.  The staff is helpful and the property is very clean.  Communication with the hotel prior to our arrival was quick and clear.  \n\nOur flight to New York was delayed, so we checked in around 6 pm instead of our scheduled 4 pm.  The room we had booked with a skyline view had been taken out of commission so we were put in an 'accessible' room a few floors lower.  Accessible rooms, in general, are not an issue with us. We \"moved in\", went to a great dinner (Il Molino-highly recommend), and then washed up and got ready for bed.  There was a reading light in the room that would not turn off.  We called maintenance and they came quickly.  They disabled the light, while we sat in our pajamas.  The next morning the shower flooded the bathroom.  The floor is slanted the wrong way.  My husband quickly requested another room.  Fortunately, we were able to get the skyline view we had originally booked.  Views are absolutely wonderful.  We were on the 34th floor and still could hear city noise, so I suggest booking these high rooms, as the lower will be louder.  The next two days we had issues with the blinds for the room.  We had maintenance come in a total of three times to fix the blind issue.  Each time they were respectful and worked quickly, but it took three times to fix the issue.  None of this was a big issue with us.  The hardest part of our stay with this hotel was the set up of the room, and why we would not recommend this room set up for families.  The showers are separated from the sleeping area by a smoked glass wall.  You can see the person showering, which erases privacy.  Also, if you shower when someone else is sleeping, the light into the room is bright.  The door to the bathroom is also smoked glass, and while thick, you hear everything from the sleeping room. We did not visit the suites, and this might not be an issue there, but we didn't want our performing daughter sleeping on a sofa bed before competition so we chose the 2 queen room. Lastly, if you care about what your children see, elevator 4 has a scantily clad larger than life photo of a woman.  Our children are bombarded with this in all advertising, but having it in the place you stay can be offensive to some.\n\nI will list both pros and cons, again, written with families in mind. \n\nPROS:\n* Great location if you want to see the whole city.  It is central, thus it is in a very busy part of the city.\n* Access to most subway lines is very convenient (especially if you have to walk in the rain).  We purchased a 7 day subway pass and practically burned holes in the card.  It was so well worth the money.  We were able to access the entire city and Brooklyn with this.\n* Staff is helpful and, when called, reacts quickly. \n* Bell staff is knowledgeable and handles all your ground needs quickly.\n* Hotel is clean.\n* Request a higher room (skyline view) for a quieter room and for amazing NYC views.\n\nCONS:\n* Bathrooms provide very little privacy. \n* Room service leaves a lot to be desired.  While it is generally quick, the food (other than the children's grilled cheese sandwich) is fair at best. -- We had a child who was sick for three days of our stay so we utilized room service more than we like to!\n* Maintenance.  While it may have just been our luck, we had two rooms, and both had issues.  Lights, blinds and drains being all of them.  They do respond very quickly, so that is the plus.\n\nAll in all, if we were traveling as a couple without children, this hotel would be highly recommended. The day of our check in the restaurant and bar were energetic and seemed to be the in place.  The decor is modern.  The set up (elevators, bar, lounge, interior design) is all cutting edge.  But, it really isn't a hotel I'd recommend for families.  We did enjoy our stay and do not have complaints, but this is a review for other families planning trips to NYC.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"NONE"}

It is not the most opulent and luxurious five star hotel money can buy. It is not a boutique spa type hotel. It does not a country style retreat feel with the finest of furnishings. \n\nIt is very well appointed with nice modern decor - polished concrete ceilings, frosted glass walls around the bathroom, floor to ceiling windows for the fantastic view. \n\nIt is similar to various business hotels but with a more friendly and personal touch. \n\nIt is in a great location for Midtown. You can walk to Central Park (OK a long walk -  30 mins), Times Square, Empire State, Rockefeller, Macy's, Madison Square Garden, The High Line and so on.\n\nIt is two minutes from the subway to the rest of Manhattan and beyond. \n\nAll of the staff were attentive and you did feel like a special guest as you arrived. \n\nThe lobby bar, 6th floor, is a nice quiet zone to enjoy a drink, with a balcony for warmer weather.\n\nRock n Reillys, 5th floor, has a real post work buzz, up till around 11pm. We also ate in here one night. The food was great and Charlie, our waiter, couldn't do enough to help. The rooftop opens up to make this an open air venue when the weather is hot and you get a great view of the Empire State Building from the front of the bar. \n\nBoth bars close at 12pm, maybe it's a European thing, but I quite like a hotel bar that stays open for residents all night \ud83d\ude00.  There are bars locally that are open till 1 or 2am. \n\nThe room itself was spacious enough and the TV huge. The amenities were perfect for a short stay - large wardrobe, coffee\/tea maker, fridge (for your own drinks - no minibar), hair dryer, USB charging points, blue tooth speaker and the wifi was great - strong signal and very fast even for the standard service. \n\nThe bathroom was only separated by frosted glass, so I suppose if staying with a friend it could feel a little awkward. The sliding door in ours was slightly misaligned so it was a little difficult to close. From my point of view though, it is the little features like the frosted glass bathroom that make this place stand out a little from a very busy crowded market. \n\nThe bed was beyond comfortable, and huge for a king size bed. \n\nWe were fine with the lifts, we only  waited a couple of minutes one time. However I could imagine how they could be annoying at very busy times in the hotel. \n\nWe never tend to eat hotel breakfasts, so we didn't try this. However the \"MY Belly\" menu did sound great, if not slightly expensive with the cost for room service added on top. \n\nOverall for the price, in NYC, this was amazing value for money and I would definite stay again on our next trip. If you want a comfortable, well appointed hotel close to everything in Midtown then this is definitely for you. ","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Pretty spacious and modern. Bed was very comfortable and so were the pillows. Hotel uses aveda products. Pretty quiet. Did not use wifi but hotel does offer free wifi. Has central air!\n\nNo free water so buy your own bottled waters( do not buy at duaneread stores- go to either cvs or asian grocery stores nearby like hmart on 32nd st or near the new york public library there is a japanese grocery store). If you want slippers bring your own. Toothbrush\/paste bring your own. \n\nI would come back to this hotel in the future and recommend it to others who are visiting nyc-- but i would not come here with my parents or grandparents because it is little too modern\/non- traditional feel for older\/conservative\/traditional guests. I also do not think i can share a room at this hotel with my friends or brothers because bathroom was somewhat see-through.. you can only see shadows of the person taking shower from the bedroom.. but still.. i would not feel comfortable.. but of course this is up to each person's level of comfort. \n\nGiving 4 out of 5 because the room was not 100% clean at the time I entered the room ( previous guest must have spilled champagne or some drinks on the counter below the TV and that area was so sticky- I had to clean the area before placing my bags on the counter).  Also a hotel employee knocked on the door and before i could open the door he just opened the door himself thinking no one was in the room ( I think he thought something had to be fixed in the room) not his fault for trying to get into the room to fix stuff... but I was surprised to see him just open the door before I could answer\/ open the door myself. \n\n","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This a is a fairly new property that I have stayed at several times. The location isn't great but the rooms are actually well designed. Great beds, interesting bathrooms (wall of glass between shower and bedroom, frosted slightly for the modest), great water pressure, tv mounted in the right spot, perfect blackout blind. Many positives. On the routine negative side (I'll get to specific negatives in a bit), the elevators are a mess - there are three (the fourth only runs between street and lobby) elevators for 30+ floors. They are 'external call group managed' elevators - meaning you request a specific floor before entering an elevator and are told which car to board. Slow and confusing is the only way to describe them - and I have stayed here several times. 5 - 10 waits are not unusual.\n\nAnother routine complaint - the small concierge lounge is always too crowded. Worse, the breakfast offerings in the lounge verge on the pathetic. NO HOT FOOD!!! Cold hard boiled eggs, cold bacon, and a selection of warm yogurt, etc. The 'featured' item every day I have stayed here over five visits is sad little chicken and waffles under a heat lamp. Truly disappointing.\n\nNow for this specific visit: the hotel booked a large event. An event they simply do not have the resources to support. They closed the concierge lounge to hand the space to the event - displacing their most loyal hotel guests. The alternative provided was an ante-room on a different floor with no seating, poor lighting - and again no service, hot appetizers. Extremely disappointing.\n\nAnd for the true deal breaker - because of this event (which the property's size and access could not support) it took 20 minutes to get from the street level to,the 6th,floor then 13 minutes to get to my room on the 10th floor.\n\nThe response from management was unsatisfactory. I am Life Platinum Marriott Rewards member for more than 15 years and still booking more than 100 nights a year yet my complaints were dismissed by the Director of Guest Relations. Clearly this property values an event customer over all of their hotel guests.\n\nI will not be a customer of this hotel again.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

There were more than ample standard and USB plugs placed thoughtfully throughout the room, and the lay-out of the room maximized its function within a limited footprint.

The rooms are decent sized for New York, with a nice shower, fridge, safe, and sufficient closet and cabinet room. The workstation is good and the Internet speed is pretty good. I managed to get more done when on VPN, as Marriott appears to throttle speeds based on the application being used.\nThe gym is a large Planet Fitness facility. \nWhile sufficient, it is a letdown compared to the hotel's overall style and design -  especially in comparison to excellent Renaissance properties like the one in downtown Washington DC. Also irritating are the elevator controls - you choose your destination floor before you get in. But somehow, unlike other places, at the Renaissance understand which elevator to take is just confusing and unnecessarily so.\nThe concierge lounge is excellent: breakfast and dinner there is both tasty and beautifully presented.

We had a high city view room which was superb.\nEach night we never tired of the view.\nThe reception staff were lovely very friendly and always keen to help, just great.\nThe rooms were well equipped all be it a little weird. I was convinced they had not had time to finish the rooms before letting them as the ceilings were bear concrete and the wallpaper was missing in parts exposing rough concrete. Little did I know this was deliberate! Hmmm distressed concrete as decoration, oh well, that's New York I suppose. \nThe bathroom just wonderful except it's a glass wall between it and the bedroom!! Yikes it's a good job we had been together a long time but we still had to step out while one was in the bathroom. Another thing the bathroom door slides but does not completely close leaving a half inch gap, need I say more. Guess I'm not quite hip enough for New York. Change this and despite the concrete it would have got a resounding approval.\nNoise from the landing, most of the nights we had a good restful sleep but one night we had a totally broken night as the service lift was opposite our room having requested a room away from the lifts. All we heard all night was the lift bell ringing knocking on doors Fromm room service and when I investigated at 3 am the door to the service lift had been wedged open so the noise was much louder than it should have been and it looked like people had been moving laundry and such like. Altogether that night was a nightmare.the floor was full that night and that might account for the noise but who knows.\nWe are gold card holders so we had access to the executive lounge which was fairly good although at times staff did not appear to know what they were doing.the hot water heater marked hot water only had been used for coffee so a decent cup of tea was impossible, back to the room for the kettle. We waited half an hour one day for someone to get us hot water not tainted with coffee. I suppose that's the penalty for being a Brit. The food was  not bad providing you were not veggie otherwise it was a bit limiting but it was the same thing every day which if you were only their for a few days was fine but not so good  for a week. Plenty of ice cold water and soft drinks though although not too many diet options.\nLocation wise the hotel is opposite Penn station and a few 100 yards from Maceys so you are right in the thick of it. The problem we found was that Maddison Square Gardens was above Penn Station and our room overlooked it. A tea dance is held each night, it starts about 7 pm and the noise despite the height of the room was very intrusive we were worried it would continue all night but thankfully by 10.30 it all stopped.Its a shame they don't tell you this at reception when you book in rather than leaving you to think what have you let yourself in for. Still if you read this you will know not to worry.\nAll in all we had a lovely time at this hotel despite the grief mentioned above. The reception staff were lovely and tried their best to assist you . That's a good recommendation for the management. The staff in the restraint were great and the food was good so all in all it was a good experience. That said for me I don't think I would go back  but that's really because I would prefer being closer to Central Park or Times Square rather than the  centre  and we found the Hyatt at Times Square much quieter when we stayed there the previous year. \nAll in all it was a lovely hotel once you take out the disturb au on one of the nights and if you want to be in the centre it's a good location, just make sure you know the person you share with extremely well in view of the bathroom.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We arrived around 11 am Saturday morning and to my surprise were able to check in right then.  The staff was extremely friendly from check-in until we departed.  The hotel is extremely clean and has a cool vibe.  The rooms are a bit small, but most rooms in NYC are, so that is to be expected.  The room was very nice though and had everything we needed.  We also had a good view from our room, not just the wall of another high-rise. The hotel is also in a great location.  We arrived at Penn Station, walked a few minutes and were there.  It is also a quick walk uptown (maybe 25 minutes to upper East Side) and downtown.  The subway is also right down the street. We were able to leave our bags downstairs at check out and picked them up at 8:30 pm in time to catch our train home.  We had the breakfast buffet downstairs which was just ok, but it was convenient.  For Rewards members, the lounge is open for snacks all week-end, although we never made it in there.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We went downstairs to customer service to raise this, the whole time the staff really didn't seem to bothered about what happened, and had zero urgency. Neverless they said they would look into the issue and get back to us on Monday which conveniently was the day we were checking out and flying back to London.\n\n4-5 days later, no reply so i'm left to chase up head office, where i get passed around to several people eventually being led to Stephanie Wager in their 'insurance' department who was supposed to resolve the case for us and settle up. It's now 2 MONTHS, and nothing has happened, the whole time my emails have been ignored, or reply's take weeks, most recently i heard from Stephanie on the 1st March where it was said the case was nearly resolved, again 2 weeks later no reply and I've been left to chase up.\n\nI'd expect this kind of service from Travel Lodge, or Holiday Inn, not the renaissance hotel which costs substantial amount of money to stay at, for that it seems fair that one could expect a certain level of SERVICE & RESPECT back, but clearly this place is happy to take, take take from you (quite literally) and provide you with nothing back.\n\nShocking customer service, I've held off 2 months leaving this review but enough is enough i'm tired of constantly being ignored.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is a cool interactive projection images on the ground level floor. The lobby area is on the sixth floor and is very modern and comfy and you feel good spending time there. Beds in the room and pillows were incredibly comfortable and the room was very clean with exposed cement ceilings which fit the rooms decor.

Our visit to the Renaissance New York Midtown Hotel on W 35th Street ( not to be confused with the Renaissance at Times Square ) could not have been better.  We were warmly greeted by the valet upon our arrival.  The ever efficient elevators ( neat system ) took us directly to the 6th floor where we were welcomed by the front desk clerk.  Both of our requests for a room located on the higher floors and a king sized bed were met without hesitation.  Although we had arrived an hour earlier than the 4pm check in time we were presented with keys to a room on the 22nd floor.  Our room was very nice.  The view was terrific.  The bathroom was spacious and VERY CLEAN and had an impressive shower.  The location of this hotel was simply perfect for our short visit.  We were in town to attend the Big East Final Four Tournament at The Madison Square Garden.  The Renaissance is conveniently located 1 block from the MSG.  We walked and had a lovely dinner at Nick and Stef's Steak House conveniently attached to the Garden.  Following a very enjoyable time at the 2 ball games we walked back to enjoy a cocktail in the hotel guest lounge located on the 6th Floor before retiring to our room. The following morning we thoroughly enjoyed our full breakfast at Rock & Reilly's which is conveniently located on the 5th floor.  The staff was simply great!  The food was delicious and reasonably priced.  Following our breakfast we requested and received a late 3pm check out.  This allowed us to enjoy a visit to the Empire State Building which was also a short walking distance from the Renaissance Hotel.  We then enjoyed a short cab ride downtown to the 911 Memorial which is a must visit.  A very emotional experience to say the least,  Upon our arrival at 1:30pm back at the hotel our friends at the valet whisked our car up from the nearby parking garage and wished us well on our trip back to Massachusetts!  I would HIGHLY recommend a stay at this fabulous hotel.  We can't wait to come back for a long weekend to see a few broadway shows and a Rangers Bruins game!

We had tickets to see Billy Joel at MSG and wanted a place within walking distance to MSG. The Renaissance fit that bill.\nThe hotel is on 35th Street...two blocks from MSG...so it was a short walk from Penn Station to the hotel.  \nCheck in was at 4:00 pm and we had asked for an early check in but our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 2:45 or so.  The girl at check in said she'd text us when the room was ready. We went 2 doors down to John O'Sullivan's (an Irish Bar) for a bite to eat but by 3:45 we still hadn't gotten notified that the room was ready.  Went back to the hotel and were able to check in...they forgot to notify us :-(  The guy who checked us in was very pleasant as was everyone else we dealt with.\n\nAnyway, the hotel was nicely appointed - opened less than a year ago - and clean.  They have a unique elevator system which condenses the service to a group of floors so you're not riding or waiting for a long time. The room wasn't huge but it was fine for 2 people.  The bathroom was very nice and spacious and CLEAN which is my #1 priority when staying in a hotel.  Bed was comfortable.  We were on the 27th floor but could still hear street noise occasionally.\n\nWe did eat at the hotel restaurant Rock & Reilly's which was just ok.  Service was slowish and they had a limited menu for \"pre-show\" people...I guess to get people in and out quickly.  The free breakfast the next day was a continental breakfast which was adequate.\n\nI would recommend the hotel just for the proximity to MSG.  It was so great to go to the concert and not have to get on a train home.  I also HIGHLY recommend getting to see Billy Joel...the show is great.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Definitely receptive to any questions or needs you might have. The rooms are a good size for New York accommodations. However, if it matters to you, the bathroom is not all that private - basically just enclosed in thin, frosted glass. We didn't have a problem with it, but it may be awkward for families or not-so-close friends. Bed is comfortable, and the furnishings are quirky, sleek, and ultra-modern.\n\nThe only hiccup with the stay was that we had placed a room service order for breakfast, and apparently the system went down (not their fault), but no one alerted us that our food order had been lost. We waited until about half an hour after the scheduled delivery window to check on its status, and the woman we reached on the phone was very apologetic and kindly helped us to re-place the order. We're glad we called, otherwise we would have never known! The food was delivered about another half hour later, and though it was tasty, the presentation left something to be desired. We did not expect the food to arrive in take-out-like containers in a paper bag. For as luxurious, modern, and beautiful as the Renaissance Midtown is, the delivery felt sloppy and sub-par. If we would have known, we would have chosen to do brunch at a nearby restaurant for a nicer experience at the same price.\n\nOtherwise, the accommodations were gorgeous, clean, convenient to all of the plans we had made in the city without being right in the thick of Times Square, and quiet from room to room (not accounting for street noise, which is totally normal). I think this is the first time I've stayed somewhere in Midtown where I didn't hear footsteps or voices from other rooms.

The lifts were complicated and weren't well- explained so I stood for a while before I worked out which lift to use, and all that was before I could check- in. When I left I asked the door-man for the bag they had stored for me. He said not a word to me when he handed it back to me, and I presume that the reason he didn't even look up when I left and said a cheery thanks and goodbye was because I hadn't tipped him ( hard to see why a tip was obligatory for someone who had silently fetched one suitcase from the store for me)\nI thought the room was well- equipped though I didn't like the concrete wall and ceiling that looked like the room hadn't been redecorated after a flood or some renovation work.

Sage Against The Machine was my drink of choice, the Crispy Rock Shrimp (was perfect) and we topped it off the Filet Mignon...cheers to the chefs! Fast forward to the rooms...they are sorta Edition'ish, very sexy and sheek but larger (based off the standard king rooms).

BUT, it might be a bit frustrating for people ( like us) not into high tech features. First, the elevators are digital \" robots\" with touch screen options and automatic delivery to the floor you select. As a fellow traveler remarked, \" this requires a lot of trust\"- no buttons for the floors, no beeping noise or flashing lights when \" your\" elevator appears. Several times I neglected to look at the quick screen which appears on the command tablet to let you know which elevator to board. I stood there looking perplexed but fortunately my husband had seen the screen and remembered the graphics showing \" our\" elevator. In fairness, the elevators in question arrived quickly and were very fast. Maybe some modification with audio and visual clues ( like Siri? ) could help us oldies get the hang of it. And, unusually, there's no hotel directory in the room. I found out modest amounts of info ( like where the ice machines were located) by scrolling around on the tv screen but not much information and not easy to find. That being said, the decor is all well done industrial chic, the bed was very comfortable and the food good. We had a weekend price well below what anyone else was charging for a similar class of accommodation so definitely worth the learning curve!","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had a minor incident where a ceiling tile in the revolving door fell and jammed the door.

The lobby is on the 6th floor - so once in the building you need to head there.  The hotel is on 35th St but there is a small entrance on 34th which makes it very convenient to Penn Station. \n\nVery modern design.  The rooms even have windows that open to let fresh air in. \n\nNote - the wall between the shower and the bedroom is glass. Even though frosted, you have limited privacy.  So you probably don't want to share with someone you are not that close to!\n\nWe were in room 3005 - this is an adjoining room with a door to the next room.  Avoid this room if you don't like this set up. We couldn't hear anything from the next room.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is located on the very busy West 35th St between 7th and 8th Ave about 2 blocks from Penn Station and Herald Square.  I arrived fairly early for my stay, and was lucky enough to get a room, which I know isn't guaranteed, but was appreciated.  As a Platinum member, was I upgraded to a city-view room.  I found the check-in to be very fast and friendly.  My room was up on the 25th floor.  Keep in mind with this hotel that it is decent size and has 4 elevators, but they can run quite slow.  \nMy room was small, but not bad for NYC.   It was modern, clean, comfortable, and overall a very nice room.  There was plenty of power outlets, and a nice work desk, which is always appreciated as a business traveler.  The room had a very large bathroom with a nice rain shower.  The frosted glass wall, was a cool touch, but if travelling with friends it could get awkward.  I found the room to be very quite for a city room and also very dark with the shades drawn, which is also well appreciated.\nMy only complaints about the hotel are very minor.  First, I didn't find the food in the concierge lounge to be particularly good, or the service to be very friendly. Lastly, be aware that West 35th can be quite busy due to its straight access the Lincoln Tunnel.  So it can be hard to get a cab or a long wait for an Uber!","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The hotel itself was really nice, comfy bed and a really fabulous shower. The location is great, plenty of shops and eateries around. Times Square is a short walk away, and the metro station is right behind the hotel if going further afield.

Excellent location as it was a short walk to Times Square and the theater district and is within a block of Herald Square and Madison Square Garden, plus it was right next to Penn Station, so could quickly catch the subway when needed.  We checked in on a Friday night and the front desk was very efficient, although not very personable, but I was welcomed as a Marriott rewards elite member which is always nice.  I had booked a skyline view king room which was decent size, plus the bed was very comfortable.  Bathroom was good size with a nice shower.  Being on a high floor gave us a nice view of the city.  I liked the way the elevators operated - instead of pushing up or down when you get to the elevator bank, you punch in your floor, then it directs you to the elevator number you are to take.  Then you don't need to punch in your floor when you get on the elevator.  A couple of other things stood out for me - the staff on the ground level were very friendly and greeted us whenever we were coming or going.  They were very helpful the day we were leaving in storing our bags and then helping us get our bags loaded into the car we were taking to the airport.  Also, the hotel arranged a car service for our ride back to the airport, which was very reasonably priced.  The driver was on time, car was clean, and we had no issues getting to the airport - highly recommend using the hotel to set this up if a car service is needed.  In general, my impression is that the hotel is very well managed.  One last comment on the value of this hotel - being a weekend during the holiday season in December, you are not going to get a bargain on any decent Midtown hotel.  But the rate I got on this hotel was reasonable particularly given the location, the service, and it being a newer, very modern hotel.  Overall I was very happy with our stay and will stay here again on my next visit.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}
