Side note:  while walking to the taxi line at Penn Station, an oblivious 20something, with her face buried in her phone, managed to trip me, causing a fall. Of course she never bothered to turn around but some random stranger helped me up.\n\nAnyway, when I told the associate about my fall, she found me a room on the same floor as an ice machine and gave me some ice bags so I could ice my knee but I digress.  \n\nThe first room was a nice king on the 24th floor with a view of the river, Jersey City (I used to work there and could see my old office building) and in the distance, Cape Liberty, NJ.  The room had been nicely redone and featured a fridge, coffee maker and two bottles of water (complimentary).\n\nI noticed a bit of a musty\/stale smell and asked the housekeeper if she could spray a bit of air freshener but it didn't help.  I called the desk and a few minutes later, the bellman arrived with new keys and assisted me in moving up to the same room on the 30th floor, with no smell!  Hooray!\n\nThe room was very comfortable and clean.  The bathroom is nice, and I liked the shower; however, it's rather dark and it probably would have been smart to install additional lighting near the shower.  The lights around the mirror aren't bright enough.\n\nThe hotel charges a $25 amenity fee which includes a few things, one of which is a $25 food & beverage credit.  That's easy to eat or drink though in the restaurant or lounge.  I chose another credit as my welcome amenity and since the concierge lounge is closed on weekends, I was able to have breakfast in the morning.  \n\nThe buffet was a typical Marriott buffet, though on the small side, much like what you'd find in the concierge lounge, as opposed to the usual breakfast buffet served in many hotels.  The eggs were lukewarm as were the potatoes.  You had to ask for toast, and the server never did bring my coffee.  I asked 2 other people before it arrived.   Also, I was not offered juice and honestly, the entire meal was a huge disappointment.  I would suggest NOT dining there.\n\nI liked that the hotel is only about 2 blocks from the 9\/11 Memorial and also from Oculus and the shopping area that houses Eataly where I had dinner.  It is about a 20 minute or more cab ride (depending on traffic) from Penn Station but the hotel is in a nice area and I felt safe walking a bit in the evening. \n\nThere are several restaurants around and some shops but since this is a more business area, many things were closed on weekends.  The hotel does have an actual Starbucks so you can place a mobile order from your room, and then head down in the elevator to pick it up!\n\nI'd stay again if I wanted to be in the financial district again.  Much quieter than Times Square.  The staff were all very nice except in the restaurant (though the bartender in the lounge was very nice) and the room was clean and comfortable.  Yes, this is a basic cookie cutter Marriott and it's nothing really special but I did enjoy my stay and will be back sooner than 30 years next time!","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

We recently stayed in this property to celebrate nine years of being together, but after my experience, it may not be the best choice.  This is a business hotel, and certain things may have changed recently after the general manager transitioned to another property in NYC. \n\nEven though the previous GM forwarded my request and acknowledgment of a special occasion, the respective NY Marriott Downtown location member overlooked the email. When I arrived at the hotel, no recognition of this event in any form was given other than the same king guest room with a particular view was presented.  Being a Titanium elite member, it felt a bit inconsiderate on their part. In addition, the lounge seemed a bit crowded and hectic during breakfast, and the restaurant below had highs and lows in terms of service and delivery.  \n\nRegardless of this bittersweet experience, the bed was comfortable. The location is quiet and near the 9\/11 memorial. There is also a five to 10-minute walk to the nearest train station.  There are a few people that I would like to recognize - Geraldine at the front desk for assisting with availability and trying to find a decent-view room, and Patricia in Housekeeping for taking care of our room.  Geraldine and Patricia helped to troubleshoot a housekeeping issue and were helpful during our stay. \n\nFinally, please remember that they charge you $25 per night to use on the property, and you must use it daily, or you will lose it.

We slept very well and the hotel is quiet - no noise bleed that I noticed from other rooms. I love that Marriott have moved to walk in showers seemingly in all their brands. Such an improvement over unusable tubs with a shower over. Our shower was good although lacking a little in water pressure for the duration of the stay, but nothing to really complain about.\n\nAbout that location. It's very close to WTC 1 and the memorial pools as well as the Oculus which is a great location I think as the WTC subway will whisk you uptown in no time, as we did several times during our stay. There are places to eat around this location and it is very safe. There is also a nice looking bar restaurant in the hotel itself but we didn't partake on this trip.

The hotel itself is nice - public areas are simple, pleasant and practical. My room is clean, spacious and  functional, with plenty of natural light and a view of the city and bay in the distance. It\u2019s definitely a decent hotel - safe, clean and comfortable. The staff, however\u2026 every interaction with them feels very transactional. As Lifetime Platinum, I wasn\u2019t offered an upgrade to a corner room that so many other reviewers were given. I stayed 5 nights and was denied an upgrade throughout the entire stay. When I asked if they had an international socket adaptor, I was told matter-of-factly that I should have brought my own. Isn\u2019t this an establishment that caters to the needs of international travellers? In most other hotels, rooms are equipped with international sockets or the hotels have spares they loan to guests. Don\u2019t expect any of the little extras here, that will make your stay more memorable. Finally, the Concierge Lounge: it\u2019s a nice space with a fabulous view! Food (both breakfast and evening snacks) exceeded expectations. The ladies who work here\u2026 they offered the only warm and sincere interaction I had with anyone in this hotel.

We were given access to concierge level which had a starbucks coffee maker, a great breakfast and plenty of drinks. On the weekends they don\u2019t do breakfast so they gave us vouchers to get breakfast at the restaurant which had a full menu or a breakfast buffet, the manager at the restaurant was there every morning chatting with us and was super kind and helpful.

This is, without question, the worst Marriott property I have stayed at. How? Let's count the ways.\n\nRooms: this room felt dirtier than one in a Motel 6. Stains on bedsheets. Roaches literally crawling onto you while you're lounging on the bed (this we saw with our own eyes). Bedbugs, as inferred from the telltale linear bite marks. When we reported these issues to the hotel after the stay, they claimed to have done an inspection that revealed no pest issues. That is an amusing finding given that we literally had to kill and flush a roach down the toilet during our stay.\n\nBreakfast: the breakfast venue, in \"Bill's Bar and Burgers,\" had a 20 minute wait on day 1 of our stay and a 45+ minute wait on day 2 of our stay. This for a breakfast buffet that I would rate as Residence Inn quality (not a ding on Residence Inn; in fact, there you can get the same breakfast without waiting in line a single minute).\n\nStaff: the rudest Marriott staff I have seen anywhere in the world across 400+ nights. Every interaction with the front desk staff was brusque and dismissive. You would not want these people staffing a McDonald's, let alone a full-service Marriott. The only noticeable exceptions were the restaurant waiters, who were impressively courteous for being as overworked and understaffed as they were.\n\nOverall: So many Marriott properties in NYC: whatever you do, just don't choose this one.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

And it worked out pretty well in the end.\n\nLocation right next to WTC site, close to #1 & countless other subway lines...Wall Street, Battery Park City, etc works pretty well as a tourist. Yes, you're not on the LES or in Williamsburg, but you're also away from the congestion of Times Square, Midtown. There are countless places to walk to for decent dinners.\n\nRoom was as expected quite spacious - was (slightly) upgraded to a view corner room. Nice windows looking west to Jersey City and south downtown. Other than that - it was very standard Marriott. You can tell it wasn't new and a tiny bit rough around the edges, but comfortable and clean.  \n\nOn some levels I'm not sure how I feel about a lounge in the\/one of the greatest restaurant, bar cities in the world...but it was good for kid's food? Seriously, food quality was better than other domestic Marriotts, Sheraton - multiple hot choices in evening, decent fruit for breakfast, a solid Starbucks coffee machine. And similar views to our room.\n\nI know amenity fees are the norm now in NYC & elsewhere, but really...why? You can tell me Bill's Burgers earned some awards in 2013, but if I really wanted to go there - couldn't I go myself anyways? The $25 daily non-accumulating credit seems designed to annoy; usable at Bill's, the 20-SKU mini-mart next to the lobby (think only snacks & beverages that were available 1980 or earlier...M&Ms, Skittles, Snickers, Dorritos + Coke, Sprite, Water + a handful of medication), or the lounge for alcohol. The other inclusions 1x\/stay - laundry ($15, eg, not 2 pieces of clothing), Citi Bike (have to request a code), tour of some sort - all seem somewhat hard to use. Honestly - just raise the rates $25, and I'd be less annoyed.  \n\nBeyond that, service was a question mark overall. Hotel's main entrance had a set of ~4 stairs, and hotel staff seemed committed to ignoring me carrying up a stroller each time. Lounge staff was extremely talkative and trying to help. Room was still cleaned daily, and did a good job with a heavily occupied room.  \n\nOverall, don't stay here if you want exciting, to be in the beating heart of Manhattan....stay here if you need an easy place to rest within the city with decent amenities. It's kind of like a Marriott anywhere...","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

But what shocked me is that anyone can come in and out of that hotel without security noticing. The hotel emphasized they cannot be responsible for people coming in and out of the hotel, then why would anyone want to stay at the hotel if they cannot feel safe walking in the corridors and leaving their belongings in their room? Despite me asking about security and actions the hotel will take to remediate security issues, nothing has been done and the hotel has been silent. In addition, they refused to compensate me for the loss of my laptop and were unfeeling about my situation (in retrospect, I acknowledge I should have taken my bag with me while going to the restrooms but felt safe given employees were present).\n\nIf you want you and your belongings to be safe, I DO NOT recommend staying at the hotel.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

And despite the annoyance of having to get the ticket stamped for parking, it's still cheaper to park there with in and out privileges than elsewhere. So I appreciated that. However, I do find the entrance very unfriendly. There was no ramp to pull my luggage, and no doorman to help either.

I only learned that my reservation had been cancelled when I showed up to the Courtyard after traveling for 10 hours (might I add in the pouring rain) and found the outside of the hotel shuttered up. A gentleman outside told me the hotel had been shut down, and pointed me in the direction of the New York Marriott Downtown instead. \n\nWhat ensued was passive aggressive and poor communication by the front desk staff at the New York Marriott Downtown, hours spent on the phone with Booking.com attempting to resolve the issue, and a bill three times what I had planned to pay. \n\nTake my word for it, from one frequent traveler to the next, avoid the Courtyard by Marriott and the New York Downtown Marriott.

Enjoy the Sea Glass Carousel. \n\nUnfortunately...\nThere are STAIRS in lobby, right inside the door. And while there is a doorman or two, they are not eager to help you with your luggage, or stroller. There is a \u201chandicap accessible\u201d elevator - a tiny little thing over to the right, but it wasn\u2019t working. \n\nThe stairs are frustrating, and the lobby is just kind of small and depressing. Low ceilings. The lobby area is over full most of the time, with no where to sit or relax for a moment. If you are in the hotel, plan to be in your room. \n\nWe reserved a room with two beds. If you\u2019re traveling as a family or a group of friends, take notice that these are DOUBLE beds, not queen beds. They will not be big enough to fit two normal sized people. The room is only big enough for two. The beds are very soft. If you like or need a firm bed for sleeping, you won\u2019t sleep well here. \n\nInside the room, there is a bright light on the wall outside bathroom door, probably to indicate where the bathroom is and bathroom light is, but because of the light the room can not get dark. \n\nThe bathroom light switch is outside the bathroom door which makes for an unpleasant room sharing experience if anyone has to use the toilet overnight. \n\nThe shower door is on rollers and would not stay shut. It rolled open half a dozen times during my shower before I wet a washcloth and jammed it in behind the roller. \n\nThere is no vent fan so your steamy bathroom remains steamy. Forget putting on makeup in there. And too bad for you if you get the second shower.\n\nThere is no vanity kit (sewing kit, emory board, shower cap, shoe mit) in the bathroom. If you need it you will have to bring it or buy it. I tore a nail on the way to the hotel and needed an Emory board. I looked in the bathroom and called guest services. They said that I might be able to buy one in the lobby. I went to the front desk where they gave me a \u201ccomplimentary\u201d sewing kit and told me I can buy the Emory board. Our first stop on our big NYC getaway was Duane Reade. Awesome.\n\nFinally the $25 fee. Others have said enough about this. We got some hot cocoa and coffee, and a keepsake mug, at Starbucks.

The views of the Statue of Liberty, Governor\u2019s Island, the harbor and the Hudson River were fantastic. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable with a nice couch along the window. The staff throughout the hotel are excellent. There is a Bills Burger restaurant and a Starbucks within the building.

Suite looks to have just been remodeled with a generous amount of space and a comfortable sofa. Room had many large windows providing plenty of light. I thought the location was perfect.

The lounge was closed on Friday when we checked in and all weekend. I enquired about water and was told by front desk that she would send some right up. It never came. No slippers or robes which any suite at a fulll service property should have. The main issue was noise. I have stayed in many big cities and know to expect some street noise, but this was absurd. I was 30 floors up and car radios and horns sounded as if they were in the room. I also don\u2019t know if this goes for all the rooms or only the connecting ones, but we had a person in the room next to us who decided to have a very loud phone conversation at 3am both nights we were there. Second night had to call for security, which I have never done in over a 1000 nights in hotels. I can\u2019t say for certain if this is a hotel soundproofing issue or a very loud guest, possibly a combination of both. Either way it is a black mark against the hotel because ultimately they are responsible for ensuring the comfort for all guests.

I'm Titanium level and crossed my fingers that we'd get an upgrade; WOW, we certainly did get an upgrade. Felt very appreciated for my loyalty to Marriott. We landed a spacious suite on the 35th floor. The views of New York harbor, plus the beautiful skyscraper lights at night, were like a scene from a movie. Impeccable service, well-stocked penthouse-floor concierge lounge (closed on Saturdays) with clear view of the Statue, huge gym with a wide array of muscle-toning machines. Very close to the 1 Subway (red line) and within 15-minute walking distance of ferries, and about a 7-minute walk to the A train subway (Nassau Street entrance at John Street) to JFK airport. Excellent climate control in the room and thorough housekeeping. The $15 \"resort fee\" was clearly outlined in our reservation, and we recouped it with wine\/food. Many chain hotels in big cities add this fee now, so I'm used to it, and it was spelled out clearly, so it was my decision to accept it. Just such a comfortable, well-maintained hotel that it was worth it. If I don't qualify for an upgrade next year, I'll definitely pay extra for the view. It really made the trip magical to wake up to that scenery, and to end the day with it. The gym is on the 5th floor, so I could see the interior of one of the rooms on that floor as I walked down the hall, and the low-floor rooms just look out onto brick walls or mechanical stuff. There's no traditional hotel lobby bar here. Access to the concierge lounge meant access to their automated  wine bar, where you scan your room key and a machine fills your glass with wine and charges it to the room.

The king bed was comfortable.  Could not figure out how to change the temperature settings. There is  a Starbucks and good burger restaurant on the ground floor. So not bad so far.\nThe reason for the low rating is the double rip off when you check in.  The first rip off: after giving you your room and key they tell you there is an additional $15 dollar a day \"destination\" charge.  You can apply this charge to anything you buy in the hotel BUT if you do not buy something each day worth $15 or more you lose it. The first day starts when you check in, so if you check in at 9pm you have three hours to spend $15 or lose it!.  I guess this fee started as a \"resort charge\" but clearly this hotel is no resort and people complained.  The second rip off is that you are charged $2.11 in state and city taxes on each daily \"destination fee\"  which is not refunded when the destination fee is taken off.  I am sure that Marriott does not pay this add on part of the fee as taxes.  This is the first time and last time I will stay at a hotel that does such sneaky things at check in to steal money from unsuspecting customers.  Shame on you Marriott!

Accomodations were ample, well-appointed without flourishes, clean, quiet. Elevators were fast. Staff were friendly and helpful. Location worked well. Pleasant to walk around outdoors. Stone's throw from 9\/11 Museum. Varied architecture to note among other buildings.\n\nDownsides: no room service or breakfast area. Only a Burger Bar for meal service and I didn't care for it at all. Sandwiches very large but  all choices were heavy and calorie-laden. I opted for chicken sandwich and my friend fish. Both were breaded and fried dry so no escape from fatty food. Not to mention that it is horribly loud so not a place for conversation at all.\n\nThe good news is there are a scattering of restaurants and a grocery-deli within two to three blocks.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The great service started immediately when I walked in the door, the bellman saw I was struggling with suitcases since there is a couple steps up to the lobby (there is a wheelchair lift). He ran over and carried the suitcases up the steps and to the front desk so I could check in. I wish I remembered the young guys name that checked us in as he was extremely friendly and helpful. He upgraded us to a high floor room with a view of the Statue of Liberty and gave us the rollaway bed for free. We were on the 35th floor room 3507. Very few hotels in NYC will put a rollaway bed in a room with two beds and this is one of them. Yes the room was a tad tight but it worked for a family of four. The view from the window was absolutely breathtaking and the room was super quiet. I really liked the design of the room especially the all marble bathroom. There was a mini fridge In the room which was very helpful for storing water and ice. One thing I feel that Marriott hotels should offer free bottled water at least to Marriott Rewards members. I feel that $4 for a small bottle and $7 for a large bottle of water is very high. I had requested ahead of time that they bring me a dental kit and some extra soap and blankets. In addition to the rollaway. I think this was the first hotel I stayed in where I didn't have to call the front desk and ask repeatedly for them to bring the stuff up. They did it automatically and the guy even set up the rollaway for us. The Christmas Tree in the lobby is stunning.

The almost 360 degree view of downtown Manhattan and the river make it a very cool place to sit and eat breakfast.

You can call and get your own brown bag dinner, or eat there, but being unable to get a tray of food when you\u2019re exhausted from cancelled and delayed flights is not welcoming. \nLately, in other locations,  Marriott has started offering your room service in a bag, with plastic utensils and plates. For the price of their rooms, they\u2019re missing the boat. \nThe room itself is well appointed, but again, Marriott now gives you one bar of soap, so remember to transfer it from sink to shower when you need it. This is just cheap.\nI am at the hotel as a speaker for a conference. I wonder why the planning group chose this hotel. It\u2019s convenient to the financial district, but it\u2019s not the class act this company should expect. \nAs a frequent business traveler I have started avoiding Marriotts.

The location was good for our outings at the world trade centre and statute of liberty.  The hotel upgraded us with a river view but this again didn't really feel like an upgrade as the real views were on the higher views.\n\nAs many have commented the hotel charges a $15 fee per night which is then available to spend on hotel services and Bill's.  This is where things seem to go wrong.  Bill's is centre of the hotel's food services and simply put a burger joint is not appropriate as the hotel's main restaurant service.  \n\nWe ordered some food there and got a medium rare burger.  My fault for not asking for well done but they didn't ask either.  Also they forgot the cheese on my cheesy fries.  My request for this was met with could you come down and we can give you some cheese before the person on the phone became self conscious of what she was saying and finally said that she would just give a fresh set done correctly.  \n\nThe breakfast is in Bills too and this is poor.  The food is limited and the server on the first day was literally clearing our plates while we were still eating. The 2nd day server was much better though.  The breakfast menu needs to be extended.\n\nThe staff at reception come across as but rude trying to be jokey but it doesn't work.  I expect full service Marriott hotel staff to be professional until they know their guests at which stage a less formal approach maybe welcome.  Exec lounge is closed on weekends which is annoying as it has the best views.  \n\nUnfortunately I cannot recommend this hotel. The hotel staff are inconsistent in quality, the facilities are a little tired and the use of Bills via the forced payment of $15 adds insult to injury.  \n\nThe good news is that is didn't detract to much from our New York trip which was great","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I was out front and I was in the midst of cleaning up after my sick working dog and because I am handicapped, I can't do things fast nor that efficient. In the middle of cleaning up, the Porter, or whatever his title is, named Homero, decided he had to be unkind and chose to yell at me to clean up after my dog, yelling! He was over twenty feet away from me and his volume was so loud that it felt like he was standing right next to me. If he thought that I was walking away, that is one thing, he could have kindly said, please make sure you continue cleaning up. I wouldn't have mind that as he may not be that observant - obviously - that I am handicapped and need extra time to go to trash and come back to clean up. But no, this horrible human being decided to shout at me. He continued to yell at me, that I lost my cool and started to yell back at him for being so unkind to someone. I kept asking him that he could be nice, but he yelled again and told me he is nice. I don't think so. It went on and on like that and I am ashamed that I scooped to his level, however, I have absolutely 100% lost respect for Marriott, who I enjoyed staying with, for employing such a horrible human being that is so unkind to people. He told me other people weren't cleaning up so he had to make sure I was...BUT I was in the middle of cleaning so he can't punish me for what other people do. Especially when he was present as I was cleaning. I don't think I'll ever be returning to Marriot because of Homero. I told the manager, but he didn't seem to care whatsoever. He said he would talk to him, but as I left, I saw him roll his eyes and retreat back inside. That's how Marriot handles themselves. Thankfully, there are so many other hotels, that are far better equipped in service and not treat another human being so poorly.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

Rooms are reasonably sized given it is in New York. For sights, it is right next to the 9\/11 Memorial, across the street from Battery City (great walks along the Hudson), and close to the ferries and trips to Ellis Island and Statue of Liberty. So in every respect, it's a good hotel and I would give it 4 stars were I a tourist. BUT, my trip was a business trip. I arrived late in the evening and was checking out the next morning before 7am. The hotel charges every guest a $15 per day fee (over and above the room rate) for something (I never really understood) that the staff tried to explain (You apparently can use it for bottled water, or the restaurant, or for some other things I never figured out completely). But you pay it regardless of whether you use the money for anything and regardless of your status with Marriott. Now I was in the hotel for less than 10 hours total. This is not a resort hotel in any way. Nor does someone doing business have the time to avail themselves of whatever the fee pays for. When you complain, the hotel staff says it is mentioned on the Web site when you make a reservation. Who knows? I didn't see it probably because I never imagined there would be such a fee in business-oriented hotel on Wall Street. Check out the Courtyard one block away or the Millenium Hilton with great views of the 9\/11 Memorial (stayed there the week before and there was no fee). Or the Conrad if you need to go to GS or the World Financial Center.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I'm not sure you can get such a nice hotel for cheap in Manhattan anywhere else. \n\nThis is why we didn't give a 5 star review. We were told that our $15 a day location fee could be used at the restaurant. So on our final day we ran up a $30 bill on breakfast takeout. The food was not good. We didn't think much of it as we were using our comps. However, when we checked out we learned that the location fee had to be used daily- it did not accumulate. So we wound up paying for half of our not so good breakfast. (Potatoes were cold, french toast was almost burned.) Do yourself a favor and use it on snacks and bottled water and find breakfast elsewhere. It's NYC and there are lots of great options nearby.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There were temporary crowd control barricades set up perpendicular to the hotel on the sidewalk where we could lock our bikes, if that was our preference.  We chose to bring our bikes to our room, which was not a problem (note: you are told that if you damage the room with your bike there is a $250 fee).  After we settled in our room we went out for dinner and noticed that they had posted a security guard out front to keep an eye on the bikes outside.  The morning of the ride, there were two staff members outside helping guests with their bikes, in addition, they put out a table with water bottles, granola bars, and bananas!  After the ride we had no problem getting back up to our room with our bikes.  Many guests checked out Sunday afternoon, after the ride and the staff was again helping people put bike racks on their cars and loading luggage.  We stayed until Monday morning when staff once again helped with loading cars.  The hotel handled a bunch of people with bikes VERY WELL.  Kudos to the management.\n\n5 BORO TIP: my husband is a Marriott Rewards member and therefore has access to the higher floor\/concierge rooms, you DO NOT WANT a higher floor for the ride.  The hotel staff warned us to give ourselves at least an hour to make it down from the 36th floor. We were in Wave 2 and brought our bikes down stairs at 5 AM, locked them up, and went to breakfast to ensure we had no issues with all of the other guests bringing bikes down.  After breakfast we went back to our room to get dressed and grab our stuff - we ended up taking the stairs down as the wait for elevators had started at 6:30 AM.\n\nROOM: we stayed in room 3612, which has a nice view of Jersey City (see pictures), you can see the Colgate clock, the Liberty Science Center, and the taller buildings in Exchange Place.  3612 is a king bed room with ample space for bike storage.  Room has king bed, two night stands, ONE charger on nightstands, desk, desk chair, fridge, small closet, chair, and ottoman.  We did not hear other guests through the walls (as always we heard loud people in hall - when will people learn?). The room was very clean.  The room safe was in a desk drawer.\n\nCOMMON AREAS: The lobby has very limited seating.  There is a Starbucks & a burger restaurant within the hotel.  The burger restaurant was terrible (never eat at the hotel in NYC - we know that and shouldn't have).  Concierge lounge is large enough, but does not have comfortable seating and is more of a cafe setting with tables and chairs (open Sunday night & Monday morning).\n\nPARKING: Valet parking.  We were told to expect a wait time of 1 hour when we wanted to retrieve our car - I assume this was for Sunday checkout due to the high volume of riders.  We only waited 30 minutes for our car (standard for other NYC hotels - 30 minute wait for valet).","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}
{"helpfulVotes":7,"locationId":93477,"title":"Is 0 stars an option?","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-05-07","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"My friends and I booked here for the 5 borough bike Tour (4 of us for 2 nights.) We didn\u2019t stay however, because we received the worst customer service of any hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed at. \nAllow me to elaborate. \nOne of the perks of booking through the 5 borough site, was that the hotels offered \u201cperks\u201d to bikers. We got no perks. We got a ruined weekend.\nUpon arrival, we started to check in. We were told that the late departure on Tour day we were offered was based on availability and would be $60 additional. Ok. Annoying, but not deal breaking. Then they said our room wasn\u2019t ready (we were early) but they wouldn\u2019t let us store our bikes anywhere while we waited. They offered for us to pay $20 per bike to store them \u201cacross the street.\u201d Ok. Thanks, but no thanks. So then they call us 4 hours later saying the room is ready. We get up to the room and it\u2019s 1 bed for 4 people. I go back down to talk to the desk and they say their reservation said I had one person staying. Interesting, because mine says 4 people staying and lists all the names and that a double bed quad is requested. They told me that my reservation was based on availability and their solution was that we could purchase another room. Ha! We said that they should give us another room because we paid for a room for 4 people and they couldn\u2019t provide that. We asked to speak to a manager. Our next mistake was expecting the management to actually take care of the problem. \nCasey Boyle, the \u201cmanager\u201d came over blank faced and approved to other room. No apology, no smile, didn\u2019t act like she cared, nothing. Fine. Don\u2019t need the manager\u2019s approval of me, just need what I paid for. So my friends take the new room and my guest and I go back up to the single bed room. The door doesn\u2019t open. So I go back down again and tell them that the key doesn\u2019t work. They reset the key, check my ID, and we go back up and open the door. Well, there was a man in the room, freshly checked in. At this point, it\u2019s just ridiculous. He was upset too because he said the room was supposed to have a certain view he paid for. Probably even more upset now that he\u2019s been walked in on random strangers with a key to his room haha. Obviously the hotel was having trouble keeping the reservation requests straight. \nSo once AGAIN, I venture back down to the lovely Miss Boyle to let her know that she gave me someone else\u2019s room. She then tells me that we weren\u2019t supposed to keep that room, we were all supposed to move to the new room with DOUBLE BEDS. Wait, what? So they had a double bed room available even though they said they didn\u2019t?? And we had to get approval to get the room we paid for?? Miss Boyle was again unapologetic, even though I had been up and down the elevator 4 times and wasted 5 hours of my day trying to check in. At this point, I didn\u2019t want to stay. If she would have just faked like she cared even a tiny bit, I would not be here writing this review. I am a manager and I work with people to resolve issues. I am BESIDE MYSELF at how she handled the situation. A simple apology honestly would have sufficed. \nLet me help you out, Casey Boyle: \u201cMs. Young, I\u2019m so sorry about this confusion. It\u2019s been an extremely busy weekend, and we are trying to meet everyone\u2019s requests the best we can. We\u2019ll get this taken care of, I assure you. Can I offer you a drink on the house tonight at our downstairs burger restaurant?\u201d Simple! That\u2019s how you save customers, Casey Boyle. Now you try! ;-) \nWe were extremely upset with the way we were treated and won\u2019t be returning. Even further, I\u2019ll be telling my experience to the world in hopes that no one else has their weekend ruined as well. I\u2019ll also be contacting the Tour coordinators to let them know about the experience and suggest they not market the hotel on their site next year. \nWhen we said we were leaving, Casey Boyle issued my refund for the deposit and said, \u201cyou\u2019re all set.\u201d I looked at her and said, \u201cThat\u2019s is? No apology or anything?\u201d The woman BLANK STARED at me, I kid you not. \nBravo, Marriott. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffd","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We arrived late at night and the only room left had only one bed. They quickly brought a cot up and set it up in the room. It was surprisingly comfy and we had no desire or need to change rooms the next day. The room was very clean and the bathroom was spotless (Gladys took care of our room and she was fabulous). We had a nice view and went to sleep with the blinds open each night, so that we could enjoy the lights of the city. The location is great! Literally a 1 minute walk to the 9-11 memorial, a 5 minute walk to great shopping at Century 21, 5 minutes to deeeelish NY pizza at Steve's around the corner, a short walk to all the financial district sights and another short walk to Battery park and the ferries to see the Statue of Liberty. There was an insanely massive line all around the park as people waited to board the Statue of Liberty boats. Save yourself the time and money and take the FREE Staten Island ferry. It passes by the Statue of Liberty for some great photos and you can also check out Staten Island. On the island, we checked out a farmer's market, did some geocaching and took some great pics of lower Manhattan. The NY Marriott Downtown also has a handy business centre where you can check-in for flights and print out your boarding passes. We were in New York to celebrate my mom's 70th birthday. I mentioned this to the Front Desk staff and they were so kind to send up a nice note and a gift box of treats for her! She was sooo appreciative and surprised!! Thank you, NY Marriott Downtown!!

First thing I noticed when we walked into the room that there was space from the bottom of our hotel door to the floor. It was seriously about two or three inches. They had some kind of a convention in the hotel that weekend and I could seriously hear other people\u2019s conversations outside in the hallway and heard ppl getting off the elevator every time they got off of it. It wasn\u2019t horrible but it was def not amazing hearing it through out the day and even at night thru the late hours. Second the employees there are real nice but some got on my nerves real fast. I was outside smoking and didn\u2019t see their 4 inch tall sign saying you had to smoke twenty feet away from the property. So of course I\u2019m outside smoking and didn\u2019t hear the guy say \u201cyou have to smoke away from the building\u201d and then he screams that I have to smoke away from the building. Now picture this there was another hotel quest next to me ( a very attractive girl) and after he told me to smoke away from the building he let her sit there and continue to smoke.... hmmm fair right?! Now there is the restaurant that is in the hotel. For one there is no room service and if you want food you have to go get it yourself. So I ended up getting a burger and she got a chicken sandwich. When I got the food and went up stairs my girlfriend notices that the bread had some kind of garlic onion in it and she is allergic to onions she ended up getting sick not much but no where in that menu does it say anything about that being in the bread and we really couldn\u2019t do anything about it that night because the restaurant closed at 11 so I just kept the receipt. Went down to talk to the manger and he was very nice about it and told us we could get something to make up for it. So later that day I took him up for his word and she got some bacon cheese fries. We went back up to the room To eat and they gave her some cold fries and a little bit of cheese that couldn\u2019t prob fit on a ritz Cracker. We were so fed\nUp with the restaurant that we didn\u2019t even bother to go back down. The best part\nAbout the hotel is prob the location.

Ubers and Lyfts were easy to get and the connected Starbucks and Bill\u2019s restaurant (average food, but at least has the Impossible Burger) added convenience to my stay.  \n\nSound\/sleep quality- 6 out of 10.  My room had the following issues: it was next to an ice machine that seemed to be running\/refilling constantly one morning, random bonks and cracks & creaks from act ducts or hallway, noise from housekeeping and guests closing doors and chatting in hall were easily heard.  These things may not be an issue for someone waking up for work\/on a weekday, but I more likely that not noticed them because I was sleeping in and on vacation.  My 1st morning at the hotel, even though I had a privacy sign on the door, we were woken up twice by a phone call asking if we wanted housekeeping- sadly there\u2019s no green option to refuse housekeeping at this hotel, so I asked the front desk to put a note on my room saying we won\u2019t need any.\n\nWifi- fast speed and easy to reconnect with the access code they gave.\n\nCustomer service- very nice and accommodating.  On our 1st night at hotel, we came back from dinner around 11:30 and smelled smoke in our room from the air vents\/a nearby smoker (even though the entire hotel is non smoking).  I called the front desk to complain and they said they could switch our room, which I took them up on.  We got moved to the top floor, which was a relief as the smoke got worse and worse by the time someone brought us our new room keys.\n\nMarriott lounge- Unfortunately, this lounge is unimpressive compared to other Marriott hotels\u2019 lounges I\u2019ve used in the US and abroad.  It\u2019s small in size, but does offer hors d\u2019oeuvres and dessert Sun-Thurs. I would\u2019ve liked for the lounge to be open as a place to sit and enjoy a soda or drink from their espresso\/coffee machine on the weekends, but it\u2019s completely off limits from Fri to Sun afternoon.  I sampled the hors d\u2019oeuvres and cookies on a few nights and they were mediocre (green salad, vegetarian pasta, cheese and crackers + some fruit, plus 2 hot- typically meat- dishes).\n\nDecor- The rooms felt a bit dated (in my 1st room, the wooden casing around the heater was falling apart at one end), but were functional.  The TV and mini fridge worked fine, but the bathroom felt older because of the fixtures and the thin bathroom towels.  The rest of the hotel is nicely decorated (lobby had lovely Christmas decorations and the elevators run well and look updated).\n\nGym- I got to the gym each day I was at the hotel and it was the most enjoyable part of the hotel for me.  There are several treadmills and ellipticals, along with a few recumbent bikes and several weight machines (+ free weights).

We got a deluxe double on the 22nd floor. Not much of a view but the beds were comfortable and the heating system is quiet. Many travel sites categorized this hotel as luxury; I disagree. It\u2019s a nice hotel with a good location but by no mean a luxury hotel. The room also comes with a fridge, a safe, and a 55\u201d TV with limited channels. There is also a charging station on the night stand but the power cord was frustratingly short so you could not use your device comfortably while charging it at the same time.\n\nThere is a Starbucks on the hotel property which is nice since it\u2019s wind chill -5F outside, being able to get good hot coffee & warm drinks without stepping outside is appreciated.\n\nSubway stations are 2-3 blocks away. #1 train is 2-blocks away, less than 5 minutes walk. N \/ R trains are 3-blocks away, less than 7 minutes walk. On arrival day, we took the Lucky Star bus from Boston to NYC, had a yummy and affordable dinner, then Uber to the hotel from Bowery Street for $14. Worth it for us since it was -15F wind chill at the time. Subway would normally be less than $3 pp one-way, of course.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Unlike most Marriotts, this hotel does not offer room service and the attached restaurant is an odd choice for a Marriott. The restaurant is a burger\/pub place. It is accessible directly from the hotel but doesn't deliver food to the rooms. I went down and ordered something to take back to my room and it wasn't a good experience. The food was bland and the bartenders (who handle the take out orders) neglected to provide any utensils. It was a challenge eating my cole slaw without a fork! Other than that, if you need\/want to stay in lower Manhattan this is a good option. There is an attached Starbucks that opens at 6 am. The hotel staff was very good. The rooms were very nice and quiet. There are limited dining choices in the immediate area, which makes the lack of a better in-house restaurant a problem.

The NY Downtown Marriott is a joy and pleasure. The key differential factor in ranking Hotels ( bearing in mind that the infrastructure, the offering and adequacy of services are taken for granted at Hotels such as the Marriott Downtown ) is the Staff and personnel. The Marriott Downtown staff have never failed or disappointed my high expectation. At every turn the Staff were simply a delight and professional in carrying out their tasks. I have tested the Hotel competition in NYC on a number of occasions and I find myself returning to the Marriott Downtown. In reality good service is akin to describing an elephant.

There are excellent transport links just round the corner into the city (Rector St is a 10 min subway to times square and the upper west side & Wall St is 10-15 minutes to grand central and the upper east).\n      It is a 2 minute walk to the trade center memorial and to the Westfield shopping center for the retail addicts - with also the deli just round the corner (Americanos?) doing cheap, yet delicious food for breakfast (it'll save you paying $20 a head a the hotel).  \n\nService & Room\n\n      Quick, polite and top notch. Checked in within 5 minutes late at night with friendly, helpful staff.\n\n***TIP*** Ask to become a Marriot rewards member (its free) to avoid paying the $15 a day for the wifi in the room. \n\n      The room was sizeable, with a massive bed and television to match with a decent selection of channels.

The hotel is definitely not worth $2,178 for a 3 night stay. \n\nUnfortunately the hotel options are a bit limited in that part of town, and Marriott knows that and charges you for it.

The Executive Assistant, Marjorie Cadet helped us with the arrangement. I arrived at the hotel on Thursday at 8 AM (mobile check-in one day before) and the room was ready for us. Normally, it was impossible to check-in early especially in NYC. The receptionist, Cheryl and Lisa took care of us and welcome us to the hotel and thank us for being a platinum member.   The room was located in the 37th floor (total of 38 floors) and in the corner. When we entered the room, we were very surprised as the room was a vice presidential suite with a king bed, 1.5 bathroom, and a separate living rooms (see pictures for details). The views from the room was amazing. We could see Hudson River, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and much more. The room was very clean. We got 4 free water bottles daily. The receptionist forgot to give a guarantee platinum arrival gift but since they give us a very nice upgrade, I really do not mind nor request for the arrival gift.\n\nThe lounge is located at 38th Floor and open everyday except weekend. The breakfast at the lounge is great. On Saturday morning, we ate at the Bill's Bar & Burger restaurant at the 1st Floor. The choice at the club lounge is better as you can have unlimited various bread, various fruits, bacons, eggs, drink, etc. At the restaurant, we can only choose 1 entree from the special menu and 1 glass of juice.

It is a middle of the road hotel with fairly updated rooms, decently comfortable bedding and a clean small bathroom. Nothing really fancy even though the entrance hallways look quite nice. The rooms are typically sized but for New York, I guess it's pretty good for the price especially given that you are centrally located in downtown NYC. The nearest MTA subway station is Rector St - or - World Trade Center \/ Cortland St station which are about a 3-to-5min walk from the hotel.\nThere is no in-room service, but a restaurant located within the facilities which serve breakfast menu options, and burgers\/beers\/drinks.\nThe staff is somewhat friendly depending on who you talk to, if you are a Marriott Rewards Member, I recommend directly talking to the Marriott Rewards attendant who will be treating you better than otherwise and provide you with the free WiFi service.\nDepending on whether you are lucky or not, you will be given a room on a higher floor with a view or not. We got a room on the 9th floor with no particular view bu the buildings adjacent to the hotel... which is fine.\nOverall, this is a no frills hotel with comfortable\/clean beds that is very decently located for New York, very close to the 911 WTC Memorial & Eataly Downtoan restaurant & the Oculus \/ Shopping Center, at a decent price. I would definitely recommend it for families or business people looking for a reasonably priced hotel when visiting NYC.

I have stayed at his hotel a few times in the past and waited to make sure it just wasn't a bad day before reviewing.  The physical hotel is ok, tucked into a tight space and not a spacious hotel.  The rooms are ok, slightly aged even with the upgrading that was done.  My comforter had a hole in it and it was right in the middle of the bed, so no missing it.  They just ignored it and left it in the bed.  The bathroom is old and dreary.  The television reception on certain channels was awful and the mere fact that in this day and age that they don't offer HD tv is crazy.  The concierge lounge has a great view of the harbor and the Statue of Liberty, but otherwise a disappointment.  It's small and the food offerings were well below par.  They do not offer room service and the hotel restaurant, Bill's West Side Bar (reviewed separately) does not accept Hotel charges.  Not a huge deal but clearly an inconvenience.

The entrance is nothing grand and the lobby is also small, but this is NYC. \n\nThey had upgraded me to a room with a view on the 36th floor and I also had comp access to the lounge on 38. The room is average to small. Room does look dated. They have an avg size window with views to NJ. I did not get a view of the Liberty Island :). They offered to upgrade to me to a larger king bed with a sofa but I declined. \n\nThe hotel has 2 bars\/restaurants, Bill's. I had some parcels delivered from Amazon to the hotel. Its important to know that the hotel does charge a parcel fee so better check on this before you get them shipped. \n\nThe location is great as its 2 blocks to the WTC mall and 4 blocks to the new Brookfield place. Plus I like downtown more than midtown as its quieter. Overall this was a sterile experience. Nothing bad and nothing too fantastic. Would I repeat? If for a short stay, no. If for longer stay then price always triumphs and this hotel was a good deal.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

During my last stay they started construction outside my room at 8AM, which woke me up. I was surprised the hotel didn't inform me.

It's almost in the shadow of Freedom tower -an amazing view to see every time you walk out the door!  The water is just a block away, and it's awesome to walk along the promenade and see the sights, including the Statue of Liberty.  If you stay here, I recommend going across the street to Brookfield place and going outside to enjoy drinks by the harbor.... beautiful scenery. It's easy to access the various subway lines from the hotel.  If you can, request a high floor with a Hudson River view! \n\nThe rooms were decent.  I think they could use a bit of updating, especially the bathrooms.  The staff were very friendly.  There didn't appear to be a concierge while we were there, so I wouldn't count on that type of assistance from this hotel.  Also, when you walk into the hotel you immediately have to go up a small set of steps.  There is a wheelchair elevator for those needing it, but most people will have to lift their luggage up the steps...unless the doormen are available to help.  I would hope the hotel would fix this situation.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the hotel, it was nice but not luxurious. However, that is what we expected for the price.

Called the front desk and a very nice person came to help us out very quickly.  Was woken up at 5:30 am by the overwhelming aroma of raw onion.  I am aware that our room was over the restaurant but it was on the 5th floor.....Very nice and modern bathroom but only two large towels.  Two for me, none for my husband? One each?

Also one soap and no shower cap.\n\nOn another note regarding Marriott in general - you are not the Taj, which makes me wonder why  your rates are so high.  \nWe  travel quite a bit for business and many clients are often near Best Western Hotels.

As well as several Courtyards, Fairfields, and Residence Inns...  This is my first stay in this Marriott, somehow.  Now I know why...  This Marriott is old, the rooms are very outdated, and I just can't feel comfortable here. \n\nCheck-in was ok, I did the online check-in and said I'd be here earlier in the day but never got an alert saying my room was ready so I didn't come over until 5:30.  While I'm checking in, I get an alert that my room is ready...  I asked if I was getting an upgrade (not guaranteed for Platinum Premier but often successful) and the young man told me I was getting a very nice room with a Statue of Liberty view.  Get to my room and it's a plain queen room, I requested King, and I can barely see the statue for the tall building right in front of me.  Heard them telling others checking in around me they were getting club level rooms, and nice king rooms, but no go for me.  It's odd because I checked in online at 10am the day before arrival and still get the leftovers. \n\nRoom is very tired.  Carpet is the old dirty yellow 1980's that Marriott had in many properties years ago.  Had...  Room is tiny compared even to Times Square properties.  It's the smallest Marriott hotel room I've ever stayed in outside of the Algonquin that Marriott bought up here a few years ago.  There is not even a place to put the luggage stand outside of squeezing it in the closet.  The TV is nothing special and mine didn't work when I arrived.  Remote didn't work nor did most of the channels.  They did send an engineer up to work on it within an hour.  No idea where I will plug the iron in, in the morning.  Only possible spot is to position it over\/against the desk.  \n\nThe bathroom is equally dated.  Not too small.  Nothing special.  And of course, a tub shower...  It's a strange tub shower though.  It's about 20 inches deep.  But still a tub shower with a shower curtain.  When will business traveler hotels get rid of tub showers? I hold out hope that Marriott eliminates these before I depart this earth.  \n\nConcierge lounge is again, nothing special.  Not very big and food offering night one was less than impressive.  The cheese cubes were the best part.  Went back for dessert at 9:02pm, desserts to start at 8pm.  All I found was one empty plate of crumbs.  Not sure what was on it, but looked like cookie crumbs.  And yep, no more to bring out. 1 hour left on dessert offering and it's nada, zilch, empty...  \n\nElevators.  Oh the elevators...  Think they are bad and slow at Marriott Marquis in TImes Square?  Wait until you try these.  They have 3 cars each for the two sets of 19 floors.  And they move slowly.  Twice here in day one I walked in the hotel to see the elevator lobby spilled out into the open area of the lobby.  I mean 30+ people waiting. If this was an anomaly and changes during the week, I'll update my post to reflect. \n\nOverall, wish I'd booked somewhere else.  Love the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott across in Brooklyn.  Stayed there the last 2 weeks while working here in the financial district. Will return there when I'm back in this part of town.  Won't return here. This property needs an overhaul\/update asap.  If something changes with the lounge before the week is up, I'll update my post to reflect.  Otherwise, disappointing property. \n\nOf note, meant to add that lobby is fairly nice.  It's seen updating much more recent than the rooms.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

They are friendly, it is in a great location, it has a decent but not great burger place downstairs.  The problem remains to be the Club Lounge on the 38th floor and the elevators.  The club lounge is WAY to small for the number of people trying to use it for breakfast. The set up is terrible no one can get by each other, there is often no place to sit and the newspapers are gone in about 15 minutes. The coffee area is too crowded for more than one person at a time. If you are going to let everyone and their brother have access to this lounge, then you need to make it bigger.\n\nSecond problem, and the bigger one in my mind because it will actually keep me from booking here again, is the elevator problem. There are three elevators servicing floors 15-38 and in the mornings you can often wait 10+ minutes (no exaggeration) for an elevator only to find it is packed solid and you need to start over. Also, it is going to stop on every single floor on the way down!  Takes forever!  I had a conference call at 8 am one morning. I was on floor 32. I decided to pop up to the lounge on 38 to grab a cup of coffee at 7:30. By the time I got up there, pushed my way through to the coffee area, and got an elevator back down to 32 (stopping at every floor on the way), I had not one minute to spare. That is ridiculous!  If I have to build that much time in to use the elevators, then I am going to find another place to stay. Marriott downtown used to be the only game in town but no longer. Several places opening right nearby.  If Marriott is smart that will fix the lounge problem and the elevator situation before all of their elite customers go elsewhere.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Generally like Marriott hotels so made some assumptions about service and quality . . . Overall the hotel is ok - I found all of the staff to be helpful, professional and polite. Check-in was easy (important after a 7 hour flight from LHR, and 1 hour 45 minute transfer from JFK). However, desperate for a drink of water I found that my room came with no minibar (perhaps just my tight old company and the room agreement?!). So I thought at least I can have room service - except you can't! You can order food from the burger bar downstairs, but they won't deliver - you have to go collect and pay there and then. Not ideal when you arrive late and just want something light, and delivered so you don't have to show your face in public! To be fair the actual food was good. So just be prepared: bring your own water \/ juice etc. and don't expect room service (even for breakfast). \n\nThe service in Bills was highly variable: one evening and at breakfast I found excellent service; another evening the waiter could barely be bothered to be there - yes it was busy, but having to ask 3 times for a cold glass with my first beer, and then having to specifically ask again when the second beer was plonked on the table was all a bit rubbish.\n\nOn the plus side: the room was very large by NY standards in my experience; was very clean; staff I interacted with were helpful; and the beds very comfortable. No free wi-fi which is strange as a business traveller, but was not particularly expensive. I found it reliable and reasonable speed. Location good for Downtown - esp, close to Battery Park and WTC.\n\nOn the debit side: no room service at all; the decor is perhaps politely called \"vintage\" . . . ; when my laundry was returned, housekeeping didn't actually close my door properly so it wasn't locked - a worry but thankfully nothing taken (when I called reception they were supportive); the air conditioning is old and noisy; and rooms with a view are noisy as you are right on a main road into Manhattan (I was on the 15th floor, but the noise of sirens, horns and trucks was quite disturbing).\n\nOverall I would probably stay again - but now forewarned with what it's like. To be honest other members of my party stayed at the DoubleTree close by and it did sound a better proposition for similar money. So I suppose you pay your money and make your choice.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I have context.\n\nThe hotel did not meet my standards for a city Marriott.  The mid-week price was high - but the going rate for area hotels since they were all sold out.  And the service was good: front reception was courteous, efficient and pleasant. The bellhop was helpful and gracious. I respect and appreciate that. The problem was the property is old and in desperate need of a face lift. Old fixtures, popcorn ceiling, tiny bath tub, dated interior. It was clean; I also respect and appreciate that. But I couldn't fathom the justification of the price for the quality of the room -- even in NYC. \n\nTo further drive the point, I changed hotels mid trip (business to personal) and transitioned to the Residence Inn downtown, another Marriott property. Delightful. Bright, cheerful, new interior! And less than half the price of the Marriott. It's an odd juxtaposition when the cheaper brand and price blows the standard Marriott out of the park.\n\nYou will have a fine stay at the Marriott - good beds, clean room and very good service. But book here if there is a good rate. If not, find a newer Marriott property. I hope the Marriott HQ will consider remodeling this hotel. The location is excellent and it would make an average experience extraordinary. ","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

With location being so prime, I was so disappointed with the staff and with how outdated the rooms were. \n\n1. The staff was non-welcoming and, at times, flat-out rude. The front desk treated me like I was a burden when I checked in. On the second night, I called down for extra towels and it took three more calls (35 minutes in total) to receive them. I will give credit to the bellman, who were responsive and very cordial. \n\n2. The rooms were in dire need of a makeover.

This is just outstanding service, in fact I've never had better. \n\nCheck in was taken care of by Amie Lau (she has been at this hotel for 18 years so that in itself says something- happy staff makes happy guests). Amie also allowed me a late checkout on my day of departure. She was extremely friendly and welcoming and thanked me for my Platinum loyalty. \n\nThis hotel is 38 floors tall but with only 15 rooms per floor, it has the feel of a boutique hotel and this is why you get such personal service. It is in complete contrast to larger hotels such as the Marriott Marquis which feels like a train station in the lobby at times as its usually so busy. The Downtown Marriott is a truly special hotel in a great location and very easy to get into places like Times Square on the no 1 train from nearby Rector St subway station. In addition, the hotel is a 2 minute walk to the new Westfield shopping centre at the World Trade Centre. Downtown is no longer just a financial area, it is once again a destination hotspot for visitors. \n\nBills Burgers in the hotel lobby serves up some of the best Burgers in town and can now be ordered and delivered on room service. There is a Starbucks in the lobby which I always use but on this occasion it was closed for refurbishment. \n\nThe executive lounge on the 38th floor is one of the best I've ever used. Breakfast is excellent with smoked salmon, crispy bacon, scrambled eggs, oatmeal, fresh fruit, bagels, bread, pastries, etc. The food in the evening is far better than the tiny canapes you might get in  some hotels, and there were some delicious (and very large) meatballs and pasta on one evening plus salads, cakes etc. \n\nThe young lady at check out was equally as friendly and continued the seamless excellent personal service that I have always had at this hotel.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

While the Marriott was very nice and everyone I DID have the opportunity to meet was very friendly, helpful, and went above and beyond, this manager, in my opinion, was unacceptable. One day before my arrival I received an email saying my reservation had been cancelled. The cause of the cancelation and something to do with my credit card company not being able to validate the purchase since this was a large amount and it was out of state. While I did confirm this purchase immediate with my credit card company something fell through the cracks. I was unable to confirm if the cancellation was due to something wrong on the hotel side of things or on my credit companies side of things, but I can assure you this; while the front desk clerk had no authority to give me my room at the same price of my original booking the manager sure as hell did. He did not help in anyway and even went so far as to tell my husband to \"look online\". So we did look online using our Marriott app and we were able to get the hotel for only a $5 price increase. Why couldn't the manager have saved me loads of time, anxiety, and stress on this last minute cancellation? I am not sure, but I am extremely disappointed that this is the way we were treated. No one should be left in the dark and if being an elite Marriott rewards member means nothing then we will go back to the Hilton honors.","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were upgraded to  a beautiful room on the 34th floor with river and Statue of Liberty views!\n\nMarriott Members recommended  the East Side Marriott because of the activities available but this location gives you just as much to do!  If you've already visited NY and seen the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's, et al, you will get a whole new perspective of NYC downtown!\n\nA visit to the observation deck and restaurant at One World is alone a reason to stay here, There are fabulous restaurants and shops and entertainment at Brookfield Place at the World Financial Center.   Walking or  biking the Battery Park City promendae - day or night - is a great experience.   Take the (free) Staten Island Ferry round trip for a fantastic water tour of New York harbor.  Or take the tour and see Ellis Island as well.  There is a complimentary Downtown Shuttle with 27 stops that takes you from the World Trade Center Memorial to the South Street Seaport with historical sites along the route.  Visit lots of downtown museums. See Alexander Hamilton's and Robert Fulton's burial sites at Trinity Church.   All of these are within walking distance of the hotel.\n\nLess than 2  miles away ($7.50 by taxi) is The Highline and the new Whitney Museum, Chelsea Market  & Arts & Craft Center (where the Food Channel Shows are taped).

Valet parking ($60) wasn't cheap, but it was hassle-free.\nWe arrived at about 1 p.m. on a Saturday and were able to get into our room (we had requested early check-in on our reservation through the Marriott site). We were a party of four women, and the front desk did a great job of locating a big corner room with two double beds that gave us plenty of space. The room (#908) had three big windows on two sides, and while the view wasn't as great as it would have been on a higher floor, it was fine given the size of the room. The beds were very comfortable, and there was also a nice club chair with an ottoman. The bathroom was fairly roomy, especially for NYC. Housekeeping quickly sent us a extra towels when requested. The room also had a safe and a refrigerator, which was big enough to hold a 2-liter bottle laying down front-to-back. Overall the room was very clean, and we are somewhat picky in that department when it comes to hotels.\nWe chose the location mainly because of its proximity to the Twin Towers reflecting pools (a block away), Battery Park and the Brooklyn Bridge. All were in very easy walking distance. We also wanted to walk the High Line, which was a couple miles north. We took a cab there (just $10), and walked back. The concierge was very helpful with directions, and gave us maps and coupons (Century 21 store). \nWe had dinner in the hotel at Bill's Burger Bar; the service was excellent and the food was average at best. We walked to the Loopy Doopy rooftop bar, which offered nice views but was very small and obscenely priced ($20\/drink). We liked the nearby O'Hara's bar much better (Deann the bartender was great), as well as the Living Room in the W Hotel. \nAs for wifi, it was complementary as we are Marriott Rewards members; otherwise you pay.

I would probably ask for a higher floor if I was going back but the view wasn't bad from the 14th.  Everywhere was clean, light, well maintained, although the bathroom could have done with a refurb as the paint was peeling and the air con was great.  The staff were fantastic and ever so welcoming and helpful throughout.  Service in the restaurant was pretty slow and some of the food wasn't brilliant.  The gym would have benefitted from showers so you don't have to wander around the hotel sweaty.  It would benefit from something to make it a little more distinctive such as a pool or a nice place to sit and have coffee or a bar on the top floor but if you need somewhere close to the financial district then I would recommend it but I would definitely get breakfast elsewhere.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Very friendly front desk gal who helped switch my room with my parents since they didn't want such a high floor - and I did. I had room 3315 and let me tell you, I almost gasped when I looked out of the window for the first time and saw that the Freedom Tower was RIGHT THERE. My other window (corner suites have two walls of windows) had was a full view of the Hudson River. Seriously impressive views! I actually slept with the curtains open all night because I could stare at the Freedom tower the whole time. I don't care if anyone saw me - ha! My dad has a hard time walking but he was able to handle the 5 minute walk to the 9\/11 Memorial\/reflection pools and museum. It's literally around the corner from this hotel and it's a must-see. The restaurant inside of the hotel is also good\/casual fare (burgers, etc) and good for catching a drink in the evening. I had to go to the front desk for a couple of things I needed and everyone was always very nice and professional and one even asked me if I wanted a cookie as I walked away. Why yes I do! Check out was easy too, they slipped a receipt under my door before 5am. It would be really hard to get me to stay anywhere else next time. This is my absolute new fave for NYC.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I felt like I was imposing.  The lobby of this Marriott has very few chairs so when we were waiting for our friends, we had to stand most of the time. Also the free Wifi.....we couldn't connect to it and when we asked at the front desk, we were told we had to go to the Marriott site, check in then do something else, etc.......My friend tried what they suggested and that didn't work either.  \n\nAnother problem we had with this hotel was their breakfast.  We paid to have breakfast as part of our room bill.  When we went to have breakfast there were only certain things you could have.  Other Marriott's give you a buffet breakfast.  There was no buffet at this hotel. \n\nThe hotel is within walking distance of the World Trade Center, which we did walk to.  Everywhere else we went, we took a cab.   \n\nThis is the first time that I've been to a Marriott and was so disappointed.

I noticed that other hotels in the immediate vicinity are using the same concept. A standalone bar\/restaurant is accessible from inside the hotel and used for breakfast etc... Interesting.

We have stayed in midtown, Brooklyn, NJ, and this time returned to the Downtown Marriott. About four years ago we had been here but the area was under a lot of construction ( there always seems to be some construction in the city). This proved to be a perfect spot for us. The hotel was very clean and any staff we met were extremely friendly. We met three different shifts of doorman and they could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Being there on a weekend it was not as busy or hectic as I am sure it could be on a weekday. While you are in a big city there will always be some noise at night but it was the quietest two nights we have ever had in the city. Our room was midway up in the hotel and anytime we pressed for the elevator it seemed to appear within seconds. From our window we looked down on the bike\/running path which was between the sidewalk and the street. Our only displeasure was to learn that the hotel did not have bike storage available. It would make an ideal spot to go off on a bike through Battery Park and up along either of the rivers. There are many dining options in the area from fancy and pricy to a great Irish pub to Le District located a short walk away where there is something for everyone. You also are within walking distance to the ferries to Ellis Island, Lady Liberty, Staten Island and in season Governors Island. All in all a great spot, and a welcome change of pace in New York City.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From first second they showed very low service. As we paid more than 400$ per night we expected at least helpful and friendly people. We had 3 suitcases and nobody helped us with them. At least they could help me, female. Instead of that, doorman was just looking, so probably for him was quite interesting if I am going to manage to bring one suitcase over steps. As we came too early, we left our luggage in a storage room where we brought them by ourselves and doorman just opened the room and pushed them and after that he asked for tipps! FOR WHAT?? For just opening door and pushing luggage? Seriously?\nRegarding room - it is ok. Quite big but in our room was door to another one and at 3 a.m. some ladies started laughing very loud, slamming doors every 5 mins and talking about what should they wear, what pyjamas,underwear etc. It was like an hour at least...\nAt the whole hotel there is no free internet, they even dont have business room. You have to pay. But in our reservation was written that in public area there is free wifi. When I asked on the reception the lady lied me, telling that in NY you dont have free wifi at all.

After a quick check in process lacking any interaction from the guest service agent other the name, credit and and ID, that is all she said to us. Seeing that the room we were given was on a high floor we assumed are usual requests and requirements would be met fine. After stepping off the elevator we found our room directly off the elevator strike one. After opening the door we found two double beds. When I made the reservation I specifically made the reservation for 1 king bed. In the hundreds of Marriott reservations we have made we have never had anything other than 1 king bed. So I called down to the front desk to ask what had happened to our room. The agent I first spoke with just argued with me back and forth finally asking if I wanted to speak to a manager, to which I said yes. The manager again offered me no solution to the problem just simply saying they were sold out. After two whole days of traveling with no sleep and no other hotels available in the city we were stuck. After going to dinner we came back to try and sleep only to find the beds being completely uncomfortable. After tossing and turning all night we found ourselves completely sleepless in lower Manhattan. We requested our car in the morning to change out some luggage and then repark the car for the day. We cleared out the room carrying everything down since we had collected alot more during our day in the city than we came in with. The problem with this was there is a small staircase at the exit of the hotel making it impossible to carry our items down any other way than one by one. While hotel staff looked on not one person offered to help us with our items.

However this time was a pure leisure and truism.\nNew York Marriott Down Town is not a typical tourist hotel. One would argue it may be more business centric?\nHowever we have found it very, very good.  Friendly porter at the door steps directs you to the reception where Kevin looked after us exceptionally well and professionally. Smart, cool guy with a nice approach calming us down after unpleasant taxi ride from JFK Airport. Thank you for that.\nRoom with exceptionally comfortable bed, nice view, clean and fresh. Advisable to have a room on the highest floors. Hotel has a gym on the fifth floor (bigger than expected with modern cardio equipment).\nFor Gold and Platinum Members, Executive Lounge (closed on Saturday until Sunday evening) is located on the 38th floor. Couple of ladies work very hard to make sure adequate breakfast is served every morning. Lounge gets very busy and it is really an effort to keep all under control and both ladies are well organised and they manage to have a smile on their faces. It helps to start a good day.\nAlternatively breakfast is served downstairs in the Bill\u2019s Restaurant (recommend to take continental breakfast only), otherwise one need a doggy bag!\nDuring evenings lounge serves some snacks, soft drinks and spirits (chargeable at reasonable prices).\nThe Host \u2013 Mario is a legend in his own time!! Exceptionally friendly, entertaining, approachable and full of stories. One evening thanks to Mario\u2019s company we have stayed there for over two hours forgetting what time it was.\nThe only thing I would change in the lounge is the coffee machine. It is either broken or outdated. No matter what button is pushed coffee comes out the same. \nHotel is located just on the edge of Ground Zero (Down Town Manhattan or as it was previously known \u201cMannhatta\u201d \u2013 island of many hills). Some five minutes\u2019 walk from Rectory tube station and 10 minutes from Wall Street Broadway). Twenty minutes later one is at Times Square. I recommend 20 dollar travel card, purchased from ticket office and being able to top it up when money runs out. It can be used\/shared by multiple users. In the other direction 10 minutes\u2019 walk gets one to Battery Park and Statue of Liberty cruises (apparently in order to explore the inside of the Statue tickets have to be bought on line some three months ahead of the trip). \nHotel offers calm location and environment after hustling and bustling all day in Up Town.\nAll in all a very pleasant break, big thank you to all the staff in the hotel (champagne glasses too).\nNow I know all about New York and can apply to be a concierge in the hotel. I reckon they need one.\nCheers","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had stated all my requests through their website about a King room, the late check-in and the statue view room and as I'm a marriott rewards member wifi should be free. We get 10pm after a long day (and here to celebrate our 4 year anniversary), reception staff seems nice enough but when I checked in she tells me I have to pay for wifi to which I told her I'm a member (can't this be checked in the system) so she had to check before validating. We get to our room on the 33rd floor and the room are twin beds with no statue of liberty view. We take all our bags back down to find out what's going on only to be told this room is not available. Since this is what was paid for why was it not told when we arrived? And why was it not available in the first place if we booked it months ago? No one checked our information before we arrived? I never write reviews especially disappointing ones like this but the fact that the room managers downstairs - after the fact we were disappointed didn't even apologize and just said they would give us back the difference and we could get our room tomorrow and as of right now downgraded. This is not the level of service I thought of the Marriott since it's always been amazing every where else we've stayed.

During the evening reception, I felt like I was being stalked...they hover around your table and especially the honor bar...I was looking at the selection and suddenly a staff person was beside me asking me what I preferred and that they would get it for me...told them I was just looking and they said to let them know if I wanted something...I found that very odd...it's an honor bar...if they don't trust folks will honor it, then they should have a bar with bartender instead. I had to ask for Diet Pepsi on several occasions coffee cup lids, crackers for the cheese plater, and the snacks area is hard candy, yogurt covered raisins and a mixed nut jar that was usually empty. Also, it's not a 24 hour lounge. I went up at noon to grab some water and it was locked. So I went to the front desk to get a Pepsi...it was $4.00...Ridiculous. \n\nBills Burger place is a joke and the one in the front of the hotel picks and chooses their hours. Closed at 9  one night....The dining and drinking establishments close by certainly benefit from the poor service and odd hours.  If it's in your budget, go to Morton's and sit at the bar, George is great or try the W hotel, great outside deck bar. \n\nI am not too familiar with NYC and wanted to see the 9\/11 Memorial so I though being close was important and as convenient as the location is, I would recommend staying at a different Marriott property like The Marquis and cab it to your points of interest.  \n\nHopefully this place gets some much needed attention, it has great potential and Marriott is doing itself a disservice by not making this hotel a priority in its property portfolio. \n\n","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We drove right up to the front door, approaching South to North on the FDR, where the valet immediately whisked out car off to the parking garage.  The Lobby was lovely: clean, white, and modern.  Hotel staff was knowledgeable, responsive, and well-mannered.  An attached burger restaurant served a delicious lunch, and had a chic 'casual vibe', without being pretentious.\n\nMy husband and I stayed in a queen room on the 9th floor. The room was very clean, smelled absolutely neutral, contained new furnishings, and was quite roomy. The bathroom was very large, and even included a make-up station and plenty of outlets for hairdryer, etc.  The bathroom was so clean, I actually had the confidence to take an actual soak in the tub, without seeing ANY residual grossness anywhere make a cameo appearance to creep me out!\n\nThe bed was very comfortable, high quality sheets, cozy comforter and blanket, and a plethora of pillows of different types, for our sleeping comfort. There was a good 8 feet between the foot of the bed and the edge of the desk across from it- enough space for morning yoga if one was so inclined.  I appreciated the bedside lamps with outlets in base for phone charging, and more outlets on the desk! This hotel got the memo that folks with many devices need many outlets! \n\nWhile it didn't have a spectacular view, I know many rooms on the upper floors have Statue of Liberty views. Our view faced east, and while simply including views of other buildings, it wasn't a horrifying air-shaft or back-alley garbage dock.  The windows had the usual chiffon glide-backs, it also had very efficient black-out curtains that kept the AC nice and cold in the room, and blocked out every speck of light.\n\nAt one point, when we went to actually 'go' for our reservation to see the Statue of Liberty on a harbor cruise, I realized that I needed to physically print out my confirmation form, and the front desk was more than happy to oblige, gave us directions to the dock, and an estimated walking time to our destination.  The only drawback we experienced was that we had requested our rooms be on the same floor and booked well in advance, however, the hotel was unable to accommodate this request. This was somewhat disappointing, but in the end didn't make a huge difference to the quality of our stay. \n\nOverall, we were delighted with our stay at the Marriot Downtown NYC, and we'd absolutely stay there again.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Didn't want to spend a lot of time commuting from an uptown hotel. The New York Marriott Downtown fit the bill. While the rooms on higher floors might have a slightly better view, I still had a view that included the water and I spent less time in the elevator going to & from my room. Winner! One oddity about the elevators at the hotel - not all elevators go to all floors. The elevators on the right side go to different floors than the left side. Once you have it figured out which elevators to use, it's not a big deal. I had a very large room on the 6th floor. Love the Marriott bed - always get a good night's sleep. Really liked that the room had a mini refrigerator in it. The weather was very warn in NYC when I visited so being able to have a nice cold beverage waiting for me when I got back to my room was great. The hotel is located in a very central area for public transportation (subway is 2 blocks away, several different bus lines within 3 blocks) so it was so easy to get anywhere I wanted to go. Battery Park was an easy couple of blocks away, so that made it ultra convenient for visiting Lady Liberty & Ellis Island. The ferry leaves from Battery Park. The hotel is within spitting distance of the 9\/11 Memorial & Museum. There is also a small grocery store about a 2 block walk away from the hotel so you can easily grab whatever drinks & snacks you want during your stay. Would stay here again. Didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant or bar so can't give you any info on them. My housekeeper - Connie - was amazing. I had gotten a late start one day (due to not felling well) and had told her I did not need my room serviced, so I expected to come back to my room the way I had left it - in a bit of a mess. She had noticed that I had left my room and tidied it up anyway. In addition she left me a bottle of water so I could stay hydrated. Stellar service! I also used the Marriott Service app to request some additional coffee & coffee condiments. They were delivered in a very short time. It was so convenient - I could just text my request, I didn't have to call anyone and wait for the phone to be answered. Can't wait for this service to be rolled to to more Marriotts. It's in a test phase right now. I give it Two thumbs up.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

Room overlooked the Hudson river was well cleaned every day. Stayed over three weekends. On the middle weekend we were given a room on 27 floor, but most of the floor had been subject to a serious flood and was full of humidifiers, pipes and towels on the floor at the entrance to all rooms.  I asked reception if the humidifiers would be running all night and I was advised they would be.  A requested a change of floor, which was done immediately - not really the point though as they should not have put guests in any of those rooms. By chance the day after the flooding, the General Manager was in the lift, so I tackled him about the issue.  He explained that there had been a flood, which I kind of guessed!!, but was hardly apologetic about putting customers in rooms on that floor.  An apology and some recompense might have been a more appropriate response.\nNever mind, on the third visit, the check in staff gave a me an envelope as 'guest of the day'.  Something good I thought, but it turned out to be a voucher for one cup of Starbucks coffee from the in-house cafe. When I went to redeem it, all I could get was a cup of filter coffee, with an extra charge if you wanted a cappuccino or latte - the voucher must have cost Marriott at least 'a quarter'!

However, it really needs to step up its game to set itself apart in terms of service or recognition of loyalty to the brand.  \n\nSo far on this stay my team and I have experience the following: a complete lack of recognition of platinum and gold status with Marriott and a failure to upgrade or even thank any of us for our loyalty, charging for wine in the concierge lounge, mistakenly checking out a guest early, being terse when a key card no longer works.  The common thread here is that these are problems easily fixed by having the staff simply do their job and recognize that they are brand ambassadors for the entire Marriott family of brands.  It's a really disappointing miss.\n\nPros: location, fantastic gym, comfortable and well appointed rooms\n\nCons: service, recognition for loyalty\n\nIf you're seeing a place to go to sleep, this hotel will do fine.

Instead, there is a flight of marble esque stairs.  This is this really slow wheelchair elevator to the right as you enter, but its so slow and not consistent in function, it simply isnt practical to get in and out of the hotel with kids and a stroller.\n\nSecondly, on the day of check out, i called to tell the front desk we would be checking out later after breakfast.  They told me they made note of this.  As I was walking back to our room with our 3 small children, i saw that our room door was ajar.  I was immediately frightened and concerned about my children and my safety.  I pushed open the door and saw no one.  I called out and a woman emerged from the bathroom!  I demanded to know who she was, what her role was and what she was doing in our room.  She kept pointing to her name tag and said she was the manager.  I found that hard to believe as her English was unintelligible.  She never once said sorry, excuse me, or any type of apology. Just kept saying she was the manager and was checking rooms.  I asked why?  I havent even checked out yet,  she huffed away, swearing under her breath but loud enough for me to hear.  The bellman arrived at that moment to witness the end of this interaction.\n\nI immediately looked through all belongings and it appeared secure.  I contacted the front desk manager who took down all information and through the bellman, was able to get the name of the woman (a Victoria, of housekeeping--not a manager).  A few days later a main manager did call me, but never offered a credit for a future stay or anything.  Just a \"sorry\".  \n\nWe have returned to new york 2 more times since, refuse to go back to this marriott, but found the upper east side marriott one much better for families and our needs with superior service and management.\n\n","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"NONE"}

This was a great choice for us. The location is superb, right next to the 9\/11 memorial. Great burger restaurant in the hotel which was not overpriced. Walked in the mornings to Georges restaurant which is two blocks away for a great breakfast. Easy walk to City Hall and to Century 21 for shopping. The rooms are very nice and clean with everything you need.  We had a super view of the Statue of Liberty. The other plus is that this hotel is much cheaper than anything uptown so you get the Marriott quality and brand for less money. Would definitely recommend to anyone whodoes not want to be in the busy tourist areas!","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel was updated throughout, very clean, very friendly staff, and helpful bellman that flagged a taxi and stored our bags. If you want to experience a little bit of the residential feel\/less touristy side of NYC totally check out this hotel! There's a small Italian restaurant south of the hotel that was very good but overall not tons of restaurants to choose from here.

The location is really great - right on the west side of lower Manhattan, near the WTC site and Battery Park.  Everything in downtown Manhattan is walkable from this location.  \n\nThe concierge lounge was small, but high quality.  For some reason there were very few guests using it each morning.  The Statue of Liberty is visible from the lounge as well - alone is worth checking out.  I did not have the evening appetizers, but ate breakfast each morning.  The lounge is well stocked with eggs, sausage, bacon, pastries, and cereals.  \n\nThe hotel has a restaurant on-site and a Starbucks.  Restaurant has $3 beers from 5-7, but avoid the food...I tried 3 items and they were all poor.  I did not get the sense that the restaurant is affiliated with the hotel though. \n\nHotel service was friendly and helpful.

Though the NY Marriott Downtown is somtimes a little pricier than the competition, it's in a great location with wonderful rooms and better service. \n\nI stayed here over an early April weekend,travelling primarily on business but with two friends for the weekend--one that had never been to the Big Apple, in fact. After relating this to hotel staff, they were fantastic enough to upgrade us to a larger room with ample room for everyone. Though I had to settle for a lower floor (really, a mid floor), I had no problem with noise and a good view of the Hudson. The staff at check-in were the epitome of great service, and many hotels could do well to learn from this one. Linens for the sofabed were brought up within minutes, and room service even offered to make the sofabed (though we turned down since wanted to use the sofa during the day). Housekeeping was also fantastic.\n\nThe room itself was a corner room, with two great views (great for NY, anyway). The King bed was excellent, and the sofa bed was surprisingly comfortable as well. My only concern with the hotel was that the thermostat was located between windows; this caused the room to get very hot as the heater overcompensated. Fortunately, I was able to move the wireless thermostat to a nightstand and had no further issues.\n\nThe hotel is seconds from the world trade center, but is a moderate walk from any subway station if you're relying on public transportation. I will probably stay here again on business travel, and though it's further out from some of the tourism scene, it's  near the statue of liberty and wouldn't be a bad choice for leisure trips.","travelDate":"2015-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The room was modern, clean and nicely designed. By New York standards it was a decent size but bear in mind that's still small compared to everywhere else. The lack of free wifi (~$10 per person per day) is a little frustrating in a hotel that is already quite expensive. We enquired about the possibility of getting an extra roll-away bed in the room but were told this was $30 a night and I'm not sure how it would have fitted in the room. The staff were friendly and accommodating when we had different bookings for each night we were here and wanted to stay in the same room for both.\n\nLocation wise the hotel is good for the Statue of Liberty and 9\/11 Memorial. You're close to the subway but bear in mind getting to mid-town will take you 25-30mins. If you do stay here I recommend George's diner round the corner, the breakfast is great.","travelDate":"2015-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}
