When I got into the room, I did not get that design. In fact, the room was very outdated - it clearly needs to be renovated. A few issues I encountered: lights of the room were malfunctioning (I would turn off the bathroom light and it was connected to the rest of the room, the light to the hallway turns off the light in the bathroom if you turn it on), the \"private\" button on the lamp would turn off randomly, the pillows were incredibly flat, we never received robes in the closet, and the floor lamps would not work, I could not get them to turn off. I went to the restaurant for a late breakfast at approximately 11:57 AM. They told us they would let us come and sit down, and did inform us that the kitchen was closing in 2 minutes. Although I appreciate the dining staff allowing us to come in and eat when closing time was coming up, but in hindsight and on my experience however, I would've rather them to tell us they were closed and not sat us. I felt entirely too rushed - the waiter was extremely impatient with me and friend. The food (the turkey bacon to be exact) was cold, service workers were restocking and cleaning things as we were trying to eat, making loud noises. To the point where the experience was ruined. And lastly, the prices for the food was extremely high for such mediocre food and experience. The French toast was about $30 and it was only 2-3 small pieces and the turkey bacon was about $14 and like I said, it was ice cold. I normally would speak to the server and ask for assistance but based on his urgency to rush us out - I knew he wouldn't be receptive and helpful. The staff seemed more interested in getting us out of the restaurant than ensuring we had a good restaurant experience. Based on the price, the description, and the photos, I was expecting a high class hotel with luxury amenities and I feel like my experience here was average. In fact, I feel confident that I would've gotten a better experience at a more affordable hotel. I'm disappointed because based on the hotel's website, I was very excited to stay here but it did not meet my expectations or meet the standard based on the costs it took to stay here.

This was not a five star hotel experience.  The hotel lobby was the only nice place I saw in this hotel. \n\nI stayed on the 51st floor of the Towers for four nights and did not have a single good nights rest.  After a full day of traveling, I wanted to sleep in the next morning but was awoken by a 6am alarm that they forgot to turn off when the last guest left. Also, for the first couple of nights I woke up at 230am and thought I heard some loud music. It was very brief but kept happening each night around the same time. I thought I could have been dreaming but finally on my last night, I set up my camera and right at 230am something in the room played a loud musical sound. I have no idea what it could have been since everything was turned off. \n\nMy first morning, my black out blinds would not open so I couldn\u2019t enjoy the sunshine and view. \n\nOn my third day there, the water pump in the Towers broke and I could not shower in my room.

For the second time I had to gather some things and shower in another room. By the way, the non-Towers room that I showered in had a better view and looked cleaner\/newer.   I didn\u2019t have time to pack all of my things to do my after shower care and get dressed so I had to walk through the lobby in my robe and hair towel the both times I had to shower elsewhere.  They didn\u2019t even offer to change me to another room but kept telling me to wait because the water would be back on, although they didn\u2019t know when it would be back on.  \n\nThere is nothing VIP about staying in the Towers. Their website boasts \u201cspacious marble baths\u201d and \u201cnightly turndown service.\u201d  I had an old outdated walk-in shower with no bath and no one came by any of the nights to do a turndown service.  Save your money and stay on the less expensive side.

I rented two rooms at the Lotte NY Palace - one for the children in the main hotel, and one in the Towers for my wife and me.  Our family has been coming to NYC and staying at the Lotte for many years; it has been a family tradition.  We will no longer be staying at the Lotte.  There are three main complaints.  First, when my son checked into his room, the water from the room's plumbing was brown.  Second, the service at the Gold Room restaurant was horrible all three days.  But by far my biggest complaint was that on a busy President's weekend, the Tower's two elevators were BOTH out of service.  Everyone staying in the Towers had to use a single freight elevator.  As a result, on the first morning of our stay, it took me 35 minutes to get from the floor my room was on to the lobby, making me 30 minutes late for a breakfast meeting.  From that point on, I had to use the main elevators in the hotel (not the Towers elevators), take them to the 39th floor, and then take the stairs up to the 45th floor.  I am 70 years old with a very bad back.  I had just had one ablation performed a week  or so prior to arriving at the Lotte and I have a second ablation schedule the day after leaving NYC.  To pay the rates this hotel charges for the Tower and then be forced to walk steps to my room with a back in my condition is just completely unacceptable.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Its jaw-dropping beauty and grandeur are matched by incredible warmth and attention. We consider it a home away from home. Last trip, we were met with a room upgrade as our little girl was greeted \u201cWelcome, Princess.\u201d She was swept into her latest fairytale stay by George K., who surprised her with a tiara while she was twirling at the center of the marble lobby. From then on, every day, she would ask at the desk when he would be in, and every time he saw her, he would say \u201cI have something for you.\u201d A Lotte teddy bear, a story about the mansion, or an umbrella on a misty day, most treasured was his time and interest. He knows and deeply cares about all, both Lotte and the guests drawn to it.\n\nOur experience as a family was of the utmost importance, and that was made abundantly clear when working with Ruth in the front office, who deftly handled changes in our reservation due to an unexpected dignitary\u2019s arrival. She gave us the same level of attention as she did every effort to accommodate incoming VIP requests. Her decision-making led to staying in a lofty Tower suite\u2014after giving our little one the key card to approve\u2014keeping the same view we originally had of St. Patrick\u2019s, now 20 floors higher. Nothing compares to starting and ending the day gazing at one iconic building from the perch of another, and thanks to Ruth\u2019s thoughtfulness.\n\nComing and going means cheery greetings along the way. Seeing a nod and a smile from Rebecca in the Towers lobby let us know that she was keenly aware and personally appreciative of our delight, as much as we were in awe of her talent in paying particular attention to everything, all at once. Our checkout with her was that of a gracious host, when saying goodbye means only looking forward to the next time. \n\nWe cannot wait for upcoming stays, sweeping through the front entrance, strolling across the courtyard, taking portraits on the grand staircase, and happily settling in after our mad dashes through the city.

The lady at the desk told us how lucky we were and that it wasn\u2019t down to British Airways it was the hotel and we should be very grateful. I left my phone number and was told as soon the rooms were ready we\u2019d be contact. \n\nAt 4pm I returned to the lobby ( no call received) to queue again for 30 mins. \nRoom keys in hand we excitedly worked our way through the packed lobby to the lifts, queued again for 10 mins. \n\nOn entering the room there was a closet on the left with safe box and ample hanging space, robes and slippers. The bathroom was opposite. This was very dated and only a bath with shower overhead. Really disappointing and similar to a Hampton Inn (which we don\u2019t mind staying in for $150 per night). \nThe room was large but tired and tatty. \nWith a desk, small round table and a couple of chairs. \nThis to note: there was no fridge or mini bar but more importantly for us no coffee or tea making facilities. For a 5 star hotel this is poor! We were exhausted after leaving the UK at 5am and had no energy to complain. \nThis morning we woke at 4am to no coffee! Called guest services and were informed there is no where to get a coffee\/refreshments until 6.30am. No room service. Only option to find somewhere on the street. \n\nThis hotel has been great disappointment. If you plan on coming here for the Christmas period don\u2019t bother, pop in to check out the lobby and the beautiful decorations however don\u2019t bother trying to get a seat in the bar as it\u2019s packed.

Large rooms, very comfortable beds and pillows.  \nGood temperature controls. \nExcellent soundproofing - we slept great. \nThe staff are wonderful and so helpful and friendly. A credit to the hotel.  I know he gets mentioned a lot but Ray the doorman is the best!  I must also mention Christian the concierge, who arranged a dinner for us Saturday night at a local italian.  He was so helpful and professional and wanted feedback the next day, which we happily gave him.  \nWe loved the Pomme Palais coffee shop inside the lobby lounge.

We spoke to reception, and housekeeping sent up a huge fridge, kettle with cups etc which we really appreciated, but told us some safes were being refurbished\/replaced and we were welcome to open a security deposit box in their office.  We took them up on this for our valuables, money etc, but it was so annoying to have to go to the front desk, and meet a member of staff in the office and complete paperwork everytime we needed to get something out.

It is simply superb.\n\nLocation:\nThe hotel is on Madison Avenue between 50th and 51st streets. The 6 line subway entrance is 2 blocks east and the E and F lines are two blocks away north at the 53st street station. Using the subway or walking, any part of Manhattan was reachable; even going to Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO in Brooklyn was fairly direct.\n\nRoom:\nWe had a room with two double beds even though it was just two of us. We did inquire for a King room instead but I had booked a double room originally as there were no king room options at the time of booking. One huge plus was getting the Cathedral view, in other words, overlooking St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral next door. We were on the 33rd floor, so it was also possible to see how crowded Rockefeller Center and Fifth avenue were from the room.\n\nCloset and Storage space:\nThe room had a very generously sized lighted closet which also had a large in-room safe, umbrella, robes, and slippers. There were also an ample number of dressers to store clothes and other belongings. Overall, there was space to walk around. Some rooms in the city are so cramped that even walking in the room can be challenging but not this place.\n\nBathroom:\nThe bathroom had both a shower and bathtub. The toilet was the quietest I have ever heard when flushed. There was also a hairdryer and lighted makeup mirror to get ready for a new day.\n\nClimate control:\nTo adjust the temperature of the room, there was a center console on the night stand beside the bed. The console had both a thermostat to set the temperature in Fahrenheit as well as 3 fan settings, including turning off the fan entirely. For a cold December night in New York, the heating worked without any problems.\n\nExterior noise:\nThe hotel was well insulated against noise. There was hardly any noise from the hallway or the adjoining room. The only thing heard was whenever the blinds for the windows were being raised or lowered.\n\nWi-Fi and TV\nWi-fi was complementary (you get the password once you check in) and there were many channels available on the TV. There are also HDMI ports on the TV to watch your own content on your device as long as you bring an HDMI cable with you.\n\nElevators:\nAsk for a high floor when checking in. There were times when the elevator got full going down that anyone in the middle or lower floors could not get on and would have to wait for the next one. The wait for an elevator was not too long but having to wait for one with free space repeatedly can be challenge and requires patience.\n\nCheck in and check out\nLuckily, check in was only a 10 minute wait before our turn. However, I did notice the lobby heavily crowded during my stay for people waiting to check in. Check out can be done by texting the hotel at the designated phone number when it comes time to leave. Should you need to go directly to the airport after checking out, there is a taxi stand right outside the 50st entrance. Inform the hotel doorman you need a taxi, who will then take you to the first available taxi.\n\nLobby:\nThe lobby was vast and beautiful with a historic touch, featuring entrances on 50th and 51st streets, as well as Madison Avenue. The 51st entrance also allowed access to the on site coffee shop as well as the gift shop. \n\nConcierge:\nMr. Christian Ribeiro provided us with exemplary service, signing us up for a complementary tour of the hotel and the historic Villard mansion that is on site by Kevin Draper, who was very knowledgeable about New York\u2019s history.\n\nDecember extras:\nThe Madison Avenue courtyard was filled with lovely Christmas decorations featuring a wonderful tree, which some people admit was more attractive than the larger one in Rockefeller Center. The courtyard also featured a bar of hot drinks to celebrate the season.\n\nThe Radio City Rockettes also visited the hotel, who were more than happy to pose for photos with any interested guests.\n\nOverall:\nThe Lotte New York Palace is a very large hotel. It isn\u2019t perfect but it gets a lot of things right versus some of the criticisms other reviewers have left. This is my eighth visit to the city in 15 years. This hotel is tied for the number 1 spot overall in my book and is the champ for Midtown (the other hotel that tied with it is downtown). Lotte is a South Korean company; if you don\u2019t already know, Koreans take hospitality of their guests seriously which is definitely evident here at the New York Palace.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The decorations throughout the lobby like up to expectations. In addition, the rooms are surprisingly roomy by NYC standards and the location works very well. Views from the room (Cathedral view) were above average too.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot to cause disappointment which seems to be reflected in other recent reviews. My own observations;\n- while large, the rooms are very sparse. Furniture is on a par with a bog standard Marriott\n- if you like the idea of the Gold Room, note it is smaller than it appears on the website (although just as well appointed) and they don\u2019t take reservations. A fair few people on the waiting list are non-guests so you\u2019re hanging around quite a bit to get a table. Other common areas similarly busy.\n- the lifts are a real problem. On some days only one of six seemed to be in action, big queues in the lobby, then lifts are fully occupied when you try to come down meaning I had to use the fire escape stairs on a few occasions. Not an option if you\u2019ve limited mobility. While many hotels experience a morning and afternoon \u2018rush hour\u2019 I\u2019ve never seen it cause problems like this.\n- Staff are a mixed bag. At best they\u2019re indifferent, at worst they\u2019re downright rude. Generally, it\u2019s all a robotic, a bit like the copy\/paste response I see the Manager has left by way of reply on all the poor reviews.\n\nAside from the lobby, which anyone can visit (and they do - see other reviewer comments on Instagram influencers spoiling it for paying guests) there\u2019s really nothing to justify the $1.200 per night for a regular room.

Our current stay so far has been far from a five star experience.  We stood in line forever to check in.  At first there were only two check in staff members.  After quite a while,  a third arrived.  None seemed interested in speeding the process check-in process along. After each check-in, it seemed to take forever for the next prospective guest to be invited to the desk.  The check in line became longer and longer snaking throughout the hotel entrance area.  One guest in line before us approached the desk without being invited and was quickly chastised and told to wait to be called.  Another guest clearly had lost her patience with the long wait by the time called, but understandably so.  Despite our wait, we approached with a cheery attitude and yet were met with a chilly robotic response from our receptionist.  During the entire check-in process, the only staff member who truly made us feel welcomed at the hotel was a bellman named Matt who brought out an arm full of waters to offer to the long line of guests waiting to check in.  Our room was not ready, despite an early check-in request made long ago, but  grace is given for that due to the season.  As instructed, we checked our bags with the bellman.  However, there was no seat was to be found in the hotel.  It was cold outside causing me to realize I needed access to my bags for an additional coat and gloves.  That involved a trip with a bellman to the 9th floor to retrieve an additional coat and gloves.  After securing additional clothing layers, we ventured forth.  Eventually we received word that our room was ready.  However, rather than having our bags in our room upon our return, we had to go through an additional check in process for keys and then take a blue card to the bellmen station.  Thereafter, it took forever for our bags to be delivered to our room, the eventual and untimely delivery which interrupted our attempt to rest.  Our room is spacious by New York standards but our decor looks tired and worn. One light does not work in our room and another only intermittently.  The bathroom lighting is  dim.  The housekeeping staff failed to leave robes or a coffee maker in our room, which required a front desk request.  Our robes and a coffee maker were eventually delivered, but long after our request.

The rate was approximately U$D1000 per night.  The hotel occupies a handy, mid-town position near all the department stores, Radio City and the Rockefeller Centre.  It\u2019s about 10 blocks south of Central Park.\n\nThe website naturally makes much of the handsome, 19th century villa that fronts onto Madison Avenue.  The hotel, however, only has access to a very small part of this building and none of the guest rooms are contained within.  Rooms are in the nondescript, black (ex-office?) building that rises behind.  Guests are able to visit the villa by appointment on Saturday mornings.\n\nSuperlatives swirl like winter storms on the website but the reality is far removed from the description which runs:\n . . . . Towers at Lotte New York Palace is among the most sought-after luxury hotels in Midtown Manhattan. Regularly ranked among the world\u2019s premier hotels, the Towers is a glamorous collection of bespoke guest rooms . . . \n\nThe common areas enjoy customary high ceilings and sweeping marble staircases but the impression once this is left behind is one of faded grandeur and a reputation that is far removed from the shabby fixtures and fittings.  More specifically:\n\n\u2022\tAdvertised services including the butler, packing and unpacking, complimentary pressing and Maybach car service were never offered.  Perhaps you have to ask, but then what\u2019s the point of advertising them?\n\u2022\tPre-arrival, the \u2018concierge service\u2019 failed to respond to my two queries, despite two separate prompts\n\u2022\tAlthough our room was huge, there was no separate sitting area, so it felt empty and unwelcoming\n\u2022\tThe room lighting had no overhead lights (except the hallway and bathroom) or recesses to create atmosphere\n\u2022\tThere were two closets \u2013 one a vast walk-in that no guest could ever utilise and the other of average size.  I\u2019m not complaining about too much closet space but it highlighted the size of the room rather than its utility or design touches\n\u2022\tThe TV was so old it didn\u2019t have Bluetooth and there was no other way to play music (not even a bedside alarm clock)\n\u2022\tThere was one USB socket in the entire room\n\u2022\tThe minibar had been removed and boarded shut\n\u2022\tThere was no turn-down service or bottled water\n\u2022\tThere were no in-room tea or coffee making facilities\n\u2022\tThe bathroom was a three-piece \u2013 i.e. no his \u2018n\u2019 hers basins and no bidet or bath\n\u2022\tThe \u2018finest amenities\u2019 were Molton Brown \n\u2022\tThere was no extractor fan in the bathroom\n\u2022\tThe \u2018entirely private\u2019 Towers involve no more a separate check in desk and a separate lift (that runs next to the main lift) and rooms on higher floors.  There is no \u2018club floor\u2019 for breakfast \/ work \/ coffees and no other benefits that I could discern (see above)\n\u2022\tThe public areas on our floor were tatty with the walls marked with the passage of countless housekeeping trollies.\n\nWe very much enjoyed the Gold Bar (in the villa) and the hotel is conveniently situated but, overall, it was desperately underwhelming compared to, say, the St. Regis where we stayed on our last visit.\n\nTo balance the feedback, perhaps U$D1000 is just what you pay these days for a room in Midtown New York but the Lotte Palace struck us as appalling value and nowhere near deserving of its 5* rating.\n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It's hard to understand how it's earned the accolade and it definitely carries the price tag. The rooms are extremely dated, verging on tired. The bathroom reminds me of my walk up studio apartment as a student. 1 ply loo roll is indicative of the lack of luxury. You need to allow 15 minutes to get to your room if you're on the 30th floor as there is no express and you stop on every floor. There is no way of charging via USB, something you can do in any fast food joint. They can't\/won't charge for you at reception. I am writing this from my room as the bar doesn't open until 5pm and the foyer is full (and hot as an oven). This is a small blessing as a martini goes for $35 inc tip. Sadly I can't have a coffee as there are no facilities. I'd happily settle for a beer but there isn't a mini bar.\n\nI wouldn't be writing this if the Palace was billed as a 3* hotel.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":126260,"title":"Grande Dame With Management Issues","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-11-12","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"This is my third stay at the Lotte, and I had hoped that it had improved since last year, but I encountered a number of problems. We stayed in a two room suite for nine nights, and here is a recap.  \n\nFirst, the many good points. The location in midtown is terrific, especially if you are going to the theater. The view from our suite was outstanding!  Easy walking distance to Broadway, but far enough away you aren't in constant crowds. Even better access to the luxury shopping on 5th Avenue, and a pleasant walk to the park. Champagne on arrival! The hotel is housed in a glorious, historic building, with great dining and cocktail options. I especially like the Gold Bar, and the bartender was terrific! Our suite was very large, with comfy beds, and good Moulton Brown toiletries. We encountered many nice staff.\n\nThe not-so-good. It is very clear that the hotel suffers from management and communication issues, and a lack of attention to detail. The rooms are looking a bit aged. I certainly would not consider it a 5 star hotel. Our suite had peeling wall paper, plumbing issues, the door bell did not work, and it appeared that some of the furniture featured in the advertising had been removed from the suite. The suite was also very barren - especially for a room that costs over $2000 per day. No glasses or cups. It did have a wine cooler and microwave, but the refrigerator had been removed, leaving a gaping hole in the cabinet with wires coming out. There is not mini-bar. I remembered from my last visit that they do not put coffee makers in the room (very bizarre for a hotel that bills itself the way they do), so I called in advance and asked they have one in the room. I was told they could not guarantee that (in my $2000 plus room) - and to ask when I checked in. (Ridiculous.) I did, and they delivered a nice Nespresso maker and two cups. However, for some reason every day they would remove the coffee cups and the sugar service, and we had to call down to get it replaced. Every day they would strip the room of cups, glasses, and coffee - and we later learned that room service and housekeeping do not communicate. We were instructed to deal with each separately. On our final night we hosted a party, ordering a couple thousand dollars worth of room service, and later that night when we returned they provided turn down, but had not cleaned the room. Housekeeping informed us that they do not communicate with room service, and it was our responsibility to deal with each on our own. We asked to discuss the situation with the manager in the morning, and were assured they would contact us, but we never heard from them.\n\nNone of this would be acceptable in a 5 star hotel. Every staff member should be trained to work together to ensure a great experience for the guest. Management should be accessible and strive to provide the best possible experience.  Bottom line - this is a beautiful hotel that need updating and love, and management committed to delivering a superlative experience.  \n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We frequent NYC several times a year and have stayed at all sorts of hotels in all areas, but as it was a special occasion, we wanted to splurge on something a little special and did so thinking this hotel would be a bit more high end than our usual stays.  However, the hotel did not hold up to our expectations.  \n\nOutside of the grand lobby, beautiful hotel bars\/restaurants and spacious sized rooms (especially by nyc standards) there is not much I'd consider \"luxury\".  The hotel itself is clean and centrally located, but feels incredibly dated, especially for the price point.  The robes and towels were stiff and scratchy.  There was a bit of peeling wall paper and a musty scent when we first got there.  The thermostat was temperamental and the lights system was weird and dated and there was no fridge or mini bar.  We found the linens nice enough but the bed a little too soft and even after requesting pillows 2x we only were able to get down pillows (not foam- though I was given a choice on the phone).  Room service options were also pretty limited and we found the concierge services by text a super helpful feature, but the brunch spot they suggested was lackluster.   I can also say that we did not experience any of the top notch customer service that everyone else seems to boast about. Everyone we encountered was nice enough and perhaps it is because we booked through a third party or were not staying in the fancy section (the towers) but all interactions were very brief and nothing like described in the other reviews.  This was fine with us (we are pretty self sufficient in the city) but we felt worth mentioning in case that was the basis on which someone might book this hotel.\n\nLastly, our final morning was what really cemented our feelings on Lotte. To begin with, we woke up and no longer had cell service in our room (and Wi-Fi is a laughable $15\/day). I'm not sure if this was some kind of tactic to get us to leave or pure coincidence but it was incredibly frustrating to not be able to look up train schedules and breakfast options etc.  Additionally, around 11am the fire alarm went off roughly a dozen times.  At first we instinctually started throwing on clothes and grabbing our stuff, thinking we needed to evacuate (we actually have been in a hotel that caught on fire, so we take alarms seriously).  After the alarm stopped and re-started several times we called the front desk to see what was going on and found out they were testing the alarms.  We were relieved but also, why not alert your guests- especially considering you have the communication via text feature?  Would it have  been that hard to send out a text alert??  Maybe it was just our PTSD but it did not leave us with a good taste in our mouth regarding an already borderline experience here.  \n\nTLDR: Hotel is clean, spacious and in a great, central, location especially if you're coming in via Grand Central.  However, I would not consider this a \"luxury\" hotel and wish we stayed at one of our usual spots for considerably less money.  I wouldn't tell anyone they necessarily shouldn't stay here but I would advise looking into other options, especially given how many there are in the area.  (Also, hope they aren't doing a fire alarm test during your stay!) ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Despite the hotel billing itself as a luxury destination, I vehemently disagree. \n\nPositives: room size is excellent and the location is convenient to a number of tourist destinations. Also when I needed a recommendation for alternatives to a restaurant we had originally wanted to go to, but decided to forego, the Towers' concierge was helpful in providing a few good suggestions and helped us make the reservation. \n\nNegatives: Housekeeping was pathetic as we had asked for our room to be cleaned when we went out for the afternoon and after 5+ hours, nothing had been done. We then asked for towels, and it took them ~3 hours to get us those towels, after calling multiple times. Most breakfast items at the Villard restaurant were not only sub-standard, they also were unbelievably overpriced for what we received. It felt nothing short of daylight robbery... for example, $12 for a few rubbery and tough chicken sausages! The main hotel concierge was incredibly misleading. We signed up for the St Patrick's private tour for $500, which ended up being only semi-private. When booking with the concierge, I had also asked if the tour included the Catacombs, and the concierge gave me a resounding \"Yes\"! And lo and behold...no Catacombs tour...that takes place at the old St Patrick's location and is completely separate. On our day of departure, I asked how long it would take for us to take a cab to Moynihan Train station. The bellman said 30 minutes would be plenty. When we came back 30 minutes later with more than 50 minutes until our train departed, another bellman (who did not even approach us, although we were standing outside for a good 10+ minutes) said it would take us at least 30 minutes to even get a cab (due to the Columbus Day parade). The misleading advice from the first bellman and the inattention from the second one meant we missed our train ride and had to rent a car to get home instead. Overall an incredibly unsatisfactory and unacceptable stay. This is no 5-star hotel and should be ashamed to call itself as such.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":126260,"title":"Nice Hotel That Doesn't Live up to Its Price  ","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"The hotel is in a great location and has some incredible views from the towers. If it were price around 30-40% lower, I would give it a much higher review. However, given that it is one of the most expensive hotels in the city, it has to be live up to that level of quality and it doesn't meet the mark. \n\nCheck in took over 20 mins due to some confusion about getting the reservations on the same floor. Management was very nice about it, it shouldn't have taken so long and required management's intervention. The desk staff should have more autonomy to solve problems.\n\nThe rooms are clean and the fixtures and furniture are decent, but they aren't super high quality like you'll find at other luxury hotels. The room lacked sufficient power outlets for charging phones. E.g. there was a power block on one side of the bed, but not both. The mini fridge was not stocked and there was a second fridge in a corner of the room that made it feel more like a college dorm room than a luxury hotel room. They did have a nice creston system for controlling the lights and the shades, but it didn't control all of the lights, so you had to get up and shut them all off using a switch by the door.  \n\nThe Goldroom has an incredible ornate ceiling. Unfortunately, we couldn't enjoy it because there is not enough bar space for hotel guests. We were told that our best bet was to take our drinks to go and find a place to sit in a room way off the lobby. The staff complained that they were suffering from not having enough resources to staff the bar properly \"since the pandemic\". The pandemic ended a long time ago and the property is charging $30 for a basic cocktail. If you can't find talent to work for tips on that kind of tab, you're probably doing something wrong. \n\nWe had breakfast twice in Villard. The food was very good both times. The service was inconsistent - a bit rough around the edges at times. In general, some of the staff seemed experienced and others needed better training. E.g., set the coffee down on the table next vs handing it over from across the entire table.  That's not a big deal at all, but it just doesn't fit when you're paying $80 per person for breakfast. \n\nOverall, I think that the hotel is pretty good and if the price were lowered to align with the value, it could be great.

However, the service is where this hotel really falls apart excluding the reception desk, they were very nice.\n\nWe stayed 4 nights in the family room and while the room itself was quite large and had a fantastic view of St Patrick, it is extremely dated. Furthermore, it just seemed messy and the room wasn't thought out very well. Our room had a bidet sprayer next to the toilet which is much appreciated as most hotels don't have this, but no spray holder?? So it was just dangling on the floor, leaking water.\n\nFurthermore, a coffee maker and refrigerator weren't in the room and we had to request them. When they came, the guy bringing it looked at me as he finished installing it like he was expecting a tip?? Like really?? For something that should've been there in the first place????\n\nGuest services were awful. Requests for water, towels, etc came in a minimum of 20 minutes or sometimes they would not come at all. Housekeeping would sometimes clean the drinking glasses in your room and sometimes they did not. Bed linens were often messy and crumpled despite asking for linens to be changed by putting the card on the bed. Housekeeping may be a known problem since the first thing the bellman said to us as he delivered the bags was \"Put on slippers, the carpets aren't clean\" since we had our shoes off.\n\nAlso, a final thing is that they have these palace tours every Saturday. When we joined, there were a few guests which we found out weren't hotel guests. I don't think that's fair for the hotel guests. They should have a check of some sort.\n\nEveryone in the hotel seemed to be hoping for a tip. Not impressed.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Lotte has always felt like a special place for my family and I. From the moment you exit your car, you are greeted with warmth and hospitality. Everyone is interested to know where you came from, what your plans are during your stay, and most importantly trying to make the first leg (entering the hotel) a pleasurable one. George is always smiling when people enter! The hotel feels majestic upon entering with its marble floors and grand staircase beyond the entryway (which allows for great photo shoots), yet it also feels comfortable and relaxing. \n\nWhat we love about this hotel is that it does not matter whether you are staying in the Palace section or the Towers section to dictate how you will be treated. We have had most of our experiences in the Towers and are beyond grateful to have had the pleasure of working with staff that go above and beyond to please their clients. Namely, Miles Gomez, the front office manager, has always made us feel like true royalty. He greets you with the warmest smile and quickly offered my daughter a teddy bear and struck up a conversation with her. This was so refreshing to witness, as in some other fine  establishments we have stayed at, staff have completely ignored our children. Not Miles, he goes out of his way to engage all people in your company in conversation. We have also had so many positive experiences with Melody and Anne-Marie at the front desk at the Towers. If you need anything, just ask them and they will try everything to help you out! \n\nNow, onto the rooms.... The rooms are beyond spacious for NYC hotel spaces. They again evoke a feeling of old world charm meets modern. The bathroom marble gives you the old world, understated charm, and the modern amenities like the electric shades, lights etc. offers you the modern amenities that are always greatly appreciated. As noted, standard rooms are generous in size and comfortable. Bedding is luxurious and you will get a wonderful sleep! If you are able to upgrade a bit to one of their luxury suites you will not regret it! I implore you to treat yourself to it. They are beautiful and perfect for a night to hang in and order room service or just to offer up more space. The larger suites such as the triplex suites and specialty suites are so expansive and luxurious it is hard to even justify leaving them to go out for dinner. We love walking around the hotel in slippers and just enjoying looking around. \n\nAs far as food, you cannot go wrong with any of the dining choices at the hotel. Room service arrives hot and beautifully presented each time. The food at the Gold Room is fresh and what an exquisite place to enjoy a cocktail and have a bite with all of that gilded work around you. Nicola was fantastic as a server, and made sure that all of our needs were met, and again made conversation with us as we had known each other for years but just met. Villard also offers a fantastic breakfast. We were also excited to see Trouble's Trust open again for a cocktail!! If you have time the Chamber of Magic show is beyond incredible and is hosted at the Lotte on Friday and Saturday evenings. \n\nI can go on for pages about our experience here, but in sum, I would say I would highly recommend staying at the Lotte New York Palace for a quick getaway, an extended stay, or just a quick visit for a cocktail or bite. I hope you will enjoy it as much as we have enjoyed our home away from home. ","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There was an odor we couldn\u2019t quite get used to and outside our windows was loud. \n\nGetting assistance from hotel staff was a fight. We called up for more toiletries because they gave us one tiny bottle of shower gel. The order didn\u2019t come up for another 40 mins. The next morning we asked for orange juice, same thing. We left the area and went to Harlem for brunch. Later that day we had dinner at Nobu Downtown and returned. We wanted to have some wine but needed glasses and that was a struggle. The very next morning was my partners bday. I attempted to order room service but that seemed to be a struggle too so against my wishes, I went to a nearby restaurant (The Smith\u2019) that has a great reputation and brought back brunch. I stopped by the front desk and ask for a plate service and cart to be brought to the room so that I could surprise him with breakfast in bed that wasn\u2019t being served in foil containers. I had balloons and cupcakes and was really trying. The attendant at the back desk let me know that she didn\u2019t think they could assist with that. After about 20 mins the order finally arrived, struggling to get all the things into the room, I left one bag at the door to return for it. 1 min later I get back to the door and the bag is missing. I frantically go up and down the hallways only to see a cleaning lady with the bag. I was beyond frustrated. \n\nOverall, you\u2019re paying for the location- in essence to be close to Rockerfeller Center and everything that neighborhood comes with, not for the actual property or it\u2019s sub par service. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The front desk is set away from the general checkin for the lower floors, giving the whole process a lovely sense of exclusivity and charm.  Checkin was quick and easy, and Jim at the front desk is wonderful and welcoming.\n\nI stayed in a one bedroom Tower Corner Suite ... very spacious and elegant, with a large comfy bedroom, and an expansive living room with sweeping views of the city, 1-1\/2 marble bathrooms, and a kitchenette (microwave and fridge and sink, but no utensils or plates or even wine glasses, so not wildly useful).\n\nThere is a large work desk in the bedroom with plenty of plugs, and the internet is free and works well.  The interior furnishings are comfortable and traditional, and solidly built.  Lighting is controlled by a series of panels that offer different moods, and it works well.  There is a large in-room safe, and fully towels and robes.\n\nThe bathroom is large and clad in marble (and there is a guest powder room as well), with a separate shower stall and bathtub, two sinks, and acres of counter space.  Spotlessly clean!\n\nNewspapers are available in the lobby in the morning, and over the weekend complimentary champagne was served  in the lobby as well.\n\nWhat makes this property unique?  Extraordinary views.  Solid traditional furnishings.  Lots of space.  A feeling of elegance and grace.

When we checked out it took 45 minutes to get our vehicle which seemed very strange (The bell men agreed). We packed up the car and went on our way. We stopped about an hour after for a break and noticed a lot of deep yellow scratches on the front side corner of our BMW SUV. We called the hotel immediately to report it, however, it was so difficult to get in touch with the front desk. In fact, someone who answered at the hotel said good luck they will probably deny it. We finally got a hold of the General Manager after an hour of trying. At first he seemed very professional but after 3 weeks of back and forth he has completely brushed it under the rug. The valet clearly banged the side of the SUV on the yellow cement post in the tiny NYC garage where they parked my vehicle and that explains why he took 45 min to bring our SUV to us... We will have no choice but to take legal action against the hotel & the valet garage. So unfortunate and such a turn off. For a so called 5 star hotel to act so classless is disgusting.  We spent so much money at the Lotte (SO OVERPRICED) and to be treated this way it unacceptable. The garage is clearly dishonest and the Lotte clearly do not care about their customers.

Super friendly and super helpful. A special shout-out to Natsuko, who always goes above and beyond to make a great experience even better.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I am still on Cloud 9 thinking about the professionalism, attentiveness and warmth exhibited to our families and guests during the planning process and the wedding weekend. The hotel where your guests stay during a wedding weekend is very important to the entire event and the Lotte exceeded all our expectations.

I was so lucky to work with each of them, from working on the contract, to getting room reservation updates throughout to helping with all the special arrangements that come up even on the last day. Their responsiveness and graciousness were amazing even in the tension filled, demanding last days before the wedding.\nThe hotel is beautiful and spotless, and the rooms are very large especially for New York City. From the time we entered the hotel for the weekend, we truly felt as though we were in a Palace. The door staff, bell staff and front desk were excellent introductions to the hotel and made the start of the wedding weekend terrific. Security, needed when locked out of our room, was prompt and courteous and the housekeeping staff was friendly and wanted to take care of our every need. Our guests\u2019 welcome bags were delivered on time and correctly. A special thank you also to Ruthie, the front desk manager during our weekend. She made us feel as if we were in a hotel in a small town, not in New York City. She met us once only upon check-in and was on duty as we came in from the wedding reception.

What used to be a magnificent hotel now suffers from significant staffing issues that reflect negatively on the entire experience.\n\nTo start, the room amenities were subpar. The fridge in our room was not only turned off, but also blocked, rendering it unusable. Additionally, the lack of a coffee machine forced us to venture downstairs for our morning caffeine fix, which turned out to be an expensive endeavor. \n\nWhat was more disappointing was the seemingly careless approach to room maintenance. For instance, we spent an entire day without fresh towels. Also, the light switches were faulty and inconsistent in operation, making for an inconvenient stay.\n\nOur breakfast experience only compounded our discontent. Although it was included in our booking, the execution left much to be desired. On the first day, a 30-minute wait forced us to forgo our breakfast. On receiving the advice to reserve a table, I attempted to do so the following day, only to be met with no response despite two phone calls.\n\nWhen we finally arrived for our so-called \"reservation\", we were told that there would be an additional wait of 40 minutes. The reason given was, once again, the lack of staff - the same issue which apparently prevented them from answering the phone earlier.\n\nIn conclusion, our stay at the Lotte New York Palace was marked by numerous shortcomings. These ranged from poor room conditions to substandard service, both of which fell far below our expectations. The hotel needs to urgently address these issues to regain its status as a luxury destination.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It is stunning ...wow! \nI can't say enough about the staff from doormen to check in , room service and on our last day, the front desk manager Miles.  He was so helpful with check out time, offered information about the various tours the hotel provides: Gossip Girl Tour, History Tour and a new one that will be affiliated with St Patrick's Cathedral  which sounds amazing.

A man whose name I did not get, who brought us room service breakfast, also was so wonderful. They are amazing and truly provided us with A++ service. On another note, I did want to point out a rather unpleasant experience we had during check-in with a front desk agent named Michael Frick. He was extremely rude and unpleasant. Firstly, he did not greet us properly. I told him hello and the name for my reservation and he said, \u201cFirst off, we are going to start with some identification.\u201d He asked both my husband and I to provide ID and then proceeded to give me a hard time because the reservation was under my married name and the ID I presented still has my maiden name. He questioned this and the validity of my marriage, even asking when we got married. He explained to me that IDs matching the name on the reservation was important to the Palace and then asked me to provide him the reservation email that my father sent me, which I did. During this ordeal, Michael was disrespectful and talked down to us. This was not the experience I expected from an establishment such as the Lotte Palace. I understand needing to follow protocol, but I did not appreciate his attitude toward us. Michael really needs to work on his customer service skills. My husband and I felt disrespected and it left a rather bitter taste in our mouths. If it weren\u2019t for the amazing staff I mentioned above, this review could have been very different. Please make sure your front desk staff knows how to welcome and talk to guests with the same level of hospitality because it really sets the tone for a visit. Thank you.

I had previously stayed in the hotel prior to the pandemic. My opinion of this hotel is mixed with a few pros and cons. \n\nPROS\nThe staff is wonderful! I have nothing but good things to say about the people at the Lotte New York Palace. EVERY staff member I interacted with was friendly, pleasant and helpful. They go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and accommodate   requests when possible. \nThe location is great. One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was the central location. \n\nCONS \nThe rooms are tired and dated. We were originally booked in a Cathedral View Room but, when we arrived at the room, it just wasn't clean. I suffer from severe allergies and requested a thorough cleaning before we arrived at the hotel. Even still, there was dust on the baseboards and other hard surfaces, multiple stains on the carpet and dirt in the bathroom. We looked at a second room and that one was just as bad. In the end, we were moved to the Towers. The room there was better but still didn't feel 100% clean. The other issue was the lack of electrical outlets in the room. Only two were free and reachable, one in the far corner near the window and the other on the wall by the television. This may seem like a small inconvenience but it is a pain not having easy access to an outlet to charge devices.\nThe second con is entirely my own fault. I had requested an \"allergy friendly\" room originally, but forgot to request the same when we switched rooms. Unfortunately, whatever detergent was used on the linens and towels made me break out in a terrible rash that covered my arms, torso, back, neck and face and required a trip to the dermatologist upon arriving home. **If you have sensitive skin and\/or allergies I highly recommend you mention this ahead of time to avoid the discomfort I suffered.** \n\nWould I stay at the Lotte New York Palace again? The wonderful staff and convenient location makes me want to say yes, but it is unlikely I will return until the hotel has undergone some updating\/renovations.

All the staff are friendly, no complaints there.\nThings I felt could be improved - We had pastries\/coffee from Pomme Palais a couple of days but even that was over $60 a time. We went to Toasties\/SpringBone across the road instead. We didn't bother with the bar area after looking at the prices. I don't really think the prices for food\/drinks are justified for the hotel as certain things let it down from being 5 stars for us.\nNo USB sockets, which is pretty standard in hotels these days. Wish I had brought my own hairdryer as the supplied one was awful. No facilities to make tea or coffee either. There was an empty minibar but it had a really bad smell so never used it.

What an amazing hotel with equally amazing views! We loved our stay here and the hotel is in a great location.\nTo be fair we were that busy we did not avail ourselves of all the facilities the hotel had to offer such as dining but what we did see and use was all fantastic.\nAs it was our 25th wedding anniversary we splurged a little bit and paid for a high room with views of the cathedral - it did not disappoint. The best thing was that when we went in to the roms the blinds were closed so we got to reveal the view for ourselves -as this was our first visit the view didn't seem real, almost as if we were on some film set and the view had been painted on a wall. It was great! The room itself was very spacious and the room while immaculate (for me) had a little bit of a retro feel to it but in no way is that detrimental to the room.\nWe had a cocktail in in the lovely bar one evening and while expensive...wow you certainly got your money's worth with the amount of alcohol i them. My wife couldn't drink hers so I took one for the team and had hers too which by the time i got up to leave after two cocktails I was swaying!\nThe staff were all very friendly and professional but as I mentioned we were not in the hotel that long as we were dashing about. My main regret is that we were not in NYC longer to really appreciate the hotel. \nThis October we are returning back to NYC and unfortunately this hotel amazing as it is, is not out of our price range (\u00a31000) more than the mid range hotel we have now booked, nothing the hotel has done wrong its just that for a second visit (something we had not planned on doing) I couldn't justify the expense, that said I certainly know where to go for a cocktail!!!\n\n","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

So much elegance radiated from their pictures! There is also so much history in these walls. That's why we were willing to pay $600 per night. \n\nBut the odyssey took its course after a short time. The toilet did not work properly, the water rose almost to the brim and I was afraid it would flood the room. A hotel employee then sent a plumber, but he told us there was nothing wrong with the toilet. Fortunately, the incident did not happen again. \n\nThe next morning we noticed that the shower (with shower curtain) was blocked (see photos). \n\nIn addition, the room had not been renovated for decades. It smells of dust, everything is old - super old! There is no possibility to make coffee or tea. There are hardly any sockets in the room! \nThe only positive thing about the room is the size and the view. \n\nA hotel employee then offered us another room. We wanted to give the hotel one last chance. But already in the evening we noticed that the sink in this room was blocked (see photos). We then booked another hotel and cancelled our stay.\n\nWe were also very disappointed that none of the hotel staff apologised for the condition of the room. No one cared we left much earlier than originally planned. \n\nThis is not a 5 star hotel. Even in a Premiere Inn you find working toilets, showers and sinks! It was a very disappointing experience and also sad, because this hotel could be amazing if someone only put some money into an extensive renovation.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable, though the rooms are definitely dated (the bathrooms in particular) and are in need of updating. No smart tv, the outlets don't all work, etc. The first room I was given was dark and dank and on a low floor, so request a room on a higher floor if you can. The restaurant is highway robbery and would not recommend dining there - stick with pomme palais, where the staff is wonderful and the prices are a bit more reasonable. The gym is great and has what you need to get a good sweat in. The service is hit or miss - I found that if you don't fit the mold of a customer here (older, white, ostentatious displays of wealth) you probably won't be treated as well (e.g., doormen don't acknowledge or greet you upon arrival and did not offer to assist with my luggage, a fellow hotel guest thought i was his doordash delivery person, the busboy at the gold bar told me the small container of nuts would come at a charge *after* he brought them out, when we had spent hundreds of dollars at that point on food and drinks, etc).

We had a cathedral skyline room (3215).  Stunning skyline view of St Patrick's cathedral, down past Radio City Hall and to the river.  We were really pleased with our room, with a \"wow\" when we walked in at the size of it.  It was large for New York, lovely classic decor and spotlessly clean.  Table\/desk and two comfortable chairs by the window.  Very comfortable bed and crisp, white bed linen.  Pillows really comfortable too.  Good size closet with plenty of coat hangers for your clothes and space for shoes.  Large size safe in the closet that fit my handbag in and my husband's laptop plus other items of value we didn't wish to take out with us.  \n\nThe towels in the bathroom were lovely and fluffy, they all seemed brand new.  Molton Brown products were very nice.  There are new shower heads with a generous water pressure.  The shower is over the bath, as in many hotels.  The sink has plenty of space around it for storing your toiletries and also a shelf too which is great so nothing gets wet.    2 x bottles of water were replenished each day in the room.  The cleaning lady was very accommodating and friendly, even asking us what time we would like our room making up on one occasion. It was our 10th Wedding Anniversary, the hotel had noted this from our travel agent and delivered a plate of delicious macaroons and a congratulations card.  A nice gesture.  Wi-Fi was free with our reservation, don't know if this is the case for all as some reviews state a charge and we were expecting to pay.  So, a nice bonus.  Overall the room, 3215, was very quiet which was just what we wanted.\n\nThis hotel is comparatively over expensive (hence 4 not 5 star review).\nThere are no tea\/coffee making facilities in the room.  You can request it from housekeeping for $35.  $35 for every replenishment of coffee\/tea too.\nDrinks - glass of champagne $22.  Cheapest glass of wine $18.\nAmerican Breakfast for one: $49 plus $9 cup of coffee plus $8 glass of fresh orange\nPommes Palais - plastic cup of fruit (very fresh) $14\nAll the above prices are before tax and tips.\n\nReception staff - friendly.  Concierge - really helpful with restaurant recommendations. Bar tenders - warm and friendly too.\n\nThere is scaffolding around the hotel which makes the restaurant quite dark.  Apparently it's been there about a year.\n\nOverall, a lovely hotel, interior decor sophisticated and grand with a real wow factor.  It's in a great location.  Our stay was memorable and we would return.  It would be a 5* rating from us if some adjustments to over pricing and provide hot refreshment facilities in room.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon checking out from that stay Jimm at the Towers desk again arranged for myself my husband and my parents to be again in the same room at the Towers at a reduced rate. Miles called the day of our arrival to find out what time we would be arriving to ensure our room would be ready for an early check in. We spoke with him upon our arrival and were greeted with such warmth and kindness during an incredibly stressful\nTime. I was able to overlook St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral during all 3 recent stays and felt a sense of serenity. I was able to sleep\nThe night before a major surgery due to the quietness of the floor we were on as well as the luxurious linens and comfy beds. Gazing out at the NYC skyline as you fall asleep and wake up has no words  Upon walking into our room the day we checked in , we were greeted with the most beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers from Miles, Lincy and Jimm and the rest of the staff at the Palace along with a lovely note. They are still on my table at home and were one of the first things I saw when I woke up after surgery and put a smile on my face. We were treated with such kindness, compassionate and thoughtfulness during our stay. The staff truly went above and beyond to ensure that we had a wonderful stay. I will be needing more\nSurgeries later in the year and will\nAlso be taking out 9 year old to celebrate when I am done with treatments and surgeries.

Our flight was delayed by 10 hours (the Southwest debacle) - we called the Lotte to let them know we would be arriving much later than anticipated. They had no problem holding our room for us. Needless to say, we got in at 2am happy to be in New York and ready to get in bed. Stacy was absolutely lovely, welcoming and accommodating. She checked us in swiftly and has us on our way. Additionally, when we got to our room we found that Stacy had upgraded us to a room with a view - extremely unexpected. Later our departing flight was cancelled and all flights were booked so we had to extend our trip another day. The front desk staff was able to extend our stay, in our same room, for an additional night. Keep in mind we were there just days before NYE so I know they were probably close to capacity.

Our full wedding experience  3. Christmas! \nThe hotel looked beautiful on every photo and I honestly could not wait. I emailed the hotel ahead to let them know that we would be getting married whilst there and also spending Christmas with them and how excited we were. Thanks to Covid the wedding\/ trip got cancelled. We rebooked again for 2021, again i emailed to let them know that we were not given up hope on staying with them. Covid cancelled again. \nFINALLY 2022 was to be our year, we rebooked again, however the price for the hotel had increased substantially, but i wasnt about to let that stop me, we pulled all of our savings and reduced the stay from 10 nights to 8 nights (we still paid for a cathedral view though) and yet again emailed the hotel to express my excitement, I did also ask in my email if they had a laundry service as i'ld need to get my dress steamed on arrival and within 2 days, they responded a very basic response to ask the concierge upon check in.\n At check in, the lobby was a bit chaotic, just full of people and luggage and no real organisation. Once at the desk the woman made an exclamation about us being there for 8 nights, as i imagine not many guests stay in NY for that long, so we explained about getting married in 2 days and also asked about the laundry service, we received very basic service here but didn't mind as it was incredibly busy, but i had hoped that maybe there might be the offer of an upgrade, never mind though. The lifts were a nightmare, considering there were 6, we always found ourselves waiting a while. Finally got to our room and found it quite dated and tired looking, no basic amenities, you needed to phone down if you wanted to use the fridge, to borrow a kettle was an additional charge as well and not even as much as a \"Congrats\" note to be found in our room, which i found a little sad as even the most basic of B&B's back home make a special effort on someones birthday or anniversary, let alone their wedding! \nThe view was lovely, could just about see the Rockefeller tree, and the skyline really was something, but that is as far as the good review goes. \n\nOn the day of the wedding we came down in our wedding attire and had some photos with the Christmas decorations and then our limo picked us up at the lobby, the doorman Maurice was a treasure, a true gentleman and stopped traffic whilst i gathered my dress and ran to the limo. \n\nUpon returning after the wedding ceremony (still in my massive wedding dress), we had to ask the concierge for a spare key as we had of course left ours in the room in the rush of hte wedding chaos, again we had to stand and queue for a while in our wedding outfits to even get to the front desk. we quickly ran back in to get me out of my dress for the evening as it was too heavy. A this point, the hotel knew for sure i had gotten married and also knew my room number, so i was certain there would be at least a glass of prosecco waiting in the room for us, or maybe a compliment slip to wish us congrats, but there was absolutely nothing, not once did they make an effort to congratulate us on our wedding, which i find incredibly strange! \n\nAll in all, the location was good, door staff good, christmas decorations beautiful, but that's really it. I really wish i had saved myself about \u00a33,000 and booked the same hotel as my family as we visited there the night before the wedding and got chatting to the staff and they sent our table a complimentary bottle of prosecco to congratulate us! \n\nIt really does look beautiful on the photos, but the general public all access the decs anyways so honestly, save yourself the money and book a much cheaper hotel (Park Central was lovely), and visit the decs for free.

The hotel lobby is exactly as seen in all pictures online - absolutely stunning. The check in process was smooth and we were shown to our room on the 25th floor. \n\nThe room although basic (which I had read in reviews) was initially clean and tidy and had a large king bed and bathroom. I did feel that the dated look and lack of consumables was lacking for a 5* establishment though. More inline with 3-4* resorts I\u2019ve stayed in. \n\nThe room was quiet and private and we slept very well over all 5 nights. \n\nHowever, the negatives. On 2 occasions we received no room service at all. Leaving at 0730 and returning at 2000 (after getting engaged) to find a room that had received no house keeping. I know this time of year can be busy so I assumed maybe it was just an accident. Housekeeping just continuously told me to wait and have no valid reasons for this incident. After 90 minutes of waiting I went and spoke with a member of the reception team. I was told \u201cunfortunately we\u2019re short staffed and things will just be missed\u201d, which I thought was an awful way to provide an excuse. I was told someone would be sent up straight away. Another hour passed and still no member of the housekeeping team arrived. By this point I rang reception and told them we\u2019d need to go to sleep. 30 minutes later a member of the cleaning team let themselves into our room (nearly 11pm). Apparently she had only just been asked to clean this room as it was empty\u2026someone in the management set up was clearly struggling to communicate across departments. \n\nWhen we complained about this the following morning we were basically told to \u201cget back in our box\u201d and it became apparent the hotel was now prioritising guests for New Year and not their current incumbents. \n\nOverall, the hotel is stunning from a lobby\/communal perspective, but the rooms are way below the standard expected of a 5* hotel and the customer service was shocking at times which ultimately did impact on our stay. \n\nIf the hotel was to undergo a refurb of the rooms and the staff underwent a bit of customer service training this hotel would be superb!

One king and one double all attached to a living room, with two adjoining doors wide open.  We then went to dinner and upon our return at 11:45pm, the adjoining room was locked with some of our items inside.  I had missed a call from the manager named Ruth at 11:00pm, SIX hours after we had checked in stating that they had made ANOTHER MISTAKE by having all three rooms open as our room was supposed to just be the living room and king bedroom.  No one was staying in the adjoining room on this evening yet they made us move our items out, eventhough it was their mistake and nearly midnight at this point.  We then requested a roll away bed to be sent to the suite and had to wait 1.5 hours and did not receive the bed until well after 1:00am after along and exhausting day of travel.

Let me start by saying that the lobby of the hotel is exciting, luxurious, and spectacular, especially during the holidays. We were excited to stay at Lotte Palace based on the reviews we read, and things started off on a great foot when we were given an upgrade to a corner suite.\n\nGiven the upgrade, we were totally fine with not getting our room until later in the evening, especially since we had plans that would take us until after dinner. We were assured that the rollaways would be out and ready for our kids since they'd be pretty tired after a long day out, and all we needed to do was pick up the keys at the desk.\n\nWell, Lotte Palace is clearly understaffed for the size of the hotel. There were quite a number of disgruntled guests waiting in line in front of me with rooms that weren't ready (currently 7pm). There were 4 people working reception, and it took about 20 minutes for my turn to be up (about 5 groups in front of me). \n\nOnce we got up to our suite, we were very unimpressed. The decor was outdated. The kitchen had no utensils\/plates\/cups. There was no coffee machine of any kind. We had 2 bathrooms, and both of the toilets were runny (had to jostle with the handle to make them stop running). To top it all off, the rollaways weren't set up yet, and once we called down to request them, it took close to an hour for them to be brought up.\n\nTo compare, at either the Ritz or the Peninsula:\n- Kitchen? Fully stocked.\n- Coffee? Nespresso or Keurig.\n- Bathrooms? Fully functional, luxurious, and updated.\n- Extra beds? Not only were they ready when we were back from dinner, but there were slippers out for the kids and even personalized teddy bears when they were younger.\n\nUpon checking out, it took over 40 minutes from the moment we handed our luggage ticket to bellhop to have them retrieved from storage. I do not blame the staff here at all. They were working their butts off and were clearly understaffed for the size of hotel. \n\nAll that being said, it is unlikely that we'd stay at Lotte Palace again. The lobby and spa is spectacular, and the views of the city are incredible. Unfortunately, everything else just falls a bit short at the moment.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Luckily, we were on a higher floor, so it didn\u2019t cause much of an interruption for us, but I felt awful for the people on floors 5 through 20, who had to wait quite a while for an opening in the elevator.

The concierge staff were quick to get you to your room, while being very courteous and polite.\n\nThe room was bigger than expected and had a good sized closet to hide all of our clothes etc. There was an iron and ironing board should we need it (also had an umbrella, dressing gown and slippers which was a really nice touch). The bathroom was simple but perfect for what we needed, there was a hairdryer and loads of Molten Brown toiletries too. We brought food to the room quite often and there was a decent sized table with two seats where you could enjoy your meal in front of the spectacular view.\n\nHousekeeping were really nice and did a brilliant job. They were pleasant and thoughtful. They could see we were going through a lot of bottles of water, so they ended up giving us double. Genuinely the best housekeeping service that I\u2019ve experienced.\n\nThe hotel itself, the lobby, the courtyard etc is lovely. It was elegantly decorated for the festive period and really got me in the Christmas spirit. It\u2019s a very fancy lobby and has a grandeur staircase. The courtyard was under maintenance, but honestly the Christmas tree and decorations were still impressive and worth checking out. It seems like quite a lot of proposals happen there too! We were on the 31st floor and used the elevators every day. We read some reviews about them being slow, which I guess is quite subjective, but I don\u2019t think they were at all.

We came for a 2 night stay, excited at the prospect of a 5 star hotel in New York. This was not a 5-star experience. We arrived late after a long flight. The check in was matter of fact with virtually no information given (not even details of Wifi) The first night we hardly slept - we were allocated a room with 2 beds which I would class as large singes - for 3 people- meaning that the two of us sharing one of the beds had a very uncomfortable night. Most of the electrics didn\u2019t work, including the safe. The blind in the room also didn\u2019t work properly. We reported this the following morning and were promptly moved to a room with a king size bed and a sofa bed which was much better. We were told the sofa would be made up later in the day. We then had to call FIVE times for the bed to be made up (we would have done it ourselves if the bedding had been available). By the time they came to sort it it was just before midnight. All 3 of us (including a child) were exhausted after a long day in Manhattan and had been waiting to go to bed for an hour and a half. \nAll this and outdated features like shower curtains that don\u2019t stop the shower leaking and meagre toiletries (one set for 3 people).

The front desk staff - pretty much ignore ur existence, forget a friendly greeting, they act like they don\u2019t see you at all. Housekeeping was ABYSMAL! either they didn\u2019t show up- or when they did  come they did such a poor job that even amenities were never replaced. I had to call to ask for shampoo and shower gel - not sure if they expected that a singular bottle should last both of us for four days? Housekeeping would argue loudly in the hallways - loud enough for me to stick my head out and ask if everything was Al right?\nOverall- this was as far away from a five star experience as I have ever had in a hotel. I\u2019ve given them two stars, one for the speed at which room service delivered coffee- they told me 15 minutes or less the first time I ever called and I was skeptical- but it was always 15 minutes or less- the second is for the view and the spacious room.

There is much to like about this hotel - but it has some problems that stop it from being a great hotel. The high points:\n\n1. Great location in midtown, especially if you are shopping or going to the theater.\n\n2. Glorious historic building. Make sure you visit the Gold Bar - and take a look around the original structure.\n\n3. I had the Towers one bedroom suite, and it was huge! You could easily host a party for a dozen people comfortably. Great view, a comfy bed, and a big walk-in closet.\n\n4. It feels very safe. There is a private entrance to the Towers rooms within the hotel, so a good choice for those seeking a bit more security.\n\n5. Nice toiletries and linens.\n\n6. Power shades and a Crestron light control system.\n\n7. The staff was mostly friendly (but per the below - not very efficient).\n\nAnd the downsides...\n\nI arrived at 5:30 pm - anxious to shower and change clothes for an 8 pm dinner. Unfortunately my room was not ready - and I was told they would text me in 20 minutes when it would be done. They told me to go to the Gold Bar - and they would credit my room $200 for the inconvenience (which I thought was quite generous). I enjoyed the Gold Bar - but never received a text. Finally after an hour I went to the desk, and was told it was ready. They did not credit me $200 - but did pay for the drink I had.\n\nThe room does not come with a coffeemaker - which would be standard in any other luxury hotel. I called down and they sent a traditional 8 cup maker to the room, which is not ideal for one person but sufficed. The next day I called down for additional coffee since I had run out. It was not delivered. I asked again for it at the desk, was assured it would be delivered, but it never came. Called again - and the request was ignored. Asked at the desk again on my next trip ourt - and despite the promise my request was ignored.\n\nThe mini-bar has been shut down, all the glasses removed from the room, and a big ugly sign inserted on the front saying that due to covid it was not available. It is inconvenient - and greatly detracted from an otherwise pretty room.\n\nNo turn-down service. This is kind of a nice-to-have in these days - but I did expect it at this level of hotel.\n\nBe prepared for really expensive room service for breakfast. Coffee is $18 (not a designer coffee - just coffee) - and perhaps that is why they don't want you to make it in the room. Most breakfast entrees are around $50, so with tip it is easy to spend $100 a person for breakfast.\n\nThe place is looking dated. Like most older hotels, there are not enough plugs, so they put an ugly extension cord out for the desk that made a nice desk look like a temporary work space.\n\nSo I was satisfied with the hotel, loved the location and the classic aura, but I think there are some management issues that could make it a much better experience. My suggestions:\n\nPut in a single cup coffee maker.\n\nReconsider the mini-bar situation (there are safe ways to do it) - and at least stock the drinkware.\n\nSpend a couple hundred dollars per room to install wall plugs in key locations that accomodate guests' different charging requirements.\n\nDo some training with staff. Their followup is not good.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was not up to par this stay except for the bellmen and the valet guys....they were just awesome and the best thing about the hotel. To begin with the room is so dark and I cannot even see to put on my makeup...need lights in the bathrooms. I am a centurion card holder and our upgrade was not really an upgrade. I booked a room with a view of the cathedral thru centurion and that is just what I got. He said I got an upgrade but I do not agree. So breakfast in the Villard was slow and not  good service. Had to ask for water several times. When you pay over $100 for breakfast for 2....it should be good.  Room Service does not begin until 5 in the evening. Closed for part of the day. I feel like it was not up to what I am used to there.When you call the desk it rang 30 times before being answered and the desk manager was not available. No one ever answered the phones there for some reason.I hope you fix these things as it is not a great hotel at this time.  I know you must be aware of the issues.

It was nice walking around and seeing all the different places that pop up in the show. Unfortunately the famous court yard was under construction so we didn\u2019t get a chance for the photo ops but it still looked presentable and nothing like the scaffolding you come across in the UK. We stayed here for 4 nights 7-11th July as a young couple and I cannot fault the place. Upon arrival we were greeted and offered help with our bags. When checking in there were no resort fees which is a huge bonus as the last time we visited New York we stayed at the row which had a crazy $160 resort fee. You do pay a $100 for any additional charges you rack up but we didn\u2019t so this was returned when we left. The room was absolutely huge on the 34th floor. The rooms are a tiny bit dated, however with the style of the hotel a modern upgrade wouldn\u2019t fit.

This time there was very disappointing-there were many issues. I splurged on a large luxury suite for me and my kids. I was told it would be ready by 4-- it was not and at 5:30 we were still waiting. We needed to shower and get to ore-theater dinner- they offered us a \"comfort room\" which was a small regular room but that defeated the whole purpose of being able to get ready in luxury. Also we didn't want to unpack, shower, move rooms and not see the suite till midnight. The kids had to leave for dinner- by the time I got into the room after a lot of difficulties, it was covered in a layer of dust and there was trash in the cabinet. I called down and two lovely housekeepers came up to dust- completely great but I was paying a fortune and... at the point the front desk offered me half off. So then I had to head out and when I returned at midnight exhausted, the lights didn't work! I had to use the flashlight on my phone to call the front desk, an electrician came up and tripped the breaker and replaced light bulbs.  \nSigh.\nSuch a bummer!! \nThe manager offered free breakfast for all the trouble and was very apologetic. \nThat all said, I will give it one more try but I feel if you are charging this much $$ this was inexcusable.

I'm a very regular traveller to NY, always try to stay in the area of the Palace because is walking distance from the office of the company I work for.  My usual preferred hotel (Intercontinental Barclay) was fully booked, hence my Assistant booked the Palace.  \n\nCheck in was very fast and efficient. Arrived around 11:30AM, quite early for their check in time, but staff was very helpful and friendly and got me a room.  Very nice and client oriented staff at check in.\n\nRoom was really spacious for NY standards, clean and with a nice King size bed. I was on a high floor (32) hence had a great view from my room. I like the fact that you can open the window to let fresh air in. I'm not a big fan of Air-Con.\n\nNow, some of negatives:\nWi-fi charge - as a standard, the hotel charges USD 15,99\/day for wifi.  I was on a corporate rate and hence not charged, but the simple fact that a hotel where you pay hundreds of dollars as daily-rate charges for wifi is currently unacceptable.\n\nCoffee machine - I travel all over the US and a coffee machine, kettle or espresso machine (depending on the hotel) it's a standard. You find this simply everywhere, even on the cheapest place in the middle of no-where.  When I asked at reception about this, they told me that they were happy to send one to me room but that they charge a Daily coffee-service fee for this.....REALLY ???....This is really a cheap attitude.  I was shocked when I heard this response.   I wake up very early (5AM) to work and like my morning coffee....so needed to wait until 6AM to walk across the street to the Starbucks and buy coffee......because refused to pay USD 18+gratuity+delivery charge for room service coffee.\n\nRoom clean - the room was properly cleaned everyday. Issue I had was that I never got replaced the same number of towels I used....so on day 3 I had literally 2 towels in the room.....\n\nSleep quality - bed was quite big and comfortable.  Being on a high floor also allows for a good sleep because is a bit less noisy.\n\nRoom & equipment - room definitely requires some renovation. Furniture with scratches and TV quite old. The work area is really bad. There is one large table but the chairs\/mini-sofas are very, very low, hence uncomfortable to sit in front of my computer and work. I had to put one of the pillows from the bed on the sofa to sit a bit higher.  Room is not equipped according to today's tech needs, so no USB sockets nor chargers.  This is almost a standard on any 5-star hotel nowadays.  So make sure you bring your chargers.  \n\nIn summary, a hotel which is really behind the main competitors in the area, at least for a business traveller.  I will be back in NY in 6 weeks time, and really not sure if the Palace will be on the list of hotels I will consider for my next stay.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This is a beautiful hotel and everyone we encountered was so pleasant and made sure we had everything we needed. We had two rooms and they were right next to each other on the 20th floor. The views of the Cathedral were breathtaking. The room was quite large for NYC, with two queen beds. My only quibble was that one of the beds was fluffier and more comfortable than the other which was more firm than I would have liked. \n\nWe had drinks the night we arrived in the Gold Room--an absolute must. The room is stunning and part of the original Gilded Age mansion with high ceilings and gilded ceilings. My sister and niece had the Mrs. Astor cocktail--which my sister loved and my other niece had one that had smoky tequila and a rhubarb twist--she was planning ahead as we were going to a Mexican restaurant for dinner. I had a glass of one of the most delicious whites I've ever had, a silky smooth Pouilly Fouisse. A nice touch is that we were brought some complimentary nibbles, salty sweet warm nuts and a crispy lavash bread with olive tapenade. If we didn't have dinner reservations I would have had a second glass of wine. \n\nWe had brunch reservations at a nearby restaurant the next morning, so I ran down to the lobby for coffee and two tropical fruit cups, which were good and very fresh. We are gluten free, but if not I would have been tempted by the many pastries--croissants looked amazing. After our coffee, we met with Maurice, one of the security guards for a Gossip Girl tour. This was a highlight of our visit. I'm currently working on a novel set in the Gilded Age--and even if you are not a fan of the TV show Gossip Girl, you might enjoy this short tour--about 10-15 minutes. It goes into some of the historical rooms where scenes from the show were set--but these are also the original rooms from the Gilded Age mansion and they are stunning. Maurice took photos for us in some of the rooms and he has been with the hotel for many years. We enjoyed meeting him and loved the tour. \n\nWe left our bags with the bellmen while we had brunch and went shopping and that concluded our fabulous NYC visit.

At check in time on all days I noted there was only one person working the Tower check in desk so lines were long. This became an issue when our room key didn't work after a long day out and about and I had to wait in a long line to get a working key, thus making us rushed for dinner plans. The air down restaurant - The Villard - was also disorganized.

But not a 5","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-04-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Bare with me there is quite a bit to say about this place. \n\nLet's start\n\nWe were on an anniversary trip and since we hadn't been able to do anything for our tenth year we went all out. \nWhen I researched New York trips, this seemed to be the more neutral location to stay at. Noise level, business, proximity to activities, and whatnot. ( to be fair it was ) \n\nOur taxi driver from the airport wasn't bad 27 dollars and it was a semi-quick drive from La Guardia. ( Taxi is probably the easiest way to leave the airport ) \n\nWhen we arrived service was on point. Was greeted at the door and directed to the front desk. We were offered help with our rooms but we didn't have a lot with us. \n\nWhen we opened the door to the room I was a little underwhelmed. You can tell the age of the hotel in the room. Yet it is kept clean and you can tell they take pride in the location. I can't begin to imagine what kind of undertaking a remodel would be. Yet the reason why I gave it a lower score in value is, that for what I paid I would expect a lot more. \nThe bathroom was stocked well. Our mini fridge was empty. We had recently stayed at a hotel where the mini-fridge was full and was expecting this one to have at least the basics. Some of the lights were not controlled by the master control ( a system they have similar to Siri but it's a button instead of a command) \nThe bed was very comfortable. \nTv is still old-style tv. Doesn't support phone mirroring.\nThe outside noise level was very minimal.\nThe view we had was nice but not worth the extra $$$ to have it. I do prefer a room on the outer part of the hotel versus the center of it so don't mind it as much. Yet if I stayed here again I probably wouldn't spend it again. \nThe room service was really good. Friendly and fast. Yet food was nothing spectacular. For a hotel of this level, I would expect warm buns, evenly cooked French fries, and more tender meat. Our buns were cold, French fries some overcooked and some okay. The seasoning was okay. Overall for the price of room service, you might be better off door dashing.\n\nRoom service was inconsistent. One day they did leave us our hung towels and the other days they took and put all new ones. On two days they gave us water bottles but the other days they didn't. ( mind you no mini-fridge either ). The cleaning was good. \nThroughout the stay everyone we interacted with was awesome. The location was PERFECT close to everything and easy to get around. Perfect for 1st trip to NY","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

A stunningly beautiful midtown NYC hotel. However what knocked my socks off was an example of outstanding personal service that transformed a big problem into a success. An important Fedex package was delivered in my name to the hotel containing documents that needed to be reviewed and signed early the next morning. Expecting the package at checkin, I was told that they were securely locked up and would be delivered the next morning. That was a problem. Alfred, Guest Service Agent, was approached and with the support and assistance of Assistant Front Office Manager Nancy, retrieved the package from the secure lockup and it was delivered immediately to my room. They used common sense, a can do \"solve the problem\" approach and made it happen. They were ably supported by Charlotte in Guest Experience who kept me advised on the progress.

Arriving at the hotel we were greeted by George one of the doormen and he was really friendly and helpful not just on arrival but throughout our stay. Booking in was really easy and we had a lovely room on the 27th floor overlooking St Patrick's cathedral. The room was nice and large and really clean. Really comfortable beds. The fridge unfortunately was sealed probably due to covid but no major issue. The shower wasn't the best one I've used but was good enough and remember this is an old hotel. Even though we were not bothered about room service as my daughter isn't the tidiest, Tammy that looked after our room did a fantastic job and she was lovely. Ani on concierge was often working when I needed any help and despite being on her own she was always really helpful and  helped me pick a better Xmas eve cruise than the one I'd originally planned to use. Truthfully every member of staff we met was so helpful and made you feel nothing was ever too much trouble. I wasn't a massive fan in the bar as a bit dark for me. My only gripe really was breakfast that they wouldn't let you book which when on a schedule to get somewhere you want to know you can sit at a time that suits. Feel this is something they could look at offering as other hotels were allowing booking. There is a small cafe inside that sold take out drinks, croissant etc which were really fresh and tasty. Another thing I felt they could offer was WiFi instead costing I think about 15 dollars a day. I know it only is about 11 pound a day but the lotte is more expensive than a lot of hotels so felt something they could look at offering. I was also disappointed they didn't put the big tree outside something I've seen when in new york before and walked past the lotte. I've given the hotel 4 stars due to a couple of things I've mentioned wasn't quite to my taste or a few things I felt could be done different so hard to give 5 when a few grumbles but nothing that would stop me staying here again and anywhere you stay I don't think any hotel would get everything hundred percent but this one comes close.

The room was of a good size with a good sized clean and well maintained bathroom.  The 2 Queen beds were extremely comfortable and daily cleaning services were in operation. The view from this room, on the 45 floor, was also very good overlooking St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and the Christmas tree at the Rockefeller Centre. \nWe also stayed for 3 nights in a Corner Suite with Pantry in The Towers on the 52nd floor. Wow, what a room! Over 1,200sq of pure luxury living. Every single point was beyond our expectations. Each room within the suite was very well maintained, cleaned daily to a very high standard and the beds were probably the most comfortable we have slept in. Now for the real wow factor, the views! These were quite simply stunning, from the bedroom; the Empire State and the Chrysler Building and from the lounge area the Christmas Tree at the Rockefeller Centre and Radio City Music Hall. It really has to be seen to be believed! \nOh, and the hotel is just yards from both 5th Ave and Madison Ave each with an abundance of shopping opportunities.\nIt is at this point of my review where I risk running out of superlatives. This is because the most impressive  quality this hotel has to offer, even more exceptional than the rooms, bars and other communal areas, are the staff!  Absolutely outstanding customer service oozed from every member of staff we had the pleasure of dealing with. Ani, Kal and Diego in the Concierge team were professional, efficient, knowledgeable, helpful, nothing was ever too much trouble. Clara from guest services, with her amazing smile and warm manner made our holiday extra special simply by greeting us by name every time we saw her. That is the kind of personal service on offer at this hotel. On top of that it was Clara who took the time to give us the most wonderful tour of the Gossip Girl suite, yet another highlight of our stay. It would be remiss of me not to say a huge thank you to Brian Becker in the reservations team, the savour of our holiday! I had made a genuine mistake with my reservation a few days prior to arrival and contacted Brian in a panic. I need not have worried as Brian resolved my mistake immediately with no fuss. Yet another example of the level of customer service you can expect and another reason to lavish praise on the staff working for this hotel.\nFinally, the quality of this building and it\u2019s location in the very heart of New York City speak for itself. However, it\u2019s the current custodians of the building who bring it to life. I had the pleasure of dealing directly with both Natsuko, Director of Guest Services and Ms Hubbard, General Manager during our stay and in just the very short exchange we had it was abundantly clear that the importance of providing excellent customer service is driven from this level.\nIn conclusion, the whole experience my family and I had of the Lotte New York Palace will live long in the memory for all the right reasons. It was beyond our wildest expectations. Thank you so much!","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

You get a real sense of being in a high-end and luxurious hotel, backed up by friendly first class service.\n\nWe were staying in NYC on my wife's Birthday and she was touched to receive a gift bag on arrival.  The guy on reception (whose name escapes me unfortunately) was very welcoming and we were delighted to have our room upgraded to the top 39th floor, with a stunning view overlooking St Patrick's cathedral and the Rockefeller.  The room itself was extremely well appointed, roomy and spotlessly clean.  It is of course challenging to find any hotel room in NYC which is quiet, but ours seem to be the exception to this rule and we had no difficulty sleeping, no doubt helped by the queen sixed bed, luxurious Egyptian lined and wonderful pillows!  Other notable features included an exceptionally powerful double sized shower (and certainly the best shower we have experienced - supported by highly effective ventilation), along with ambient lighting (adjustable from a tablet device) and a great sized LG TV.  While one of the bedside lamps was not working on arrival, this was immediately fixed.  The safe in the wardrobe was well proportioned and provided plenty of space for passports, cash and other valuables.  Although not especially required in December, the air conditioning was very effective and quiet.\n\nThe Lotte benefits from a stunning, sweeping staircase (reminiscent of the main Disney hotel at Disneyland Paris), along with luxurious dining rooms and a bar.  We treated ourselves to breakfast on the morning of my wife's Birthday and, although very nice, my one and only criticism of the Lotte would be the price.

She suggested an early booking at Hatsuhana Sushi Restaurant, followed by jazz at Birdland. Both were perfect. Not only did Isabella get it right but she had  factored in the slow-moving traffic in the area as people drove by the Rockefeller Plaza to enjoy the lights and huge Christmas Tree. We enjoyed them too, but on foot. \nDinner was delicious, beautifully served by attentive staff members. The jazz was superb- Richard Sexton and his sextet played the American song book with verve, precision and fun. \nLeft to our own devices we would never have packed so much into so little time.

From check-in to housekeeping to concierge, everyone I encountered was beyond pleasant and extremely helpful.  In particular, I would like to commend Jerry from the Postal Room.  He went above & beyond as Santa's helper!  I bought a Christmas gift for my son on our trip, but was unable to squeeze it into my suitcase.  Jerry came up to our floor & retrieved the box from the hallway where I had hidden it from my son.    When I went to the lobby to meet him to arrange payment and provide my shipping details, we realized the package might not make it to Texas before Christmas morning.  Jerry personally walked it to the UPS store right then on a Saturday evening to get it in UPS's hands in time so that I could return to the hotel room where my young son was waiting alone.

On a recent stay on Dec 1, my husband and I checked in to a corner suite in the tower.  After spending the day in the city we went back to the room to enjoy the view.  The room definitely looked dated and 'tired'.  I noticed the sofa cushions were turned the wrong way-- when I went to fix them I saw the sofa was dirty and stained (so they had just put them on the sofa with turned side ways to hide the stains. There was a large stain on the bedroom carpet, tape on the wall, a used face mask (not ours) in the corner, lamp shades were dented and crooked, floor base board were missing and had exposed wall behind them.  The next morning we realized that we had 1 bath towel.  So our $1500 suite was of no use, we couldn't sit on the sofa and enjoy the view or even take a shower with a dry towel.  We requested another room -which they accommodated (we had to move the luggage ourselves).  We asked at the desk that we be charged fro a regular room - not the suite since we could not enjoy it.  We were told the manager would call our cell phone- no call ever came.  When we checked out 4 days later the manager was still going to be calling us-- no call came and we were charged the full suite price for the stay.  The regular room was ok but nothing special at all for the price, shower curtains in the bathroom, no turn down service the entire stay (they said they were doing it and we requested it every night), light burnt out on make-up mirror, one of the power shades was inoperable. The hotel has not been kept up.  It was impossible to get a drink in the lounge-- no staff was ever working in there.  Very disappointing, this hotel had been our go to place in NYC.  I also wrote a review on the hotel survey that they sent and asked that someone contact me-- again no one did.   Clearly not customer service focused","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The service was exceptional, I never encountered a staff member without a smile or willing to help. Clara was fantastic and made a point to come and greet us whenever she had a chance. She also personally brought things to our rooms that we requested. The bellman Henri was extremely helpful. Ahmad (spelling) went out of his way as well to say hello and have conversations like we were family! My mother fell in Central Park and when I asked for an Ice pack be sent to her room, they were there within minutes! The day of our ceremony as I was getting dressed an eyelet broke and at the same time Bibi popped her head in to ask about cleaning the room. We asked if she had a sewing kit on her cart, which she did and she even sewed it back on while I was still standing in the dress!! I can't begin to tell you what a relief that was! She was a lifesaver at that moment, and I will never forget that gesture! \n\nI think my only complaint about our whole experience was the elevators, only 3 of the 6 worked and were quite full ALL the time. We waited 20 minutes or so just to get in it and then they would stop on every floor on the way down. We were almost late to our ceremony because of the elevators. \n\nOverall, what an amazing, magical stay that will always warm my heart!

People working there were respectful, helpful and willing to help. Except one Asian lady at concierge or reception, that actually didn't give a f... about our small requests (some glasses in the room, beside the plastic ones, a kettle as I needed hot water for a medicine I take).\nThat is where good things end.\n\nThe bad side:\n- room looks like crap. Old dirty floors, since the days Al Calpine was a regular customer\n- nothing in the minibar. Actually it was sealed so you can not use it even if you need to cool something.\n- if you want products in your minibar, there's a 35$ charge\n- in 2021 you have to pay 16$ a day for internet? How miserable can you be as hotel and hotel manager to do that? When you pay 800$ per night. Why don't you charge extra for the elevators or for flushing the toilet?\n- bathrooms look horrible. Cosmetic products are decent quality.\n- breakfast is more expensive than Michellin restaurants and the bread served with Benedict eggs was old 2 days in a row (and I am talking about 175$ breakfast for 2, where we had 2 Benedict Eggs, 1 coffee, 1 tea, 1 bottle of water)\n- in the room you have no glass, no forks, knives, bottle opener, a bottle of water, ZERO.

None of us had ever been to NYC and I was overwhelmed with the lodging options. I struggled to find a place close to the \u201caction\u201d that could comfortably accommodate our family of older children. We didn\u2019t want to book a place that would require us to have two rooms. A few options were found but I kept coming back to this one. I will say I\u2019m a bit of a self proclaimed \u201chotel snob\u201d so I tend to be rather picky. \n\nThis hotel was located perfectly and as a first time trip to NYC we were so pleased to be so close to everything within walking distance or at least closely located to the subway. I\u2019ve stayed in numerous hotels and this was honestly the cleanest one I\u2019ve visited to date. I had zero concerns in this area and I could tell the housekeeping staff takes pride in their work. On that note, I\u2019ve always stayed at places in which the housekeeping staff could be allusive after times, but the staff here were frequently nearby and very attentive to any needs we had. Each one would greet us and hold conversation each and every time we walked by. The little things do not go unnoticed.\n\nEach staff member (front desk, bellman, housekeeping, food service, etc) was professional in every sense of the word and I have zero negative things to say about them. \n\nThe only thing I would have liked to have seen was more lower priced meal and snack options for younger people (kids and teens) particularly for room service. There was no kid\u2019s menu listed on the room service menu but I also didn\u2019t inquire about it when I called so it may have been available. We only dined in the room one night and while it was rather pricey, everything was absolutely delicious. \n\nI\u2019m not one to typically return to a place solely because although I often return to a location, I usually enjoy a bit of variety.

Not a big deal at all - they just gave us two breakfast croissant sandwiches and one breakfast burrito instead of the other way around as we ordered. Sunday morning we ordered the same things, and one of the managers recognized me and proactively didn't charge me for the breakfast burrito, saying \"I remember the mix-up yesterday, so we won't charge you today.\" It was very busy at the time he did this and it was impressive for him to recognize me and remember.\n2. We checked-in pretty late on a Friday night - maybe around 8:30pm. We asked the concierge where to go for a good, nice, but casual dinner. He suggested an italian place nearby, he made a phone call, and we were seated 2-3 minutes after we arrived. And they were busy.\n3. I called room service Sunday late afternoon\/early evening to see if I could order a couple of cocktails for my wife and I since the hotel lounge\/bar was still closed from covid restrictions. Miles said room service doesn't have access to a bar to deliver drinks, but he said to give him 5-10 minutes and he'd send something up. He asked what my wife and I might want.

The concierge weren\u2019t able to help us with anything, not a reservation, not information, nothing. This is a big hotel with ONE working elevator, it would be wrong during normal times, but during a pandemic it\u2019s unacceptable. This is a hotel they should at least serve a proper breakfast. We understand that due to COVID there are a lot of restrictions, but the fact that they use that as an excuse is unacceptable.

In brief:\n\n- The rates were very competitive\n- The rooms are very good\n- The location is solid\n- The service was incredible. I will mostly expound upon that below.\n\nThroughout the past 1.5 years, each staff member we interacted with at the Palace treated us as though we were having our actual wedding there. A cadre of the Palace's employees ensured every detail was covered and they were all timely and friendly in responding. They adjusted our block, no questions asked. They provided a booking link. They adapted to changing circumstances. They had detailed forms for us to give them a sense of how to place wedding favors in our guests' rooms. Kaan, one of the managers, also showed us around some of the cooler rooms to take photos and elucidated some of the history of the hotel to us. He also saw to little details, finding misplaced items for us and assuring a bus we had arranged arrived in a timely fashion and was parked in an accessible place for our guests. They also brought some bar stools up to the bridal suite at 9am for a last minute request.\n\nOther hotels and blocks we have dealt with in the past have not come close to as hospitable as the folks at the Palace.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

I was there on a Monday night and was comforted in that there were not too many viewers and plenty of options to take pictures from a safe distance.

Anything outside of walking distance is easy to call for an Uber or cab that will be able to meet you right outside the door.\n\nOur most recent stay was during Christmas, and the hotel is absolutely MAGICAL! The decorations are BEAUTIFUL and they have a lot of really fun details, such as Letters to Santa. Each kiddo (or grown up!) who writes a letter to Santa will receive a personalized letter back!

This was my first time on a plane & my first real holiday in 20 years - everything was absolutely perfect from start to finish.\nOn the last day when checking out, one of our suitcases decided to break & John (who had been looking after our bags) went above and beyond to ensure the last few moments of our time in New York were not ruined. He went out back and returned with a suitcase for us to use, completely for free, and after repacking our bags we were given a complimentary glass of champagne before being helped to our taxi. John honestly deserves a massive compliment for his hospitality, kindness & for just being a really nice guy. Can't thank him enough! (There is a blurred picture of John in the photos - top bloke!) You really couldn't pick a better hotel to stay in.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The city was perfect- kind weather, great food, lots to do and experience but the cream on the cake was this hotel. Perfect location, really helpful staff and, courtesy of the Pomme Palais, marvellous breakfasts.\n\nTwo niggles that others have touched on- lack of free WiFi  and the fact if you want a kettle for your room the hotel will essentially rent you one. After three decades travelling the world, being lucky to stay in very nice hotels, the kettle wheeze was new to me. Strange penny pinching when the hotel provided a courtesy car to take the four of us to our Broadway show on our last night!\n\nThis hotel has the \u201cwow\u201d factor backed up really friendly staff. I have no doubt my kids will remember the Palace as a highlight of their first NYC trip. Can be expensive but well worth it. \n\nTIP- the Duke Eatery is on Park Avenue, just around the corner from the Palace with bottled water 1\/3 of the price of that in your room with fantastic and affordable sushi and other take away to keep costs down.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My daughter and I worked with Dan Nelson on getting her Wedding Block, as most of our guests would be attending from out of state.  \nDan gave us a tour of every type of room, and view available, and even had to do it 2 separate times!! The Cathedral View is our favorite!  He had our reservation Block ready fast, and great instructions for the guests on how to reserve.  Dan made the link work straight from their wedding site, making it easy for our guests.  He keeps up with the reservations and updates us as to who has booked a room.  He has also handled every special request we have had regarding rooms with views, getting family suites for those traveling and needing cribs, etc.  Dan has helped me personally with reservations when i traveled to NYC for advance wedding planning.  \nThe Lotte Palace is iconic, the rooms are spacious, staff is efficient and friendly.  I have stayed at Lotte Palace about 6 times in the last year.  \nIt's great for any NYC visit.  \nIf you are planning a wedding in NYC, I highly recommend Dan Nelson as your Group Room Block Manager at the Lotte New York Palace, he is the best!","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

I booked through Amex Hotel Collection. Usually they do a good job. The entrance was beautiful. However at check-in the woman was a little rude, forgot to give me a key and other little things that I just let go. Supposedly we got an upgrade. It was obvious the room was not properly cleaned (dirty napkins and towels near the wet bar and on the desk). This was a bad first impression. We had plans though and needed to hit the town. \n\nThe next morning upon turning on the bathroom shower\/tub faucets the water was brown. This was really disturbing considering the price and the star rating at this hotel. I went downstairs and was not greeted by anyone but went to talk to one of the check-in people. Unfortunately I got Olga who told me that there was nothing she could do and to run the water for 20 minutes. She was quite rude, abreughinf her shoulders. I was shocked. I said I had already run the water and this was a nice hotel and I expected clean water to bathe. Gross. She rolled her eyes and said she could talk to her manager. Ten minutes later she said she would send an engineer. (Just how I want to spend my morning in a \u201cnice\u201d hotel). The guy came up, complained, said everything was fixed and left. This has taken an hour by now. I turned on the water. It was still brown. Dirty as can be. I called back. Still no apology from staff. They will send the guy back. He hasn\u2019t shown up ten-15 minutes later. I called back and finally got a manager (third time asking). I was polite until this point. She said we could move rooms. TWO HOURS LATER. So we packed up and had to move. The repair guy showed up as we were leaving and made some rude comments while yelling in front of my child asking why he had to be there. It was a bit ridiculous. The only helpful person was the bellhop who helped us move. The manager offered us a $50 credit not to be applied to our bill of the room but for the bar. Really? That is a slap in the face. Nothing was comped, no one cared, the entire staff was rude and apathetic. Why wasn\u2019t the first solution to move us rather than have your guests wait for your dirtiness to be cleaned up? My time is valuable and not only was the Palace a bad experience it was amplified by the poor and rude staff and the lack of doing anything about it. This was disgusting. I\u2019m also disappointed in Amex. I expect more from their collection.  \n\nSpacious rooms. The rest was a bad experience. Stay elsewhere. ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room rate was at $299 per night, excluding taxes and breakfast. Quite expensive but, well, that\u2019s a \u00ab\u00a0palace\u00a0\u00bb after all. In fact, beyond the name, the location, the lobby and the prices, it is more a 3- or 4-star hotel than a palace. The bedrooms are definitively not of the palace standard; I have been several times to palaces, but the bedrooms were way nicer and more comfortable. I live in France and, obviously, I woke up at 3am on the first day. First reflex: preparing a coffee before checking e-mails, but... there was no coffee machine in the room! I complained at the reception, and was told that palaces had no more coffee machines in bedrooms (which is wrong of course). The problem is that their breakfast room and coffee shop don\u2019t open before 6:30. I find it shocking for an hotel with international customers, who are jetlagged. Their breakfast room is wonderful but the bill was even greater. There is no buffet. Coffee at $8, orange juice at the same price... I went there with a group of 8 and was charged $570, ie $70 per person on average. The most interesting story is the fridge in the bedroom. If you purchase drinks or fruits outside the hotel and put them inside the fridge, you get charged $35, even if you don\u2019t consume anything in the fridge. On top of that, the staff is not friendly, not smiling. In short, I don\u2019t recommend this hotel at all.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

First, let me say, compliments to the front desk staff here - my checkin with Stacy was awesome. When there was overnight construction outside my room, she arranged a switch and an upgrade. I was so grateful after a long day of travel. \n\nThe rooms on the Tower side are notably nicer than the Palace side.  They are more spacious and have a bit more tech and just feel cleaner in general. I would say this is a four and a half star hotel room. \n\nSo why Two stars? Because there is a lot of construction in and around the hotel and it affects whole floors, and there is nothing the hotel can do about it because it\u2019s an outside company contracted to do the work.  Also, the spa is under renovation until May, and the small lobby lounge was full, and the restaurants are closed. So, basically, if you need a place to rest or work during the afternoon, you\u2019re SOOL.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering staying at the Palace, I would highly recommend getting a sense of whether there is going to be construction during your stay.

One side overlooks St Patrick\u2019s cathedral and whether by day or night it\u2019s beautiful.  The welcome was very traditional with a warm friendly greeting by the hotels door staff. The check in at reception was very quick and we were assisted to our room along with baggage by one of the hotel porters.  The room was very spacious and we overlooked the cathedral up on the 27th floor which was amazing outlook.  The bathroom was great with a bath and powerful shower.  Everywhere was clean and fresh. The only thing we could comment on was not to have tea\/ coffee making facilities in our room which was surprising for a 5 star hotel.  Maybe this is normal in New York?  We had cocktails in the Gold Room bar which was an amazing place.  The cocktails were good too although at $22 per drink was pricey even compared to London prices.  All the staff in the hotel were great, nothing too much trouble and always there to make sure you had the most pleasurable stay. Some might say the decor is a little old fashioned but we loved it. A fabulous building, great location, pleasant staff and definitely worth a visit even if you don\u2019t stay there is is open to the public to take a look inside and perhaps go to one of the many bars.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

For this trip I actually flew out 5 days early to spend time with my daughter who wanted to do NYC with me prior to a work trip in NJ the following week. My normal 10 day trip was now 15 days and I was a little nervous...how would I feel about being \u201cstuck\u201d in the same hotel for more than 2 weeks. \n\nLet me just say this, if you\u2019re going to be \u201cstuck\u201d in a hotel in NYC the Lotte is where you want to be!! It\u2019s gorgeous. The location is fantastic. The amenities are first class. The property is simply a gem and I can\u2019t say enough about it. That said, there are beautiful properties in great locations with outstanding amenities all over NYC. What really made the Lotte stand out was the staff. The bellmen, the desk clerks, bartenders, room service attendants...they were all wonderful, simply wonderful. There was one person in particular, however that deserves a very, very special mention and that was our housekeeper, Jacqui. Jacqui is special. She is kind and caring, attentive beyond words and has the heart of an angel. My 15 day trip turned into 3 weeks when I got sick towed the end of my 2nd week. \n\nAfter a trip to a local urgent care I was advised to avoid flying for at least 4-5 days. Jacqui made a point to stop in before she began her shift, after she finished her shift and of course during her shift she was there to clean the room for us each day. She went above and beyond the call of duty, ensuring I had everything I needed and if she couldn\u2019t be there she sent a colleague to check in on me. There\u2019s nothing worse than being sick away from home but quite honestly, I felt so well taken care of that as much as I wanted to get home I actually hated to leave when the time came to go. As I said, the entire staff was AMAZING (the manager even extended the special rate I had secured when I booked the trip 9 months prior when I got stuck those extra 5 days), but Jacqui is one of a kind. When you book your room at the Lotte, ask for a room oh the 17th floor - this is Jacqui\u2019s floor - and maybe even ask to be taken care of by her specifically. I can assure you she will make your stay at the Lotte even more special than it will be already. If nothing else, ask to meet her. She should truly be the hotel\u2019s ambassador - she would be PERFECT for the job \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEnjoy your stay at the Lotte and be sure to grab breakfast at Ess-a-Bagel on Third Ave. Prepare to wait in line but boy oh boy is it going to be worth the wait!! Best bagels in the city!","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Another way to sum up my impression is that it's an excellent hotel to bring your parents with but not your hipster siblings. \n\nThe hotel doesn't try to follow the trend and marches to its own beat, and it may come off as backward\/inconvenient especially if you are accustomed to tech amenities from other hotel. But if you don't care about modern convenience and care about basics that were no longer basics (large room, intuitive control panel, staffs with personal touch) then I think you may find this hotel a keeper. I'm not necessarily saying this to dismiss other hotels (nothing wrong with having a TV that connects to netflix).   It's just that this hotel appeals to different crowd.

I arrived late and wanted to eat at the restaurant.  I had to walk next door for dinner, which was okay but that restaurant was big and noisy.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Lets start with the Hotel. The Hotel it is a beautiful property. Decorated beautiful for the holidays. The decor is beautiful and the location very close to everything. 5th. Avenue is about one block away and easy to walk everywhere. Close to the subways station and to Central Park. The rooms ave perfect size and they are kept clean. Now, lets talk about the problems we encountered. \nNot coffee maker in the rooms. If I wanted a Coffee maker, a one time fee of $30.00 dollars will be charge to our room plus $15.00 per day to service the coffee. I had never heard such a thing charging for a coffee maker. second problem was my room was not clean Dec 31th. I had to call twice to Housekeeping to report the problem. Finally the housekeeper showed up and was a bit rude because she had to clean the room. I realized many of the rooms in our floor were not clean that day. Guests were upset and waiting for the housekeeper to ask what is going on. third problem, may room was  charged $121.00 dollars for a breakfast we never had. My husband requested to see the receipt signed and it was someone else on the bill not us. They suppose to credit and issue a refund to our credit card, which still showing as pending. . I wish I can give you 5 starts because it is a beautiful Hotel. However, I fell that duke to so many issues encountered I had to rate this hotel and give 4 stars for the issues encountered. I wish they can include Coffee makers in the room and not charge the guests that ridiculous fee.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Asked for some pillows and a guy came with the pillows under his arm (not the mos hygienc way to deliver).\n\nWe asked the hotel before hand about receiving packages and they told us they dont charge and to address them to the hotel with the name of the guest.  \n\nSome packages were taken up to the room but we noticed some where missing but thought they would be delivered later.  After that a never ending sequence of issues started :\n\n1. We booked the hotel through our travel agency who is a Virtuoso agency.  So we told them we were not impressed at all with the service of the hotel and how bad was the maintenance of the room and little pillows.  The breakfast in the dining room took an eternity to be served too and everytime we called guest services for anything or room service, either they didnt answer or the service was really slow.  The following day there were 6 additional pillows (a bit too much that we thought it was like \u201cyou complain about not many pillows ...well, there you are...have lots of pillows\u201d.  Didnt like that but there was also a bottle of wine with an apology of Mr Renee who is the front desk manager.  Nice touch but, to be honest, we dont drink and didnt want any gift, we just wanted a good service.  \n\n2. The delivery of packages was veerrryyy slow.  Some took more than 24 hours to be delivered and some never arrived.  I made a list and asked the lady in the mail counter.  She was not really nice but I left her with the tracking numbers of packages that were delivered even 10 days before.  She made some excuses like the guy who signed didnt work in the hotel, so I left her.  \n\nAprox 45 minutes after we heard a knock on the door and a guy (whose name I can remember now .... something like Kwaen) entered the room with 4 or 5 packages and threw them on the floor.  He was furious and started complaining to my husband and me how bad we placed our orders...he was out of control, left the boxes and left the room complaining about us.  I went to the front desk and asked for the manager who, after some tries of the lady in front desk to avoid calling, appeared.  A very nice Mr Gomez listened carefully and very professionally to all my comments.  The amazing thing is that while I was talking to him in the lobby the impertinent guy who threw the boxes on us some minutes ago showed and tried to interrupt the conversation I was having to Mr Gomez.  He knew I was complaining about him and was trying to avoid that.  I didnt allow him to talk and demand him to go.  Mr Gomez assured me he was goint to look over our several issues and I left content.\n\nBefore arriving in the hotel we asked how to address to packages and the answer was to the hotel and the name of the guest.  Apparently the labels are not big enough sometimes so the name isnt printed so we understood those things happen but the way it was handled by Joan in the mail desk and this guy who threw the boxes was totally un profesional and VERY RUDE.  \n\n3. To avoid the eternal waiting in the dining room we decided to have breakfast in the room.  TERRIBLE wait the 1st morning because we called when we woke up so after that we ordered with the order hanging in the door the previous night.  They arrived on time but the order was never right.  Either things came incomplete, wrong or cold.  The worst was when I ordered pancakes, I was about to eat them and then realised they didnt leave cutlery so I called and asked for cutlery...30 minutes and nobody showed.  Called back again and told them it was too late and my food was cold so I wanted the order to go back and to be cancelled.  They said yes.  After 10 minutes the waiter arrived with the cutlery, told him we didnt want it and he got angry !! This never ended.  Called to ask for ice (no ice machines) and they took more than 1 hour !!! The worst service \n\n4.  Very busy everything.  There is not a moment of peace in the hotel.  I know it was pre christmas but staying in a hotel that you have to wait for everything is exhausting.  Wait for somebody to answer the phone, for breakfast, for room service, for someone in front desk, for a drink in the bar, for everything.  Too much.\n\n5. There was another bottle of wine sent but we sent it back.  Thank you very much but we dont want wine...we just want good and respectful service, we were paying more than USD 1000,00 per night and we expected a totally different experience.\n\nI have to acknowledge Mr Gomez and Ms Renne\u2019s effort but that is not enough.  Everything was an issue but the guy who threw the boxes at us....he was the worst and 100% unacceptable for a hotel of this level.\n\nWe are going back to NYC next week and we didnt even consider going back to this hotel....we wont be back and we dont recommend anybody to stay there.  Good effort of Mr Gomez and Ms Renne but it needs more....\n\nA pity because the location is amazing...never more.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Known for its magical Christmas decorations we had to book here. \n\nTravelling on the 27 December from Heathrow right up until the point we saw the amazing Christmas Tree in the court yard of the Lotte we were on cloud 9 and extremely excited to begin an amazing week in the Big Apple. After taking a few photos of the tree we made our way to the reception to check in. \n\nPop... our bubble was quickly burst. Our reservation had been cancelled by the company Amoma who we booked our stay with. We booked late June and paid for a 5 nights in stay in full. Amoma went bust in September when they kindly cancelled our reservation with the hotel but did not have the common courtesy to inform us, the paying customer, that they could not honour our reservation. We found at after a very long day of travelling when we tried to check in.\n\nThis apparently was not the first experience the Lotte had encountered but this did not help us at 11pm on the 27 December in what is the busiest time in the city. \n\nThis is where a little Christmas spirit happened. The reception staff at the Lotte offered us a room with a view of the cathedral for a discounted rate for the night and promised that although they were more than fully booked they would do their upmost to try and accommodate us for the rest of the stay. Whilst this was not ideal not knowing if we would have a room for the rest of our stay at least we had a room for the night. \n\nBefore going to bed that evening my husband and I decided to go and view the Rockefeller Christmas tree to try and cheer us up before a very tearful and sleepless night on my part. \n\nWe woke on 28 December not knowing if a room would be available to us so my husband went down to reception and the reception staff and manager could not have been more helpful. They had managed to secure a room for us for the remainder of our stay and whilst it was not with the view of the cathedral it was very cosy and comfortable. \n\nI love New York and it could have so quickly become a place that would have left a bad taste in my mouth due to the selfish and inconsiderate company Amoma. They are a disgrace and should be ashamed that they have no doubt ruined many holidays.\n\nThey however did not succeed in spoiling this magical adventure we went on, but this certainly wouldn\u2019t have happened without the excellent staff at the Lotte. \n\nMy husband and I have enjoyed the most amazing Christmas and new year in New York and it was great to know that the Lotte hotel had helped to make what could have been the worst vacation ever the best and we have nothing but good things to say about the Lotte team. The General Manger Becky Hubbard  heard of our bad start to our holiday so arranged for some nice treats to be sent to the room which were very well received. \n\nThe staff have certainly restored my faith in humanity and I can say that we will certainly be back.

They knew how many people were expected on the Sunday before Christmas. but instead of staffing up for the mass of people - the lobby had about 500 people in line -  there were exactly 2 reservation agents at the desk.   It took forever.  Our complaint brought us a $200 credit to be used in the hotel....that's not really compensating us for the major inconvenience, is it!    \nSecond, the room.   It was a very nice room, spacious, fine.   But, there was no coffee service - so you have to get dressed to go get your coffee.  The extra \"blanket\" there was was good for nothing.  And no ice machine on the floor, you have to call room service.  It's free, but it's annoying to have to do that. \nThird, the restaurants.   There are about 5 of them.   But not one serves a dinner menu....one is sweets, one is \"rare wine\" tasting.  The only place to use the $200 we got was the restaurant that had \"small plates.\"    Night one, it was fine (charcuterie & cheese plates.).   Night two, not so much.   The cod was supposed to come with a fish roe.  It was not in sight.  When asked, the waiter said it was \"sprinkled on top.\"   No, it wasn't.   So they charge you $30 or so for a dish in which they do not include all of the stated ingredients.   Does that make you feel like you're being cheated a little?   Of course you are....roe is expensive, put it on the menu, don't serve it, nobody will notice.  It happens a lot, not just here.   I would not return to this hotel again ....there are too many other places in NY that might do a better job of remembering they supposed to be serving clients, not just making money.

The hotel is in a perfect location, which makes it so easy to walk all around Manhattan.  The lobby was extremely festive, and Christmas decorations were beautiful. The service was very friendly and attentive.  The rooms were a decent size for a New York hotel, although the decor is a little bit dated.  The WiFi was abyssal though, and very frustrating, given what we were paying.  Other than that, we loved this hotel, and we will likely come back.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

You pay more for the Towers and expect more. No service at the desk when you comeback late at night and want to ask for late checkout.

I\u2019d love to see what the hotel will look like when the rooms get an upgrade.\n\nGood gym, even while it was all under construction.\n\nBut time for new mattresses, modern bathrooms, and a chic update of the rooms.

We will start with reservations,  I specifically asked about joining rooms throughout the booking process and was told the hotel does not offer joining rooms!!\nLast year we stayed in the towers overlooking the Cathedral and for some reason during my booking we ended up overlooking the Cathedral but not in the towers,  I tried discussing this while checking in but I guess they were to busy to care what I had to say!!\n\nReading reviews about families that were lucky enough to have this option I was somewhat confused. Do they or don't they? Next were the letters from Santa, we specifically put our little envelopes in the mailbox as we did last year but never responded \ud83d\ude22\nWe were all so excited to make this an amazing holiday and couldn't wait to walk back into the room and to see the response on everyone's face that Santa wrote to them.  I mentioned this to the front desk through a phone call and my response was...they must have had to many!!! Really ?If this is the case don't bother!!
