In our case, Daniel and Cristian were wonderful. They let us know that they can schedule a driver to pick us up and take us to the airport (which I will take advantage of next time!) At the time the price was the same if not a bit less for the driver compared to your Lyft or Uber service. The rooms were cleaned daily (with water and snacks restocked) and at night it was quiet.

For a small room there was ample, well thought out storage with 4 large pull out drawers under tour king size bed.  The room contained a mini fridge, espresso coffee machine, large TV and small hand held steam iron. There were a couple of packets of complimentary crisps, biscuits and water which was a nice touch.  There was a privacy light on the door if you did not require room service.  We had them freshen the room half way through our stay, when we returned, they had thoroughly cleaned through and changed all the bedding.  The room was spotless. Bathroom quite big with huge shower and good water pressure.  We were in room 1705 which was quite high up and at the back of the hotel, really surprised as to how quiet it was considering we were in the middle of NY city, no noise from adjoining rooms either. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful and so welcoming.  When you step outside the door the area is a little off putting but to to be honest it felt extremely safe.  There is an Irish bar across the street if you arrive late and are wanting a quick meal or a drink.  Just around the corner there is a \u201cPret A Manger\u201d with an eating area for breakfast items such as lovely almond croissants or warm savoury items and good coffee to start you off on your day.  This is classed as the financial district and very close to the 9\/11 site and not far from battery park where you get the ferry to see the Statue of Liberty and Ellis island.  We were a little worried about the subway but there has been a massive change around here since we were here last, everywhere felt much safer and cleaner even though a lot of buildings seemed to be covered in scaffolding for some reason. We did not find lots of restaurants in the immediate area but a 5-10 minute walk took you to plenty.  Could not recommend this hotel highly enough. After a hard day trekking the city, so nice to have a homey haven to come back to, wonderful shower and amazing bed for a well earned good nights sleep.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As we do with most trips we read the really bad reviews on TA to see what we might be letting ourselves in for. The Hotel is not huge as are the rooms. When we checked in the Tea, coffee and water arrangements in the room were clearly described to us and what would and wouldn\u2019t be replaced.   We were allocated a room on the second floor at the front of the hotel, which was very near street level with the noise and smells associated with it. However, unlike other comments there was almost no street level noise to be heard, and while there were some interesting smells around the area the hotel smelt wonderful being scented with a lovely fragrance, so top marks there. The room its self was clean, and  bed comfy. There were charges for phones and everything you would expect. We almost immediately headed for the recently added roof top bar and while it is not tall enough to have any outstanding views over the city it is a great place to relax and imbibe a few cocktails. The staff were friendly, polite and helpful without exception whenever we meet them. \n\nThe location is excellent. Being in easy walking distance to lower Manhattan and the One World Trade Center or south street sea port or battery park, also as virtually all the subway lines converge around wall street it was usually only a minute or two to walk to any station (usually the various entrances to Fulton Street) to get virtually anywhere in Manhattan which makes getting around very easy. The Bars and clubs in Stone Street are an easy stroll away as are Fraunces Tavern and the Dead Rabbit, both of which are worth a visit.  On the flip side on a Sunday in the financial district we walked all day and didn\u2019t see a yellow Taxi cab once, so if you like to travel by cab and not subway you may be disappointed. \n\nSo if your tired of Times Square and fancy something different The Artezen could be just the ticket, as long as you like to ride the subway!","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this hotel , despite all the good reviews on here, the management has got to learn how to deal with customers complaints . I paid over $300 per night for the room without breakfast and in addition there is a resort fee, which is effectively a tax and another way the hotel makes money out of their customers. When we arrived at reception the receptionist explained the resort fee to me and stated that this was for coffees, teas, and water in the room as well as Internet and the Spa?. In the room there was only 2 small tea bags and two creamers so I requested more which they obliged. Next day i  requested some more creamers as two was not enough. The receptionist said that they would bring some to the room. After 45 mins i phoned back down and inquired where the creamers were as we wanted a cup of tea after walking around NY all day, only to be told that housekeeping had stated that each room was only allowed 2 creamers a day and we already had that so therefore we were not allowed any more, i assumed they were joking , but was told this is the rules. I confirmed , that the resort fee of $16 covers this and they stated it did , however you are only allowed 2 creamers a day , despite them not replenishing the water( which is also included in the resort fee) that day . I expressed my disappointment and they told me the manager would contact me. Pete the manager phoned me and explained that he had spoken to Housekeeping and these are the rules and you are only allowed 2 creamers a day per room.I confirmed with him , that the resort fees are for these amenities and he agreed but made a big statement how the Internet (which in almost every other hotel in the world is free) is also covered by this resort fee. He agreed on this occasion that he would allowed 5 creamers ( but only delivered 4) but from the next day onward we would only be allowed 2 creamers per day. I find this pathetic and bad management , and shows the hotels attitude of squeezing money out of their customers, and customers feelings doesn't matter .\nI would have dropped my rating even lower but Daniel the concierge was extremely helpful.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I checked the reviews before booking, and was glad to see that they were still as consistently good as they were before, and it was still good value (New York pricing considered).  My girlfriend was a little hesitant as it's location is a bit out of the centre of Manhatten, down near Wall Street, but after our stay she agreed that the location was actually excellent - it's right across the street from the subway, it's just a short walk to the Staten Island ferry (free, and a must do), and there are loads of great bars, restaurants and shops nearby.\n\nWell, I'm pleased to say that it's as superb as before.  The customer service is excellent, the bedrooms are beautifully maintained and comfortable, and I just can't find fault with it.  We were nice and high up in the building, on the 17th floor, so our view was very good, and although we can hear the inevitable street noise from below, it had no impact on us.  The roof top garden was just being 'soft launched' to family and friends, so we missed out on that only just (despite the best efforts of the concierge, Daniel, to get us a viewing - we'll just have to visit again!).\n\nTalking of Daniel, the concierge, he deserves a special mention.  He's very personable and kind, and was a pleasure to chat to.  He gave us plenty of great advice, and he definitely enhanced our stay.  Not that the other staff weren't excellent too, I should add!\n\nA couple of other tips - if you want superb cocktails in a wonderful and intimate bar, go to the Parlor at the Dead Rabbit Bar (about a 10 minute walk away, but probably best to book a table).  And for great food and drinks in an awesome environment, visit the Trinity Place Bar and Restaurant (just a five minute walk away).","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The beds and mattresses are high quality. Nice showers, too. And a very useful gym. Everyone I dealt with at the hotel was friendly. The price was decent for an NYC hotel (if $350 a night is ever \"decent.\") Location is unbeatable - we found a very good hole-in-the-wall Chinese place around the corner for hand-pulled noodles. For staples, a Whole Foods is 2 blocks away. So is the 9\/11 memorial. In addition, Battery Park and Chinatown are short walks. I'd pick this location again.\n\nSo what causes me to remove 1.5 stars from my review? I realize NYC is a noisy place, and I've never stayed anywhere there that was perfectly peaceful. But our third floor room here was directly across the street from an \"Irish karoke bar\" that blasted music past midnight. Our first night was a Saturday and I figured, OK, Saturday night. Our second night, however, was Sunday, and once again that place violated our rest till midnight or later.\n\nI'd stay here again, but advise others (and myself next time) to ask for a room facing away from the street or higher up in the building.

The Artezen is ideally located for the subway (50 yds), WTC and Memorial museum (200 yds), The Staten Island Ferry ( 400 yds) and The Financial District (300 yds). As you approach John Street you can begin to wonder about the area. Don\u2019t be over alarmed, the street is just busy. \nOnce inside the hotel is a modern clean and well equipped hotel with good amenities. We find that any hotel is only as good as it\u2019s staff and would certainly endorse the warm and courteous welcome you receive from all members and a willingness to offer help and advise. \nOur room was modern and clean with good amenities which was appreciated. Some rooms have outside terraces which don\u2019t offer any views but do give you additional space to sit.\nAs we were room only we used the Brookfield Place which overlooks the Hudson River and The Oculus ( in the WTC railway station) for meals. These offer many dietary options and are a great place to eat. A visit to The Tin Shed is well worthwhile.\n\nThanks to all the staff who contributed to a great stay. We would recommend this hotel and hope to see you on our return.\nRegards\nPhil and Sally ( Room 704)\n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

That is not lost on me. To start off, this hotel is a perfectly fine hotel if you need to stay in FiDi. The room is decent size but the bathroom is tiny. I've stayed at hotels in NYC at similar price point with MUCH bigger bathrooms but I get that might have been more of an exception in NYC so no points off for the small bathroom. The room makes up for it with the large balcony which was really nice to have. With the exception of one lady at the front desk, the rest of the staff was exceptionally nice and welcoming.\n\nNow, this is where I got really angry. You pay a fee each day that is supposed to cover water and coffee etc. Not once, did they refill the coffee pods or water bottles for the 3 nights that I was there (each day they made up the room). I called one day to get some water and creamer (used both creamers for one pod). On the third day, I called down because I ran out of coffee pods. The lady at the front desk said that it would be an extra charge. I told her this was ridiculous because they were never refilled. She said she would look into it and call me back. Really? 5 minutes later she called me back saying the system shows they replenished them but that they would send more and graciously waive the fee. The room comes with 2 caffeinated pods so for my stay I should have had 6 of them (if I used 2 per day) but I only used 2 the entire stay (the 2 that were in the room on the first day). She continued to explain that their system showed it was replenished, essentially saying that I was lying (there were no cups either since they were not replenished). Honestly, from a customer service perspective, I should NOT have to argue about getting a freaking coffee pod and convince them that I am not lying to save a couple bucks. \n\nAgain, I know I am complaining about a relatively small issue, but it was such a simple thing from a customer service perspective to not insinuate that the customer is lying and just send up 1 freaking coffee pod.\n\nIf I need to stay in FiDi again, I would likely not stay at this hotel. Such a shame that one bad customer service encounter can leave a foul taste in your mouth and ruin an otherwise nice stay.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The rooms and bathrooms are modern, clean and comfortable. A\/C  available in the rooms, we had a very large shower, and bedside lamps even had USB ports for charging devices. A clothes steamer was also provided which was very useful for a quick fix on creased clothes out of our cases!\n\nAll staff were extremely friendly and the concierge (Carmelo) was very helpful and knowledgeable, especially in advising the best option to get to JFK for our departure.\n\nThe location of this hotel is what really makes this a stand out hotel for me (this was my third time in NYC). I found it very easy to get around, regardless of where we went. Subway stations are seconds away from the hotel and several key tourist attractions are nearby, as follows:\n- 5 minute walk to 9\/11 memorial.\n- 5 minute walk to Wall Street (Stock Exchange etc).\n- 7 minute walk to Brooklyn Bridge.\n- 10 minute walk to Wall St. NY Ferry to get to Brooklyn\/DUMBO (I recommend doing this instead of walking all the way over Brooklyn Bridge then back, tickets were about $4).\n- 15 minute walk to The Battery for ferries to Statue of Liberty\/Ellis Island etc.\n\nThere are plenty of restaurants\/pubs\/bars in the surrounding area. A few of my personal recommendations:\n- Healthy Green Juice Bar (breakfast smoothies\/acai bowls etc) 30 second walk.\n- Kest\u00e9 Pizza (offer full gluten free menu) 5 minute walk.\n- Overstory cocktail bar (64th floor 360\u00b0 views of NYC skyline, incredible for seeing Brooklyn Bridge at night) 5 minute walk.\n\nOne final, huge, positive of this hotel, the location is also very quiet!

The Deluxe King room is quite small, but a lot of New York hotel rooms are small. We enjoyed the location. The concierge was super helpful, as were the doormen. \n\nOur stay was really dampened though by lacking housekeeping and - more than anything else - the response we got from the front desk about it. So this review is really for front desk management. \n\nDuring our whole stay it seemed the only thing housekeeping did is make the bed. Not once did they change the sheets, replace essential amenities (like the bathroom soaps or toilet paper) or even give us clean drinking glasses. They also just generally didn\u2019t tidy. On our third day we told the desk about this and asked for new soaps and toilet paper since we had run out. We had to go down and collect them. \n\nThere was still no improvement for the rest of the stay, so at check out when they asked if we had any feedback, we told them again about these issues and said we were disappointed that nothing was done even when we raised it mid-stay. The woman at the desk first responded by telling us she suspected we had left the \u2018do not disturb\u2019 sign on and, if so, it was our fault. When I reminded her that the housekeeper had come in every day to make the beds, so I didn\u2019t think it was our fault or that there was confusion about a \u2018do not disturb\u2019 light, she got really abrupt and defensive and started talking about how the snacks in the room were only a \u2018first day\u2019 thing and would not have been replaced anyway. That floored us - like she totally didn\u2019t care or listen to a word we said. Who was talking about snacks? I told you we weren\u2019t given soap or toilet paper and that dirty dishes were left in the room for five days straight, even after we asked for someone to come sort things midway through. Nobody cared about snacks. \n\nThat whole exchange left a really negative final feeling. We didn\u2019t ask for anything from the desk because of these issues so it isn\u2019t like we were fishing for compensation. We just gave feedback because they asked for it. To have the desk rep respond so defensively and abruptly to us on the way out the door wasn\u2019t great. If you don\u2019t want feedback then don\u2019t ask.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

After traveling for about 30 hours we just wanted to collapse into bed but we had to shower and stockpile water. \nWe spoke to a manager and he had been given little warning of the water outage himself. He admitted that they should have thought of the effect on people checking in on the day of the outage. He gave us a free upgrade and took 50% off the price of our first night.\nI don't understand the great reviews as the hotel is nothing special. The staff were great. The doorman really helped us out one evening when the taxi we thought we had booked didn't arrive. He went to the main street and hailed a taxi and brought it back to us. It seems that the only way to get a taxi is by hailing them down. A car service can be booked but that is more expensive.\nThe location of the hotel is a downside unless you want to be in the financial district. Everywhere there is scaffolding because of some regulation about checking the facades of buildings. Apparently it is cheaper to leave the scaffolding up permanently than to take it down and rebuild it when needed.\nThe booking sites all say that \"breakfast is available\". This is not true.

That was the first example of many, from all of the staff, of the extreme professionalism, humanity and courtesy at Artezen.\n\nThe location is fantastic, just a few metres from the A train, in the middle of the Financial District. Our room had a delightful view, far from the noise of the city that never sleeps. The bed was gorgeous. \n\nThere is a gym in the building and shops, restaurants and pubs all around - including my beloved Dunkin' Donuts just a few metres away.\n\nChinatown, Little Italy and Soho on one side to the North; the Brooklyn Bridge and the piers of the South East; Battery Park and the World Trade Center: they're all within walking distance.

We arrived at the hotel on a Friday morning, way before check in time (about10:00 AM). Chis the doorman greeted us hardily with a great smile.  Carmelo, the hotel concierge was right there to greet us as well.  We knew that our room would not be ready, but Carmelo checked in our bags to hold and offered the use of a restroom to freshen up. A real touch of class and service. The front desk took our telephone number and would call us when our room was ready.  Off we went to the Bronx Zoo with no worries.  Sure enough, around 1:00 PM, the hotel called to let us know they were ready for us when we ready to check in.   \n\nWhen we checked in around around 6:00P, the evening staff was as friendly, professional and pleasant as the morning staff.  Anthony processed our credit card, explained where the ice machine was located, the workout room, wifi information, exactly what was going to be charged to my credit card. Our room was on the 12th floor.  What I was impressed with was that there was the doorman, and three staff members that stood between the main entrance and the elevator leading to guest rooms.  We have stayed in nice boutique hotels in NYC FiDi where there is one clerk on duty, who doesn't even look up when a person enters the lobby, and the elevator is right by the front door.  And the elevators require the use of your room key card to work...going up....and down (so if you get ice...take your keycard. I'm glad I saved myself embarrassment). \n\nThe common areas, lobby and guest room were very clean.  The only two things that kept me from giving the 5th star were minor, but this is a new hotel and these should have been attended to right away.  If the small, minor things aren't fixed right away, maintenance  problems get bigger.  The foldable luggage rack had a broken leather strap.  It's minor, but noticeable. The second was that there was only one bottle of body gel for the shower. It was empty.  Jump out of shower all wet to grab the bar of soap.  \n\nThe plus side is that the windows do open, and the weather was very, very warm for the weekend we were there, and we had fresh air.  There are plenty of USB connections to charge all of your devices. There is an in room safe to store your valuables, a small refrigerator to keep beverages, etc.   \n\nIf you arrive by subway, the Fulton St. Center is a larger MTA subway hub.  It's serviced by several lines: A,C,J,Z,2,3,4,5 lines. There are a lot of connecting underground walk ways connecting all the lines.  If you find your way to the main hub\/lobby area at Broadway and John St., the hotel is just across the street from the John St. entrance\/exit.   \n\nThis hotel's staff show that they are truly people oriented and care about making you feel welcomed and important. I will definitely consider staying again when we return to NYC later this year.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We were allowed to check in one hour early, which was convenient. Our room on the 14th floor was quiet, clean, cozy, and comfortable. We're always looking for a quiet place to stay and this certainly fit our needs. We appreciated the daily complimentary bottles of water (included as part of the \"resort\" fee). The location was convenient for users of the Subway and close proximity to Brooklyn Bridge, 9\/11 Memorial, and the financial district. But many places are closed in this area during the weekend. The only downside of the room was that the pillows were really uncomfortable. My husband found the room to be on the small side, but for me it was fine. The bathroom was nice, small, but with a great shower; however the sliding doors are placed in a way such that water leaks out onto the tile floor (depending on shower head direction). Overall we recommend this hotel and hope to return.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Felt Like Home","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-09-18","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"It has been a month and a half since my guests and I stayed at the Artezen. Despite the length of time that has passed, it has meant a great deal to me to make sure I post a review of my excellent stay. \n\nMy guests from out of state and out of town and I stayed in 2 of Artezen's rooms for three days\/two nights, end of July into August 2021. Our experience was simply fantastic.  We were all made to feel comfortable and respected as guests immediately entering the hotel and throughout our stay.  \n\nThe check-in was smooth, the employees were kind and conscientious. Zero pompous attitude. \nThe wonderful manager, Francesco, was so truly awesome and had such amazing patience and a great attitude. He welcomed us to the hotel in such a sincere way, and even kindly kept a lookout for my car, to make sure it didnt get a ticket as I checked me and my guests into the hotel (I  was on a real time crunch and had no choice but to briefly stick my car in a loading zone). He was truly so helpful! \n\nTo make matters better, I overheard the manager tell a guest that he was going to clean his room to prepare it for what seemed like an unexpected check-in. The guest asked if the room cleaning personel were available.  Francesco sweetly told the guest that as the manager, he is willing to do everything needed for his guests. Wow. This made my day.\n\nMy guests and I all loved the rooms and felt very comfortable. The rooms were clean, the furniture stylish, atmosphere peaceful.  I stayed in my own room and it was wonderful. The bathroom, sheets, table, everything, was clean and appealing. \n\nMy bed was literally - literally - the most comfortable bed I have EVER  slept on in a hotel. EVER.  My body melted into the sheets and the mattress. I was exhausted and this amazing room allowed me to get rest that I really needed. It was definitely a home away fron home, and I do not say this lightly. \n\nJoseph was terrific and at my request, twice arranged  car service for my guests.  Despite mutiple phone calls back and forth that were needed to get the arrangements done, he remained patient at every call.\n\nThe young lady at the front desk at checkout  (sorry that I forgot your name) was very sweet and made nit just my stay but my departure great too. Who does that?? She did!\n\nFrom the young doorman to management, everyone I dealt with was professional, always respectfully referred to me by name, and made my experience the number one best hotel stay I have ever had. I have zero complaints and in fact, this hotel experience exceeded all of my expectations. The level of service at this hotel is the definition of top-notch. \n\nBy the way, the hotel location is great! There are blocks of stores, restaurants, and all kinds of eateries accessible by foot just by stepping out of the hotel.  A 15-minute walk will take you to the South Street Seaport.\nThe area around the hotel is fantastic. There are restaurants, stores, everywhere and accessible just by exiting the hotel and walking on the block or across the street. A 15 minute walk will get you the South Street Seaport.\n\nWithout a doubt, this hotel high quality, high standards, and now for me, a home away from home. Can't wait to stay there again.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

As we can\u2019t travel abroad safely, we figured that New York would give us an international feeling.  We found the hotel perfect for us.  We were greeted with smiles and cold bottles of water.  Although check-in wasn\u2019t until 3, there was a room ready for us early.  We just loved our room!  Although small, the layout was clever and mirrors gave a feeling of more space, as did the beautiful floor to ceiling windows.  Decor was muted and modern.  The air conditioning, so essential in these dog days of August, worked beautifully.  The room was very quiet.  The bed was comfortable and the Frette linens were absolutely amazing\u2026so smooth and comfortable!  A desk and chair, a fridge, and snacks, bottled water and coffee (although it was Nespresso, which we don\u2019t care for) were waiting for us.  For people like us, who like regular coffee, there is a nice little breakfast spot directly across the street called \u201cToasties\u201d.  We got coffee and breakfast sandwiches there daily.  Toiletries were of high quality.  We were on the 17th floor, but found the elevator quick and smooth.  \n\nYou can get anywhere from this hotel on the subway.  You need only walk a half a block to a huge \u201cstation\u201d, which is much more than I would have expected.  You can find excellent chains there, escalators, and elevators.  We took the subway to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Chinatown, the Meatpacking District and Washington Heights.  \n\nOur room, with its excellent shower and plush towels, was our oasis with this very hot summer weather.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":15237449,"title":"Very nice!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-08-05","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"We booked this hotel to enjoy part of a vacation week we had at the end of July. We had stayed a couple of nights in Brooklyn and wanted to be based in Manhattan for a couple of nights. The Financial District often has good deals on quality hotels and the deal for this property was no exception.\n\nWe had a relatively easy drive over from Brooklyn and found the hotel. There was some scaffolding up, so it may have been difficult for someone to find the property. John Street is quite narrow and between outdoor dining setups and parking only on one side, there was no real loading zone for the hotel. I was able to idle in a spot reserved for City employees and dropped my wife with some of our bags. I called the hotel to ask about their parking garage and they gave me the name and address of where to park. Google maps led me astray and I had to call again and this time got better directions to the garage. I walked a couple of blocks from the garage to the hotel and checked in. The hotel was well-staffed with three employees working the front desk and a concierge. Our room was not ready, so the concierge checked our bags and the front desk staff offered us bottled water and keys to use the bathroom while we were waiting for our room. The staff was always very courteous and well-meaning, but did not properly activate the key for the elevator and bathroom, so we had to call for help. Luckily they came right away and got us where we needed to go.\n\nWe ended up going out to lunch and came back later for our room. This time we were able to check in and had no trouble getting to our room. The room was quite spacious and very well appointed, especially for NYC. The queen bed was opposite the doorway and faced a big screen TV which had a fridge, desk, pre-programmed tablet, water, chips, cookies, and a coffee maker underneath. The hotel charged a small resort fee for the in room snacks and water, but it was worth it considering we would have bought multiple bottles of water every day. The bathroom was also well-appointed with a large shower and good sized sink area. Central air conditioning was controllable by a wall-mounted thermostat and directed air towards the bed. Next to the bed was a window with a south-facing view.\n\nWe slept very well both nights and everything was in working order in the room. The water bottles we had used were replaced the next day, but we did not receive any other housekeeping services. If that was the protocol due to COVID, that is fine, but I would have preferred that was explained to us. We used the gym one day, which had free weights, a couple of cardiovascular machines, and a multi-purpose weightlifting machine. There was also a separate yoga room. The weightlifting machine was a little difficult to use and was broken for some exercises.  We made do with the exercises that were available.\n\nWe checked out on the final morning and once again stored our bags as we were not quite ready to leave. They were willing to store our bags, but the concierge said something about coming back before 5:00PM. We were going to leave well before that, but it would have been nice to have the option to stay a little later if we really wanted to. We came back to retrieve our bags and walked to get our car from the garage. The hotel negotiated a discount rate with the garage as long as you give the hotel the ticket upon check-in and they give you a sticker. If I hadn\u2019t needed the car for the first part of the trip, I wouldn\u2019t have brought it. The subway and PATH trains are accessible right across the street from the hotel.\n\nOverall, I would definitely stay here again given the good rates they were offering and having a safe and quiet stay.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Fulton street MTA hub is huge and has pretty much every train line, it\u2019s directly across hotel. John street is narrow, so when you pull in, you\u2019ll have to hop car on the side walk so you can drop off luggage. Parking lot a short drive away, but ask for directions because it\u2019s easy to miss as the streets are super narrow and unlabeled. Numerous fast food within a block. \nHotel lobby: small, but Extremely clean, it smells very pleasant. Concierge very helpful. Check in was easy. You need a room card to access elevators. If you arrive early they\u2019ll give you a card for the bathrooms. Hallways are narrow but not a problem at all. Wheelchairs fit. \nRoom: reviews are correct in saying small. However that means smaller than most hotel rooms. We stayed on a double room standard, and we fit a twin blow up mattress easily. There\u2019s room, I was expecting a tiny room but it was not. The bathroom is very modern exactly like the photos, it is small, but not horribly so. Everything is so so clean I had zero complaints. You get free Fiji water every day, nespresso shots, and snacks included in price, cleaning staff does a great job. Beds super comfortable and 4 pillows per bed. We did not order room service but they have an outside place that brings food in. Gym modern and clean. Tv has chromecast. Fridge is the super small square ones, no microwave in room. \n\nConclusion: all the reviews are true. I was surprised because usually reviews tend to be enhanced but that\u2019s not the case here.

My husband and I stayed for a quick one night \u201cstaycation\u201d to soak up the city before moving cross-country and we needed a clean, comfy place to crash after a full, hot day of touristing.  Full disclosure, the Petite Queen room is, in fact, the tiniest hotel room I\u2019ve ever seen, but it was just what we needed, as we just had backpacks for our overnight and no large luggage.  The room could also work nicely for a quick solo business trip, but if you\u2019re staying longer, one of the larger rooms would be worth it.  The night guard who checked us in couldn\u2019t have been more pleasant, despite it being 12:30am when we arrived, and the receptionist at check out was also very friendly and made sure we enjoyed everything.  There\u2019s an $11 \u201cresort fee\u201d which covers the 2 waters, chips, biscoff, and nespresso in the room which was a welcome and thoughtful touch.  There were so many small details, like a black make up towel, nice toiletries, convenient outlets, and a full length mirror that made this room really stand out.  Not to mention the updated, sophisticated design of the rooms, and the large, totally luxurious shower.  The blackout curtains and silent A\/C made it very easy to sleep in.  My only VERY minor complaint was the pillows, which are the kind that look fluffy and then kind of deflate as soon as you lie on them.  I prefer something a bit more supportive and substantial.  But would absolutely recommend this place and would stay again in a heartbeat, hopefully for longer next time!","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Highly recommend!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-04-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I highly recommend this hotel. I had some initial concerns prior to booking, yet after speaking directly with one of the staff, I was put at ease. \nThe hotel has safe guards in place-extra staff, a hotel room key is needed in order to ride the elevators, the front doors are locked from 11:30-6:00am (room key access or ID matching reservation). \nI booked a queen deluxe room at a fantastic price. The room (#1804) was away from the elevator\/stairwell. The room was quite spacious for NYC standards, with plenty of room to move around. The bathroom, a bit tight with the door open, was fine with the door closed. A large vanity top, with a shelf underneath made unloading all of my toiletries a breeze (with room to spare for more than one guest). The lighting could have been better, but not bad. Fancy toiletries, thick white towels and a beautiful tiled shower with an amazing rain showerhead. The bathroom and room appeared to be spotless, including items being dust-free. The bed, on the softer side, was super comfortable, the pillows felt fine at first but quickly flattened. The heat\/ac worked perfectly. And finally a room with a larger trashcan to dispose of carryout food packaging! The resort fee included two bags of chips and two bottled waters on arrival. After that, each day there were 3 bottled waters. A mini fridge and Nespresso machine as well. \nEveryone of the staff were pleasant and welcoming, especially Carmello, who always seemed to be at the door greeting all guests coming and going, always opening the door. He offered to make dining suggestions if I needed them. The hotel's team can make or break a guest's visit and here they excelled at making it. Another mention, there was hardly any wait time for the elevators, as in many NYC hotels. \nThe location is fantastic for exploring, especially lower Manhattan and even walking the Brooklyn Bridge. \nThe only negative I could find with this hotel, which is a big one for me, is the quality of sleep in regards to noise. I am a light sleeper and always use a fan or white noise app when traveling. The first night I was awakened by conversations of noisy guests coming\/going from their rooms. With each entry\/exit, the doors to the rooms slammed shut. The second night I was kept up from 10:30pm-2:30am by loud music with heavy bass coming from a nearby rooftop (about a block away). I could see them from my room. This was no fault of the hotel's. In fact, I called the front desk at 12:30am to see if there was some sort of noise ordinance for the city. The gentleman was apologetic and recommended I call 311, or faster would be to call the police. I did neither, hoping some one else would call as I didn't know the exact location. I had my tablet and iPhone both playing a white noise app, along with pillows over my ears...still could hear the bass. The third day after returning to my room around 3:30pm, housekeeping was cleaning rooms on my floor. Once again, door slamming from the housekeeping closet and guest rooms. A bit annoying, yet I wasn't trying to sleep. And finally on my last night, I could hear a man's voice and his conversation. I got out of bed, no one was outside of the door. I listened and found it was coming from the bathroom, perhaps his voice was carrying from another room through the exhaust fan or possibly the walls. The noise would normally be a deal breaker for me, but  everything else was so perfect that I would over look it in the future. Perhaps there is some sort of mechanism that could be put on the doors of the rooms to minimize the doors from slamming. I would definitely stay here again, but next time I'll be sure to bring some earplugs.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"NONE"}

This in itself was not a problem as we didn't experience any street noise and it was light enough, however - the room type (2 queen beds to accommodate the 4 of us) has connecting\\adjoining doors and we were woken up on 2 separate nights by loud talking which felt like it was happening in our room. This was at 3am and again at 1am. The first occasion I rang the front desk and they went to speak to the people in the adjoining room. The noise stopped but it happened again 2 nights later.

Was on a mother-and-daughter \"girls trip\" and we wanted to opt for somewhere that was quieter, but well connected via subway. This hotel was perfect. Being on a side street in the financial district meant that it was quiet at night, which allowed for the perfect sleep. It is also steps (literal steps) away from Fulton Street subway station, which gave us access to each subway line we needed. \n\nFurthermore, the staff was very helpful. One of our girlfriends got to the hotel earlier than we did. Despite not being in person to check-in (as the reservation was under my name), the hotel staff allowed her to go up to the room earlier than us. They were also very courteous every night we returned from our outtings, as well in the mornings when we hopped off to our adventures. \n\nAccommodation-wise, the room felt very spacious for NYC. Additionally, the beds were really comfortable. I'm a stickler for a comfy bed and plush pillows, and our sleep was heavenly. This was underscored by the fact that the air-conditioning was quiet (a rarity for NYC, it seems!). The only two downsides to our room was that the bathroom was quite compact (challenging for multiple girls getting ready in the AM) and the alarm clock being very bright. We had to turn the alarm clock upside down and cover it with a pillow to tame the glow. \n\nOverall, a very pleasant stay. Would definitely stay again.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

I am usually hard to please but I must say I was so impressed with this hotel. It is small but perfect for a few days in the city. I never expect large rooms in nyc, but I do love an impeccably clean room, a fantastic bed and a great shower. This hotel excelled in all 3. Our small quiet room had everything you needed and they invested in the best quality things. I adored the bed with Frette Linens (usually found at luxury hotels) and super comfortable down pillows and comforter. I love that their small resort fee included spring bottled water (Fiji & Poland Spring), wifi as well as a nice espresso machine. Since the hotel is only 9 months old, there were no smells, bathroom was impeccably clean with high quality fixtures. I even loved the toiletries with a bit of vintage apothecary feel. The hotel is also located in a nice area, super close to city hall, Brooklyn bridge and with a subway stop right outside the hotel entrance. All the staff was wonderful and extremely friendly, ready to help with everything you needed. I stayed in much more expensive hotels that do not even compare in quality with Artezen!

Having never ventured south to this area, we were excited to try something new. (We usually stay in Midtown our north)\nThe hotel is nice-the people are super. (One odd exception I will explain later) We loved Artezen and enjoyed the size and number of rooms. (Rooms are not big by any stretch, but are comfortable) We didn\u2019t have a view, so I\u2019m not sure if there are viewers available. As a Traveling planner, I should\u2019ve asked for a tour. The rain shower head in the bathrooms is amazing. One thing I\u2019d suggest... once the bar of soap goes into the shower, replace it so your patrons don\u2019t have to constantly move it back & forth. (It\u2019s the small things that matter.)\nThe room stayed warm...too warm. I had no way to cool it down for sleeping. We opened our window but the noise from the street kept us awake. \nFront staff & guys at the door were great.. very friendly. However, this morning when we tried to check out, the front desk person was hard to wake. He was upright and eyes were slightly open but he was almost unresponsive. I asked him several times for a copy of my bill and it never happened. It was surreal. I asked him to print it & asked if he was ok several times. He got the print button because I heard it print, but when I asked him yet again, he mumbled something and said it wasn\u2019t ready?!?\nOnly other critique... there\u2019s no coffee in the room, only tiny nespresso pods. And, without a restaurant to fall back on for a cup of coffee (not to mention a glass of wine) it doesn\u2019t check all the boxes for me.  For that reason & those preciously started, I likely won\u2019t be back or put clients up here. Glad I tried it.

We did use it and was surprise how well it did removing wrinkles from our clothes.  The beds were comfortable but we did not like the pillows (I believe they were feather stuffed.

The hotel decor was modest, modern and simple.  It rained 2 out of the 4 days we were in NY, but the hotel had umbrellas guest can borrow. They were placed near the door on the way out.

Also, our room was facing John Street, which was noisy from around 0600hrs onwards, but in reality most hotel rooms in NYC suffer from road noise and our room was reasonably well insulated.  Don't let these two observations detract from my very positive review of an excellent hotel.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We had a Deluxe King room on the 5th floor facing John St. Overall, it was a nice stay. Almost everyone at the front desk was very friendly, and the concierge\/doormen were helpful. We stayed on West Coast time during our trip, and the curtains in our room kept out almost all the light. We never felt unsafe coming back to our room at midnight. The Fulton St Subway station is practically next door, and it's a huge station that takes you almost anywhere.\n\nWe didn't have much trouble sleeping, but if you have noise issues, I would recommend earplugs and\/or not having a room facing the street. There is no soundproofing from the hotel hallway or the street. \n\nThe bathroom looks gorgeous, but functionally could use some more hooks (there's one on the door), and a place to hang your towel that is by the shower door. Also, the bottom of the glass shower wall leaks, which we found out the hard way on our first night. If you mistakenly hit it with water from the handheld showerhead, or even splash it while showering, be prepared for floor flooding. The toilet paper roll is also in an odd place. Great selection of toiletries.\n\nPros: Bed was very comfy, room size was good for NYC standards, subway station on the same block, friendly staff, fast elevators, Chromecast capability on the TV, plenty of USB outlets, great blackout curtains\n\nCons: Noise buffer is non-existent (street noise and hotel hallway noise came right into our room), glass shower wall does not prevent water from coming out on the bottom, weird placement of toilet paper roll (you have to reach forward from the toilet)","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We choose the Artezen Hotel both because of its location and the great price we got on Expedia. The hotel is opposite the Fulton St subway station which offers a selection of trains to most of the city. For us it was perfect.\n   The room was spacious, the bathroom fine with all the toiletries and spare towels there if needed. The shower was good though no bath tub if that is what you want (not us). There was a fridge and coffee machine. We asked for and quickly received a second rack for the suitcases. Elevator service was speedy.\n   But the very best part of the already good experience was the STAFF!  They really were wonderful, especially Carmelo, going out of theirway to be friendly even giving my 12 year old a small gift at the parting.\n In addition, my partner (who is writing this), who found and booked the hotel made a mistake and booked us for 8 instead of 9 nights.

Jenelle and her colleagues were welcoming and provided a very positive impression at check in and the whole team welcomed us daily during our 6 night stay. This is a newer hotel located within a minute walk to a main subway called Fulton station. The subway system was initially daunting and intimidating but we found it easy to navigate and all of the riders were always happy to assist with directions. This hotel offered convenience to attractions like WTC, walkable to Statue of Liberty ferry at Battery Park, walkable to the Brooklyn bridge and some great food! The room was exceptionally clean and reasonably spacious for New York and the King bed was comfortable and air quality excellent. The air conditioning was great and not excessively loud. Being a newer hotel the wifi signal was excellent and the resort fee was reasonable less than 15 bucks and included three bottle of water daily. The elevators were quick and never an issue and ice machine is conveniently located on the forth floor just outside the elevators.

I have to say, I wish we had stayed for longer as this was our favourite hotel of the 4 we stayed in. The location was great- a short walk to all main attractions in lower Manhattan. We had stayed in the East and West previously and really liked downtown and the more relaxed atmosphere. \n\nWe did originally book a Queen Terrace but asked to change rooms as we were a little disappointed at the placement of the terrace. The Managers were extremely helpful and accommodating of our request to change, they couldn't do enough for us. We ended up in a Superior Queen which was an absolutely lovely room, very spacious for New York and new with all modern technologies. Everything was really clean and comfortable. We thought the Ipad was a nice modern touch and the ability to cast from our phones to the TV was great. I would advise requesting a room at the front of the building if possible, as there is more distance with other buildings and a better view. \n\nThe daily coffee and fruit infused water was really nice, as well as the welcome snacks and bottled water. The resorts fee was actually less per day for this hotel than others we had stayed at but you get more for your money. \n\nAll staff we encountered in the hotel were extremely helpful, including doormen, front desk and even the Janitor\/cleaner that helped me find the ice machines. The Supervisor on the evenings was also really helpful when we were looking to watch a movie that wasn't yet showing on the 'on demand' section of the TV. \n\nI would highly recommend this hotel and we will be returning when we stay in New York again.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The 42 inch TV was a great treat for a political news junkie such as myself.  There's a tiny refrigerator in the room, too!  I like a cold beverage or two while enjoying the room and it was nice to be able to store a few bottles of soda and water.\n \nBed was super comfy with luxurious linens.  The bathroom was spacious and well stocked with towels and toiletries.  Was very happy to see it had a walk in shower.  Always hated the tub\/shower combo in hotels.  Who takes a tub bath when traveling?  Nice robes and slippers are provided to slip into after stepping out of the shower.\n\nRoom service is provided by a service named Hospitality Butler.  I ordered breakfast online.  Tasty and hot breakfast was quickly delivered within 20 minutes.  The coffee left a lot to be desired but I'm a coffee snob so it's probably just me.  The room has a Nespresso coffee maker.  I prefer regular coffee so didn't use it.  A little disappointed there wasn't a drip coffee maker.\n\nParking is available on Gold street about a five minute walk down John street.  The hotel will give you a sticker to put on the claim ticket to receive a small discount.  Be aware that Gold street is a narrow almost hidden street.

The portable crib we needed was in our room when we arrived and was in perfect condition. It was cool to have Netflix and other streaming available when we chilled in our room after busy days. The patio available with our room was huge and lovely! I visit NYC fairly often but have never stayed in this area. Surely there are pros and cons, but overall we had a wonderful visit due in large part to the comforts of the Artezen Hotel.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This hotel is a diamond tucked away on the historic John Street in the heart of the Financial District. I couldn\u2019t have picked a better place to stay for four night. Everything is centrally located to this hotel and the bonus is that from the moment you walk in you\u2019re treated with 5-star customer service, the rooms are exquisite as this is a brand new hotel and the views literally take your breath away.\n\nCarmelo the concierge made sure my stay was impeccable from things to do, places to see and invaluable information about the city. When you visit ask for him if he doesn\u2019t find you first. The entire staff Michael, Jeanelle, Sal went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and relaxed on my visit. Sure everyone is use to the major chains but this boutique hotel trumps them all. \n\nScott Walker the General Manager was extremely personable, friendly and went out of his way before bracing for the rain to take time with me in answering all my questions and concerns. I will definitely give my business to this hotel again and again every time I come to New York City. If you\u2019re wondering where to stay stop guessing and book your reservation.

The stand out thing for me was the bed, which was extremely comfortable, but there were also lots of nice little touches throughout that gave the place a sense of luxury e.g. a bottle of water on arrival, an iPad for use in the room, good quality toiletries etc. The shower was excellent and I liked that the desk was slightly removed from the main part of the room: good for keeping work separate from rest. The curtains did a great job at blocking out light, the air con worked well and the room was very quiet - all in all a good recipe for a solid night's sleep.  There wasn't a huge amount of storage but there was a small cupboard\/wardrobe which was enough for me to hang a few dresses and jackets and there was a room safe for valuables.  I didn't use the gym but i could see it was stocked will all the essentials.  Being so close to Fulton St station makes this a great location for accessing the rest of the city and there are tons of places to eat close-by (i would recommend Nish Nush for falafel fans!).

Well mannered front desk staff are most gracious and make your check-in experience effortless and timely. The room I occupied on the 8th floor was thoughtfully designed to make good use of the square footage provided and included a small armoire, desk and chair in addition to a comfortable queen size bed. Above the desk was a wall mounted flat screen TV of good size. On a side of said desk was a coffee\/tea maker and 2 bottles of FIJI water. The bathroom was roomy with a good sized walk-in shower and controls that allowed the guest to dial up hot water without restriction (which is something most important to me). The toiletries provided were custom made from CO BIGELOW which was another nice touch akin to the gratis artesian well water. More thoughtfulness as concerns the guest experience is the inclusion of a high quality steamer in lieu of an iron : I was quite impressed how well this apparatus removed wrinkles in addition sanitizing my clothes.\nI slept like a baby and was happy with the self regulating thermostat provided hence a guest can set a temperature to their liking.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

As another reviewer mentioned, the shower is not intuitive and we, too, were dealing with a cold shower for a few minutes until we figured it out.  The rain head is also located too close to the wall to be at all useful.\n\n3. The alarm clock went off the first night we were there are 3:30 a.m.  Hotel maids should be trained to turn off the alarm clock as part of getting rooms ready between guests.\n\n4.

We arrived at 1:00pm but our room was ready, and the let us check in early.  We were assigned a room on the 14th floor, overlooking John Street.  Even though there was road construction going on, our room was quiet.  The 14th floor hallway is a little dark, painted a warm gray, but the rooms are nicely spaced, which was appreciated.  \n\nOur room was a bit small for two people, but it is well laid out, with plenty of outlets, and it worked fine for us.  We asked for a refrigerator to be brought to the room, and that fit easily under the desk.  The hotel leaves chips and cookies along with bottled water each day, which was much appreciated!  There is also a Nespresso Coffee masker, if you like that type of coffee.  We were not fans, but found a lovely coffee shop just a few doors down and on the way to the subway.\n\nThe TV was huge, and internet was included in the room. Using your Artezen access code, you can also watch Netflix, Hulu, You Tube, etc on the TV.  That worked out great for us!\n\nThe bathroom is roomy, with tiled floors and shower.  The shower has a wand and an overhead rain shower which is awesome for taller people.  The room was stocked with soft fluffy towels, and a bathrobe and slippers.  They leave shampoo and conditioner, lotion, shower gel, bar soap, and mouthwash in the bathroom for your use.  If you are traveling for business, there is also a steamer in the closet to freshen up your clothing.\n\nWe loved the proximity to the subway, and the many options for trains from The Fulton Center and the Oculus.  These two stations are also connected underground, which was very helpful in the rain!  Both areas also have access to shopping and restaurants as well.  Just take a left when you leave the hotel and the subway is a half block away.\n\nThe rooftop bar was not yet opened, and we did not check out the fitness center.  However, we were very impressed with the staff as well as with the amenities in our room.  The only thing I would change is to place a mirror on the wall outside the bathroom.  That would have been a big help getting ready in the morning.

By New York standards the rooms are nicely sized. I can\u2019t say enough good things about this property. Give it a try!!!!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The most friendly and helpful staff! Carmelo and Michael were super helpful, as was everyone there. One block from Fulton Street subway. Super quiet. Beautifully appointed room, comfortable bed, Linens and towels. Complimentary water and coffee in your room each day. Would definitely use this hotel again.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Carmelo opened the door for us giving us a very good welcome to the city and this extremely warmed our hearts in the cool and tiring morning after a 19-hour long flight! The hotel staff were always attentive, smiling and checking if we were in need of help. The room was cosy and well equipped, the complimentary mini bar and Nepresso coffee were absolutely many plus points! If I ever come back to NYC again, Artezen will definitely my first choice! Thank you team :)","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was so pleasantly surprised! The staff was all so lovely upon my arrival all the way through checkout. The room is luxurious with a comfy bed, Frette linens and a plush robe with slippers. There are even free snacks and water. I can not recommend this hotel enough and I will absolutely be back! Their rooftop is undergoing renovations but it looks like it will be amazing.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The yoga room and weight room was nice and fully stocked. Angel the doorman was amazing. I also had a male front desk guy that brought my food to my room from door dash because he didn\u2019t want me to leave the comfort of my room (overnight shift April 5). The shower head was amazing lol! The room was stocked with snacks and Fiji water and refilled daily (amazing). Hotel was very clean and quiet. Front desk crew guys were very nice and friendly. Never felt ignored always greeted. On the downside the internet did not work in the room and the cable went in and out the entire stay. The lounge isn\u2019t open yet so there wasn\u2019t any breakfast. Not a huge issue as we weren\u2019t in our rooms that much. And the staff made up for what was missing. Hotel is near a lot of restaurants and perfect location from subway.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}
