Our room was on the 3rd floor street side, this had its advantages and disadvantages, the main advantage was that you could walk up the stairs and thus avoid the terrible wait for the lifts, however there was a little bit (but not too much) street noise.  The hotel serves breakfast which was a bit chaotic but on the whole worked well.  On a couple of occasions if you went after half past 9 some of the items had run out and it was also sometimes difficult to find a seat.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1158763,"title":"Great stay!!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-07-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"First, a few standard things to say about the hotel. The window air conditioning unit was amazing in our room, it kept the room at a true 68 degrees. The beds were pretty decent, not near the standards of home of course, but my husband and I both have bad backs and neither of us left our vacation with stiff and sore backs. We showered at night after very hot and sticky days, so the showers were always great for us. They have big pump bottles filled with shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and body lotion. I know I saw conflicting previous reviews about this, so just know we were able to store our luggage before check-in since we arrived at 9:30am. Be aware that while breakfast is in session all stored luggage is placed openly in the main lobby, so you will probably want to make sure that you have locks on your expensive goods. Breakfast is absolutely crazy if you show up after 7:30. We could never find a seat indoors after that time, so we always ended up sitting outside. My biggest bit of advice would be to request the lowest floor room that you can get. The elevators are slow, hot, stuffy, and always busy so we took the stairs most of the time which was very convenient.\n\nWe took a Lyft when we arrived at La Guardia and it cost $75 with tip. If you want to be really adventurous like us, on the way back to La Guardia we took the N subway train to Astoria Boulevard and then hopped on the M60 bus (at the Hoyt Av\/31 stop which you can see before you even go down the exit stairs to the street). The bus arrives frequently, and tickets can be bought at the bus stop using the same type of machines as the Metrocard which itself can also be used as a form of payment. The bus ride costs the same as a subway ride. The neighborhood in that area doesn't appear to be the nicest area around though, but it is very busy, so you aren't in a desolate area.\n\nLastly, if you have been running around the city and you want to order food to eat in your hotel, Black Tap has great burgers and chicken tenders, and MEW has great sushi. Sitting down in these restaurants isn't easy without a reservation, but takeout for both of them was only a 20 minute wait and then we just ate at the tables outside the hotel.\n\nFinal bit of advice, if you are trying to get to Metlife Stadium you should probably leave 3 hours before the event if you plan to take the subway and Port Authority bus line which hundreds of people ride on. We missed half of the Manchester United soccer game because we only left 2 hours before gametime, and our Lyft ride to the stadium was stuck in traffic for over an hour which also added an extra $100 to our original quote from Lyft :(","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Breakfast was consistent with all other Hampton Inn\u2019s that we have stayed at.  Wifi was good.  Room was clean.

I\u2019m not the type to even write a review let alone a bad review, but I really think I need to this time in the hopes that it will save someone else much trouble. My wife and I after a long day of driving finally arrived to the parking garage which is like 3 blocks away from the hotel. Which that really wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if the hotel lobby would have had a decent luggage cart for us to borrow to get our belongings out of our car three blocks away. They did have a small luggage cart that I could borrow so after checking in I quickly grabbed the luggage cart and pushed it 3 blocks away to where our car was waiting to be parked in the parking garage. After loading as much of our belongings as I could on the insufficient luggage cart, my wife and I then had to hold everything else that we could in our arms as we struggled to push the luggage cart back to the hotel lobby. After we finally got back to the hotel lobby we had to wait for what seemed like the two slowest elevators ever known to man to reach the lobby floor so we could get in it to go to our room on the 10th floor. This hotel has something like twenty stories and a great many rooms yet they only have two elevators for this whole building for the guests. The elevators were so very very slow. \n       Upon arrival to the 10Th floor where our room was, the hallways are so very narrow. I couldn\u2019t even get the luggage cart that I had to push three blocks each way to get back to the hotel info our room on the 10th floor because of the hallway being so narrow so I had to make several trips from the cart around the corner in the hallway to our room several times just to get our belongings into the hotel room.\n       Upon our day to checkout of the hotel, there were other people checking in and these guests had filled up the only two luggage carts out of the whole hotel with their luggage yet they were not taking their luggage and luggage carts anywhere but just letting them sit there in the lobby. I asked the hotel clerk at the lobby desk if there was anymore possible luggage carts anywhere and she said no. I then said that I need to have a luggage cart so I can get my belongings out of the hotel room to which she said there was nothing she could do about anything in a rather uncaring way. In the meantime I have to go get our car checked out at the parking garage three blocks away. The attendant at the parking garage was very rude and said I could not even leave my car there for a minute after I paid for the parking fee. So I pay for the parking fee and while the valet is bringing our car down I\u2019m flat out running as hard as I can back to the hotel lobby to where my wife is waiting with all of our belongings after we had to carry everything down from our room by hand and while waiting forever for two very slow elevators. We fortunately were able to get everything loaded in our vehicle somehow at the end but it was a total nightmare.

We used the LIRR from JFK via Jamaica Station to Penn Station to walk the two blocks to this hotel. It does save about $50 dollars one way.  \n\nThe breakfasts at this Hampton Inn were our highlight.  There is a dedicated staff that puts everything together before 6:00AM.  Kudos to these fine workers.  We enjoyed going down to breakfast for our 3-night stay. \n\nThere were different breakfast selections for each day.  One day it was scrambled eggs; another day cheese omelets.  The turkey sausages changed too.  I liked the ones that looked like Polish Kielbasa\u2019s.  My wife did not like the coffee.  I found it most tolerable with the Hazelnut flavoring. \n\nWith that said, we did find this Hampton to be looking its age.  The elevators are atrocious.  There are only 2 elevators for 20 floors and they took so long to get anywhere.  If that could be fixed, I would rate this hotel higher.  A number of times we just walked down our 10 flights of stairs just to get out.  \n\nI would ask to get a \u201clower-floor\u201d if you are not paying for an Empire State building view.  \n\nRooms are indeed small.  We had just traveled from Portugal and found our European rooms much larger.  Everything is tight, even the bathroom.  \n\nOur sleep was good, though, as the beds are comfortable.  Our backs did not ache. And the room was clean. \n\nIce was just on certain floors.  You may want to inquire which floors have ice.  Luckily, we just had to use the stair-case to go down one level to get our ice.\n\nIf you can get this hotel at a good rate, you may have found a winner, even with the flaws. If you found this review to be \u201chelpful\u201d in any way, please give me a \u201chelpful-check\u201d to let me know.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Staff was very nice and accommodating, room and public areas were clean, and I slept well.\nThe only odd thing... The TV.\nWhile I don't watch a lot of TV, when I'm back in my room after a long day of meetings, I like to be able to sit down and watch TV or have it on while I'm catching up on emails and other tasks.  However, there was no channel guide! Not an electronic one on the TV or a printed one in the room. There were certain channels I could tune to that showed me what was on TV (but didn't even show all the available channels), but the channel numbers were incorrect. No \"guide\" button on my TV remote either.\nI thought this was odd and must have been an oversight, so the next morning after my first night, I stopped by the front desk and inquired about this. The lady was very nice but said they didn't have a channel guide, but I was welcome to call down to the front desk if I was looking for a certain channel.\nMost hotels I stay at have an on-screen channel guide or a little card in the room (which I understand with covid restrictions may not be feasible).\nJust seemed odd to me.  Fortunately I found the 1 channel I wanted to watch and was good for my stay.\nWould I stay here again? Probably, if I needed to be in that vicinity of the city.

So we had to go and we stayed this last weekend, we sleep very uncomfortable off course, but no other choice. \nRoom had enough room for our luggage, desk, beds and a chair. \n\nBreakfast was great and Luis was also super helpful with us and everyone at the time of the breakfast and maintain the breakfast area well clean but Sunday and Monday the area was not very clean. \n\nThe room lady who made our room 204 from Jan 17-20 never put enough towels, I always had to ask for extra towels every night after all day walking. \n\nThen the guy who works at night poor guy he was always bringing everything and first night sheet had blood, so he came to made our bed (sorry we did not get his name but he was from Jamaica) he was super nice guy too. \n\nFront desk always helpful and fast respond all the time.\n\nLocation in my opinion was far from Times Square, about 10 blocks. \n\nI did not take pics of the room but was a second floor not noise at all. \n\nHotel was clean and outside areas too.\n\nI will not stay here again, only because it was dar from Times Square since I stayed before in that area.

Very friendly and always willing to help. But this is where the good news end.\n\nHotel rooms in New York are generally small ... the rooms in this Hampton Inn are very small and show the age of the hotel. And I am not talking about a scratch here or there ... the ventilator in the bathroom was strangely hanging from the ceiling, for instance. The bathroom was not perfectly clean (especially in \"hidden\" places).\n\nBut the real nightmare came with the elevators. There are 20 floors (each with 8 rooms) served by just the elevators (each of them can accommodate ca. 10-12 people) and one of them broke down during our stay and was out of order for two days (or maybe more ... it was still our of service when we were leaving). You can guess how it look in the morning when everybody was trying to get their breakfast. One \"roundtrip\" of the elevator up to the 20th floor and back to the lobby took 15 minutes or so because on the way down the elevator stopped at each floor although it was already full. On the 2nd day the only working elevator was used by some construction company which was probably doing some renovation for moving material up and garbage down while the hotel guests were hopelessly waiting and waiting. On several occasions we ventured to walk down from the 17th floor because we did not want to spend most of our time in NYC by waiting for an elevator.\n\nI understand that things break down from time to time but the hotel can do better to handle such an emergency situation. I would also expect the hotel operator to have some contingency plan to fix the elevator within hours and not days.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Complimentary hot breakfast was great and options changed daily. \n\nCan't say enough about the super friendly and helpful employees. When we arrived the first evening, we found out our Expedia booking created two reservations for our stay and we'd have to visit the desk again the next day for new keys. Came down in the morning and the day clerk knew about the situation and had new cards ready for us. Took about 30 seconds to close one reservation and open the other. I was very impressed they easily rectified the reservations and allowed us to keep the same room. The day clerk also helped us with a ride to the airport, spotted us getting off the elevator at check-out and escorted us to the car. \n\nSo I want to make special mention of Jason and Ryan for their exceptional service during our stay.

After I went to sleep, someone opened my hotel room door.  I had the security lock on so all I saw was a band of light around the door and heard a man's voice. I called out and they went away. I got up and closed the door and reset the lower lock, which the key had opened. I went to call the front desk when I heard the person at the door again, so I asked loudly who it was and they left. The floors have only 7 or 8 rooms clustered around the elevators. I called the front desk staff person, who said she'd \"call the engineer\" and call me back. I waited ten minutes and called again.  She said she hadn't heard back from the engineer. Ten minutes later I called again and they said they'd re-key the door, which they did. By the next day, the hotel claimed no one had used a key on my room at that time. They said they had a \"report\" that showed that but it's now six days later and they still won't send the \"report.\"  The manager has made it clear they \"admit no guilt\" and acts like I'm making it up.  I stay in a lot of hotels and have never had this happen before, although I've heard people fumble at the door and then realize they have the wrong room.  But to have the door opened was truly scary.

When we checked in on Mon 15-Jul, we checked into room 504, which was very poor quality. The carpet was torn in multiple places exposing the floor, the room barely had space for 3 of us with our suitcases but what put us off completely was the filthy stentch in the room. Later that day, I went and mentioned the issue to the Reception, with a hint that I am a senior reviewer in Tripadvisor - that did the trick and I was moved to room 405 which was much better, but why spoil the experience by giving a dodgy room in the first place!\n\nLeaving aside the check-in experience, my new room (405) was clean and had more space (I know NYC cannot afford space, so was quite happy with the room), the bed and linen was very comfortable, bathroom was small but good enough and well stacked with towels and toileteries. Mini-fridge was on request which we didnt request, owing to the room's space.  \n\nWhat I loved - The complimentary breakfast was a real blessing as we were always hurrying in the morning for our guided sightseeing tours, the 24X7 fresh coffee and tea & cold water in the breakfast area on offer was just very human thinking by the hotel mgt. The location is just perfect, you come out of 34th st- Herald sq subway and the hotel is 15 steps from it. The surrounding places are filled with eating, drinking & shopping options, so that was 5 star for us. Also, Jason (at reception) accepted our request for a late check-out (instead of 11, he moved it to 12, though not much but still thanks for the intent!) which I felt was nice.\n\nWould I visit this Hampton Inn again when I return to NYC? Maybe, maybe not. I had a good experience, but not something which would stop me from exploring other hotels in the area. Also, this is a Hilton group hotel, so Hilton has to do some serious quality checks in here.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I think I failed to read into the fact that most of those reviews were something along the lines of \"decent place to sleep, didn't spend too much time here.\" Well, I didn't either but I somehow wish I spent less time here.\n\nStarting off, check-in is at 3 but it took close to an hour because they had one person at the front desk and a million kids on a high school trip and a few other families. There were other employees floating around and occasionally someone manning the Hilton Honors station but not for long.\n\nBasically - our room wasn't ready so they had to find another. Fine. We get a room on the 17th floor. First thing I notice after traveling all day - THE TOILET DOESN'T WORK! Fantastic, I just need to pee and I need to leave for my event anyway, so I figured I'd deal with it later. \n\nI come back later that night to tell the front desk about the toilet and they send someone up. Now the maintenance people are some of the nicest people I've dealt with throughout this whole thing. But it took an HOUR AND A HALF of my time at midnight to fix this thing. And once it was fix, their tools left a weird black ring in the toilet. They told me someone at the front desk was documenting this all and someone would come in to clean or paint the inside of the toilet because of the black marks. \n\nWell. No one did. No one even mentioned it to us or called up to our room. It was like that the whole weekend.\n\nNext up, the \"breakfast.\" I legit thought the omelette was in a tortilla because of how hard the outside of the egg was. So, I think you can kind of gather your thoughts on how the rest of the breakfast fare is.\n\nTo top it all off, one night our keycard wasn't working. My husband went down to the front desk to inform them and the girl needed an ID. Okay.... we have the keycard right here. We're tired. We've been here for 2 days and you've seen us. But you need my ID. Okay. I'm waiting for him on the 17th floor, desperately trying this keycard and he comes back asking for his ID. So, he goes back down there and the other employee doesn't ask for his ID AT ALL and hands him a keycard. Okay, thank you but why couldn't you just have done this in the first place?\n\nOh and all those reviews about it just being a decent place to sleep? It's not. The room is either too hot or unbearably cold no matter what you set the temperature to. The blankets are scratchy and stiff. I even asked for more when the room was too cold and they came up with the most ragged and scratchy blankets I have ever used in my life. It's also just the most uncomfortable bed I've ever slept on with pillows that just immediately flatten when you use them.\n\nWe left a night early. I'd rather have a long drive back than have to spend another night in this hotel. After telling the front desk our story, they offered $50 off. FIFTY DOLLARS. WHAT A JOKE! We didn't want to argue that because we wanted to get out of that hotel as fast as we could. But they must be kidding when they offered that. They really, really, REALLY don't care about who stays at their hotel.\n\nMy advice, don't stay here. A hostel would be better. A garbage chute would be better. The pile of trash outside the building is more comfortable than the bed. The only good thing is the location but with another hotel literally next door and a thousand more in the city, don't stay here. Don't even consider it.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The way I got treated at this hotel, during my stay here in February, left me with a really bad taste. It actually started out pretty well. I had booked a room with a view of the Empire State Building. You could see the building, but it wasn't what you'd call a view. So, I wanted to see if they could change my room to a lower floor (which I prefer). They were able to accommodate me. The folks at the front desk, also guided me to an amazing camera store. The trouble started when I realized that the room wasn't heating up enough. Weirdly, the air conditioning unit was blowing hot air for sometime and then it was blowing cold air. Now, this might not have been too much of a problem in a larger room, but given that the room I was in was really small (again, not a complaint, that is just how most NYC hotel rooms are) the freezing air was blowing right on my face. \nWhen I called the front desk, the guy sent up a technician. I tried explaining it to him, but he kept saying everything was okay. Since the hot\/cold blowing was only happening every 15-20 minutes, when he was there, it was only hot air and he refused to believe me. He got quite rude and behaved as if I was blaming him personally. So I just asked him to leave. I called the front desk again, to see if they could find me another room. It was close to 10pm and really cold outside and I really didn't want to go to the trouble of moving to another hotel. Also, since I was using NYC as a stopover to catch an international flight in two days, I had a lot of luggage with me. And, I had ordered dinner for two nights. The hotel couldn't find me another room. So, I was compelled to leave, since the cold air had started affecting me by that time. My throat started feeling sore, my head started aching, and there was no point getting sick before a 20+ hour journey. Luckily, I found another hotel at a reasonable price.\nI had never expected that I would be charged, especially since Hampton Inn's motto is that they won't charge us if something is wrong and they can't put it right. The front desk guy, again, appeared to be understanding. He even helped with my luggage and offered me points. I requested him to just make sure that I wasn't charged, since it wasn't my fault that I had to leave. He promised to speak with the Manager.\nWell, I was charged the full amount for that night. When I reached out to Hilton, they sent me a lame letter saying they couldn't really do anything, since the Manager said there was no issue. Nobody - neither Hilton, nor the Manager - considered, why I had to leave on a freezing night and move to another hotel, if there was no issue. It was a nightmare! What had started as a pleasant stay soon turned into literally the worst hotel experience I've ever had and I spend close to 100 nights a year in hotels. I was disappointed with the hotel, the Hampton Inn and the Hilton brands. This is what I got for being a loyal customer!","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

We booked this Hampton because it is centrally located in Manhattan and close to the Empire State Building. It\u2019s a very compact hotel and a lot smaller than the standard Hampton. Our room and bathroom was also very compact with not a lot of room to accommodate our four suitcases. That being said it was adequate and we managed ok. The room and bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was fine with a good stock of toiletries. The breakfast was the usual Hampton breakfast but the breakfast area is also compact for the size of the hotel and as a result gets very busy in the morning. We did manage to get breakfast and we enjoyed it. Our room was located on a high floor and at the rear of the hotel so we looked onto the back of buildings and office blocks. I guess no matter where you are located in the Hotel, you are going to be looking over onto adjacent buildings. \n\nThe massive plus for this hotel is that it is centrally located in Manhattan to walk either north or south. It\u2019s also in walking distance of Times Square and Grand Central Station. The cost of the Hotel is also very competitive considering you get a free breakfast. \nThe staff were very friendly and accommodating and kindly organised us a limo to take us to Brooklyn cruise terminal to get our ship back home.

It is an EXCELLENT location; about 2 blocks from Penn Station which is at 33\/34th streets & 7th\/8th Ave (hotel is at 35th & 6th Ave). We took the AirTrain from Newark Liberty airport & transferred to NJ Transit ($13\/adult one way fare) & got off at Penn Station & walked to the hotel for about 10 minutes. If you have young kids or lots of luggage you may want to grab a taxi from the Penn Station to the hotel.\n\nThere is also a subway station within 10-15 steps from the hotel door that can either directly take you where you need to go or you can easily transfer to another line.\n\nIf the weather is too cold or wet, you can just use the underground paths to navigate your way from the subway station by the hotel all the way to the Penn Station (do NOT get on any trains; just navigate the underground maze & follow the signs for the Penn Station. You should come out very close to Penn Station if you get out the correct exit).\n\nHotel is also walking distance (10-15 minutes) from Times Square\/Broadway shows & the Empire State Bldg.\n\nOur room had 2 double beds; for a group of 3 or 4 people the room is a bit tight. But hopefully you are not indoors for too long while visiting NYC.\n\nThe mattresses were not as comfortable for me but I also have a bad back. The bathroom sink & toilet did not seem to have been washed on a daily basis; but overall the bathroom was clean.\n\nThe complimentary buffet breakfast is absolutely wonderful. They have 2 or 3 different variety of hot items that they rotate throughout the week (western omelette, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.), delicious NY bagels, donuts, muffins, yogurts, fruits, cereal, juices. There should be something even for the pickiest eaters in your group. The ladies that help out in the morning are wonderful; they quickly brought out anything that had run out. The only minor complaint is that (for my taste) the hot breakfast items were not as hot as they should be & the hot water was also not hot enough for making tea.\n\nIf you are a Hilton Honors member, book your room online directly through them using the AAA or some other savings program to get the best value.\n\nPleasant young ladies & gentleman working the front desk. Ask them for maps & the city tour book especially if it is your first time in NYC.\n\nOverall an excellent location, excellent staff & excellent value. We will definitely stay there again.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Very close to the Empire State Building, Bryant Park, Herald Square, and the subway. It's a short walk to Madison Square Garden and Times Square. As far as a home base for exploring the city, it doesn't get much better than this. But the hotel itself was a bit disappointing, so don't expect to spend much time in your rooms. I was on the 20th floor so street noise was not an issue for me at all, but the hallways are loud with the closing of doors. Rooms are tiny and cramped, with no fridge. Shower curtain had holes in it, closet door was broken, A\/C unit was extremely loud. They advertised the room as having a Empire State Building View, which technically it did - you just had to stick your head out and up to see it. Check-in also took a while, despite being a Diamond member.\n\nAgain- if you are going to spend all of your time exploring the city, this is a great hotel for that.. but keep your expectations extremely low about the hotel property and rooms.. this is far from a luxurious stay.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Wedged between the shopping havens of 6th and 5th Avenue, not to mention 30 seconds walk from Macy's, with Broadway & Times Square a 10 minute stroll, a Subway station on the corner of the street, Grand Central Station, the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Centre, Flatiron Building all a short walk, and the imperious Empire State Building looming over from just one block away. \n\nThe complimentary breakfast is worth the body-dodging in the small buffet area. And the waffle-making machine is definitely worth the queueing to use. You're given the option to have a blowout American breakfast (sugary cereals, bagels\/muffins, French toast, potatoes, waffles etc.), or you can keep it light with fruit, yoghurt, or some toast. The only thing missing for me was pancakes - but you're not short of nearby diners where you'll find some (I'd suggest Ellen's Stardust on Broadway, fyi). \n\nTo rattle through some of the other stuff the hotel was great for: \n- Good quality free WiFi\n- Nice and clean\n- Rooms a perfect size (we had a King) \n- Bed was very comfortable and was massive!\n- Heating with thermostat to adjust\n- 24\/7 complimentary tea, coffee, water, hot chocolate. \n- Good TV channels (particularly if you like US Sports or Seinfeld\/Friends)\n\nLast thing I'd like to comment on was the staff. As a Brit, I often forget just how much better the service is in the States. And the Hampton Inn was no exception to that. After a long flight and journey to NYC we were greeted with a smile and staff who really couldn't do enough for you. They were happy to help with any questions we had, and even found us an excellent spot to watch the Super Bowl. On our final day, they were happy to keep hold of all our luggage until we had to leave for the airport, allowing us to spend our final hours exploring the city suitcase-free. Really can't speak highly enough of the staff. \n\nWhen (not if) we return to the Big Apple, we will definitely be looking to book the Hampton Inn again.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The bathroom was a good size however I found the shower didn't have the best water pressure. The bed linen and bathroom towels had seen better days and should be replaced in my opinion.\n\nAn issue with this hotel is the terrible elevators, you could be waiting sometimes upwards of 5-10 minutes once you pressed the button and once inside it felt like they were moments away from breaking down.\n\nThe hotel is in a good location with the entrance to the train station just down the street.\n\nI didn't eat breakfast at the hotel so can't comment on that but I did love the free coffee and tea facilities in the hotel lobby.\n\nOverall, we had a pleasant stay at this hotel and I would stay here in again when visiting New York.\n\nPS: Edwin is a real asset to the hotel, he was very friendly and helpful.

The facility was clean, comfortable, well-staffed, and reasonably priced.  WIFI was also included with good connectivity.  A bar next door called the Monarch boasts the best view of the Empire State Building.  Their boast is not over stated.  The view is spectacular. By the way, this hotel does have Empire State Building view rooms but we opted for a lower level room(4th floor) for speedier elevator access in and out.

This closet would not close as the safe would not close so we had to keep our luggage on the bed and remove it when we wanted to sleep. The carpet was old and nasty looking. I felt that this was not the standard that I was used to with the Hilton Chain, and I even used my Hilton Honors points for this place.

The staff were really helpful, if you asked them a question they would google & print out a map or instructions. Room was clean and shower \/ bath had really good hot water pressure which never depleted. \nNot the prettiest hotel, but certainly didn\u2019t regret my 5 night stay here.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

They are very slow. The hotel is 20 floors (I think), and we were on the 7th floor. The hotel is relatively narrow, with only 8 rooms per floor. There are apparently no service elevators, as the housekeepers and maintenance staff also used the same two passenger elevators as the guests.

We arrived early in the morning (well before check-in) and were able to leave our luggage for the day and the staff even invited us to have breakfast!\n\nI read lots of other reviews before booking and offer the following:\n**Staff were very pleasant and helpful at making recommendations\n**Elevators - we had zero issues with waiting for an elevator at any time of day\n**Our room had only two sets of towels for two people for three nights. We requested extra towels two days in a row. The first day we were given only one new towel (not the two towels and two washcloths we requested) and the second day we didn't get any (but pilfered some from the housekeeping cart). Never did get any washcloths. Check your towel supply and ask right away!\n**Breakfast was typical for Hampton and the staff kept up with demand very well. Hot coffee and cold water were available all day.\n**The room was small (as expected for NYC) but clean and the bed was comfortable. The only issue with the room was the bathroom fan. It was sort of hanging out of the ceiling, very loud, and ineffective.\n**Our room was on the 9th floor, front and we had no excessive street noise at night\n\nWe would definitely stay here again!","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I pulled out my ID and credit card, and waited. She didn\u2019t acknowledge me, put the person on hold, or attempt to start my check-in while I was standing there. She continued to \u201cargue\u201d with the caller about how she couldn\u2019t do anything to help unless the internet company called her. That took about 10 minutes. Then she finally got off the phone, and another phone started ringing. She asked me to hold one second, and picked up the other phone. She asked that person if they could hold, but they didn\u2019t want to hold and a new issue started with this caller booking on Expedia. Then another 5 minute conversation. She could have easily grabbed my ID and credit card, and started my check-in while she was talking. Anyway, next morning about 8:00 am I go to take elevator to lobby from the 12th floor. It\u2019s taking forever, and finally an elevator opens but it is packed with people and a stroller. No way for me to fit. I wait another 10 mins, and the only other elevator stops on my floor but it\u2019s going up. It appears to be the housekeeping manager in that elevator. He holds the elevator open for about 5 mins while he talks to the maid on my floor. I\u2019m thinking people are probably waiting on every floor while this guy makes his rounds holding up one of only two elevators in the hotel. Finally he leaves, and the other elevator stops on my floor. Inside is a housekeeping staff member with all her cleaning supplies next to the buttons. It\u2019s hard to press your floor. As we go down, several stops, and more people trying to fit on the elevator. The maid doesn\u2019t get off to let guests on the elevator. She\u2019s going to the 2nd floor, and she\u2019s getting there no matter what. People are turned away because they can\u2019t fit due to the maid\u2019s equipment on the elevator. So we have two elevators on a weekday at 8 am being used by staff when that\u2019s the busiest time for people to get down to breakfast or to start their day. Makes no sense.

I chose the hotel based on brand, location and the reviews were not too bad.\nI arrived late evening, and my 1st impression was it was not the warmest of greetings. I felt like I had interrupted the 2 folks at reception. Check in was fast, show my credit card and ID, and handed me keys with minimal interaction.\nMy room was on the 2nd floor. The door was odd as the key card insert was behind the electric board, it was easy access, but did look odd. The room decor is dark,and during the day, this is not helped by the building view of the room as there is no natural light. It was a NYC standard size room, small. But ok for 1-2 people. It is older and a little tired with its furnishings, but clean.\nThe bed was comfortable and a good size, could have fit 3 or 4 people in it.\nBreakfast was fantastic, a good selection of options, and it was not too overcrowded at the times we went down. I really enjoyed it. \nIf you are all about location, this is perfect, you are literally 2 mins to the subway system, and right in the centre of Herald Square. This is my favourite location in the city because it\u2019s away from crowded Times Square, but close to everything. \nIn the bathroom under the sink was a shelf, so when using the shower I put my clothes there to keep them off the floor. Unfortunately on my last day, I left my Pajamas on the shelf. My bag was locked, and it was later that evening I discovered I was missing them and immediately remembered where they were. I called the hotel, and got told they would check with housekeeping in the morning. I did not hear back so when down that end of the city I popped in. They claimed they could not find them, even though both my friend and I could explain exactly where they had been left (they were in as new condition Garfield brand). This then comes down to 2 things - a dishonest cleaner, or a not very good cleaner and the next guest taking them (unlikely). A report was filed, and I was told it would take about 3 weeks...it is now past 3 weeks and I have heard nothing. It should also be noted at the time there has been 100% no apology. While careless of me to miss taking them, I expect honesty from the hotel, and some form of contact. I am very disappointed in the lack of action on this. For this reason I will never stay at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Received an upgraded room on request being a Hilton Honors member - terrific corner room, top floor with an Empire State Building view! \n\nLOCATION: Hotel is in a great location - near the subway, Penn Station\/MSG, Bryant Park - all within a very short walk. Straight walk to get to Times Square, Broadway, etc. Several restaurants nearby, including a couple of great carts!\n\nROOMS: Room was a 2-double room and was NY-small, like most in the city. Very clean and quiet on the whole. I'm sure being on the top floor helped drown out the street noise, well, that and the earplugs we always travel with. Not a lot of storage area for suitcases. You'll have to use the armoire and chest of drawers.\n\nHOTEL:  All employees we came into contact with were quite nice and always smiling. The breakfast area can get quite crowded on the weekends and the breakfast food area can get demolished several times during the service hours. I'd recommend getting there early or tempering your expectations. Food was basic Hilton fare - the same stuff you'd find at any other Hampton in any other city. Decent but nothing to write home about. The elevators were a bit slow when the hotel was busy. There are only 2 elevators for all 20 floors (I think 8 rooms\/floor). It can take a while depending upon the time of day. Once, it took a good 10 minutes to get to the ground floor to pick us up after breakfast.\n\nOverall, I'd say any room facing the street will have a great view. If you are a HHonors member (Gold\/Platinum), be sure to ask for an upgrade when you make your reservation. It was a really great stay here and I will definitely look at going back when we need to return to the city that never sleeps. Thanks Hampton!","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It is not In\/out parking.  They will put your car into a very tight space and roll all the windows down...I don't know why!  \n\nThe hotel staff was so wonderful.

We went to the city for the weekend to celebrate our daughter\u2019s birthday and our younger child came down with the dreaded stomach bug days before departure.  Having booked through the Hitlon Honors app, the free cancellation period had just passed, but I called the hotel and Ashley, one of the managers, expressed genuine concern for my younger daughter\u2019s health and reassured me that as long as we kept in contact with her and if indeed we weren\u2019t going to make it, to just call the morning of.  Thankfully we did not need to and got on the train and rode the 2 hours into the city from our home. A quick 15 minute walk from Grand Central and we arrived at the hotel.  The front desk staff were amazing.  I had read reviews about \u201cno fridges in the rooms\u201d - all you have to do is ask my friends! We were fortunate that they still had some available and a member from the maintenance team immediately delivered it after we got to our room! The room is a good size for a New York City room - not overly spacious but good enough for a family of 4 for the weekend who wouldn\u2019t be in the room except to sleep and shower.  On two occasions, front desk staff ran stuff up to our room (shower cap and a new key card) and even after we checked out, held on to our bags free of charge.  We did not partake in the breakfast, as we wanted to nosh on authentic NY bagels and explore Chelsea Market.  After checking out of our room, we came back to the hotel after a final stroll and one of the gentlemen at the desk overhead my 4 year old saying she needed to use the bathroom and without us even having to ask, he produced a key card so we could access the bathroom on the lower level.  Such a great staff!  Thank you all sincerely for making our trip a wonderful experience! ","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It sits back further than some of the other buildings on the street.  \nThere is outside seating as well as a couple of chairs in the lobby as well as a bar\/restaurant.  \nThe receptionist were nice and helpful at checking.  Our room attendant was very courteous as well.  \nYou can also purchase snacks and food at the pantry beside the front desk.  \nThere are less than ten rooms on each floor but the elevators do take quite a while so if you are in a hurry, you may want to take the steps if you are on a lower floor.  \nThe business center and gym are a floor below the front desk area.  \nThe rooms were standard, beds, desk, microwave and refrigerator.  \nOur room didn't have much of a view.  We were directly facing a classroom for a school right across the street.  \nThe next block over is the largest Macy's, a mall and several other shopping stores.  The Empire State Building is about two blocks away.  There are several restaurants and souvenir shops that are just a couple minutes away, by foot.  \nTimes Square is a short walk as well and it is advised to just walk, if able, or take the subway, which is  pretty much right at the hotel, instead of taking a taxi, Uber or lyft. You will spend more time in a taxi, due to traffic, and could have already walked and be enjoying your destination.   \nThere was constant trash on the street, daily, waiting for pick up which was a drawback. The light switches were filthy so good thing I always travel with Clorox wipes and Lysol spray.  There were a couple of areas that could have used a good cleaning.  \nThe authorization hold ($50 per night) took a few business days before it was released.  \nOverall the stay was ok as we were not in the room much.  If the hotel was offering a cheap price, I could possibly consider staying here again.  ","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The only downside is that one of the elevators was out of order for our 4 day stay, which made for lengthy waits getting to and from the 14th floor.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

That said, the hotel is perfectly located just off Herald Square litterally \"2 steps\" from Macy\"s and all the shopping on 34th street. Subway entrance is right on the corner. I stayed 8 nights and although my room was on the second floor facing the street it was not noisy. The room was very large, clean, the bed comfortable, HD tv, plenty of drawer space and had a safe and coffee machine. Breakfast was included and there was a large and tasty selection. Antonia was in charge of keeping the buffet well supplied and always had a smile and \"good morning\" for everyone. There was a glitch in the beginning with housekeeping but after I complained Mirna - the head of housekeeping- came to see me personally and apologized. After that I got towels shaped like a heart on my bed. Now that's customer service! The front desk staff were very pleasant and always helpful. The only thorn on the rose were the elevators. Only 2 old and slow ones to service 20 floors of guests so there were many times when the wait was very long. They really should install new elevators.\nIf you're not looking for grand entrances, large lobbies, uniformed bell boys and in house restaurants but want a very nice, cozy, perfectly located and reasonably priced (for NYC) hotel - this is definitely for you.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Vi ankommer med to b\u00f8rn (8 og 11 \u00e5r) kl. 24 midnat (kl 6 om morgenen dansk tid, s\u00e5 p\u00e5 det tidspunkt havde vi v\u00e6ret v\u00e5gne i n\u00e6sten et d\u00f8gn).

Vi fik at vide, at vi den f\u00f8rste nat kunne blive indkvarteret p\u00e5 et s\u00f8sterhotel ca 6 minutter i bil fra hotellet. Og at vi s\u00e5 kunne ringe kl 9 n\u00e6ste morgen og sp\u00f8rge, om v\u00e6relset var klar. Herefter fik vi at vide, at vi bare kunne g\u00e5 ud og praje en taxa og tage til det andet hotel.

Vi overh\u00f8rte en samtale mellem receptionisterne p\u00e5 de to hoteller og fandt herefter ud af, at hotellet havde dobbeltbooket, og at det var derfor vores v\u00e6relse ikke var ledigt...\nVores f\u00f8rste klage falder p\u00e5, at de overhovedet kunne dobbeltbooke et v\u00e6relse, som allerede var k\u00f8bt og betalt.

This is an extremely well managed hotel. This staff is one of the best we have encountered in a very long time. The rooms were actually larger and more comfortable than the HIlton Garden Inn next door. Aaron, Maria, and Grisell all stood out for various reasons. Aaron arranged our late check out with a big smile, Maria took care of our TV problem and Grisell helped us retrieve our bags later in the day after we had checked out and gave us the key to a very nice bathroom to freshen up in before our trip home.

We booked at this Hampton Inn due to the low rate and good reviews on TripAdvisor.  The location is great \u2013 by Macy\u2019s and lots of other shopping.  We found a small Asian restaurant within walking distance called Main Noodle House where we had dinner.  The checkin and checkout process was smooth.  The staff were friendly and gave us 3 bottled waters for being Hilton Honors members.  We had a room with 2 double beds.  The room was a bit small for 3 people but we made it worked.  There is no fridge or microwave.  Please note the double beds were small compared to other double beds we had in the past.  My son had 1 double bed to himself and he rolled off the bed during the night.  Definitely a tight squeeze for two people in a double bed.  Delicious complimentary hot\/cold breakfast (eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, waffles, toast, yogurt, fruit) in the morning which made for a great start to the day.  We had an issue with the safe as the last guests had it opened but in the lock position so we couldn\u2019t close it.  We phoned the front desk to report it and a maintenance person came up within 5 minutes to fix it.  The only other thing that came to mind is in the bathroom there is no towel bar to hang the hand towels.  They have a hook behind the door and near the shower but nothing else.  They can easily put another towel bar in front of the sink area to hang a towel for drying hands.  All in all enjoyed our 1 night stay at this Hampton Inn but if staying longer you might be more comfortable in larger accommodations.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Although the room is small, we do not have any issue with its size and cleanliness. We booked our trip through Priceline and prepaid for the hotel. However, when we checked out, the staff also charged us again. We were busy to catch our flight therefore we decided to contact the hotel after our trip and it has been a very bad experience ever since. I have talked to Ashley (manager), Hector (supervisor), Yonsi, Aaron for at least 7 times but the matter has not resolved. They can see on the system on the double charges but each time I called they would give me a different explanation such as the Priceline master card didn't go through. Really??? Or they will refund right away but I didn't see refund or confirmation email.. It is very sad but they didn't follow with their commitment to refund us. At least three times, the staff (including Ashley) promised to call me back but I never receive any call from them. I have been a loyal Hilton member for at least 10 years. I always stay at Hilton property anytime I travel but I have never experienced anything like this. This is unacceptable! And I'm deeply disappointed about their services and commitment. This definitely WILL NOT BE THE HOTEL that I would stay when I visit New York next time. My next might be to call our credit card company and dispute this charge.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

La posizione \u00e8 ottima, fermata della metro praticamente di fronte, a un passo da Times Square.\nNon \u00e8 un hotel di lusso ovviamente, ma le camere sono pulite, ordinate e hanno tutto ci\u00f2 che pu\u00f2 servire per un soggiorno di qualche giorno. Nemmeno troppo piccole, noi siamo in 4.\nI letti comodi, la biancheria pulita e di qualit\u00e0.\nLa colazione inclusa nel prezzo \u00e8 buona, niente di sorprendente ma accontenta sia gli amanti del dolce che del salato (solite scrambled eggs, omelettes, bacon, ecc). Carina la macchinetta per prepararsi i waffels sul momento, molto apprezzata dalle mie figlie adolescenti.\nUnico \"problema\", che noi per\u00f2 essendo mattinieri non abbiamo avuto, pu\u00f2 essere l'affollamento della sala colazioni dopo le 9, in quanto la sala \u00e8 piccina e da quanto ho visto arrivando troppo tardi si rischia la coda. Noi abbiamo sempre fatto colazione tra le 7.30 e le 8.00 e non abbiamo mai avuto problemi, anzi era semivuota.\n\nUnico neo per quanto riguarda la stanza era la sua collocazione. Piano basso, mi pare 2\u00b0 o 3\u00b0 e affaccio su un micro cortiletto, vista muri, e soprattutto con i motori dell'aria condizionata sotto. Conseguenza: un costante ronzio derivante dai motori. Ci si abitua...noi dopo un p\u00f2 non lo sentivamo pi\u00f9, per\u00f2 se qualcuno avesse problemi di insonnia o semplicemente una particolare sensibilit\u00e0 ai rumori, beh, suggerisco di chiedere una sistemazione ad un piano pi\u00f9 alto (non \u00e8 un grattacielo comunque, mi pare abbia 12 piani in tutto) o quantomeno con affaccio sulla strada.\nPoi NY \u00e8 rumorosissima in ogni caso, anche soggiornando al 30 piano il rumore di sirene e traffico non sparisce mai....\n\nNel complesso non la migliore sistemazione che abbia avuto a NY, ma sicuramente per il rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo pi\u00f9 che adeguata.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our room was impeccably clean and comfortable with more than enough floor space for our 2 suitcases and carry-ons, and shopping bags!\n\nThe employees at the front desk were always helpful and friendly. We mostly interracted with Emmanuel, Amanda and Hector who were all so nice, friendly and always ready to give recommendations or any advice you may need. \n\nBreakfast was so yummy every morning. Your basic continental breakfast: cereals, waffles, muffins, bagels, breads, outmeal, sausages, eggs, coffee, juice, etc etc. They switched it up day to day so you don't get bored but we never did. It was always yummy and the kitchen staff were always nice and ready to greet you.\n\nThis hotel is the perfect stay for NYC. We walked a lot and everything is within reach. Definite stay!!","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Not much street noise on the 18th floor, usual idiots slamming doors at 1am but not the hotel's fault. Smallest rooms we've stayed in NYC, the bed takes up 3\/4 of the space, 1807 looked at the building next door no view. Watch out for rooms ending in 06, vending machine right next to the door. Clean, nice flat screen TV, room safe in the closet. Breakfast was ok, egg dishes varied each day, western one day, scrambled the next. Only complain as other reviewers have mentioned the SLOW ELEVATORS. There are only 2, did I say SLOW elevators for 20 floors. At peak times you can wait 5-10 minutes then if you are unfortunate enough to be on a lower floor you can't get on because its full. One reviewer suggested staying on the 3rd floor and using the stairs. If you are into Korean food there are a couple of restaurants next door and a Vietnamese one. We went to the Playwright Irish pub twice over 4 days, a 5 minute walk down the road on 35th. A bit of a walk to Broadway shows and Times Square, ie 42nd to 50th st, 20 minutes or so. If the weather is nice be prepared for huge crowds in Times Square.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-04-29","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"We stayed here for one night when our flight was cancelled.  We had stayed in a sister hotel (Hilton garden Inn) next door for a week prior to this, but there were no rooms availability for an 8th night, so we moved here instead.   The welcome at Reception was fine.  The Room decor was nice.  But it didn't feel clean.  The bathroom floor had dirty marks on it, the shelves & tissue box were dusty & there were also hairs (from the last guests?) on the shelves.  We were tired after the cancelled flight & hadn't the energy to complain.  I washed my hair & plugged in my brand new hair dryer, there was a buzzing sound - like electricity - I plugged it out & looked at the socket - it was filthy!   This may have been the cause of the buzzing, I tried another socket but my new dryer no longer worked.   I called down to reception to inform them.  They (in fairness) were quick to send a technician who told me only to use the socket in the bathroom & he got my dryer working again, he was a nice man.  Later that night my husband and I got into the lift from the lobby to our room & a guy joined us in the lift, we immediately felt unsafe.  He didn't press a button, but got out on our floor and walked behind us, my husband turned to face him & he changed direction & got back into the lift.  Unlike the hilton garden inn, there is no room card needed to operate the lifts, so it's less secure in this hotel and this experience made us aware of that! \nThe next morning we went for the breakfast I had read so much about.  The atmosphere & quality of food was like a soup kitchen.  Paper plates, dried up bread & a disgusting thing described as an omelet - see pics - simply revolting.  The orange juice was not even from concentrate, it was a juice drink, full of sugar.   I asked the staff member servicing the restaurant a question and she was very unfriendly & completely disinterested.   I remember reading a number of reviews complementing the restaurant staff & they were all very positive, but I also remember noting, that the ones that did, were mostly completed by 'new reviewers' with just 1-2 reviews to their name\/profile, which is often a sign that they are not authentic and by the staff members themselves.  Of course I can't be sure of this, but it makes sense, from my experience.  The fruit was the only eatable item - so that what the extent of my breakfast.  So overall, I will never stay here again & would not recommend it to anyone.  The worst hotel ive ever stayed in in New York.  Yes the location is fantastic but there are a number of hotels on that street with the same location - stay there instead, the Hilton Garden Inn was much nicer!

Location is excellent.  Steps from the 34th St\/Herald Square subway station.  Can be hectic at the breakfast station as several larger tour groups were based from this hotel during our stay.  Our floor was quiet, but didn't have those groups on it.  Heard that it was noisy in floors with tour groups. Will absolutely stay here again.  Super, super location.

They even managed to put my friend in the room next to ours even though he booked separately and arrived later. Some airlines can't even do that! \nThe breakfast buffet rotated the hot food which was great so you didn't get the same hot food every day. The fact it's included in the room rate too makes it a great deal! \nThe only issue I think for us some nights was street noise because we were on the 2nd floor. Not a hotel problem just a general issue I guess being right in the centre of New York. \nWe scored a diamond tho as we got a huge room with two beds in it, which we didn't really need but good for space. \nDidn't use the gym facilities but they looked great and Hotel was always clean and tidy.\nHousekeeping were great and prompt with towels.\nOverall I couldn't score down anywhere with the hotel we were happy with what we got\nThanks guys!","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"NONE"}

The room was adequate enough and we where very pleased with it we had a very large double bed which was really \ncomfortable, some people may think the rooms are small but  you're  in New York and you won't be in your room for long. There is a subway station only a minute walk away that takes you into Times Square or another about 5 mins away that takes you to the South Ferry terminal for the helicopter port or world trade centre etc. You can walk into Times Square it takes about 10-15 mins the Empire State building is just up the road and turn right about 5 mins away.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":1158763,"title":"Great location, better than satisfactory stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-04-12","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We stayed at the Hampton Inn for a fortnight over the Christmas period. It was not without it's faults but the overall stay was good within the limitations of the hotel. First of all, the location is wonderful and makes up for a great deal. We came in (and departed) from JFK via the Airtrain and the Long Island Rail Road so we needed to have a hotel near to Penn Station. The Hampton Inn was ideal in this respect as well as having a subway entrance within steps of the entrance.\nOther advantages of the location were that we were across the road form Macy's and 34th St Shopping as well as being a short walk form 5th Ave. In terms of proximity to the sites you can't do much better. In fact, we could see the Empire State Building from our window.\nBreakfast is another highlight and the staff on breakfast (along with those on the front desk) are very friendly and accommodating. There is some variety with breakfast but after 14 days we'd had enough! Even so, it was a great way to begin the day.\nthe room itself was nothing to write home about. The heating and cooling system was a bit on the primitive side. Twice our toilet blocked but, to be fair, maintenance staff arrived within minutes of the blockage being reported.\nRoom service otherwise was a mixed bag. We were only given the right number of towels once in our stay but a phone call to the front desk fixed the problem. If things like this stress you out my advice is not to stay but if you can roll with the punches and want to stay in the heart of NYC you could do a lot worse at more expensive prices. Nor should you underestimate the value of breakfast included as eating out is not cheap.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}
