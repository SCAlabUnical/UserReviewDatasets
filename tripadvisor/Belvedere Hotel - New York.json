Very helpful doorman who arranged a cab for 5 at $135, considering it cost $87 for a yellow cab from the airport including additional charges so we had to get 2 cabs. \n\nSome negatives\nRooms dated, poor lighting (no ceiling light in main bed area, only a bad very yellow lamp), no facilities to make a hot drink, only from reception area & only from 7am-10am, very little a way of sockets to plug chargers in so it was a bit of a juggle.

The room I stayed in was spacious. As you enter the tiled foyer, [the rest of the room is carpeted]  on one side is a kitchenette with a microwave and a refrigerator along with a sink. There is no coffee or tea service nor any water provided. Opposite this is a nice sized closet which contains adequate room to hang coats. The safe and hairdryer are also located here along with an ironing board and an iron. A luggage rack is below this. There was a nice king sized bed and there are windows on two sides of the room. There are blackout curtains on one window but they do not close all the way. The shades on the window provide the blackout but they really need to be replaced. The edges were all frayed. The other window had the wooden type venetian blinds. The room was very clean. The bathroom was a nice size with a tub and shower but there were no decals on the floor of the tub to prevent a fall or any grab bars to hold on to while showering. This bathroom may have been recently renovated since the tile design looked fairly modern and I have seen it in other hotels. The water pressure was good and the water was hot. The towels provided were adequate but have seen better days and are small for the average person. There is a wide screen TV and a nice desk area with a comfortable chair but there are no extra outlets of any kind, USB or otherwise. This made working difficult. The bed was very comfortable but I was looking for an extra blanket and there was none in the closet. There was an extra pillow there. I could not find any way to adjust the temperature in the room. It was comfortable enough so I didn't bother to inquire. The lobby of the hotel is large, the concierge on one side and the check in area on the other. There is a business center in the lobby with two computer screens and a printer. I don't know if there was a charge for using it. In the morning from 7-10a, there is a coffee service in the lobby which provides only coffee and hot chocolate and you are entitled to one granola type bar. There is no hot or cold food available. There is also no restaurant on the premises but there are many in the area which do take out. The back of the hotel connects to a Brazilian steakhouse but this is a separate entity and not associated with the hotel. The elevators in the hotel are small, accommodating 4 people, less with large luggage items. My advise is if you would like to stay here, book directly with the hotel and not thru a third party. There is also a facility fee which is $20\/day plus state and city tax daily. In summary, it was a nice stay in a convenient location and I would recommend and return.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Sadly these photos are not a true reflection of the accommodation we arrived to and I would advise anybody else to avoid this hotel. We were travelling for my friend's 60th birthday and when we were checking in the lady on reception was very abrupt so this was the first disappointment. When we got to the room, we were so upset to see it's condition. Holes in the wooden furniture, dated bathroom, single glazed window that seemed to be stuck open, no proper air conditioning, old electrics, dirty curtains and carpet. It was minus 7 in temperature in NYC and there were only sheets on the bed and no duvets. The heating unit was attached to the window with tape and located behind the curtain! Health and safety nightmare! Thankfully I had stayed in NYC before so I found the Westin on booking.com and checked us in there and we swiftly checked out. The male on reception when we checked out didnt offer us any other room so I imagine this is what the condition is of all of them now. We are out of pocket and this caused undue stress on a special trip but once we got to the other hotel we were just relieved. I advise anyone who may have booked this hotel on a package to find alternative hotels before you go.

When we came back around 4 PM (check in time) we put the bags in the room and went out again. Then upon our return the room temp was approximately 85 degrees with NO thermostat. So we called the front desk and a mechanical\/maintenance person arrived. She opened the vents and turned down a steam valve and said that might fix it. It did not, so I had to turn the valve all the way closed and since the valve seat was bad we still got heat. So I had to turn on the window air conditioner, for the entire stay. Then the shower would run warm, to freezing cold and then to scalding hot. The coffee machines were taken our of the rooms when Covid hit in 2019 and there was a 'coffee station' that sometimes actually worked! The coffee was not good. The bell hops\/door openers did not open doors for us after we did not tip them to open the doors, it was not a problem as I have been opening doors for a long time. The front desk staff is not friendly and upon arrival we were told there was a $21.xx a day \"Facility Fee\" for the internet, GYM and the Coffee machine.

The staff was so responsive and polite and responded to all requests quickly and professionally. The hotel is next door to a sweet little Mexican restaurant with $5 margaritas all day and was a great way to end long days of walking around NYC.

The staff were so rude and didn't care less.  I get it, the hotel is in prime position close to everything, they do not have to make ANY effort.  We were booked in for a 5 night stay but our flight was cancelled and we missed our first night.  I phoned the hotel and told them we were not going to get there until a day later.  They said fine and would hold the reservation for us from the day we arrive.  What I didn't realise was that we were also being charged for the night we were not there, that is over $500.  (I am trying to get this refunded but the hotel does not care). When we arrived the next day, we were keen to make up for lost time and keen to get out.  But it took us 2 hours to leave the room because the safe was not working and wouldn't close AND the actual door to the room would not lock so we couldn't go anywhere! The reception staff were really rude and dismissive and really wanted to be elsewhere.  The maintenance person then fixed both issues and we were able to get out.\nConcierge were next level rude.  Does the hotel pay them a wage?  I'm guessing they do, so what is the minimum they need to do for their work?  The minimum would be opening a door right?  No.  If you are rude you don't get a tip so if you don't tip the rudeness is escalated by 100.  Upon departure we had a few hours before our train departed so I asked where we could leave our bags.  The concierge didn't speak he just pointed to himself.  I asked again and got the same gesture 2 more times.  I gave up and asked reception who said the hotel will store our bags for free etc etc.  When we went to collect the bags the concierge asked if we needed a taxi, (we didn't) and he dumped our bags outside the storage area and we struggled through the front doors to take them to the side walk.  A hotel guest actually helped us with the doors while concierge rude man just stood by.  Unbelievable.  The hotel offers a free coffee service in the lobby which is a circus, not what I would pass for coffee.  It's just a machine that you press a button for hot dark liquid, it's not a \"service\".  The one star I give is for the location and the ability to open a window.  We were on the 17th floor.  The building is old, but well kept, our room was clean and newish.

Lobby nice, booked through a third party (for the first time) and the review I will give is less than stellar.  We read a lot of reviews and many stated the rooms were dated.  We would have been fine with dated as this location was close to everything we needed.  We had two rooms both in same condition on the 16th floor. It wasn\u2019t until day three of our stay we discovered there were actually clean rooms.  Our room was filthy!   We didn\u2019t have any heat and the air conditioner in the room was so moldy it could have made us ill by the end of our stay (if we would have used it). The window would open all the way which would have made it dangerous for children.  We called about heat and the engineer that came to our room late at night was shocked at what he found (with the mold, filth and lack of a heater) and said he would have management contact us and send up a room heater.  None of this happened!!  We spoke to a manager about the stay and filth of our room and Georgia (customer NO service) stated \u201cwe should have said something\u201d. I said \u201cwe did!\u201d  She took $100 \u201cresort fee\u201d off of one of our rooms and told us to take it up with the company we booked through as this is all she could do!  So we did just that and VIO reported that when they contacted the hotel, it was reported that the \u201ccustomer was already compensated\u201d.  Wait what?  I don\u2019t think that is appropriate.  Georgia said we requested a \u201cstandard room\u201d!  To which I replied \u201cis standard filthy\u201d? ?????  Needless to say there are nicer rooms and apparently if you book third party and you get a disgusting room, you have to complain to get something better.  How about you just don\u2019t use those rooms until you upgrade?  I wrote Georgia a letter and filed a complaint with my credit card company so we shall see.  It has been 4 weeks and I haven\u2019t heard from Georgia which is not surprising based on my experience with her while on property.  Great location but terrible customer service and beware of filthy rooms!  The picture of the room on the website is no where close to the quality of room we received.  Beware!  I am a Marriott\/IHG brand person and took a chance on a Boutique hotel and was disgusted to say the least. Oh and Georgia said if I would have said something earlier then they would have moved us as the hotel wasn\u2019t full.  Wait so you couldn\u2019t automatically put people in better rooms?  We had to complain?  While we are traveling?  We chose to travel for 8 hours and plan to stay at your hotel and you literally don\u2019t care and give us a garbage room hoping we don\u2019t complain?   Idiotic!  There is so much more I could add but if you are there now or are going in the future and you get a nasty room then say something!  We didn\u2019t even have the room attendants come in and clean everyday because, based on current conditions, we didn\u2019t want additional filth coming to our room.

It was so run down and lacked so many basic amenities: Nowhere to plug in a USB, no blackout shades, there was a beat-up old desk that looked like it was taken from the Goodwill reject pile, a closet with one of those awkward doors that made it so you couldn't really easily access things in the closet without navigating around the door, full-length mirror was in the bathroom so it fogged up after a shower and you couldn't really use it when getting dressed, a tiny bathroom counter and nowhere to put your toiletries, beds that felt kind of soft and thin, and awful pillows. They thankfully upgraded us to a superior room which is the same layout but way better appointed including:  a bathroom counter, USB plugs, a full-length mirror in the room, a better closet, better beds, and a black-out curtain.

Steep price for what should standardly be included in the nightly rate: Wi-Fi, fitness center (which we didn\u2019t use), coffee in the lobby for a few hours, and other services most people won\u2019t use (local phone calls, receiving mail\/packages). For two rooms, two nights this was an added $90. For internet, essentially.\n\nWhen we booked it was noted that checkout was at 12noon, however when we checked in they told us it was an 11a checkout (must have recently changed as 12noon was crossed off in pen and rewritten as 11a on the paper with the room key). When checking in they said we could request a 12 noon checkout the morning we were leaving- however when we called at 7am the morning of checkout, Matt at the front desk asked us to email him our reservation info showing proof of a 12 noon checkout, and then told us it was \u201chotel policy\u201d that only one of our rooms could check out at noon (but if we booked the two rooms on separate reservations, it wouldn\u2019t have been an issue). Not something you want to deal with at 7am when you\u2019re previously told it should be no problem. \n\nThe water temperature in the shower was either ice cold or scorching hot, with no in between- we had to avoid the water while lathering up and then splash the water on ourselves to rinse off to avoid burning our skin. \n\nPluses:\nGreat location, and convenient having a mini fridge and microwave in the room.\n\nWe won\u2019t be staying here again.

Hotel staff was very resistant to allowing them to check in without putting their credit card down for the room incidentals, even when I called them directly to give them my card as both the individual who held the reservation and was accountable for all charges.  Check-ins ultimately went fine, the room was a decent size but desperately in need of an update.  The pillows were among the worst I've slept on in the last several years and it feels like this has been surpassed in quality by basically every mid-budget chain out there.  They now charge a \"resort fee\" in addition to your room rate but added on in the small print - perhaps they could use a bit of the resort fee to replace a few pillows.  Checkout presented another issue - did not have time to stop at the front desk on checkout, and called to give them the card for the resort fee.  We were told that there was no way to change it to a different card than had been presented on check-in despite talking to multiple people.  Either they truly don't care, or they have absolutely no delegation of authority to anyone working to managing customer care, or their systems are trapped in the 1990's with the room quality.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel is very tired and in need of a major upgrade. At check-in yesterday evening we struck the rudest woman I think we have ever come across. It forced me to become very short with her, which I must say I was disappointed in but it had been a huge day of travel at that point. A welcoming persona is needed, no matter what. The room has plenty of space but was dingy. We were fortunate to have a nice city view. However, there is no soundproofing, so you hear every horn, siren and idiot on the street, and we were on the 9th floor. We could also hear the TV next door, hence earplugs are essential at the Belvedere. They probably should supply them as standard! There are two main lifts but only one was working. Just hopeless to get a lift down. Others have alerted to this mess. There is a third lift at the end of each floor. We had a bit more luck there, still, had to take the stairs down several times. The AC units are noisey, as many have said. Again, the earplugs are needed. At the moment, there is an air drying machine blasting the hallway outside our door. The smell out there is like vomit. Something must have gone on but the noise is horrific. It is only about 5pm, heres hoping it wont be all night. Others have said the hotel would struggle to meet its 3 star rating. From someone who has travelled the world, stayed in many 3 star hotels and submitted hundreds of reviews, it is not a 3 star hotel, two at best. The big positive is the location. It is close to Times Square and subway stations, plus walking distance to many shops and attractions. For the cost, you could do much better. Look elsewhere.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Once we paid for the booking there was an additional clause that stayed a 30 minute time slot for us to be waiting outside for, if we were late each additional 30 minutes would be charged at $25. Luckily we got through passport control quickly and our luggage came through promptly, so we were within the time allocated.

Two full sized beds felt incredibly small.\n\nAfter the first night complained to front desk about the various issues, and the receptionist was actually quite attentive which was much appreciated. Within 15 minutes, engineering came up and fixed the safe, fixed the sink. Housekeeping immediately came by with an array of softer nicer pillows. These efforts made for a better stay.

The only available water was from a vending machine in the lobby that did not accept credit cards so bills were required.

So you're two blocks from Times Square which is awesome, and yet far enough away that it's quiet at night.  Hell's Kitchen is a great neighborhood, and the Mexican restaurant next door is awesome.  I'm giving it four stars for two reasons: The parking garage is quite a bit away from the hotel. As I drove in, it was a little inconvenient to have to leave to park the car and then Uber back. It's a little too far to walk when you're carrying bags, or not 100% familiar where you're at.  And then the other reason is just that the rooms are pretty small. I know that it's listed as being 350 ft\u00b2 which sounds like a good size, but when I compare it to something like the Warwick--feel the room is small in comparison. There is a little bit of dead space that encompasses where the sink and refrigerator are; at other hotels. Those are built into the actual room space, so the room and bathrooms are bigger as a result.  But the staff with the exception of one person was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. I would consider coming here again but maybe with a smaller group or alone--two double beds can be challenging to accommodate a group of three to four.

The drapes in our room wouldn't close so we phoned the desk.  Someone from Engineering came up and couldn't figure out why the curtain wouldn't move on the rail.  We said it was unacceptable and asked for a new room, so he said he'd talk to his manager.  Forty minutes later, still with no response I went down to the desk.  There was one person working who said she was the manager and it was with her, but she was busy.  I complained that we were trying to go for dinner and had already missed our reservation so she said to go and they'd get us a new room while we were gone.  When we got back they had a room for us and we moved at 10 PM at night.  By then we were exhausted and went straight to bed, and at that time I discovered a large hairball in the bed.  I was too tired to complain and swept it out onto the floor and went to sleep.\n\nThe room was small and badly appointed.  There's no coffee maker or clock, and the HVAC is so loud that my ears were ringing when I got up every morning.  The beds have a very thin blanket between two sheets (no bedspread), and the pillows are rock hard solid foam.  There's no room service, even though it's attached to a restaurant.  This place is basically a Motel 6 with a doorman. \n\nThe elevators in this hotel are a total joke.  They're too slow and small for the size of the building.  If you're heading out during the busy period of 9-10 AM you may wait 2-3 minutes for an elevator only to find that it's completely full and you have to call another one.  We were on the 10th floor (out of 16) and it was difficult to even get on.  On more than one occasion I saw people getting on at lower floors going up, willing to ride all the way to the top and all the way back down just to get on.  One of those people was a bellman who said he had to do it regularly.  When I asked him why he didn't use the service elevator at the other end of the floor, he said it was for housekeeping and maintenance only and he wasn't allowed to use it. \n\nThey advertise package drop-off on their website.  My wife had 3 things shipped to the hotel.  For two of those, it took more than one person looking, and almost 10 minutes or searching just to find the package.  If you're actually going to advertise that you provide that service, you should at least be competent at it.  They aren't, and clearly have no filing or record system.  On those two occasions that they couldn't find the package their automatic response was \"are you sure it got delivered\".  One time an older Indian gentleman was working the desk and couldn't find the package so he asked my wife who delivered it.  She said USPS, then had to explain to him that it meant \"US Postal Service\".  Seriously???  \n\nI couldn't decide on 1 or 2 stars, but gave them 2.  The showers were hot and had good pressure, and the location is excellent with no external noise 10 stories up (not that you'd hear it over the air conditioning). We stayed here because it was cheaper than it's competitors, but you get what you pay for.  I wouldn't stay here again, especially while Covid 19 is still lingering as you have to spend far too much time crammed into elevators for it to be safe.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

(As a side bar, it seems this is how they always operate as the lobby was full the next night around the same time, same situation). I was worried since housekeeping was so behind that the room wouldn\u2019t feel clean, but it did. The bathroom felt a little cramped but I\u2019ve seen worse. The outlets on the night stand barely held the chargers in, but at least the bed was pretty comfortable. You need a phd to figure out the shower, good luck. It\u2019s also slippery, which is scary for someone who is expecting. Going to echo everyone else in that the elevators are absolutely awful in that they\u2019re super slow, or not working at all (not to mention cramped). This was extremely frustrating, I was somewhat grateful we were on the 3rd floor only for this reason. One thing to note is that there was no street noise where we were, which was nice. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t recommend staying here. I think the staff were sort of rude - but understandable if they\u2019re constantly facing angry customers due to poor management. I would avoid it.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel staff could not be friendlier or more helpful especially the doormen who are always there to open the door or help with your bags. The hotel supplies a tea and coffee service each morning and treats you to a complimentary muesli bar which was a surprise.

We had all attended the same elementary school. I knew about the hotel from having stayed there years before\nWith my sister, so I booked the hotel for all of us. It was clean, staff was responsive and pleasant. The hotel was bustling with guests. I did not eat at the hotel restaurant so I cannot comment on it. It was near the Broadway plays we wanted to see on 45th street in Midtown Manhattan. We could walk. And we took yellow cabs to other places at low costs. Room prices were reasonable. Each of us paid about $360 total with tax for 3 nights. That\u2019s about $120 per night for 1 person. We had 3 people in one of our rooms and the hotel was able to fit a rollaway bed in the room with two double beds. Hotel was quiet and the perfect place to stay, except for no handrails in the bath tub. We requested rubber mats for the tub floor and they were sent up immediately. Rooms were cleaned by housekeeping each day and each room had a microwave oven and refrigerator. I will definitely stay there again.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We hear a noise and realize it is not coming from outside, but from the hallway, a barely audible fire alarm.  We run out of our room, forgetting our keys and head down the stairs.  An announcement is being shared, but you cannot hear the content in the stairwell while running down them.  In the lobby no one tells you what is going on and the fire department shows up, then leaves and everyone starts to go back inside. No sorry for the inconvenience, nothing from the staff.  We asked for a key and cautiously went back up on the elevator, not the main elevator since those were not working, but a side one, that no one would confirm was safe to ride after the incident.\n\nWe would have left right away, however by the time we got a key and were back in our room we would have missed the last train out of the city.

We spent the weekend in NYC as part of my daughter\u2019s 16th birthday gift with tickets to see Wicked. Our group included 4 Mom\u2019s with their daughters. Upon arrival on Friday Jacob at check-in was wonderful and made us feel very welcome. The bellman that helped us with our luggage was great (wish I knew his name) and took the time to explain where a 24 convenience store was located as well as a 24 pharmacy if needed. He also told us if we needed anything to press 0 for concierge, which we did for extra pillows and towels. We received them within 10 minutes of request. Room was spacious and quiet with a beautiful view. Beds were comfortable. Breakfast was OK and typical of continental breakfast. Saturday morning we were headed to the Gershwin theater and the same bellman gave us exact directions to the theater which was greatly appreciated!\nUpon checkout on Sunday (Jacob was on duty again) we were able to leave our luggage with bell services. The bellman there was wonderful as well (again wish I knew his name as well). He asked about what time we would be back and where we would need to go and he made notations so he could help with a cab when we returned.\nAfter lunch and some shopping we returned to the hotel for our bags. While were waiting In line to be helped (busy at check out time) we had a delightful chat with the concierge about how wonderful Wicked had been and we chatted about some other musicals we would like to see in the future. Before bell services retrieved our bags he had the door man arrange a cab and had it waiting before we even had our luggage.\nFrom beginning to end the staff was wonderful at this hotel. We are talking about planning another trip and we have already recommended this hotel to friends for the comfort, service, and proximity to everything NYC has to offer!!!","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Booked this hotel so we could guarantee they would have a double bed each.  We were given rooms 613 and the boys 605.  We had to ask to move room as 613 was next to elevator and although you couldn\u2019t hear the actual elevator going up and down, guests rolling luggage in and out, banging their luggage, talking loudly whilst waiting for the elevator led to a very disruptive nights sleep.  We moved to 603 which was so much better. The boys had no problems in their room at all.\n\nAnother reason we booked was because of the very positive trip advisor reviews. However, there are no tea and coffee facilities in the room now nor are there any USB charging points. Both of these were quite disappointing. After travelling around New York feeling quite tired it is nice to go back to the hotel and to be able to make yourself a beverage of some sort. However there was no water heating facilities in the room and therefore we could not even use our own tea and coffee. As the room has a kitchenette with microwave and fridge, I would have thought it almost inevitable that a kettle would have been provided. \n\nWe were surprised to find that a Breakfast (muffins croissants Danish cereals porridge) with coffee and tea cold drinks was available from 7 am till 10 am and they really do ask you to leave at 10 am even if you have not finished your breakfast.\n\nThe staff at the hotel were all extremely helpful and polite. The Doormen always saying good morning to you, reception staff very kind and changed the room with no problem at all and really understanding. The rooms were always cleaned well, with any used toiletry items replaced each day.\n\nThe location of this hotel is just perfect you are just far enough away from Times Square not to hear too much noise, the occasional fire engine was all we heard, but we were at the back of the hotel.\n\nThe room itself was comfortable although not really sure what made it an executive room apart from a bath robe there was nothing else that  I could see that made it an executive room it was pretty standard to me. It would have been much better if the USB charging points and tea and coffee making facilities had been provided. Or at least have somewhere in the hotel you can get coffee during the day.\n\nI would suggest that the bed mattress in room 603 be replaced as it was rather saggy and our backs were starting to ache by the end of our week, and the base cover had collapsed which we only noticed when packing and checked under the bed to make sure we had not left anything behind.\n\nAs it was a bit chilly we did ask for an extra blanket for the bed which was provided by housekeeping very quickly.\n\nOverall a perfectly suitable hotel in an excellent location.  Very friendly staff. \n\nWe were able to check our luggage into storage for our final day and the staff arranged a car to pick us up which they said was the same price as a yellow taxi would have been. This was unexpected and very useful as it was a lovely large car to take us to the airport.\n\nWe would like to thank the Belvidere hotel for our stay in New York City.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The first room we were booked into was freezing cold, the curtains dirty and even torn in places and the bed skirt and lounge chair both badly stained.  Both the double beds had deep dips in the middle and looked quite worn.  We demanded to be moved and were met by a very repugnant staffer, who informed us \"that's what you booked, that's what you get\" and \"No-one has informed me of any problems with the room\", to which we replied that we were now.  \"Someone\", who we now realise was a member of the Housekeeping Team knocked on our door and said \"they are moving you\", before walking off.  The Manager later accused us of refusing to let her in the room--WHEN in fact, A\/  She didn't introduce herself B\/  No request was made to inspect the room  C\/  We had no clue who she was.  The hairdryer looked as though the filter had never been cleaned, the air vent in the bathroom was filthy, there was hair on the pillows before we'd even got into bed.  The desk was terribly scratched and marked.  One of the blinds was stuck closed and couldn't be raised throughout our entire stay.  There were NO AMENITIES in the room, not even a single teaspoon!  No coffee maker, let alone a kettle, which you will find at other properties throughout Manhattan.  There are doormen at the property, however, most could be seen leaning against a pillar in the foyer.  A few homeless people regularly sleep adjacent to the hotel, on the Times Square side of the property, which made us cautious of walking by with young children after dark.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

I think there has been mention in other posts about how slow the Elevators are. Yes, at times when it is busy, they are a bit slow. They are not huge, so only so many people can go up or down at a time. Did not bother us. The place is clean, rooms are decent sized, decor is a little art deco and a little updated.\nWe did not get a chance to try the breakfast, and although I wanted to try to get back in time for a happy hour glass of wine, that never seemed to work either. But I imagine they both are nice.\nStaff was friendly, our flight arrived early, and by the time we made it to the hotel we were a few hours before check in time. But, our room was ready and we were able to check in early, which was great.\nLocation is great. Times Square, Theatres, Subway stops, shopping and restaurants are all within walking distance, yet you are just far enough away from all the noise and hustle and bustle that it is almost quiet as you walk down W 48th to the hotel. \nOur only complaint, and the reason I did not give 5 stars, the pillows on the bed. You have to fix the pillows. I have stayed in many hotels in lots of price ranges and I don't know how or why, but your pillows were not good. Maybe we have ruined it for ourselves, we have the Casper pillows at home, and have had them for about 6 months now (no I do not work for them) So if you do not get other complaints about the pillows, then it must be just us, and ignore my complaint.\nOther than that, we enjoyed our stay and should we come back to New York for another visit I imagine we would book with you again.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Times Square is only 1 block away & a 10min walk up to Rockefeller tree area too. 15min walk to Central Park & the piers are on the Hudson River side, at the end of 48th, where all the cruise ships come in.

We were told we could go down to the cafe from 7-10am for complimentary coffee, but we often stay out late and sleep in so weren't up in time every day. We also enjoy tea and coffee in the evening and had to find a starbucks that was still open and spend $10 there if we wanted coffee or tea. Even side of the road motels have coffee makers. We could not figure out why they would just get rid of them all together.\nOur wifi also NEVER worked. Although we complained to the front desk a couple times and they tried re-booting the router, we could only get service if we went down to the lobby (the wifi seems to work better on lower floors, FYI). Because we were on a higher floor and had no wifi, our phones wouldn't work at all in the room, which was really inconvenient for everything.\nThe elevators were also consistently having issues while we were there (one just showed you were always on the 7th floor, no matter what floor you were on, and another took over five minutes to go down one floor).\nWe would have been okay with all of this if it wasn't for the daily $35 facility fee we were charged for services we didn't get or never used. Its for the wifi (didn't work), wine hour in the evening (don't drink), half price off breakfast (our breakfast was included in the price of the room) and the gym (didn't use). We essentially paid an extra $35 a day for nothing. On an already huge hotel bill.\nThe location is amazing if you like theatre, the rooms are large and clean and the beds are comfortable, but we were so disappointed in the hotel \"amenities\" and the charge for them, when we decided to extend our stay by a day, we went to a different hotel for our last night and enjoyed elevators that worked, an in-room coffee maker, wifi that worked, a free (hot) breakfast, and only a $5 facility fee.\nWe were so sad to think our once favorite place (we stayed there four times this year alone and this was the first time we had any of these issues) may now be somewhere we don't return to. \nBelvedere, if you are reading this, please consider reimbursing guests who don't or can't use the amenities the facility fee, and please bring back coffee makers in room for guests.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I was worried about this but my husband and I had a king room and it was not tiny!  There was plenty of room on each side of the bed for bedside tables.  There was a decent amount of room to walk around the bed\/TV stand, desk and window.  The bathroom wasn't right on top of the sleeping area which made it feel even bigger.  The bathroom was modern and a decent size.  Good water pressure in the shower.  The whole room was clean.  There was a separate area near the door with a coffee maker (Keurig with pods), microwave, a small refrigerator and sink.  Perfect!  The closet was a great size for two.  Mini safe in the closet.  We used the room service at 9:30pm one night to get dinner from the Italian restaurant next door.  It came quickly, was hot and had good food.  We did not use the hotel's breakfast deal.  We had a room on the 15th floor which gave a great view, but getting down the elevator was sometimes slow because of it.  And the elevator is tiny.  Our room was at the front of the hotel so faced the street.  Yes there was street noise but where in NY ISN'T there street noise?  I wore ear plugs and slept like a baby.  One complaint:  we needed to use the AC (it was warm while we were there 12\/8-11) and it is loud.  Quite loud. But we didn't spend a ton of time there so it wasn't a huge deal.  Staying in the summer and having to use it all the time would be a different story.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, as was the concierge.  Room cleaners did a great job.

We arrived early and our room wasn\u2019t ready; however, bell services happily stored our luggage. At the front desk, we asked for food recommendations and the front desk rep ( I think his name was Mike) was super knowledgeable on multiple options. After a few hours of playing tourist, we decided to check back with the hotel and to our surprise our room was ready. We had a deluxe king and this room was fantastic! A wet bar, fridge, microwave greeted us when we entered the room. The space was large with plenty of USB ports all over. A bench, desk, spacious closet, full size bathroom, and robes! Bell services brought our luggage to us within a matter of minutes (I don\u2019t remember the gentleman\u2019s name) but he took the time to point out all of the amenities in the room (this also includes a hair dryer, safe, iron) and was super welcoming.

Jacob is such a nice person and always greeted us with a pleasant disposition. \nThe hotel does offer a discounted continental breakfast in their lounge (we chose not to do this), we found a gem around the corner (Times Square Diner).

We notified the front desk and they moved us to a smaller room. We had paid for a larger size room since there were 3 of us. When we went to talk to the night manager, her could not have been ruder. He denied that the hotel had bugs and insisted that the room was the same size. He made no apology, and eventually said that \"sometimes, some hotels have bugs.\" He offered nothing to us and accused us of lying about the bugs (even when we had photos of them clearly all over the bathroom). Because it was after 11:00pm, we accepted the smaller room and just moved to it. The day manager 2 days later was super nice, but I would definitely never stay here again based on the awful customer service we received from the night manager. That, and the bugs....","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Also, be aware or taxes and \u2018facility fees\u2019, these are not included in you\u2019re original quote and are added at the end, adding another $130 to the stay. \nThe staff seem a little bit moody and aren\u2019t the cheeriest rays of sunshine.

The bellmen were very helpful and professional and the rooms were clean and well presented. Because of its location in a built up area amongst other tall buildings means the views aren't incredible as far as NYC goes, but pretty decent in the 16th floor room that we received after requesting a room with a view. Breakfast was decent enough considering it was free as part of our package. Honestly though, if we had to pay $20 each then I'd definitely have sought somewhere out in the city for breakfast each morning.\nThe hotel doesn't have a pool or its own bar, which is the only real let-down in my opinion.\nThe location is fine. Far enough from times Square to be quiet, but close enough to be accessible by a 5 min walk. Also there are numerous subway stations near by so getting around the city is easy.\nWe would highly recommend going on a sightseeing tour and getting an attraction pass. If you use \"city sightseeing\/grayline tours\" thier office is literally a 1 min walk from the hotel so super convenient. \nAll-in-all a lovely hotel.

When we checked in, the total she had quoted was exactly what we were charged. No unanticipated fees. Our room was perfect for our needs. The beds are medium-firm. The microwave and little refrigerator enabled us to buy a few groceries and avoid a few expensive meals out.  We walked to Central Park, Carnegie Hall, High Line, Empire State Building and shopping on 5th Ave. Subway stations are only a couple of blocks away for more distant destinations. My only surprise was that the concierge didn't seem to know about discounted theater tickets. She was very willing to call theaters and book us for shows at full price. But that is all she does.

There are many restaurants and bars close by along the avenues, as well as stores to grab a quick bite and beverages.

The attractions of this hotel were its location, star rating v price, room size and options in terms of in-room amenities. Arriving at around 3 pm we were allowed to check in an hour early, and as we had booked the hotel in January when the \"Facility Fee\" was $20 per day (plus tax) we were given that rate to pay at the desk rather than the current $30 (plus tax). This facility fee I presume is a form of resort tax but regardless every hotel appear to charge it in NY and it comes with different features. Those at the Belvedere are captured on the image attached but in brief include wi-fi (Which tbh was quite weak) leading to my having to revert to 4g roaming at some points), 50% discounted continental buffet breakfast i.e $9.99 v $19.99 which we took up the option of on the last morning but regretted as the offering was quite poor\/limited and the breakfast room was very old fashioned feel and depressing feel (no natural light) and a short walk away near Times Square in  Sbarro Resturant you can get a much better-cooked buffet breakfast for only $11.99, access to a fitness centre (not used) and free local calls\/concierge and small discounts on local tours. A unique aspect was a free daily wine hour. Again we didn't take up this option but it seemed very popular amongst the mainly older hotel clientele. Though the facility fee price hike didn't apply to us it did seem a bit steep, but it was unclear if this was a seasonal rate etc. The room we had we had upgraded to an Executive Room King Bed in advance of arrival for a small extra charge as this guaranteed an in-room fridge and city view which we saw as a major plus in addition to the generous (for NY) room size, microwave, Tea\/Coffee maker. The room included a well-appointed bathroom with complimentary toiletries, in-room safe, iron and ironing board as well as dressing gowns. The bed was very comfortable and every day the room was tided and bed remade without issue whilst we were out. The lifts\/elevators were dark and slow but it wasn't a deal-breaker. The reception and concierge staff appeared friendly and approachable and on our day of departure we were able to leave our luggage in a safe room for no charge. Located in a fabulous location (a reasonable 15 min walk to the city cruise pier and 5-10 mins walk from Broadway\/Times Square with access to the metro system) and not too tall in term of floors in all I have no reservation in recommending this hotel and would not hesitate to re-book here, as we felt safe and secure in the heart of midtown.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When I return, many of the desk staff recognizes me and greets me by name (that really feels good).  I love the location and the fact that I can walk to many of the theaters, Hell\u2019s Kitchen restaurants, Times Square, etc, although it is very far from my daughter\u2019s college (NYU), my primary reason for visiting.  The office staff will often upgrade me without me even asking.  Wifi is spotty and the slow, slow elevators are a down side. But honestly, I mostly love everything but the price.  Although the cost always seems lower (at Hotels.com), it always comes out much higher than I planed.  In addition, I have noticed that the price keeps creeping up from one reservation to the next.  While I understand some of it, I discovered another hotel, that is rated about as high as the Belvedere, with the same amenities, but the rooms are almost $80 a night cheaper.  I was amazed at the price difference. I canceled my two upcoming reservations in lieu of staying with them, which made me sad.  I will continue to look for deals at the Belvedere, and would love if some reward for frequent guests such as myself were instituted.  As I said in my title, I love this hotel but since I travel to NYC at least 4-6 times a year to visit my daughter (from San Francisco), the $80 a night savings is too good to ignore.  I hope the Belvedere considers my suggestion of rewarding loyal customers.  Thank you.  Bob Abaya","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We had booked this stay via Hotwire, and were aware that we would be getting an unrenovated double double room.  The 4 star rating is a combo of 3 stars for the accommodations and 5 stars for location.  \n\nThe room was fine - obviously needing some updating (I believe the hotel is planning on completing renovations to all rooms eventually).  The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was small and cramped but functional and the AC unit was loud.  The small fridge and microwave were useful, as we bought some staples from the corner store down the street and Food Emporium a block away, which cut down some dining costs.\n\nThere is a $30\/day facility fee (which we knew about) which covers free wifi, daily wine hour from 5-6pm , discount on the continental breakfast and discount on some tourist tours.  The wifi was unreliable and kept cutting out.  The wine night was fine - a glass of wine and a few blocks of cheese.  Not worth it for $30\/night, especially considering that most of the other hotels in the area do not charge such a fee. \n\nThe location can't be beat.  About a 3-5 min walk to Times Square, 10 min walk to Central Park\/The Met, and 7-10 min walk to Rockefeller Center.  Metro station (50th St.) is about a 5 min walk away, so very easy to get to further places (like 9\/11 Tribute) by metro.

Appena arrivati alla sera (21:00) abbiamo effettuato il check-in in pochi minuti e ci hanno spiegato tutti i comfort dell'hotel lasciandoci anche un biglietto come promemoria. La camera era al 9 piano e devo dire che anche se era piccola era comoda e ben disposta. Non abbiamo usufruito della colazione in hotel, con solo 10$ a testa, perch\u00e9 abbiamo trovato un supermarket \"the food emporium\" vicinissimo all hotel e molto comodo per fare colazione, internazionale e non, e una piccola spesa prima di iniziare a visitare NYC. L'albergo \u00e8 molto curato e pulito. Personale accogliente. Dispone di phon e cassetta di sicurezza. Inoltre al suo interno c'\u00e8 anche la cassetta dove poter inviare le cartoline. L'unica pecca di questo hotel \u00e8 stato l'ultimo giorno, quando effettuato il check-out, abbiamo dovuto lasciare le valigie in una stanza in reception e abbiamo dovuto dare una mancia di 10$ per due valigie. C'\u00e8 anche il servizio \"taxi\" che ti porta all'aeroporto, mi raccomando procuratevi soldi in contanti perch\u00e9 con il bancomat o carta ti aggiungono una tassa di quasi 10$ in pi\u00f9 al costo del viaggio totale che noi purtroppo abbiamo pagato. Inoltre l'agenzia dove abbiamo prenotato questo hotel ci ha detto che in loco ogni giorno dovevamo pagare, oltre gi\u00e0 al pagamento della camera, anche una tassa ti 35$ che alla fine prendono tramite la carta di credito quando fai il check-out.

Don't be put off by the scaffolding in front of what appears to be a beautiful old building!  We were told that it's an ongoing project, but there was no work being actively done while we were there, at least that we heard or saw)   Check in was busy as we arrived about 15 minutes before the stated time of 4:00 pm, but Mike W. was great and cordially welcomed us!  We drove in from Boston and chose to \"self park\".  Jose the doorman gave us directions to the discounted parking garage, and after we unloaded, two of the adults went to park the car - over one street on the next block so a short walk back.  We were assigned connecting rooms (as requested) on the 9th Floor right across from the elevators.  I was a little concerned when we first saw that, but the rooms are in an area of the hotel that \"juts\" out just a little and enough to give us a long corridor as you enter the room to keep the bedroom area away from the noise of the hallway\/elevator - and it did!  Very quite rooms, overlooking W48th Street and one of the rooms had a \"side\" window where we could see the signs in Times Square two blocks away!  The main focus of our trip was the theater and we were a short 10 minute walk up 8th Ave to the Gershwin Theater.  This hotel is very convenient to not only the Theater district, but Times Square and many other attractions in the area ( Rockefeller Center, Trump Tower, Grand Central and Penn Stations) - all within reasonable walking distance.  We walked up to Central Park from the hotel - it's a bit of a \"hike\" but fun!  We could hear sirens occasionally, but keeping the AC fan on constantly drowned out most of the traffic noise at night.  The system is a little loud, but worked as \"white noise\" for us so it was okay!  We did not participate in the nightly \"happy hour\" or use the gym, so it's hard to accept the extra $30 facility fee and tax that is automatically added to each room, but we were aware of it ahead of time, so not surprised.  It would be nice if they could use a key code for the gym and people who actually want to use it could and other's not be charged for something they don't want or need.  Overall, our stay was great - the staff friendly and our room service was as expected.  We would definitely stay here again and recommend for families traveling as the price was more affordable than most hotels in that area.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The welcome was great - a door person opened the door and there was no wait at check-in.  The gentleman at check-in was so personable and nice.  \nThey charge $23 per night for 'special' charges, which includes your internet, access to a very small fitness club and a wine and cheese hour from 5-6 p.m..  This was pretty pricey for what was offered.  There is a continental breakfast for $6.99 per person that includes breads and pastries, yogurt, beverages and spreads.  This is one of the better deals for breakfast in the area (as long as you're okay without anything warm).\nThere are three elevators. If the line-up for the two in the main lobby is too long, there is a small elevator at the end of the hall to your right.  Never a line-up.\nThe rooms are a good size for New York, with sufficient light and larger bathrooms that have granite tubs and backsplashes.  The carpets are brown which give a dark\/dingey feel to the room.  The televisions are the smallest I've seen in a hotel room, which is okay as you're never really in your room to watch tv.\nThe beds have to be the most uncomfortable, old, noisy, and riddled with lumps that I've ever slept in.  Reminds me of a college futon! If we weren't exhausted from walking all-day, it is very likely we wouldn't have slept a wink.  Thank goodness for being exhausted from enjoying the city.  Both beds in the room felt the same, so I suspect it's standard for the hotel.\nThere is air conditioning and heat in each room, and while the fan sounds like an airplane taking off, it provides some comfort in the room.\nWe had the wine and cheese one evening and it is literally, wine and blocks of cheddar and mozzarella cheese.  Not a cracker to be seen to help wash down the mediocre wines.  We tried it one evening and there was a red and white offered - both being too dry.\nOverall, the location is very good and almost balances out the deficiencies we experienced.  You may want to reserve the right to test your beds before you commit to a room.  If you intend to enjoy full days in New York and will be exhausted when you return, all will be okay.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It also had a separate sink outside bathroom and microwave which would be great if you wanted to reheat food or drinks.\nBeds were lovely and comfortable and shower had plenty of hot water morning and night.  There was plenty of storage also.  Air conditioning unit fan was very noisy but ok when switched to auto.  \nThe reception staff were lovely and helpful and check in and out was very efficient.  Sometimes there was a bit of a wait for lifts, particularly for those on lower floors.\nNow the negative. Breakfast in the cafe was poor and the decor in there very dated.  It looked like an old function room with horrible red velvet curtains and bar.  They also ran out of plates and cutlery one morning and the following morning the cafe was completely closed.  \nThere is a $20 daily facility tax which you have to pay on departure for things like WiFi, the fitness centre etc, regardless of whether you use them or not.\nOverall, the Belvedere is a pretty decent hotel and I would recommend as a base.  If you want trendy and modern, then this is not for you as it is more traditional.

I\u2019d town and certainly good access to subway. \n\nStyle:  this is a budget hotel. It\u2019s full of families and travellers looking for a good deal in expensive NYC. The rooms are adequate. Beds reasonably comfortable. Bathrooms nice. Shower head is excellent. We had a king \u2018suite\u2019 - essentially slightly bigger than a regular hotel room. Our room smelled badly of sewer.

Overall it\u2019s clean and in a great location, close to all amenities, tourist attractions and several metro lines. We were put in a \u2018recently refurbished\u2019 room which was much nicer than we had expected. We loved having the fridge, microwave and coffee machine which gives you the freedom to have a hotel chill night if you\u2019re tired from constant activities. The onsite restaurant and bar is excellent; the room service from the local Route 66 diner was great; the included breakfast less impressive with no plates and very little choice left when we went down halfway through service but that\u2019s not a deal breaker, it\u2019s New York, you can get breakfast anywhere and in fairness if we\u2019d been on a tighter budget we could\u2019ve at least had a bagel at the hotel! The downside was the heating and bedding; a scratchy waffle sheet between two thin sheets which was uncomfortable and an air conditioning unit that sounded like a jet engine and had a blast of artic air surrounding it, even when it was off. The result was that one side of the room was constantly freezing cold and the other too too hot if we put the heat on to try and negate that which isn\u2019t conducive to a decent night\u2019s sleep and is disastrous for your skin. In defence of the hotel, we didn\u2019t bring this up with them, not least because we figured it\u2019s probably the same in all the rooms so we didn\u2019t actually give them a chance to correct it.

There was no thermostat I could find in the room, just a window A\/C unit, but there were air vents in the hallways blowing warm air. They also very helpfully sent up a space heater which we didn't use but it was a nice gesture. The WI-FI is kind of crappy. There is a busy fire station at the corner of 8th & W. 48th. We were woken up several times by the sirens. Breakfast is so-so, bagels & muffins, cereal some fruit and of course coffee & juice. It's included (allegedly) so I suppose you get what you pay for.\n\nI was all set to give a good review until the day of my check out. We walked down to the cafe for breakfast just as we had been doing all week but this time an attendant asked to see my room key. I asked why, and he said something to the effect of \"it's busy and we have to make sure other people don't come in.\" I showed him my key and then he asked if I had a voucher. I said no, we have been getting breakfast here all week and no one had asked for a voucher or a room key until now. He told me I'd need to check with the front desk, so I walked over to it and had a rude encounter with the woman behind it. I told her I needed a breakfast voucher and gave her my room number. She answered that it would be $10. I told her that no, breakfast is included as it clearly states in their Travelocity listing (as of today at least - I have a screen shot). She told me that it was not included and said I could speak to her manager - a classic dodge for service personnel who don't give a s**t and just want to be rid of you. I didn't feel like arguing or speaking to the manager so I just left. It made me angry though that she treated me like some kind of lying freeloader to be gotten rid of rather than a paying guest.\n\nI would have given them 3 stars since the Belvedere is comfortable and convenient despite its shortcomings and considering the price I didn't have high expectations. It's about what you'd expect for what you pay, being one of the less expensive hotels in the area. But I have to take away a star for the inexcusable way I was treated when simply trying to get a cup of their below average coffee and one of their tasteless factory-made muffins before checking out.

I thought the location was just perfect for me.  A short walking distance of Broadway and Times Square and to be honest if you don't mind walking and the weather is okay (as it was for my stay) you can walk just about all over NYC from this location.  There is also a subway right around the corner from the hotel and a Budget rental car facility a 2 minute walk around the corner in W 49th Street. 9th Avenue with it's many great restaurants is also just a 2 minute walk away.  The room I had (#1102) was on a corner and had views in two directions.  My room was comfortable, clean enough and was well equipped for what I needed.  The internet worked fine about 99% of the time and the shower, refrigerator, heating, TV and lighting were also all good.  There was a safety deposit box in the room but I didn't use it and also a clothes iron.  Staff at the door and front desk were all friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was included in my room rate but I never ate at the hotel, either grabbing something out or giving breakfast a miss in place of a NY brunch.  My 4 night stay with all the taxes; (State Tax, City Tax, NYC Occupancy Tax, NYS Hotel Unit Fee, State Tax Other, City Tax Other and a New Facility Fee, of $30?!), cost US$982 which despite my actual room rate varying from US$125 to US$269 during my stay gave me an 'average' rate of US$245.50 per night, which isn't too bad for NYC.  I would recommend this hotel, mainly for its location and comfort of the room.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The Belvedere had decent reviews and seemed affordable. I will say that there were some solid things: it's in a great location off of Broadway and Times Square, close to several theatres and restaurants. There is a wine happy hour from 5pm to 6pm (though the wine is mouth puckering sweet). Though we didn't use them, they did have facilities on site like restaurants and a gym. The staff were kind, too.\n\nFor the not so great: the first is the facility fee. Perhaps this is a standard in New York, but it seems affordable comparably until the $20 facility fee is tacked on. It raised the price quite significantly. In addition, the elevator situation is HORRIBLE. I believe there are elevators on either end, but no one used them. The two you see central in the lobby are what everyone uses, and to get up or down from our room was a ridiculous nightmare. The morning we departed, we left our room at exactly 9:00am. We didn't get to the lobby until 9:11am. Spend 11 minutes in an elevator, especially small one. It's not fun. One elevator clearly wasn't working. There needs to be signs directing people to other elevators, especially for a narrow, tall building where elevator are basically your only option.\n\nIn addition, the rooms look nice, but the edges are rough. The commons areas could use a clean. We also were on the street, and even 10 floors up, it was loud. The windows were flimsy and leaky. We stuck a pillow in the window to stop a fairly bad draft.\n\nIn total, this is probably a 3 1\/2 star, but for the area and the other hotel options, they need to raise their game a little. I would probably find another option in the area, but for a short stay, this will probably work.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I suppose I waited to the last minute and was stuck with what was available.

The following day I went downstairs to pay for an upgrade given we were there for another week, the very kind staff upgraded us free of charge. The room we were upgraded to was significantly better, roomy with nicer furniture, a more comfortable bed and a much larger bathroom, this is why I am giving it 4 stars, the standard room was more 2.5\/5. The hotel is in a great location if you want to do the touristy things, it is very close to Time Square, a short walk to the Rockefeller Centre and only a 15-20min walk to Central Park with many subway stops close by; as this was my partners first time in NYC she wanted to do \u2018everything\u2019 so the location worked well. The staff are very friendly and there is a happy hour of free wine every night from 5pm-6pm, this is a great offer but if you love wine these wines probably won\u2019t appeal to you. One lift appeared to be broken when we were there as only one worked which made things a little slow. Overall this hotel gets 4 stars based on the deluxe room and the location, it is well priced but you may find better nearby.  ","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The bagels and bread had mold on them. We ended up leaving and still having to pay. When I told the front desk at check out, they advised that their baked goods get delivered fresh everyday.

The bellhop stored our bags and we set out to find lunch based on the suggestions from Frank at the front desk.  He was very nice and gave us a few different options on which way to go.  Each staff member we encountered was polite and helpful. \n\nOnce we were able to check into the room, we found an updated, very clean and tastefully decorated room.  It was bigger than expected (the last time I was in NYC, our room was tiny!).  There was a small \"kitchenette\" area with a microwave, Keuring Coffee maker, sink and small fridge.  There was large closet with plenty of hangers, robes and a safe.  The bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was small, but the shower was a large walk-in (not a tub, which I liked) that appeared to recently updated.  The head was in the ceiling, rain water style, which I did not like. There was no pressure and I had to use the hand held nozzle to wet and rinse my hair.  \n\nThere is a facility fee of $20.00+ tax per day to cover the WiFi, wine social hour and some other amenities.  I did not feel this fee was out of line.  I wish we would have been around during the social hour to enjoy some wine.  \n\nThe location is great, just a few minutes to Times Square and walking distance to many attractions.

Zum einen aufgrund des noch g\u00fcnstigen Preises im Vergleich zu anderen Hotels und nat\u00fcrlich der unglaublich guten Lage zum Times Square.\n\nBei Ankunft mit unserem Shuttle vom Flughafen Newark wurden wir vom Portier sofort in Empfang genommen, die T\u00fcren aufgehalten und die Koffer abgenommen. Hier hatte ich anderes erwartet, aufgrund einiger Bewertungen, aber bei uns war alles prima.\nDie Dame an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich, man blockte 300 Dollar auf der Kreditkarte als Sicherheit und wollte pro Tag eine Resortfee von ca 20 $ erheben. Da ich dies schon gelesen hatte, mich bei meinem Veranstalter FTI auch erkundigt hatte, wusste ich, dass diese Resortfee ( und damit auch das WLAN) bereits im Reisepreis enthalten ist. Dies teilte ich der Dame mit und damit war das Thema auch schon erledigt. Also aufgepasst und vorher nachgefragt,  ich denke viele werden sich \u00fcberrumpeln lassen ;-)\n\nDas Zimmer war sehr nett, gut nat\u00fcrlich in die Jahre gekommen, aber sauber und praktisch. Die Fenster lie\u00dfen sich etwas \u00f6ffnen, so dass man auch mal frische Luft bekam. Da wir in der ersten Nacht gefroren haben, haben wir am n\u00e4chsten Morgen um Decken gebeten, die wir auch prompt bekamen. Gleichzeitig bot man uns an, dass ein Hausmeister nach der Heizung schaut. Als wir abends ins Hotel zur\u00fcckkehrten, war uns Zimmer gem\u00fctlich warm.\n\nWir haben nur am ersten Morgen im Hotel gefr\u00fchst\u00fcckt, es war ausreichend, aber keine Offenbarung. Wir haben festgestellt, dass egal wo man letztendlich fr\u00fchst\u00fcckt - es ist nicht einfach unter 20 Dollar pro Person auszukommen. New York ist einfach nun mal extrem teuer. \n\nDas Belvedere Hotel w\u00fcrden wir jederzeit wieder buchen, die Lage ist einfach super und das Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis wirklich in Ordnung.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}
{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93569,"title":"A Perfect Boutique Hotel ","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-11-30","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"My recent stay at the Belvedere Hotel started off pitch perfect when a solicitous, well dressed hotel manager pleasantly greeted me, reviewed my existing reservation and then somewhat surprisingly, offered me an upgrade to a larger and much better suited hotel room! Within seconds after appropriately thanking him, I was inside a well preserved landmark antique hotel elevator being transported to my newly assigned room, which was located on a top floor of this architecturally vintage boutique hotel. Upon opening the hotel room door and laid out in front of me, was a smartly and tastefully designed, standard sized NYC hotel room along with a window view! Just past the entrance way, I noticed a modern kitchenette that included, a set of cabinets, a built in under counter stainless steel refrigerator, a dark granite counter top, a small round stainless steel sink with matching faucet, a fairly decent coffee maker and a working microwave. In addition, I noticed cutlery, stemware, plates and napkins for a small intimate gathering of possibly three persons as well as a few kitchen-must essentials such as a cork screw, a large ice bucket, a medium sized serving bowl and a large serving tray all in stainless steel! Walking through to the bedroom area I pass a large two door hall closet with a long hanging rack, open drawer shelves, iron, ironing board, wall safe and two white cotton signature hotel bathrobes. Standing now in  front of a king sized bed, which looks extremely comfortable, well made, most inviting and overall, it definitely is large enough for two persons! I then look at the separate pristine bathroom off the bedroom that is perfectly designed yet a little small in overall size.  My week long stay went very well and I must  mention that this hotel serves a terrifically bountiful daily buffet breakfast with enough food selections to please all patrons so this \u201cwow factor\u201d  is definitely worth making the effort to get up for!  In addition, please note that kids will very much enjoy all the breakfast selections, especially the waffles and pancakes! \n\nIn summation: this hotel establishment is supremely run, offers very good accommodations and is located in close proximity to all Broadway theaters. The entire staff at this hotel all worked most assiduously to accommodate me as well as all of its guests which is why I certainly will be booking a new reservation here sometime soon. The only drawback  the facility fee charge (50% of the total room charge), however, I would not necessarily hold it against them as there are so many other NYC hotels that I like as well that charge a daily facility fee. Therefore, as a a caveat to all when booking a room at any NYC hotel please be on the lookout for this sometimes \u201chidden\u201d charge. I do highly recommend staying at this hotel especially because the entire staff treated me with such enormous respect, which is exactly the way I, as well as all other hotel patrons, like to be spoken to. Special mention to the entire management team for accommodating my requests  while I stayed at the very lovely, hospitable, civilized and memorable,  Belvedere hotel. Jeff M. \n\nP.s. For those readers wondering\u2026there is no relation, whatsoever, between the \u201cBelvedere\u201d hotel in NYC and the best selling \u201cBelvedere\u201d Polish rye vodka that is produced and distributed by LVMH! \n\nFootnote: The author of this review has been living without an apartment since early February 2018 and therefore felt that having a small kitchenette in a hotel room where he was staying was probably the most welcomed addition he could ever possibly ask for! \ud83c\udf83\n","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was so impressed with the place at the time that I wrote my very first TripAdvisor review about it. Twelve years, and 230+ reviews, later I went back to the Big Apple and stayed here again. I was equally happy this time round. I ended that first review with the line \u201cI wouldn\u2019t stay anywhere else\u201d but nostalgia ain\u2019t what it used to be. So when we decided to go to New York earlier this year the first thing I did was look around to see which hotel offered the best value. Surprise, surprise although I was open to staying anywhere in the Midtown area the Belvedere Hotel offered the best value for us. The location is wonderful just off 8th Avenue so quieter than hotels nearer to Times Square. We always felt safe here too. It is at the edge of Hell\u2019s Kitchen so all the wonderful restaurants on 9th Avenue are easily accessible. Check in was a breeze and, as we had booked before the introduction of their new \u2018resort fee\u2019, we didn\u2019t have to pay it:-) A credit card is needed as a guarantee but that\u2019s not unusual. We had breakfast in a local diner the first morning but opted to eat in the hotel every other day as it was better value, and more importantly, offered a great choice of fruit, cereals, pastries, juices etc etc The continental breakfast was $13.95 and the full breakfast was $19.95. Our room was spotlessly clean with crisp bed linen, well appointed and spacious. We also had a little kitchenette with a microwave, fridge and coffee machine. The weather was cool during our time in NYC so we didn\u2019t need to use to A.C. but we turned it on one day and, as other reviewers have said, it is very, very loud. I personally would not have been able to sleep with the noise but it wasn\u2019t an issue for us at the end of October. We never had to wait more than a few minutes for the elevator, there are four of them on each floor. All staff we met were efficient and friendly, especially the receptionist who checked us in, Noel gave us a really warm welcome. There is a wine hour in the lobby every evening of the week which is a nice gesture and a welcome one too after a day\u2019s walking and sightseeing. It is a pity that there isn\u2019t a bar onsite as it would be nice to be able to have a nightcap. We loved our time in the Belvedere and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good-value, safe, clean base in the heart of Midtown.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

He gave me 1126.  Which is 4 feet from an elevator.  Right at the end of a narrow hallway with close packed door entrances abutting the elevator.\nThe floors are thin and so are the doors\/walls, so I heard people thumping by constantly, and the elevator doors slamming.  Ridiculous.  \nTried to address it with the front desk... nada.  \nThen, adding to the fun, manager Shonda and the Ops Director Justin were rude and dismissive, when I spoke to them the next day.  \n- Justin said he knew about the issue (a day earlier).  I asked him, \"Uh, so what did you do abut it?\"  He explained that he hadn't yet seen the people involved, so nothing.\n- Shonda reported that she spoke to Frank who recalled my request.  And then she stopped, like she'd done all that was required.  And I said, \"OK, what about the issue, the whole reason we're talking.\"  She didn't get it.  So I clarified: \"do you think it's weird that I asked for a room not by an elevator and the front desk specialist put me right by an elevator?\"  She said, \"You weren't by an elevator.\"  I asked her to clarify.  She said, \"well, you weren't RIGHT next to the elevator.\"\n?  \n- Justin chimed in with more misinformation and semantic games, saying Shonda was technically correct that I wasn't \"directly\" by an elevator.  \nIt was all a bit surreal. \nGuys, helpful hint: wouldn't it have been easier to just put me someplace that's not by an elevator, when I made the request at check-in?  \nThere was more silliness, and I won't get into all of it.  Quick example: I didn't even use the hotel room... I slept at a friend's place that night, to avoid the noise!  The beds were untouched.  Didn't use wifi or the gym or any other feature... but they were sure to tack on a $22 resort fee for all those services I didn't use.

I phoned hotel prior to my stay to confirm we would be in one of the updated rooms (reservation was for \"executive\" rooms) and learned there was one higher level -- \"superior.\" So I upgraded our rooms at $10 per night, also very reasonable. Also requested that we have rooms located near to each other. When we checked in we were assigned rooms directly across the hall from each other and the rooms themselves were very clean and comparable in size to almost all NYC hotel rooms. Nice \"kitchenette\" area with refrigerator, kuerig, and microwave. We brought regular cups and extra coffee pods so were able to make extra morning coffee. Two mornings we ate breakfast buffet which was exceptionally good and also a reasonable price, with children under 12 half-price -- so a bargain for us. All hotel staff were friendly and helpful. This is an older boutique-style hotel that reminded me of stays in Europe. Would have liked two chairs in room, instead of one, but would have been tight. Walkable to all we planned, even Penn Station. Will stay again when we visit NY. We got great value for our stay all-around.

However, our experience this time was that the bathroom was very small with no counter space to place your toiletries etc. We had to store our toiletries in our suitcases or in the closet, it was a nuisance to carry things back and forth.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":93569,"title":"Good Location","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-10-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We have just returned from our NYC trip and the location of this hotel is very good as it's central to many of the tourist sites.   First off the room is a good size and VERY clean!  The kingsize bed was perfect after days of walking and walking and walking, so comfortable you fall asleep almost the moment your head hits the pillow!  Our room had a door that would enable it to be a double room if you were to come with kids, but wanted space or a little privacy.  However, that door is not very sound proof, as we could almost always hear our neighbours as they would come in late and loud every night.  The bathroom was pretty big, although I don't understand why there wasn't much space to store your belongings, no shelf, and no ledge on the tub either.  Considering that people are staying for a few days or longer, they do need some sort of area to put their lotions\/shampoo\/hairbrushes etc etc.  There is plenty of room to put a shelf above the toilet to safely store these.  Other than that, the bathroom was perfect.  We had a city view with a big window that we left open at night to hear the sounds of the city and to let in a natural breeze but the AC system was good and strong if needed.\nWe only did the hotel breakfast buffet once , it was ok, but honestly I personally don't eat enough to get my $$$ worth out of buffets.  For those interested we ate breakfast next door ( on the left as you leave the hotel ) and it was a nice place ( I will review it separately, this is just an FYI ).\nThe front desk people were friendly and helpful and so were most of the bellhops.  There was an incident with one over a misunderstanding on our part, he was rude and slammed the door practically shutting my husband's foot  in the door, but other than that, they were nice enough to answer questions and give directions etc.  One other thing though, the elevators are slow, small and very busy during the mornings.  Keep this is mind and maybe ask for a room on the lower levels so that you could take the stairs if you're the type who doesn't like to wait.\nFor those that plan on spending a lot of their vacation in the uptown area or to hang out at Times Square in the evening, it's a great location, only two blocks from the heart of TS, but you don't get the noise of it, if this makes sense.  This is our third visit to the city and are thinking that next time  we might try a different location to stay, and that would be the ONLY reason we wouldn't come back to this hotel.  We ate at a few restaurants that are very close by and in general loved the area.  Personally speaking, TS is just too busy\/crowded\/loud\/crazy and I much preferred the neighbourhoods of Tribeca or the Village as you could walk on the sidewalks and not feel claustrophobic.  That has nothing to do with the hotel, just putting it out there. If you're worried that you booked and won't like this place, you can rest easy, you'll be happy to stay here.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

What a fantastic first impression he made.  Our room was everything we needed, clean, comfortable, spacious and quiet!  After a day of sightseeing and Broadway, we fell into bed exhausted each night.  Yes, the air conditioner makes some noise but it didn't bother us at all, and with the NYC heat that week, we were very glad it worked so well!!\n\nEvery single staff member we encountered was pleasant and downright friendly -full of smiles and helpful tips. The location was perfect. 8th Avenue is busy with lots of shops and restaurants, and quick access to subway stations. The craziness of Times Square was only a block or two away.\n\n The only negatives are the hot (really hot) elevators.  An upgraded fan system in the tiny elevators would be very welcome.  By using both the main elevators as well as the ones at the end of the hallways, we never had to wait long for a ride!\n\n I would not hesitate to recommend Belvedere to friends and family and will definitely stay there again for my next NYC visit.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It was a good size for New York standards with nice decor and a decent view of the city.  The bathroom was nice but really small, larger guests may find it very tight.

There were three of us in this standard room with two double beds. We reserved through Expedia about 45 days in advance and got a rate of $240 per night not including taxes. The actual rate after all of the taxes was about $288 per night. Compared to the base rate of the surrounding hotels this was a deal. We selected the pay the hotel later option. Upon arrival they charge your card $300 for incidental expenses like running a tab from the food services. The charge is later reversed if you don\u2019t rack up any meal charges etc. The staff was very nice from the doorman, to the desk clerk, to the housekeeping staff.  When my kids saw lobby and the elevators they thought of the Disney attraction Hollywood Tower of Terror not in a bad sense but in the sense it evoked old Hollywood style and elegance. The lobby and entrance were clean. The two elevators visible in the lobby were small and slow unlike the rapid fire elevators of the Marriott Marquis where we stayed last year. There are two other elevators down the halls to the right and left of the main ones. Use those they are less crowded. We got an odd numbered room on the sixth floor. The reason why I mention that is the odd numbered rooms have a view to the rear of the property which is no real view if you are on the(I\u2019m guessing ) 10th floor or below. So even numbered rooms might have better views. On the first floor is a buffet and an expensive Brazilian restaurant neither of which we took advantage of. Our room was comfortable. Good Airconditioning and heating. Beds were comfy. TV was about 42 inches ?  There was a desk and chair, and good storage space. Included a refrigerator and microwave in a separate area. The bathroom was a bit small but adequate. Water pressure and heat was decent. Overall a nice room for the price. \nIt is located between Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Times Square on 48th Street which is a one way street towards Times Square. It is smack in the middle of he Theater District. Most of the Theaters are a 5-10 min walk from the hotel. We also took a long walk to Central Park from here, and to Rockefeller Center, MOMA, and Grand Central Station. We had to use Uber to the southern part of the city. Hell\u2019s Kitchen which is west of the Hotel has a variety of restaurants you may enjoy. By the way it\u2019s quicker to walk north south than east to west in NYC. You can go two blocks north south in the same time it takes to go one block east to west or west to east!","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Not being a couple and requesting same or previous room to last time we booked seperate beds ! When Checking in, I was made to feel that I booked the incorrect room and that the system was right! They did not have any other rooms that we booked available so we had to check in to the king, check out the following morning and recheck in to the correct room type in the afternoon. This wasn\u2019t a good start! We were offered breakfast on the house for the duration for our stay as well as free wifi the length of our eight night stay! The next morning we ventured to breakfast to find  we were not on the list for free breakfast and once again felt like we had to prove we were correct. Our wifi stopped after a few days, then our room keys were cancelled.. when requesting a kettle we were told we couldn\u2019t have one as it\u2019s not available to our room type but were given paper cups and plastic cutlery in compensation. We had a microwave with no cups, glasses or cutlery. Overall,it was unpleasant dealing with most of the staff par select few. It\u2019s a shame as our previous experience was so positive and it\u2019s in a great location! It obviously makes a difference in who you deal with.

After leaving our bags we did the short walk to Times Square, grabbed a late lunch, and got lost in the excitement of the city.  \n\nWhen we finally made it back to the Belvedere, our room was ready and waiting, and we felt like we had done something special to get such a room.  A spacious king on the 15th floor with views both south and to the west (we could see the Hudson River!).  Small fridge, microwave and wet bar, and a beautiful bathroom done in a chocolate colored marble tile.  Best of all, the room AC kicked out a very nice temp for us during our entire stay, something I was worried about due to some of the TripAdvisor reviews and the fact that were from Florida and need our AC! \n\nI would definitely stay here again, especially since the location is so close to Times Square, Broadway\/theatre district, and all the restaurants on 9th Ave and on W 46th.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I love the hotel!  The location is outstanding if you are in New York to see Broadway shows.  The front desk and bell staff are always professional.  The rooms are quiet and comfortable.  I like having a kitchenette for coffee and snacks.  HOWEVER, I recently booked a stay for October and was very unhappy with the changes they have made to the reservation process.  There is now a \"required\" facility fee.  Ugh.  Who are they kidding?  Everyone hates those.  Just tell us what the room is going to cost.  \"Facility\/resort fees\" fool no one.  When I booked the \"non-refundable, 30 day advance purchase\" rate something called \"Roomerflex Protection\" offered \"insurance\" at $121.58.  I did not want it.  Never the less, when I booked the room the charge showed up instantly on my credit card bill.  When I emailed the company to protest the charge this was their response, \"As a one-time gesture, we have removed your Roomerflex Protection. I have escalated this to our finance team so they may be able to refund you back. Please allow a few banking days for it to reflect in your account.\"  Why can't I opt out of it when booking a room?  I'm very disappointed that the Belvedere would put their guests through this nonsense.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Check in was very easy, we had a room on the 4th floor which was spacious and clean. It was great having a free safe in the room to use which took the stress out of leaving documents and cash around. Beds were made up every day and towels were changed daily, including weekends which was a bonus when there are 4 people in a room! The beds were super comfy, we all agreed that we had our best sleeps here! The air conditioning unit was a bit noisy but I always wear ear plugs so it wasn't an issue for me sleeping. Once you leave the hotel its literally a 2 minute walk to Times Square, its a great base to have if you want to take in the sights of New York but then escape from the hustle and bustle after a long day out.  The restaurant next door does lovely food but you do have to book if you want to eat here on an evening. There is a tube station a five minute walk away with a 24 hour manned booth so you can actually speak to someone about tickets rather than work out the machines. You can get a direct train to the World Trade Centre from here, it cost us $22 for a family of 4 return. We also used the train to get to Coney Island, again it was only $23 return for all 4 of us. You can walk to practically everywhere from the Belvedere, Central Park, Empire State Building and all of the theatre district is close by. We had Wifi in the room which all four of us used (a real bonus for the kids) with only a few minor connection problems now and then. Having a fridge and a microwave was also a bonus, we filled ours with drinks to keep us cool in the heat wave! Check out was quick and easy. Staff were all polite and helpful.

The rooms don\u2019t have central air only a window unit which seemed to have trouble keeping the room cool even in 70 degree weather.

There were even many usb charging outlets for all four of us. Also, what a nice laundry room in the basement-never a wait and very clean with plentiful machines.   \n\nSome things to consider. The room has FULL size beds, not queens.   Being used to sleeping at home in a King size bed, it was tight. I would still stay again though as I couldn\u2019t find many other hotels in this price range with positive reviews. There is a table between the two beds. There is no table on other side of bed so I kept placing my phone and glasses on the floor. There was plenty of room for a bedside table...so it would be great if they would add one. \n\nOf biggest concern though was the lack of hooks or places to hang towels. There is no hook on wall or bathroom door. With four of us and the intent to conserve daily washing of towels that made it tough.  To take your clothes into the bathroom to shower, there is no surface or hook to place them. \n\nAlso, each day we were given new soaps even though the previous one had only been barely used.

Also we were charged $600 on arrival for 2 rooms we'd booked. This was taken from our bank account and held on to as a retainer. We felt this was un-necessary and a bit naughty as it wasn't explained in any of the booking proceedure and by the staff at check-in hence leaving us a little short on spending money. It also took nearly a week for it to be reimbursed when we got home.\nFound scaffolding all round front of hotel which gave it a look of a building site but nothing seems to be being done as we never saw any workmen.\nAll in all we thought it was a little expensive for this type of hotel, maybe it is due to its location.\nAnd overall we enjoyed our stay but would probably stay a little further downtown next time where we found it a bit quieter and a little cheaper. \nIf you want hussle and bussle of Broadway and Times Square which is literally just round the corner, this is ideal.

I have two double beds and enough room to do my daily yoga practice. Also because my itinerary kept changing, I actually ended up with three reservations and the staff was able to keep me in the same room for the whole stay (I'm still here, actually). There is a decent breakfast available made in an actual kitchen. And the best part, I believe, is its location.

The hotel staff are professional, helpful and above all else, friendly. The hotel is well kept and clean with comfortable rooms to boot! If you're in a rush in the morning you can take your pick from a continental type breakfast or go for the full bacon eggs etc. This was an additional cost, but for the full breakfast at under $20 ($13 for the continental if I remember) correctly) for as much as you can eat and drink, you can't go wrong. Well cooked and hot! When you've stuffed your face you're ready to hit town! As stated above, the hotel is minutes away from Times Square. As you leave the hotel turn to your left and you can't go wrong. If, like me, you purchase a \"hop on hop off\" tourist pass, before you go (I got mine from Trailfinders in the UK) the office to redeem your pass and get your actual \"pass\" for use on the bus and getting into the attractions, is just around the corner at the end of the block as you head towards Times Square. The buses pick up near too, and really you can't go wrong because you can't miss them! This \"hop on\" ticket costs about \u00a3110 each and includes (I think) over 90 attractions. For that, and being constrained by time, I visited the following: The Empire State building, The Rock, 9\/11 memorial, Statue of Liberty Ellis Island and did a tour of Brooklyn. So well worth the money! Of course any visit to the Big Apple wouldn't be complete with visiting Central Park, which is about a 20 minute stroll away from the Belvedere. On top of our above tours we also visited the usual shopping suspects that New York has to offer. Getting to the hotel from Newark airport was easy. No messing at all. Simply leave the airport and you'll see a taxi booth where you tell the attendant where you want to go (a good idea is to have the address written down) and they'll print off your \"ticket\" with the price for you to give to the driver. This cost about $90 including tolls of $20. Getting back for our return flight home was even easier as the hotel is able to book a shared shuttle at about $48 for two. All in all the Belvedere is a great hotel in a great location. The staff are fantastic too! Would I recommend? Yes! Will I go again? Undoubtedly! ","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I cannot emphasize enough how perfect this location is - you can walk to all the touristy Times Square stuff, but you're just far enough down a side street that it's quiet. My Orbitz history earned me a VIP upgrade - I got a suite on the top floor and free wifi, as well as a discount at breakfast.\n\nI read some complaints about this place before I went and was a little nervous, but those fears were unfounded. While I did have to wait for the elevator a couple times, I didn't think those waits were bad at all, and while I did get some hallway noise, I simply popped in my earplugs (which I always carry with me when I travel) and went right to sleep.\n\nThe building's art deco look and history were absolutely sublime, and the staff is what makes this place so special - I felt welcomed and respected the whole time I was there. When I experienced a slight issue with my toilet running, the front desk staff dispatched a repair man right away, and he efficiently fixed the problem.\n\nI can't get over the gorgeous gargoyles outside my window! I have never stayed in a cooler hotel room in my life.

I've yet to be disappointed.  My main reason for going to NY is to see shows, this location couldn't be any better, right in the middle of the theater district and Hell's Kitchen.  It is far enough off the beaten path you you don't have all the mayhem of Time's Square but a short walk away.  I have always had one of the renovated rooms which are really nicely done and a good size for a NYC hotel.  The rooms come equipped with a coffee maker and microwave.  The staff at this hotel in my opinion is exemplary.  I have never encountered one person who does not try and go out of their way to help you.  On my most recent visit the remote for my television wasn't working, I called the front desk and they had someone up to my room in less than 5 minutes to solve the problem.  The hotel has a breakfast buffet where you can chose a full breakfast or continental breakfast, this is extra with most room packages and is included with others.  In the cases where it was not included with my room I still found it to be a good deal and enjoyed the food.  I just love this hotel and it will always be my first choice when travelling to NY.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Bem localizado na 48 entre 7a. e 8a. aves, ha um quarteirao da Times Square. No entanto devo esclarecer que dei muita sorte no check in. Reservei um apto standard duplo ,Como cheguei as 9:30 da manha e o check in era somente as 15:00 n\u00e3o havia apartamento standards disponiveis. Foi ent\u00e3o que o Rickie na recep\u00e7\u00e3o me ofereceu um Apto superior por mais USD 25 a diaria, incluiria o WIFI ( que \u00e9 pago ) e eu entraria imediatamente. Topei na hora. Ao entrar no quarto amamos! Nao era grande, mas estava limpissimo, bem conservado, com um corredor onde havia um armario para roupas, microondas , geladeira , um banheiro todo revestido em marmore nov\u00edssimo e uma ampla vista de Manhattan do 17o. ( ultimo ) andar. Tudo \u00f3timo ate come\u00e7armos a ouvir conversas de h\u00f3spedes nos elevadores e no lobby reclamando dos quartos! um senhor americano que estava com a esposa nos falou que seu quarto que era standard estava bem ruim. Quatro dias depois do nosso check in, chegaram uns amigos que iam se encontrar conosco e haviam reservado um apto standard. Dei a dica para eles pegarem um up grade para um apto igual ao nosso ( Executivo ), porem nao havia mais disponibilidade, so 3 dias depois. Subimos entao e entramos no quarto a eles destinado. Parecia que tinhamos ido para outro ( e bem inferior) Hotel. Quarto m\u00ednino, mal conservado, ar condicionado velho cheio de ferrugem e barulhento, banheiro pequenissimo, cheio de infiltra\u00e7\u00f5es e com o chuveiro pingando. Fiquei chocado! E acabei entendendo o que estava ouvindo de outros hospedes do Hotel. Muita diferen\u00e7a entre um quarto Executivo e o Standard. C\u00e9u e inferno. Outra coisa e isso eu j\u00e1 havia reparado, o Hotel cobra Wifi, cobra para guardar as malas e nos cobrou USD 5 para receber uma correspondencia que era um envelope com cartao de credito.

We felt the position of the hotel was ideal for us being away from the hustle & bustle of New York.  Yes there is a fire station nearby but we never found it that big a distraction.  It was genuinely nice to return on an evening and have some relative peace & calm compared to other 'premier' hotels nestled closer to the main tourist attractions.  The nearby subway stations gave easy access to the city - tip 1 Metro card can be used for up to 4 people which we didn't learn until near the end of our stay so we ended up with a card each.  We used the subway often for the longer distances up to Central Park and down to the financial district - far cheaper & quicker than using taxi's.\n\nOur room was on the 12th floor and had a view of other high rise blocks but set far enough back that it didn't feel enclosed.  The room was clean and the beds comfortable which is essential if you want to recharge after a day of walking.  Styling was a little dated  (characterful maybe) but nothing that would ruin your stay - far better than the soulless boxes you get in some modern hotels.  The room had a little kitchenette which was great for us as on a number of nights we had take out from the various restaurants nearby - Bare Burger on the nearby 46th street a definite highlight for us.  The fridge was well used for drinks & other food stuffs that were available from the nearby corner store.  The only downside was the air conditioning which was pretty noisy however as we visited in February it wasn't an issue as we simply switched it off whilst sleeping.  Only other comment that other travellers might find useful is to check what is included in the free breakfast as ours only covered the continental breakfast - the American breakfast would have been at full cost.  Same for Wi-Fi - we had Wi-Fi access included in our package (an essential to keep our 11 year old happy!!) but if you don't it is an extra you have to pay for.\n\nOverall we were very happy with the hotel hence the excellent rating.  We fully intend to return to New York again in a few years & would have absolutely no hesitation to book the Belvedere Hotel again.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Staff were great - Ricky and Jacob in particular were really friendly and helpful, so thank you to them for making our stay a pleasant one.\nThe only disappointment was the rooms - we had booked Deluxe King rooms through Expedia and they were not Deluxe. Room 1428 is lovely - it's a corner room with great views over 2 streets. Room 1426 was small and dark and had a cracked sink - the air con unit is stuck in the window - it's so dated, there's nothing deluxe about it at all. We moved to room 1612 which was only marginally better but the views were enough to make us move. You can see the Hudson river from one side and the One World Trade Centre and the New Years Eve ball from the other. The rooms have fridges and coffee machines. There are no mugs or teaspoons, but cardboard cups and stirrers provided with the coffee and whitener\/sugar. You can ask for a kettle and buy a mug whilst you're out! The corner store is great for bottled water and breakfast pastries - I can highly recommend Honey Buns! \nOverall, the Hotel was in a great location and the staff were great. The only downside was the rooms which let it down badly. The website deluxe rooms looked so wonderful, but so didn't live up to expectation.\nClose to lots of eateries on 9th Avenue (try Kahve coffee shop on 9th) and close enough to Times Square and Broadway for other restaurant options - try John's Pizza and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co in Times Square.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Thought perhaps our bedroom may have benefitted from uplift, especially the bathroom, very 70s feel, but again spotlessly clean. Beds for me were very comfortable,  and I slept well. Room was however very hot, couldn\u2019t turn radiator down, air con was a bit noisy , but could vent by opening window.\nBreakfast was good and enough to keep me going all day.\nIf I\u2019m ever back in Manhattan I\u2019d certainly consider staying here again","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}
