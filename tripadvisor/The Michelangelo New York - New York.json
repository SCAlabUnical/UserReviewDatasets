You'll be greeted by friendly and helpful doormen, pleasant reception staff, and aided by Concierge whenever needed.

Have tried several other hotels within five blocks of 50th and Broadway but so far have found only one that would not cause me to flinch if I had to stay there again - however, it was too expensive for my company's policy this time, and the Michelangelo had decent reviews. My experience, however, does not leave me wanting to stay here again. The gentleman that checked me in was very nice and professional. I asked about coffee in the room and he said there isn't any, but that since I was staying for the week he would have a Keurig brought to the room. I asked if they might have ear plugs and he said he'd have some delivered.\n\nAfter checking in and getting to the room I found it pretty cold. Since I'm normally concerned about a room that is too hot, this didn't frighten me - I figured I could turn up the heat, and I checked the heater under the window and it was definitely working. There was a large modern floor unit air conditioner in the room with a large air hose taped into a window, which let in a lot of noise from the outside, and the window itself couldn't be sealed shut with the hose in it, so it was leaking a lot of cold NYC air into the room. Again, I figured I could turn up the heat. \n\nI wanted a shower after the day's flight and noticed that I could hear voices coming through a grate in the bath\/shower enclosure. I could definitely make out the conversation clearly. Before heading out I went to wash my hands and noticed the spigot water flow is practically up against the bowl, so there is almost no way to put your hands fully under the running water. Poor design and installation. \n\nWhen I returned after getting dinner there was a Keurig on a counter, and I figured I'd better try it out before assuming it would work in the morning. It didn't, and ended up with water coming out the bottom and flooding the counter and onto the carpet. I used towels to contain it and called down to ask them to come look at it and confirm it works or replace it. I was told they would come up right away. I then left again to go out for a  walk and came back an hour or so later to find nothing had been done, and there were no ear plugs in the room. I called down again, and this time a new machine was brought and the broken one taken away. \n\nThe room never got warm, I was moved the next day, to a much better room, but still super loud with street noise.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I asked for an upgrade and was told I was already upgraded to a studio.  The hotel was booked solid but you would think it was empty.  Not much people coming in and out.  It was very quiet I fell asleep quickly.  If you want to be close to Times Square but not in the middle of the caos this is the hotel for you.  Walking distance to Times Square about 5 minutes.  Check out Famous Original Rays pizza it's about a block away.  Pizza is amazing.  There are other eating options close by.  Can't wait to return to this hotel, you will not be disappointed!","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

Although our room was not ready when we arrived, the bell hop checked our bags for us, and the hotel texted me when the room was ready.

The furnishings were on the elegant end of the spectrum.  Each room is given 2 free bottles of water a day, and then there is the expensive minibar, too.  My only complaint was that one of the bed's mattress needed to be replaced, but it wasn't terrible.  The location cannot be beat.  It's across the street from the Winter Garden theatre, and at most 5 blocks from other theatres you may want to visit.

I will start off with the positives.  The location is great.  It is a \"quiet\" spot very close to everything (shopping, theaters, times square and central park).  The bell staff is very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are HUGE especially compared to New York standards for the price point.  We were offered an upgrade upon arrival from two queens to two king beds. The beds were very comfortable.  The water pressure was great. There is a full mini\/snack bar.\nNow for the negative. Our room was not ready when we arrived, which is typical.  However, we were told it would be ready shortly and they would text or call when ready.  An hour and half later, we still had not received confirmation that our room was ready. So we went back to the front desk, just to find out that had been ready for over an hour. When we arrived to our room, while checking out our view, we pulled back the curtains to find a mouse trap sitting on the floor. I know that NY has been known for a rodent issue, but we were not expecting to see a mouse trap.  There is not a coffee or tea pot in the rooms. When we checked in, the told us that we had a $10 drink credit at the bar each evening.  However, we were never able to take advantage of this perk since they closed the \"bar\" area so early.  And, when we were checking out, we asked for a late check out.  Mind you, this was on a Monday, they said that the latest we could do was 1:00 and they would have to charge us.  I was told by the front desk \"it isn't me charging you, it is our system.\"\nMy overall opinion is that the hotel is just OK.  Exceeds in some areas, but lacking in others. Not the worst I have stayed in NY and not the best.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The location, just off 7th, makes it easy to get to everything from museums and theaters to restaurants and Central Park. Between the location and the design of the hotel, coming and going was easy, whether it was going down the street to get a coffee, walking to Central Park, or going to restaurants and other attractions. I liked the fact that their main door doesn\u2019t open onto 7th St, so that you could step out of the hotel without immediately having to fight a crowd. The room was really nice, clean, comfortable, and really quiet--I heard nothing of the city or other hotel guests. The hotel staff and quality of service were amazing. The door staff were helpful and friendly from the moment I arrived until they helped get my luggage to a taxi. The front desk was readily available and able to quickly get answers to questions. The restaurant staff were great. Even the cleaning staff were friendly. My one suggestion is that if you need to be able to plug in your laptop and phone at the same time, bring a small out charger that allows you to plug your laptop and other devices into a single AC outlet. There are limited AC outlets, and the light fixtures don't have the extra AC and USB plugs built into them that most hotels now have. Make sure you book directly through the hotel. They have their own in-house reservation person who's really helpful.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

And, of course, our home base in New York is always the Michelangelo Hotel at 51st & 7th.  Perfectly located for easy access especially in the Theater District.  First of all, New York has bounced back from COVID and is open and bustling with activity.  It looks great; like the pre-COVID days.  Lots of people and businesses have re-opened.  Restaurants are open and it is all wonderful.\n\nI should also say that we always call our friend Lakeman for transportation from LGA to the Michelangelo.  We look forward to seeing Lakeram each time we visit.\n\nThe Michelangelo is looking really good.  Lots of attention to detail and personal service.  We have been saying at Michelangelo for nearly 10 years (maybe more).  Staff is friendly.  We were greeted out front yesterday morning by Tedoro who recognized us and told us he was happy we were back.  And Edwin the Bellman took good care of us.  Lots of hellos and friendly greetings all the way from the curbside to the check in desk.  Michelangelo is open with no signs of Covid.  Lobby lounge is fully operational.\n\nEverything about the Michelanelo is clean and smart and in good working order.  It is nice to stay where you are known and appreciated.\n\nThis time we stayed in Room 409 which was a delightful room with a comfortable bed and a small sitting area and in room bar area.  The room was very close to the elevator and very quiet. Our only regret is that we did not stay any longer.  But we will be back in October and will stay longer then.\n\nJust to finish off, the Michelangelo is where ywe enjoy staying for our theater visits to NY.  Our first show was a Camelot matinee at Lincoln Center.  Michelangelo is 1 block away from the #1 train (red line) and Lincoln Center is about 2 stops in the Uptown direction.  Subways in mid town are very crowded, which is a good thing.  On the return, we took the M7 bus from right out side Lincoln Center down 7th Av. to across the street from the Michelangelo.  Total transportion cost was $9 roundtrip for 2 people.\n\nIn the evening we walked to Parade on 45th street. The congestion in Time Square is exhilarating and is what makes NY New York.  Ray's Pizza is on the way and a great place to have a nice slice of NY pizza before the show.  We also enjoy the Majestic Deli which is a block away from the Michelangelo.  Great selections for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just a snack.\n\nWe enjoy travelling to New York and we enjoy standing at the Michelangelo.\n\nJIM\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I emailed General Manager, Marco Gianni ahead of our stay asking for any complimentary upgrade that might be available for our celebratory occasion.\n\nWe pre-booked a transfer from JFK, again with Booking.com (\u00a359) and were greeted at the arrivals hall and whisked into Manhattan in a smart black SUV. \n\nOn arrival, the Hotel presents as a large traditionally-built brick building at the corner of 51st Street and 7th Avenue.  We were cordially greeted by the doorman and assisted with our luggage into the chandelier-hung hallway, and through golden bronze doors into the opulent foyer.  The foyer was both spacious and elegant.  Marble flooring, impressive chandeliers, crystal wall-lights, oil paintings, a grand piano and sumptuous seating areas. We were efficiently checked-in and given a complimentary upgrade to a Junior Suite (#709).\n\nWe took one of the three elegant golden elevators to the 7th floor and found our suite just a few steps away down the hallway.  On entering we were in a marble-floored vestibule with floor to ceiling mirror behind some glass shelving, upon which some books and an ornamental plate had been placed.  Moving through we found ourselves in our large seating area, with sofa, armchair, coffee table and two reproduction wooden chairs.  Uniquely we had a walk-up bar, with three stools, refrigerated mini-bar and a tray of chocolates and snacks for purchase.  Very kindly we had been left a bottle of Prosecco on ice and a half-dozen chocolate-dipped strawberries.  The refrigerator is big enough to also store your own items alongside the pay-to-consume mini-bar products.\n\nTo the side of the bar, a sliding door led to the bathroom, with well-lit vanity mirror above the washbasin, shaving mirror and a good selection of toiletries and amenity items. A further sliding door led to the w\/c and large bath-tub with over-bath shower. There were complimentary bathrobes, slippers and a good array of white fluffy towels.\n\nThe Junior Suite had a large and very comfortable king-size bed, bedside tables, several table-lamps, an armoire which opened to reveal a flat-screen TV (with free channels, pay to watch movies and information services) and more drawer-space.  There was a large double-wardrobe with mirrored doors, electronic wall safe, iron, ironing board and laundry bag.\n\nThe air conditioner was effective and easy to operate.  The view from the Junior Suite's three windows, was past two wings of the hotel to 7th Avenue.  Double-glazing meant that the noise of the City was barely audible and we enjoyed very peaceful nights sleep.\n\nThe hotel is very conveniently situated about a 5 minute walk down 7th Avenue to the bright lights of Times Square and a 2 minute walk to 7th Avenue Subway Station. There are very many diners nearby for breakfast, the iconic Ellen's Stardust Diner is just opposite, Applebees and Juniors diners are just over the road.  There are plenty of bars nearby and Full-Service restaurants in and around Times Square, including the must-visit Virgil's Barbeque and it's sister establishment Caramine's  Italian Restaurant just a  few blocks away down 7th Avenue on 44th Street.  The theatres of Broadway are near the hotel. The Rockerfeller Centre and shops of 5th Avenue a 5 minute walk.  Central Park is a 10 minute walk up 7th Avenue.\n\nIn all, a very comfortable and charming hotel, with great staff and Italian style, set in the vibrant heart of New York.

The staff we encountered were all very personable, helpful and courteous. Housekeeping was excellent and our room was kept extremely clean and it was lovely to return to it after a busy day sightseeing. \n\nThe location of the hotel is excellent and was near (but not too near!) Times Square, Central Park and many subway stations to get you up and down Manhattan island. \n\nThe only downside we felt, which is personal opinion, is that the fixtures and fittings were a little tired. Light switches, lamps and particularly the shower mixer were old and all could do with updating. In addition, the air conditioning unit was very noisy so not sure how this may play out in the warm summer months as it may be difficult to sleep with it on. \n\nHowever, if you\u2019re looking for a comfortable hotel with lovely staff that is centrally placed then booking here would be a good move.

Almost all of the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room itself was spacious, the beds were comfortable, and the linens were very nice. The location was excellent and close to the theater and Times Square. Unfortunately, that is pretty much where it ended. \n\nThe hotel itself looked quite dated, and even though we upgraded to the king suite, it too was very outdated. The furniture was very old and worn out. The toilet flush barely worked, and to our surprise, there were no wine glasses in the mini-bar. We had to call down to the front desk for some, but they never arrived, and we had to go down to the lobby to ask for them. They did indicate the wine glasses were supposed to be there, but maybe it was an oversight by housekeeping. The bath products provided were of poor quality. Additionally, there was no coffee or water in the room, which was surprising considering the high price we paid for our stay and the fact that it is a star-rated hotel. We paid around $650 for the night (and that did not include breakfast) and $90 for parking per night. We were there for 26 hours, so they charged us for 2 nights parking. \n\nOverall, we would not recommend staying at the Michelangelo hotel in New York, as the lack of attention to detail in room amenities and outdated decor did not justify the high cost of the stay. We realize it's about supply and demand, and that could justify the cost, but it certainly does not justify the star rating.\n","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is valet service.\nThe concierge was quite welcoming and although we could not check in until 3:00 p.m., we were able to have all of our information entered into the system, and our bags held in a secure location, so that when we returned, our key was ready, and the doorman delivered our luggage to our room.

Then the manager Elizabeth suggested we come back in an hour because all rooms weren't yet available, since it wasn't quite check-in time. We had lunch, they called when our new room was ready - and what a difference ! SPECTACULAR.  A lot of light, spacious and high floor as requested.  It was an anniversary trip,  so the accommodation meant everything to us :-)  The next morning, they sent up a bottle of Prosecco to congratulate us and it was very much appreciated !  We travel a lot and have found that good hotels are eager to have happy guests - sometimes you just have to ask for what you want.

He was pleasant to be around and an asset to the hotel to say the least. \n\nOverall, I would stay at this hotel again, the location is fantastic however NY is a loud city so you are bound to hear the traffic regardless of whichever room you stay in during the night. The hotel, while feeling slightly dated, felt clean and luxurious and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to book in the future.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The best that can be said is that it's an excellent location, clean, safe - for nearly a grand it should be! Then the downside: It's very expensive (morning bagels are charged at $19!). Despite the price it has no aura of luxury, the room was dark and the AC exceptionally noisy. My friend has stayed there several times before, yet his request that we have adjoining rooms was ignored and I was on another floor. The main issue however, was that they were very rude to me. With no warning, I was locked out of my room after two nights simply because administratively they didn't have my credit card on the room booking - they had my friend's. That struck me as pretty astounding (why not just buttonhole me at reception? Or better still, book me in properly, on my own credit card, at check-in!) However, when I tried to ascertain that my card alone would be on the booking and that my friend's card would not be mistakenly charged as well (a real possibility given automated billing), a man in a hotel black suit was called from behind the scenes and started shouting at me. I was astounded. I paid nearly a  thousand dollars to stay at a dark and not luxurious hotel only to be locked out of my room then have a man shout at me in the lobby. This was real NYC attitude. Contemptible. And yes, this is a genuine review - not a hatchet job; and yes, it went down as I describe here - this is not a self-serving account and I am not embroidering. I believe the man who originally served me at the desk was rather ashamed of his senior's attitude for what it's worth.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

You are so centrally located here that you can walk quickly to anywhere.\n\nTeam-  From the Manager Marco, the Ops Manager Hamadi, to the countless other team members we encountered, everyone was a SUPERSTAR!!!

We stayed here for 4 nights 16th-20th May as part of my wife's birthday celebration. A luxurious, elegant & classical Italian style hotel with superbly comfortable beds and beautiful rooms. The lobby is stunning and a great place just to chill out. The photos on their site really don\u2019t do it justice! All the staff from reception, housekeeping and porters were very friendly and helpful. \n\nThe room we were in was incredibly spacious, and after a day of sightseeing, a long soak in the large bathtub was just perfect! The beds are so comfy, we were out like a light as soon as our heads touched the pillow (and usually it takes me a while to doze off, so this was a nice little bonus for me!) Housekeeping were brilliant and the room was spotless. \n\nIt's around a 5-minute walk to Time Square and the same to Top of The Rock so quite central to midtown attractions and near to a few subway stations. Despite its location, you won't hear any of the hustle & bustle of the city so you\u2019ll get a great night\u2019s sleep!  \n100% recommend this hotel and we\u2019ll definitely book when we next visit NYC.

AMAZING hotel, right in the heart of Manhattan, centrally located, perfect for Theatre District, Central Park and so much more. The hotel is pristinely clean, beautiful lobby, amazing staff, who quickly checked us in after our long flight. No queues, and nothing was too much trouble. Our room was stunning, beautiful outlook from the 7th floor over 7th Avenue, we had the added bonus of being able to see the stage door of the theatre that Hugh Jackman is performing in, so got to see him arrive and leave on a few of the days we were there! Our room, a king studio (Room 711), was huge by New York standards,  the bed was wonderfully comfortable, with really good quality bed linen. Separate seating area, walk in wardrobe\/closet, vanity area was separate from the main bathroom, just wonderfully laid out. Room was incredibly well soundproofed, we couldn\u2019t even hear the roadworks that were taking place outside on one of the days we were there. Housekeeping did a brilliant job each day of cleaning the room.\nTwo very small downsides to the room though\u2026\u2026\u2026air conditioning unit was a little bit noisy, but we soon got used to it, and it worked incredibly well considering it was 90 degrees outside. The other disappointment was the prices for the very well stocked minibar, which seemed excessively expensive, so we avoided consuming any items from it, and just stocked up at one of the many local shops nearby.\nOverall, a brilliant hotel, wonderful staff, great location\u2026..we will definitely return again!","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Even though the hotel looks old it is super clean and very well taken care of.  The old look comes from a lot of red velvet and gold trimmings.  The lobby is elegant with a huge flower display and lobby restaurant.  The staff us very friendly and the morning breakfast is not to be missed.  A big plus is a modern samovar that makes any type of coffee you desire.  This is a small hotel by New York standards which, when taking into account its great location, is a true rarity.  Bear in mind we were there in February and the city is hardly even half full.  That means that the hotel was quiet, cabs were plentiful and the shows and restaurants were very easy to get into.  New York is very diligent in keeping Covid down, so come spring and summer and the city fills up, you won't be able to get near this hotel,  I strongly suggest you book now if you think your going to the city.

They claim to have reopened but let\u2019s be clear: they haven\u2019t really. They claim 4 stars but do NOT provide the basic services required by this rating. \n\nAmong the most annoying things is the total absence of food service, no breakfast, not even a coffee maker in rooms!!!  Even Motel 6 has coffee makers. No free water in the rooms either. The lounge\/bar area is closed. So basically you get a room. Period. \n\nDo they tell you all this when you book? Of course not. \n\nDo you think that management cares? Well\u2026 I expressed my disappointment at the front desk and by email. Or course no response. \n\nOver the past two months I went to the Dominik, the Lotte and the Four Seasons in NY. I appreciate that reopening after covid isn\u2019t easy and not all hotels are fully back. But clearly some make more efforts and succeed at delivering a nice experience.

We arrived to security asleep in the lobby and our floor reeking of marijuana. Our suite had stained carpeting and was extremely dark. The next day, construction noise at 7 AM (that we were assured was not taking place) forced our guests to switch rooms. Several other guests complained about it, too. Mice (plural) ran through the bar right in front of us. Another guest had to be moved for a water leak. They gave a package addressed to me to another guest that I had to chase for two days. The security guards continued to snooze in the lobby and the management continued to do nothing about the issues. The Director of Operations called me at one point after we complained at the front desk about the building up of issues. She left me her \"direct line\" - when I called it back, it went to the voicemail of a man named Vikram. That was endemic of the level of professionalism at this property. The bartender on our first night was a very pleasant woman. The next two nights it was an absolutely unhinged maniac who berated my guests and yelled at them that their presence in his half-empty bar was not as important as his three small tables of theater guests. He then proceeded to yell all kinds of things including that he was union and there's nothing anyone could do to him. This happened in full view of the front desk staff, who said he would report it to management yet the next day nothing was done. When we returned to our room after our marriage, the temperature was an unbearable 83F and we had not touched the thermostat. Upon checkout, we waited to speak to the manager and it was a complete waste of time with him stalling and claiming he knew nothing and had to make investigations. Over a week later, nothing he said would be followed up on has been done. No one has contacted us. We received no bar credit (which we were supposed to receive after the mice ran through) or credit for any of the hassles. Days later I had a guest calling to say they'd been charged for parking when they had no vehicle. At every opportunity to make something better, these people decided to make it worse. There isn't one employee we encountered who had either the ability or the willingness to change the course of this nightmare. Choosing this hotel for our wedding group was a colossal mistake and I am ashamed that I had my family and friends book there. At the last minute we decided to stay two extra days in the city but we left and went to another hotel so the nightmare would end. The second we walked in the door of that property, they spotted that we'd just had a wedding and upgraded us, gave us a bottle of wine and bar credits and the contrast in service and professionalism was astounding. Hotel Michelangelo was just a disaster on every level.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Some of the fittings have slightly been worn down. It needs a bit of love.\n- No coffee facilities in the room.\n- Deliberately deceptive \"residency fee\" which is not included in the initial quoted price per night on Hotwire when hotels are compared on price. It's only visible right at the end before you pay. After tax, this comes to almost $50 per night extra on top of the room fee. I say it is deliberately deceptive, because the only reason they don't include it in the room fee is so that they can rank higher\/cheaper on listings such as Hotwire while still making a larger profit when it comes to the final fee you have to pay. I challenge the hotel to reply and come up with a reason for not including this in the room rate that doesn't include \"some other hotels also do this too\". They say it covers things like wifi even though their website says wifi is complimentary. If this fee was optional, I would understand, but it's not. Note that this practice is illegal in many other countries. Travel rating organisations such as the AAA actually deduct rating points from hotels who do this because of the deception.  \n\nSummary:\nStay at this hotel if the location is of utmost importance.

This meant that it could be a little noisy with the taxi horns heard late into the night but not too bad. The room itself was a deluxe king and was very big possibly the largest of our 6 previous visits to NY. It did not look tired as some have said and there was lots of storage space and the wi fi was perfect. The closest subway is either 50th street or if wanting another line a mere 5 minute walk to Rockefeller. As much as we both know how tacky Times Square is you simply have to turn the corner and there it is and it always makes a cool picture. My only issue was the area that was allocated to drinks and breakfast which seemed very small and I am not sure if I missed it but was there another bar or restaurant in this hotel? as I never found it. Door staff were very helpful and stored our suitcases for our late flight and got us a cab with no issues, Thanks guys. I would certainly recommend this place if you have never been before as it is so central and close to all the classic NY spots including Central Park which is a 10 minute walk away.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Needless to say, NYC was jammed.  We had plans for Broadway shows, an event at Carnegie Hall, dinners at Le Bernardin and Tratoria Dell Arte among others, and a visit to MOMA.  The Michelangelo could not be in a better location and we were able to walk to all of those events even though it was very cold that weekend and we are in our 70's.  It was also a short ride to get to the High Line, Hudson Yards and the gentrified Meat Packing District which we hadn't seen before.  The Michelangelo has a true European vibe.  We had a full suite (with two bathrooms !!!) and paid a fraction of the price that we would pay at the better known hotels where we usually stay.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the concierge was quite helpful for directions and restaurants in the neighborhood.  It is a smaller property without a fancy restaurant, but they do have breakfast, lunch and dinner available with a somewhat limited menu.  The bar is comfortable and open late and was a good place to meet people from locals to international travelers.  It draws an interesting and nice crowd.

Due to a supply and demand situation I was able to book one night at the Michelangelo Hotel that with taxes came to slightly over $800 for one night.

My biggest complaint is when we picked up our luggage from the doorman who had been holding it for us after we checked out.  We had been clearly told by the front desk that when we picked up our luggage the doorman would help us with any transportation we needed.  After we collected our luggage from him I asked him if he could help us get a taxi.  He asked me where we were going and when I told him Penn Station he told me to walk to Seventh Avenue and I could get a taxi there. I understand that Seventh Avenue is in close proximity but really?

This is not a cheap place to stay, but I suppose their rates are in-line with other similar establishments in the area. \n\nThis most recent business stay at this hotel from December 8-December 10 has changed my impressions to the extent that I will more likely than not choose different lodgings for my next trip.  \n\nFirst:  When arriving at the hotel, there was no bellman to assist with the luggage or even to open the door, which is difficult when you are bogged down with luggage.\n \nSecond:  I arrived for check in at approximately 2:45 PM (normal check-in is 3:00) and was told that my room was not ready.  I was informed it should be ready shortly and that they would notify me by text when ready.  I told them I would wait in the lobby with my luggage since the delay was supposed to be short.  At 3:30, after no word, I wen to the front desk to inquire the status and was immediately handed a room key -- they said the room had been ready --- but obviously no notification.  Another person at the front desk said that he had texted me, which was either a lie or he was mistaking me for someone else.  In any event, this got the stay off to a bad start. \n\nThird:  the toilet in the room was defective, in that the only way to get a full flush, you had to keep the handle depressed and then release it at just the right time.  I put in a request at the front desk for someone from maintenance to look into it, but the problem was not addressed since the same issue continued.  I received no notification that the hotel had looked into the issue. \n\nFourth: On the second day of my stay, upon arriving to the room in the late afternoon after a business meeting (approximately 4:30 PM) I find that the room had not been serviced at all.  I go downstairs and ask to see the manager, and then had to wait for 15-20 minutes before she came out.  She did apologize and asked if I wanted to be comped dinner at the small open restaurant adjacent to the lobby, but I said no.  She did take off approximately $25 for the \"resort fee\" or whatever they call it where the hotel adds-on to the bill for the gym, wifi, or other BS add-on fees.  Just give a room price and be done with it. \n\nTo conclude, I was very disappointed with the Michelangelo this trip.  There was not one issue, but several, including to me a less than enthusiastic attitude toward customer service.  This is especially offensive given the very high price paid for the room, upward of $1,000 a night.  \n\nI will be staying elsewhere on my next business trip to New York.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

They said they would upgrade me to my executive room tomorrow. I must deal with it for tonight. \n\nUmmm. It's not an upgrade when you give me less than what I paid for without telling me and after I complain say that the next day will give me what I actually paid for. And I am still waiting for them to actually give  me what I paid for. Although they can never give my back the time they have ruined on my vacation so far having to deal with this and spend in this horrible room. I only have the downgrade room they tried to sneak in at the rate I paid for the better room as of this review. \n\nAdded to this, it's not a clean room. But a picture paints a thousand words so I'm posting pictures of what they represent on hotels.com and what I was given. I really hope they choose to make this right. I will update my review one way or the other.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room was large (400+ square feet), clean, and quiet.  We barely heard anyone in nearby rooms, and we usually had the elevator to ourselves.  A couple of the doormen were friendly and helpful.  The hotel was located close to Times Square, Radio City Music Hall, Broadway, Carnegie Hall, the Ed Sullivan Theater, and Central Park.  The Empire State Building was within walking distance.  Many restaurants were nearby, my favorite being Patsy's (Frank Sinatra's favorite restaurant).  We took a cab here, but a much cheaper way from JFK would have been to take the Airtrain for $7.75 and the E subway line to W. 53rd St. for $3. Do the reverse to get back to JFK, and it's a reverse commute on a weekday morning.  Would definitely stay here again.  It was a bit of a splurge, but you get what you pay for.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Overall it was a pretty comfortable stay. Check in was a bit rough bc. I had requested an early check after a red eye flight from LA and alas...my room was not ready! So, I ate a lovely ( but expensive!!) breakfast and by 12.00 I was shown to my room. At first I was not happy! The carpets were stained pretty badly and the room felt dark although it was a pretty good size for me ( single occupant). I was told I could choose to wait for another room or switch the next day and decided to stay.\nBut, after settling in I ended up staying in the room all 5 nights. It was super comfortable and my carpets were shampooed the next day and I was lazy to gave to pack up and move again. I liked the bed and the shower was nice with a rain shower or hand held shower option. Lots of down pillows and a relatively quiet room to boot. ( for nyc!)\nTheir customer service is outstanding! They really try to accommodate their guests! I ordered room service twice and it was excellent... prompt, efficient and exactly right.\nI had mentioned that it was my dad\u2019s bday weekend and my parents were staying  on the same floor with me. Their room was beautiful and large.. almost a suite! Also my dad received a bottle of champagne and chocolate cake with a lovely card on his birthday from management... very thoughtful!\nAlthough the furniture in this hotel is a bit worn and could use an overhaul I like how polite and personal the staff is. Everyone goes out of their way to make you feel like a welcome guest and that\u2019s rare for nyc!\nThe tv worked well, the ac\/ heater worked... the toilet flushed and shower drained perfectly and there was  hot water as much As desired .... plus good water pressure...  a comfy bed... nice big towels .....these are all the things that make a stay comfortable and I\u2019ve stayed in 5 star hotels in NYC where I\u2019ve had issues with one or more of these things so I don\u2019t take them for granted  when staying in nyc! I think management really tries to make their guests happy and i think if they remodel and update this hotel it would deserve 5 stars.

The service is very personnel.  To ensure we were satisfied, our check in clerk texted us several times over the weekend.  Nothing was too much trouble. \n\nWe booked through Hotels.com but the hotel could not be more accommodating about finding us a good room. I read some of the rooms were interior, some on 7th which is noisy and some on 51st. Also, that higher was better. I called to let them know my preferences and we were put in the excellent room 620 - corner, quiet, with windows on 51st. \n\nThe  room and the hotel are traditional. Not for the W, Nomad crowd but for those of us who like our comforts, and a bit of elegance. We are middle aged as were most of the guests we saw. \n\nI thought the room was beautiful and it, and the premises as a whole, were in excellent condition.  \n\nThe room was also larger than a traditional NYC hotel room at about 400 square feet with room for two comfy chairs and a desk. There was a nice amount of drawer space with a 3 deep drawer dresser, a decent closet and two night tables with decent storage. \n\nThe bathroom was divided in two with a sink\/makeup mirror outside of the toilet, bath area. The bath was a soaking tub, with a combined shower, including a wand. There were robes and slippers and decent cosmetics. \n\nThe hotel is at the corner of 7th and 51st so Midtown but considered Times Square.  Very close to the theaters and not far from Time Square itself.  \n\nBUT.... the safe was so high up, even my 5\"9 husband needed a chair to retrieve things. The closet was beside the bed and it was very narrow between the two. Really awkward to get anything..  On the plus side, the hangers were plentiful, wooden, and not attached like the hotel is worried they will be stolen. \n\nThere was NOWHERE for your electronics.  We were searching for plugs.  \n\nThe bathroom has one sink - not a deal breaker - but the only place to put cosmetics was the sink area.  No other shelf. \n\nThe mini bar was ridiculously expensive, eg. $12 M & M's. Yes, nicely packaged  in a glass jar but who cares?   The mini bar was also stocked with every type of liquor, even champagne. We did not take advantage of it but it had a real old time feel. Charming. \n\nHowever, there was no Keurig.  That was a big minus. The first day we were meeting a tour and wanted to eat breakfast in Lower Manhattan.  By the time we got to where we were going, w had been up for 2 hours and we were not happy we had yet to have a coffee.  \n\nNot sure room service's hours but it was not available either at 4 or at 11 pm when we really needed it.  \n\nWe ate breakfast at the hotel the second day.  It was overpriced and mediocre.  $27 for an American breakfast where the potatoes consisted of 4 tiny potatoes and $18 for bagels and lox where the cream cheese was like Kraft, the bagel must have been Entemanns out of the plastic bag and you needed a microscope to see the fruit side.   The lox was good and plentiful at least. \n\nThe Wifi is free but there is a $48 fee on top of your room rate, for amenities. \n\nDid not look for it but don't believe there is a spa of gym ( just not sure). \n\nRe location, we found that whether it was the line to get tickets at the subway or getting to the theater, or finding a diner, we encountered crowds we weren't used to because we usually stay more East. We were constantly walking in huge crowds if we took 7th or 8th. So good if that makes you feel part of the action. But we did not appreciate it and it definitely means you need more time to get places and you will wait around longer at the local eateries.  \n\nWould we stay here again?  Definitely, if the price is right. We would just explore the area better for food choices and maybe bring stuff to our room.  Overall, we had  a good experience.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I\u2019m not quite sure what the residents fee is or why they can\u2019t charge this within the upfront cost for transparency but never mind. We were informed of this at check in but were not told how much this would be (to be fair, I wasn\u2019t present for check in and my friend omitted to ask this question, which I would have done). It would have been by the by, however, as we wouldn\u2019t have been left with much option other than to pay it or find another hotel at late notice in a Saturday night in Times Square (whilst there was a UN summit taking place!). In the interest of fairness, I will say you do get a $10 beverage allowance and $10 off any transport booked through reception. \n\nThe hotel itself is wonderful. The location is perfect for central Manhattan and the suite we stayed in was certainly luxurious. I can\u2019t quite bring myself to agree to it being worth the price but I have to be fair and say it was maybe overpriced by around \u00a350. Get rid of the residence fee and I would have been pretty happy with the price. I\u2019ve added photos below to show how wonderful this room was. It was spotlessly clean, the temperature was just right and it was lovely and quiet. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. \n\nThe staff were very friendly throughout. \n\nThe hotel is perfect for a short or long stay and if I could come to terms with the cost, I would stay here again. \n","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It was my first trip to the city and because my friends had booked the hotel I wasn't too sure what to expect. First and foremost, the hotel is perfectly located just a short stroll from Times Square. Considering the busy location, I was pleasantly surprised how quiet the hotel was and I enjoyed the best sleep. Seriously, the beds are super comfy you might find yourself struggling to get up in the morning. I will say that the decor of the hotel is a little dated in places and could do with a bit of TLC and modernisation. But it is spacious, charming and extremely clean and comfortable. On that note I'd like to give the housekeeping team a shout out for doing such a terrific job, they are a credit to the hotel. I'd also like to thank the Michelangelo for changing my room after initially not being too happy with my allocated room due to a strange musty smell, and the fact that I also wanted to be on the same floor as my friends. In my opinion the hotel was rather expensive, but I guess you are paying for the location and given that it was my first time in America I have nothing to compare it with. Would I recommend the Michelangelo? Yes, without doubt. The location is perfect for sightseeing and most of the staff I interacted with were very polite, friendly, helpful and accommodating. It's a shame the hotel rooms don't have tea and coffee making facilities but perhaps that is common for rooms in American hotels. However when we enquired about this, the staff provided us with a tea\/coffee making machine. They clearly care about making sure their guests are happy and comfortable. Staying at the Michelangelo made my New York holiday all the more enjoyable and memorable, I only wish I'd been able to stay for longer.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

It's been along time since the bath tiles have been cleaned.  Door frame from the bathroom was in need of caulking and paint.  One window shade was completely broken and on the floor.  The TV was not working but only needed to be plugged in correctly something we should not have to worry about.  Our AC unit broke on the 2nd night and could not be fixed. The AC unit looked pretty old.  We had to move to a much smaller room because of availability issues and they would only give the Resort fee per night as credit.  Also avoid room #510:  The AC in that room broke too and we had to move our relatives to another room.  There was a shortage of bath & hand towels for whatever reason.  Our rooms would get cleaned around 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm and only when we complained.  The resort fee was supposed to be deducted from the bill.  When we got our bill management forgot to give us the deductions they were suppose to give us for our trouble.  We had to wait for management to be available to make the adjustment to our bill. Our whole family reserved 4 rooms and spend around $7500+ and only got around $360 credit for our trouble.  I believe this will be our first and last stay here.

The staff making sure that the lobby is enjoyable and quiet for all the guests is what makes this place so special.  I know Walter, he is great.

Under the counter top was a cushioned stool. The towels were thick and soft.  Bathrobes and bedroom slippers were also provided.  The hotel toiletries were of  good quality.\n\nThe ambiance of the hotel is old Italian luxury with emphasis on heavy ornate furniture and drapes and gilded lamps.

Hence the lobby is rather pleasantly quiet unlike other big multi-roomed hotels with lobbies like Grand Central Station.\n\nService was friendly and efficient .  Housekeeping was excellent . \n\nHowever, we were a bit surprised by the resort tax of $50 a day.   We remembered paying a daily city tax during previous visits to NYC at other hotels.

The only amenities I could have used is the $10 drink ticket but I don't drink so it was useless. A Hotel like this for this charge should give you a daily paper and have free coffee available in the lobby or a pot in your room. Instead, they place these drinks and snacks in your room hoping you will consume them so they charge you an enormous price. The room is very roomy but the bathroom door slides open instead of having a door and this sucks! The room was clean and the bed was outstanding- I slept like a baby! The staff were nice especially the bellhops. So again when you think you have a good price on their rooms remember to add $192.50 to your bill as explained in the small writing. Around the corner is a great place to eat the Majestic Deli, they serve good breakfast too and stay open till 1:00 AM. Again for a 5-star hotel, they offer little at the hotel in useful amenities!

I called down to ask for someone to come up and help but was told there are no night shift maintenance staff at the hotel. An offer to switch rooms was made but my husband was in a deep sleep and i did not want to wake him so the hotel brought up a fan to circulate the hot air. The next morning it was fixed by the day time staff but no offer of compensation of any kind was made for our terrible first night. On our last morning I realized the maid had not left the condiment packs for coffee and called down to request that three packets be brought up.It took over 45 minutes and three calls to make that happen delaying my shower and cutting short our time to do some last minute souvenir shopping. Again no offer of compensation was made -- not even a complimentary coffee. Not the best stay this time. This used to be my favorite hotel but the Hotel has poor guest relations practices.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon check-in, we found that our bathroom had not been cleaned properly....there were several black human hairs in the tub, whether from a housekeeping staff member or the previous guest, it was not acceptable. \n\nWhen we returned to our room the following afternoon, none of the Keurig coffee supplies that we had used that morning had been taken away or replenished. \n\nAfter a day of sightseeing, we arrived back to our room the next afternoon to find that some of the used glasses, swizzle sticks, and wastebasket trash had not been removed, nor had the carpet been vacuumed. \n\nEach time that we talked to a hotel staff member at the front desk about the issues, they said they were sorry. \n\nThe fact that the hotel bar ran out of several of the most popular brands of liquor by Friday, May 31, was the \u201cicing on the cake\u201d, so to speak.....especially when we found out from people who frequent the bar that this often happens by month\u2019s end. We had planned to mention this to a manager, but by then we were just tired of complaining, and ready to leave. \n\nAll of that said, the hotel\u2019s location is wonderful, the staff is very friendly, and the rooms (although needing some freshening up and better wall plugs), are large by NYC standards.

Mini bar eye wateringly expensive,  so our son was told  not  to  touch a thing. Nice touch was the mobile phone.. free international calls. This was to off set the daily hotel tax. \nRoom cleaned lovely by Suzana. Beds turned back nightly. Nice touch. Ooms clean. Plug sockets a bit dated. Our chargers(uk) kept falling out. Didn't eat in at all but the menu wasn't extensive and as its on top of time square for eatreys, I'd say book room only.\nLocation good. Literally straight ahead Time square was 2 min walk,very very busy . Turn left Rockafella and St Patrick church no more than 5 min walk. Central park a nice 8 minute walk. Location couldn't be better for the theatre... 5 min to Broadway. Just be aware. Lots street traders selling bags watches, more bags CDs accosting you constantly in this area,  not so much of this further away from time square, so if that's ok, this hotel is for you.

Of course, a place with a name like The Michelango has marble - everywhere. The room has real glassware and striped wallpaper as is usual in hotels in this price range. The furnishing are appropriately themed and more upscale but the lighting is abysmal. The lamp on one nightstand is turned on with a rotary in-line switch on the cord that disappears out of reach and out of sight against the wall. The other lamp features the classic, socket-style switch tucked under the lampshade accessible by only someone with elfin hands. Not to worry, there\u2019s plenty of light in the room courtesy of the Barclay\u2019s multi-story, LED billboard that shines incessantly through the inadequate curtains. The bathroom has a tub versus a walk-in shower and you might consider avoiding rooms with a tub unless you\u2019re gymnastically inclined as the step-over is high and wide. The water pressure was fine and the dual-head shower is a nice touch but the soap dish holds water so the next time you use the soap it\u2019s water-logged mess and blown up like an 8-day toad. Please, explain why any hotel has an iron and ironing board, nowadays? Maybe it\u2019s for the same, non-existent crowd of travelers who would use the available, in-room, \u2018Handy Smart Phone\u2019 or the Play-Skool inspired alarm clock radio. The room didn\u2019t have a coffee maker so you were forced into going without or getting up, getting dressed and schlepping down to the lobby for obscenely priced food and beverage items from the lounge food area. $5 dollars for a carafe of hot water for tea is a tax on convenience and a proper gouging. \u2018Anywhere but Here\u2019 is the takeaway for food and beverage at the MIchelango. As you come and go from the Hotel, several things are notable, the staff is friendly, the lobby is fumigated with a choking scent and the elevator can be accessed by anyone with the hight and a finger to push the buttons. When you get to your floor, be prepared for the maze that awaits you. The short, zig-zagging hallways might seem baffling but they have the benefit of dampening the sounds of people in the hall so the room was quiet save for the siren soundtrack that is NYC. I wanted to like this room but the disconnect between the price, amenities and miscues with the detail left me disappointed.\nThe folks operating the Starwood Hotel chain need to stop claiming to, \u201c\u2026get the details right..\u201d Too many little things, let\u2019s call them \u2018details\u2019, are amiss to warrant the prices charged. This corporate branding is lazy and cynical. I find it both comic and criminal that a Hotel chain that purports to be upscale, can fail to offer me a coffee maker but will give me an iron and a worthless, pesdo-smartphone. Offering guests things they don\u2019t want and wouldn\u2019t use, then padding the amenities list with these garbage bullet points is maddeningly absurd. One of the details I\u2019m going to get right the next time I travel is to avoid Starwood Resorts. \nLuxury pricing for budget amenities is a poor value.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

But on this most recent stay from May 1st to the 5th, they really went above to help me.\n\nOn my first night, I returned to my room from my performance only to find that I was leaving bloody footprints on the bathroom rug.  It was seeping through my socks.  I had not realized it, but the shoes that I was wearing had caused severe damage to my foot.  The bottom of my big toe had torn open, and was very raw looking.  During my stay, the staff was extremely helpful in assisting me, and seeking out medical care.\n\nThey sent someone from security up to help with the wound and wrap some bandages around it.  This person also directed me to a very good urgent care, City MD, which was not too far away from the hotel.  The staff at City MD were wonderful, and gave me some medications and ointment to help with the problem while I was in New York, until I could get home and see my regular doctor.  Fortunately, there was a drug store only a block away from the hotel, so I could pick up my medication easily.\n\nDuring the week, the staff was very helpful, and always seemed interested in how I was doing.  Of particular note was Henry the bellhop, who has always been wonderful to me during my past stays, and would often offer to help to get anything I needed.  They also would send someone up twice a day to help me with the gauze and wrapping the bandage over my toe after I applied the ointment.  The staff really went out of their way to try to make me comfortable during my stay, and I appreciate their efforts.\n\nDue to the injury, I wasn't able to do as much as I wanted on this trip, since I had to stay off my feet.  But, I still managed to see my six shows, and they were all wonderful.  I want to extend my heartfelt thanks again to everyone for their support and help, and I look forward to seeing the staff again when I return in November.

In addition, I \nknow that my needs are different from the average traveler.  Suffice to say, the management has always come through on my requests, the location is perfect for ANY tourist and my sister and I absolutely LOVE the place with all its little faults which may be big ones for some I guess.  I will continue to stay at the Michelangelo on my twice yearly trips to the States until they tear it down, throw me out, or have some kind of infestation or something really awful because it is truely a special hotel.  Once again, ask for Henry and even if you don\u2019t need the Grand Suite, all the other rooms are great too.... a tv in the bathroom?  Cool, very cool.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

First, was not having a coffee machine in the room, so one of us had to go down to the lobby to buy 2  $6.00\/cup of coffee, which we did once but not twice.\n\nNext the $40\/day fee for really nothing more than the internet, for most people, is out of the norm and not worth the price.\n\nThe breakfast was really disappointing and very expensive for a \"diner\" quality eggs and bacon plus whole wheat toast.  We wouldn't visit the dining area again.\n\nThe AC system was very noisy and we discovered the next day that our interior windows were both open about 5\" so the outside noise was disruptive.  We closed it the next day, and it was better. \n\nThe hotel was a bit dated, and could use some renovations.  There are some beautiful touches, but areas that need some upgrading. \n\nWe were received well on arrival, but one of the other receptionnists put a customer on hold and left and the new receptionnist who replaced him was clearly unaware that the customer on the phone was on hold for 5 minutes (and very unhappy) - that's not great customer service - so this made a bad impression.  This made us doubtful of the customer service ethic of the hotel.\n\nWe enjoyed our stay, but are not sure we would return. ","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had minimal interaction with the staff other than Asha, who checked us in. She was wonderful and very helpful. There were 4 of us (my spouse and 2 kids with me). This location seems to be the perfect distance to Broadway, Times Square, Rockefeller Square and the MoMA. Everything was just a couple blocks away. The lobby and the hotel in general are beautiful and ornate. It reminds me of what a grand, old world hotel should look like. Warm and elaborate, not sleek and modern.\n\nWe booked a room with 2 king sized beds. The room was very spacious with a clean, 2 section bathroom. There was also a sizable walk-in closet. Slippers and robes were available in the closet. Our room looked over 7th Ave. The view was excellent. They have added an extra layer of windows that do a remarkably good job of keeping out the street noise. There were 3 windows, so there was no lack of natural lighting.\n\nThe only negative (as so many others have pointed out) is the residence charge. It is nice to get some of it back through a $10 drink credit each day.\n\nIf we are coming back to this part of the city again, we will certainly be staying there again.

The room was spacious and very clean. The King bed was comfortable and featured big, fluffy pillows. We had a street view, but minimal traffic noise on the 7th floor. The in-room safe was conveniently located for anyone 6-2 or above. I like the \"Green Policy\" with towels and linens, but like in most hotels, all towels still get changed every day no matter what. Lots of mirrors made the room look even larger. Old-style bathroom with shower in the tub. No coffee maker--surprising for this level of hotel.  Check-out was cheerful and the doorman very helpful with storing our luggage.\n\nWe had a drink in the bar one night, and watched the outnumbered, single waitress trying to keep up with dirty tables and loud guests. Not the best experience.\n\nStyle comes with a price tag! Beware that the guest room charge is only the first chapter.  Add to that the state sales tax, the city sales tax, the occupancy tax, Javits Center tax, residence fee, state sales tax residence fee, and city sales tax residence fee (8 items in total!) and you get a sum that makes me think twice about coming back. Granted, the hotel is not to blame for the taxes, but the high base rate + residence fee generates a lot extra when multiplied by proportional taxes.\n\nThere are some fabulous glass vases on display in the corridors.\n\nThe location is great for show-hopping around Broadway.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The foyer and bar are pleasant; the bar is nice to sit in for a drink before bed and jazzy music plays softly in the background - it would be even nicer with slightly more atmospheric lighting. The barman was especially friendly and helpful. A kettle was delivered to my room on request which was good - I wonder if tea\/coffee-making facilities should automatically be in rooms perhaps, for this price. Doormen are friendly and helpful, and cleaning was v.good. The location is just at the top of Times Square - convenient for me as I am a solo female traveller and l felt safe. Recommended if you can handle the garish bustle of Times Square (many don't, but I like it!!). The Michelangelo is a great tourist base near several key subway stations, so that it's easy to get downtown etc. It's also situated right by all the Broadway theatres, so it's handy if you're seeing shows as you can walk to them. And of course, just a stone's throw from Central Park :) I truly loved my stay here, I had a very happy week at the Michelangelo and would definitely return.\n\nP.S. There is a lovely bakery (part of a chain but so nice) with amazing cookies up behind the hotel on 51st between 6th & 7th Avenues, called Maison Kayser\u2026","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

Incidentally,  2 cups of coffee is $11 not including tip, and there is no coffee in the rooms. \nIf they were to offer a coffee bar in the morning and reduce the resort fee,  I think this would br one of the highest rated hotels in the city.

Stored bags for a day after checkout and as I was reaching for my wallet, the doorman says \"we store the bags for free, but we accept tips.\" Um, yours just went down.\n\nSo, all in all the problems were fairly minor, and the location really is great, so if you go in not expecting true 5 star experience and not paying full price, you'll enjoy it!

The location is excellent because it's down the street from Rockefeller Center, American Girl, and a lot of access to different restaurants and attractions within a 10-15 minute walk.  So don't need to worry about hailing an Uber\/Cab or jumping on the subway with a toddler.\n\nWe stayed in the grand suite and the room was absolutely massive.  So this was very convenient and comfortable for the family, and the hotel arranged a crib for no charge.  One compliant was that the decor, furniture, and room items were a bit dated.  The rug was severely stained and grimy, there was a rice kernel encrusted on the lamp shade, the faucets leaked (I fixed it for them), and there were stains on the bed sheets.  The laminate flooring is very dark in color, so every speck of dust and lint shows through (makes the room seem a lot more dirty).  This isn't really a fault of the hotel, but a remodel or update may be in order sometime in the future.  This is something for guests to keep in mind if you're splurging $600+ a night on a room.  The housekeeping was very attentive and helped us a lot, and freshening up the room for turn-down service.\n\nWe encountered 3 different doormen during our 5 day stay.  Theodoro by far was the nicest.  Every time he saw us coming down the lobby he would rush to open the door for my wife while she was pushing the stroller.  He would even help her lift the stroller up the steps (there's no ramp).  He had such enthusiasm and hustle no matter what time of the day we saw him.  He was also very helpful with directions and other small tasks.  As for the other doormen on staff, my wife would mention every day that they would completely ignore her and never offered any help.  I thought this was strange until I experienced it myself the last day of our stay.  It was around 12 noon on Tuesday Nov 13th and we had already checked out.  We were pushing 3 pieces of luggage plus a stroller through the lobby and the doorman walked past us to assist a couple that wasn't even leaving!  He was telling the couple that he could hold their luggage for them while they toured the city since their flight wasn't until the evening.  So my wife turns to me and says \"You see? That's the guy that's been ignoring me the last 5 days\".  Luckily I ran outside and our driver came inside the lobby to help with the luggage.\n\nMy toddler was playing with my wedding band the last day and misplaced it.  The hotel staff was very helpful, sealing off the room and having the security team comb through.  Marco the head of security even gave me a follow up call after to see if we found it after unpacking our luggage.  Luckily my kid put the ring in her backpack and we found it after returning home to Los Angeles.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

There's plainly no replacement, refurbishment or maintenance programme here. It's very disappointing because this used to be a lovely hotel.\n\nBe aware, there is no restaurant. The space which was formerly Limoncello is no longer part of the hotel and is now a gift shop, with an entrance from the street.\n\nBreakfast is now served in an area off the lobby, which is a wholly inadequate arrangement, furnished as it is, with very low arm chairs and sofas, so deep that it is impossible to sit up to the tables to eat the food comfortably. \n\nService was absolutely shambolic, with unprofessional, chaotic staff and apparently their equivalents in the kitchen. Nothing came promptly or without at least three requests, elements of the meal either didn't appear at all, were wrong or were so far apart that the items which initially appeared were stone cold by the time everything was united on the plate. All we could hear was a chorus of complaints from all the other diners. One man got up to cancel his pancakes which were so long in the cooking that he was in danger of missing his flight.\n\nIf we hadn't been hungry each morning and had breakfast as part of our package, this would have been entertaining, so extreme was it. The Keystone Cops come to catering. Each day we were treated to this spectacle to one degree or another.\n\nWe complained to the charming lady duty manager who was very apologetic (but interestingly did not appear surprised to hear what we were saying) and generously said that by way of compensation she would look at our room rate and make an adjustment.

Frigo Bar, accappatoi e ciabattine oltre ad asciugamani profumati (e non come quelli che spesso troviamo in certi Hotel anche a 4\/5* che emanano un odore sgradevole)! Una doccia fantastica con varie opzioni di getto d'acqua e poi una insonorizzazione giusta per la posizione, nessun rumore stradale (eravamo al 6\u00b0 piano), ma la veduta con ben 3 finestre \u00e8 favolosa. \nAhhhhh, forse una pecca l'ho ricordata (peraltro dimenticandomi di segnalarlo in reception, ma l'avrebbero risolta all'istante), ovvero il Phon aveva il filo elettrico troppo corto, pertanto era sovente che si staccasse dalla presa mentre ci si asciugava i capelli.... :-)))))).

Inoltre proprio a 2 passi dal The Michelangelo, ci sono posti favolosi per degustare colazioni ottime ed anche ad un prezzo ragionevolmente inferiore a quello dell'hotel (ovviamente.....).\nInsomma 11 notti piacevolmente trascorsi in un affascinante Hotel che con le su 5*Stelle, io e la mia famiglia siamo stati davvero benissimo e soddisfatti di ogni cosa.\nNon capita sempre che solo il giorno dopo si riceve in stanza la piacevole telefonata del manager dell'Hotel, il sig. Marco Gianni, che ti chiede se abbiamo dormito bene, se tutto apposto, se serve qualcosa oltre il disponibile, insomma essere al centro dell'attenzione per un ospite \u00e8 il massimo che si possa desiderare, a completamento di una pulizia giornaliera e trovare i letti preparati alla sera con cioccolatino e accappatoi sempre sostituiti anche sino al giorno prima della partenza.\nGrazie, infinitamente Grazie a tutti Voi, un affettuoso abbraccio al Sig Marco Gianni, alla superlativa Laura Baroncelli ed un ringraziamento anche a tutto lo staff con cui abbiamo avuto piacere di conoscere.\nSicuramente anche in altre citt\u00e0 cercher\u00f2 di trovare Hotel IAMSTAR.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I am in property management and very particular about where I will lay my head at night.  After researching literally hundreds of reviews of NYC hotels, we decided to give The Michelangelo Hotel a try.  We chose to take the airtrain from the airport and connected to the subway into the city and got off at the 7th ave stop.  The hotel was only two short blocks away.  We were greeted by the bellman who helped us get our luggage down the stairs and then at the front desk by Walter.  He was friendly and very welcoming.  I let him know we were only staying a short time but we were going to make it an experience while we were in New York.  He spoke with his manager and we were upgraded to the Grand Suite.  His kindness and generosity gave the service at The Michelangelo Hotel 5 stars in my book.  The hotel has an old world Italian feel which added character to our short stay.  When arriving to our room on the 7th floor, it felt like we were coming home to a NYC penthouse apartment.  The marble floors and Italian decor continued into the living room and hallway to our bedroom.  There were two nicely appointed bathrooms and the suite was very spacious at 800 sq. ft.  The linens were clean and comfortable, though there was some wear on the carpet simply from the age of the hotel, the accommodations were still very luxurious.  We went to the hotel lounge where the hotel bartender Gerard was equally as warm and friendly as the front desk staff.  He offered us cappuccino martinis as we were feeling slightly jet lagged and recommended several places for us to enjoy dinner and more NY experiences on our quick stay.  The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance to Times Square and the Theater district without being right in the middle of NYC chaos.  When we arrived back to our room, the bed was very comfortable and our suite was quiet and relaxing.  Having two restrooms in our suite was a plus!  We enjoyed our stay and I highly recommend The Michelangelo Hotel to other picky travelers like myself who like the luxury experience and first class accommodations.

The service has always been wonderful, but on my recent visit during the July 4th weekend, the service really stepped up when I needed some help.\n\nI had booked transportation from the airport to the hotel with the help of The Michelangelo's Concierge.  After I arrived and had been checked into my room, I was shocked to discover that my smart phone must have fallen out of my pocket at some point during the ride to the hotel.  I immediately went down to the lobby to inform the Concierge what had happened, since she had been the one who had booked the ride.  She immediately helped me out by contacting the transportation company and getting in touch with the driver, who indeed did find my phone in the back seat, and dropped it off at the front desk that evening before I was to attend my first performance on that trip.  I am grateful for the quick and immediate service she provided, and for being so helpful in getting my phone back so quickly.\n\nAs always, the rest of my stay was worry-free.  I was upgraded to a gorgeous and large suite, and being a regular at the hotel, so many people at the hotel seem to know me by name, and are genuinely happy to see me whenever I come back.  The Michelangelo also has a very quiet and intimate atmosphere that you just don't find very often in New York, and is always welcome to return to after a long day in the city.\n\nWhenever anyone I know is headed to Manhattan, I always tell them to try The Michelangelo.  I will be returning for another visit in December with a couple of my friends, and I look forward to not only returning, but to seeing their reaction as well. (One came with me last summer and loved it, the other is going to have their first experience.) Thank you again, Michelangelo staff, for your help and for another great stay!","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

Special Thanks to Walther and June","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-08-08","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This place exemplifies elegance and classic luxury. It has a very eclectic spirit, coupled with authentic Italian hospitality. The rooms are spacious, inviting, and not intimidating like some modern, chic luxury hotels can be at times. The crowd is older, professional, and classy. And so is the staff. They go out of their way, are patient, kind, and made my stay here memorable. \n\nCannot say one negative thing - these guys are some of the best. The lobby alone is quite the spectacle, is open, inviting, and screams class in a non-pretentious way. That is not an easy to pull off in NYC, kudos to the architect. \n\nSpecial thanks and shout out to Walther - He made my stay worth it, I will be coming back, and greeted me with steadfast service the moment I arrived. Also, thank you to June, who allowed for a much needed late checkout. These little things go a very, very long way.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

Ideally located just round the corner from times square. Hotel was really nice. Our room was massive the only down side was the window faced onto the next building so could not see anything. There was a gym which was included in the price. It was only small not much equipment. The staff were friendly. There was a shop two doors down Cafe Duke that was open 24\/7 this sold everything. We would go there for breakfast.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We have stayed there exclusively over the decades when we travel to New York City with very good reason: the hotel sparkles and is likely the cleanest and most comfortable we\u2019ve ever stayed in. The staff is welcoming and competent and treats each guest like royalty (which we are not.) Walther is a fixture at reception and we recently met Angel. They are so accommodating and gracious -ready to answer all questions and to make the stay fabulous. We met Ming at the front door, and he is amazing too! He was welcoming, funny and extremely helpful, whether suggesting where to pick up coffee or starting our morning off with a warm greeting. It makes so\nmuch of a difference. There is self parking a couple of doors down. Incredibly enough, rates are very competitive if you make reservations early and ask the hotel about special packages. This hotel is extraordinary!!!
