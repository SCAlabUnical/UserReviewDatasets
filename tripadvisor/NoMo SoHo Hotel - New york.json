Also there were no USB plugs, only regular plugs (which was frustrating because I only had one charging base and multiple things to charge) because I\u2019m so used to hotels having USB ports for charging. Just a few little things that were slightly inconvenient. But overall, great experience. ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

But honestly, I'm just done with it. This place used to be fantastic, great service and all, but now? Forget it. TERRIBLE!\n\nToday, on September 8th, 2023, at 12:46, I had the worst encounter with the lady at the front desk. She's like a professional misery distributor. Hates her job. Not accommodating, no social graces. No thank yous, no nothing. I\u2019m pretty sure her name is jazmin. \n\nAnd remember when they used to have those mini-bars in the rooms before Covid hit? Well, they pulled the plug on that too. 9\/10 times, you don\u2019t have one bottle of water in the room. One night, I came back after some drinks, parched as can be, and called down to the front desk for water. Guess what? They wouldn't bring it up; I had to trek down to get it myself. So, I started using Instacart just to keep myself hydrated during my stays.\n\nBut today, I'd had enough. When I called to book another night, the lady at the front desk told me, jazmin I believe is her name, in the rudest tone possible, that they were fully booked. Funny thing is, their website said otherwise. So I pointed it out and she then made up some bogus story about they don\u2019t have access to the rooms and insisted I book online, which I did. She then tells me I can\u2019t have the same room because it wasn\u2019t available. So I had to annoyingly pack all my belongings and I asked over the phone if a bellhop can move my things and she says yes but you have to come downstairs to check into your new room. I go down and she then tells me we don\u2019t have any bellhop available for a while, in her miserable rude condescending tone. I go back up to my room, realize there\u2019s no way I can move all of this on my own and call back down to tell her I would wait. She pauses and is silent, then in her crumby attitude says ok. \n\nI thought I'd be waiting forever, but then, out of nowhere, a bellhop shows up at my door just two minutes later. I mean, how can they be \"swamped\" and then magically appear that fast?\n\nHonestly, this place has so many issues, it's not even worth listing them all. I hope someone buys it, cleans house, and starts fresh. Especially that lady at the front desk; she's in the wrong line of work. I used to love it here, Jeffrey at the front desk is wonderful. He treats you like royalty, knows your name, and provided service like you were at the Ritz. Julian the bellhop is amazing! He\u2019s also awesome with restaurant recommendations and things to do around the city. I would love to talk to the owner of this hotel, it can be so much more than what it is. It\u2019s not a hotel, it\u2019s like you\u2019re staying at a hostel now. Such a shame. ","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I will start by saying we booked our room via my husband\u2019s iPrefer Rewards program. And I know some boutique hotels are not keen on travelers using membership\/reward programs, as it cuts into their bottom line. That said, we did expect the level of service and cleanliness we have experienced at other I Prefer Hotels. What was promoted as one of the premiere hotels in SoHo is nothing more than a 2-star hotel at best. \n\nI will admit the archway entrance is quite stunning, and the outdoor patio for the restaurant is gorgeous, but the rest of the hotel is showing its age. Our room was dated, banged up, and dirty. Our headboard was cracked with stains and wear. We had stains on our sheets. The caulk around the sink was cracked and moldy. The mirror was broken and chipped in multiple places. There was mold and mildew in the shower stall. The hair dryer was also cracked on the end. The pendant lights next to the bed was dusty, listing to the side, and we were so low my 6\u20195 husband hit his head each morning. We also believe there was mold or something wrong with the HVAC system, as each time the A\/C turned on, we both started to sneeze and cough.  I have attached pictures of some of these issues as a reference for others.\n\nI ate in the restaurant for lunch one afternoon. My lettuce leaves were brown and wilted. The salad dressing had been cut with water and was messy with little flavor. And my chicken was rubbery and undercooked.    \n\nExcept for a maid in the hallway and one bellman, we did not see anyone else from the hotel. We were never greeted or asked if we needed directions or help. \n\nIf we had not paid in advance for our room, I would have checked out immediately and never looked back.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Aside from my bed, the lobby is where i spent the majority of my time at the hotel.\n\nOn one occasion, my wife and son could not access our room because the key wouldn't work, again. Staff at front desk refused to give my wife and son a new key because they weren't listed on the reservation.\n\nInstead of a phone call, I had to leave a major work event (the reason I was in NYC) to get yet, another room key card. This was extremely irritating. Guess what!? I had to get another card the next time I accessed the room.\n\nThe room had the LARGEST cockroaches I have ever seen. Roaches on Roids. \n\nBeing on a tight schedule, it was frustrating not being able to get something as simple as coffee in the morning, because the concession area did not open on time 2 days in a row. Getting coffee at 7am at a 4 star hotel should never been an issue. Especially with the daily services charges guests incur. \n\nWorst of all, and why we will absolutely never come back is, I received a work-related-package and a staff member brought it to my door, with 1 quick and quiet knock, to subsequently open my door while my wife wasn't clothed was extremely bothersome and felt like a complete and utter invasion of privacy and should absolutely never happen.\n\nMy wife wanted to leave, but I insisted not to because I had enough work-related responsibilities during my visit. A new hotel and moving around is time consuming.\n\nI also overheard a staff member speaking of another staff member in a negative light, using descriptive phrases such as the skinny weird guy... I felt embarrassed just hearing it as a guest.\n\nAs a New York native, I was disappointed to have this experience and wish I chose a better hotel for my son's first time in NYC. We travel a lot, and this, is by far a top 3 worst hotel experience's.\n\nHopefully the management can take this disappointing, but much need review and seek to make some changes to enhance people's experience, at what could be a GREAT hotel.

This was a big mistake. Our room flooded and a lot of our belongings completely ruined. The worst was the apathetic attitude received from staff and management. We asked repeatedly to speak to the general manager as we were getting no where with the staff, not a single apology or refund for a major flood in our room. Apparently it was impossible to speak to Patrick, the general manager.  Not sure why, since If escalated, he should be willing to speak to an unhappy guest. We tried the next 5 days to get a hold of him in person or over the phone. His voicemail is full, he doesn\u2019t respond to email, and he is at all times not at the hotel to speak in person. We eventually gave up but to this day not a penny of a refund for our $500+ in damaged clothing and shoes or a refund for the flooded room we paid for. ","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our welcome on check in was disinterested verging on rude, not something we are used to from quality hotels.  The receptionist seemed to think one complimentary bottle of water on our first day was a great thing. Our room was a classic queen and small.  There is a small wordrobe and no drawer space so we could not put suitcases away.  We ate breakfast once, and it was fine but there is no concept of sutainability; even if you eat in you get paper cups, plastic cups for cereal and paper plates.  The mind boggles at the terrible waste of this.  This is the first hotel I have been to in years, where they do not give you the option of leaving towels on the rack to show you are happy to use them again, so our towels were changed every day..sustainability folks!  Climate change!  However checkout is what is leaving me in despair.  Again, a rude member of staff with a curt 'write your email, we'll send the bill shortly'.  12 HOURS LATER, an incredibly wrong bill arrived charging us for meals and drinks we did not take in the hotel.  Given we checked out at 6.30 AM and the cafe opens for breakfast at 7, I am keen for them to explain how we ate breakfast with them on our last day.  So far I am over $200 down due to their incompetence. It's all a bit too cool for school, with poor service, rude staff.  They booked us a car to the airport for a flat $85, we paid with $100 and the driver kept the change without us telling him to.\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There are no mini refrigerators or coffee pots in the rooms and there are no ice machines in the building. If you want ice, you have to go to the restaurant\/bar. If the bar isn't open, no ice. The first time I asked for ice at the bar, I got 3 cubes. I found this very unusual and probably my biggest frustration. That and breakfast. \n\nBreakfast does not open until 8:00. What??? Why?? A Breakfast credit was included in my reservation. It was super frustrating waiting until 8 to get coffee and food, and a big crowd  rushes in at 8:00, so getting food is a slow process. Pro move - Arrive early. \nGet seated first and order instantly. They don\u2019t offer to-go options for coffee or food. Also the online menu is completely different from the menu in the restaurant. \n\nThe bathroom is fairly open to the main room, so it is not super private. The shower didn\u2019t drain at all. \n\nI was offered a late checkout then locked out of the room twice. I spent 20 minutes each time waiting to get my key card reset.\nSigh. \n\nThere is no informational paperwork in the hotel room - how to order room service, what floors are things located on, restaurant hours, fire safety, how to use the TV etc. \n\nPros: The entire staff was very nice.

The concierge booked a wonderful driver to the airport ($85 to jfk) The hotel is in a safe area and I felt comfortable walking around at night, alone. The view from my room was lovely.

The rooms are starting to show their age. The shower grout needed attention, the safe handle was completely broken but did not affect the functionality of it, one of the outlets wasn't working and one light flickered like a strobe light if on for more than a few minutes. The headboard was peeling off, not just a little, a lot-really needs to be re-covered or replaced. It looks really bad. The room needs to be updated with USB outlets or something that can hold a USB outlet.\n\nThe lobby\/hotel smelled delightful and was decorated beautifully. My two sisters and I are sensitive to smells (causes migraines) but all three of us couldn't get over how nice it smelled. We were very impressed by how fast the service was. I requested 2 extra pillows and they were at the door in less than 5 minutes. We upgraded the room and it said it included a fridge but it wasn't in the room so when I requested it, same thing, it was there in 5 minutes and it was the COLDEST fridge. NEVER have I had a hotel fridge that worked so well. Check-out and check-in were easy. We didn't eat at the restaurant but I did have drinks at the bar and the service was good. We ordered room service one evening and the menu was a little disappointing. The food arrived hot in to go boxes but was nothing too exciting. I would not recommend room service to anyone. \n\nAll in all, we had a good experience. The cost was very reasonable. I just recommend trying to do a little updating to the rooms.

The rooms are clean, although we had clothes from the previous guest in the drawers, very easy to overlook by housekeeping so easily forgiven. Towels are changed daily but we had to remind housekeeping each morning there was three of us in order to get the right amount, again not a biggie but it slows you down from getting ready.\nNow the bad, not a great place for the international traveler, the place basically closes at 10pm so no food or drink available at all after that, and with no tea and coffee making facilities in the room or mini bar\/fridge the only option is to get a bottle of water from reception if you are thirsty or arrive late. Personally we had to drag ourselves round to Little Italy to get a late night bite after our journey which wasn\u2019t great and totally unexpected from a hotel that sells itself above budget. \nChecking in was a ruthless, emotionless affair, front desk is the first impression and this was not the best, I should mention that on day three we met Angie on reception and she is the best, cheery, professional, courteous, the whole nine yards. \nWe also had to go back to reception as the room wasn\u2019t made up for a family as we had booked, sorted reasonably quickly in fairness. It should also be noted that you have to give $150 a night deposit for sundries so if you are on a budget and here for a while then this needs to be taken into account, it\u2019s all in the booking conditions but should be mentioned as most people don\u2019t go to that detail. Handy though and probably the hotels plan to encourage the use of room service but trying to get through on the phone to room service is an experience and be prepared to be hung up on if they are busy. The room service food is really, really good however it comes in a takeaway box and not on a plate with no cutlery or salt\/pepper, napkins etc so best not to get the chicken as this comes with polenta and saut\u00e9ed veg, get a burger as this is easier to eat with your hands. Also and more frustrating is that we got the food in takeout boxes in a bag, no big deal but we got charged two tray charges for the one bag and the hotel helped themselves to a $15 tip, $27 to get takeaway sent to the room seems extortionate so be mindful that the money you leave as a deposit needs to be checked on departure, even though you have not actually been waited on you will pay a full tip, when this was questioned at reception I got a cold stare and we had to accept it. Buyer beware\u2026.  The $6 tray charge and tip of \u20ac6 for bringing water on the first day seemed cheap in comparison. \n\nThe showers aren\u2019t very user friendly so be prepared for a cold blast as you negotiate the taps, interestingly the shower window has no privacy glass, fine if you are an exhibitionist but if you don\u2019t want the neighbours in the next buildings to see you washing then pull down the semi opaque blinds.\n\nThe aircon in the room is noisy, needs a service and quite annoying at night, having a drink would help with the sleep but this needs to be done before ten\u2026\u2026\n\nIn summary, if you want your break to look amazing but not BE amazing then come to Nomo, if however you want excellent service and to feel that your destination goes above the bare minimum then maybe use one of the hundreds of other top hotels Manhattan has to offer. Sadly my next trip won\u2019t be here and it\u2019s such a shame as this place could be golden. A bit gutted to be honest as this was \u201cour\u201d NY hotel and I\u2019m hoping they improve as the location is really good and it feels like you are in New York and not the tourist area.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

You're surrounded by great restaurants and bars and also really close to Little Italy and Chinatown.  You're not right in the centre of Manhattan but with the hotel's proximity to Canal Street station and the express trains that stop there you can be in Midtown\/Times Square in 10-15 minutes.\n\nWe found the service to be fantastic. I sent an e-mail prior to arriving requesting a room on a high floor to fully appreciate the great views that the hotel affords, I also mentioned that we'd be celebrating an anniversary while we were there. When we got to the we were delighted to see that we'd been given a room on the 25th floor (photo of view attached) and there was also a hand-written card and some festive cookies left for us, it was a little touch that was greatly appreciated. During our first night my wife had a slight allergic rection to the feather pillows in the room, we popped to the front desk on our way out the next morning to ask them to be replaced and by the time we returned some new synthetic pillows had been put on the bed. The staff at the front desk were always really friendly and accommodating as were the night porters when we returned to the hotel every evening. \n\nWe stayed in a King Suite which at the time of booking was similarly priced to most regular hotel rooms in Manhattan, it was a great size and was always cleaned to a high standard. We also loved the Chromecast option on the TV's allowing you to stream Netflix, Amazon etc....from your phone.  As for the complaints about the lack of coffee making facilities, who comes to NYC to drink poor coffee in their room????, there's loads of amazing cafes literally on your doorstep.\n\nWe didn't eat in the restaurant, but the space looked amazing, and food smelled delicious whenever we walked through reception. \n\nOverall we had a great experience at NOMO SOHO and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again when we next return to NYC.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

AVOID!!!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-12-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I have stayed at this formerly excellent hotel at least ten times for multi-night stays in the last two years and while there are often small issues, we chose to stay there repeatedly because the staff was excellent and the location perfect. They are also a member of Preferred Hotels, which usually guarantees a nice stay.\n\n I\u2019m afraid the hotel must be having major fiscal issues because our three rooms I booked for last night were treated to the most abysmal customer service and problematic rooms I have ever experienced. It made a Motel 6 look like the St. Regis. \n\nI had booked three rooms: two King Suites (each for three people) and one Double Double Deluxe. I knew there would be a problem at check-in because our three person King Suites were the \u201c07\u201d rooms. Although all of the King Suites cost the same, there is a big difference between the \u201c01\u201d rooms (such as 2201) and \u201c07\u201d rooms. The living room area is significantly bigger in the 01 rooms, which allows them to accommodate three adults, whereas the 07 rooms can only accommodate two. \n\nThe reason for this is because the living room is so small in the 07 rooms, the couches cannot pull out without creating a fire hazard. I learned this first hand by being assigned one of these room in October or 2021 and the hotel website will not allow you to book three adults into that room type. When the couch is folded out, there is absolutely no floor space leading the bathroom or the exit door. \n\nNonetheless, we were booked into 1407 and 2107. As soon as I got the assignment, I explained it was going to be a problem. I told the front desk clerk that I have been in every room type at the hotel and I know these rooms cannot accommodate three adults. There was some consternation and Zeta, the Front Desk Manager made her first appearance as \u201cThe Worst Person to Ever Work in a Customer Service Position\u201d. \n\nIt is very important for anyone reading this to understand the following: the night before check-in, I got three separate emails (for each room) offering me upgraded room types for an upcharge. Furthermore, I had checked their website prior to starting a discussion about the room size to see what was currently listed as available. The Balcony King Suite, which has the larger footprint, and a balcony was available, in addition to other King Suites. \n\nZeta started the conversation by firmly stating, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, there are no other rooms. We are completely sold out.\u201d I pointed out that by law, we are not allowed to have three adults in the smaller room types. Apparently a glitch on the mobile site (or in the integration between their website and the Preferred Hotel booking site) booked the rooms with one person instead of three in each. Rather than acknowledging the likeliest reason for the mistake was a site glitch, Zeta repeatedly accused me of purposely booking it for one to save money. My previous experiences with the hotel booking site has been that the price is almost always the same, but if she had taken into consideration I never book one person into a room, she might have thought twice before accusing me of being too cheap to include the correct number of people. \n\nAfter telling me several times there were no other rooms available, Zeta took me to two other rooms that were available. One was the Queen Suite with the larger living room and the other was the Studio Balcony, which is a single room with one King bed. The latter was absolutely ridiculous as a suggestion because she knew we were traveling as three adults. We opted for the Queen Suite and despite that suite being less money per night than our original booking, she still charged us the higher rate (as evidenced by the invoice at check out. \n\nThe Double Double room was an even bigger issue. The room wasn\u2019t available at 4PM check in. In an effort not to be more of a problem, I said it was fine that it was still being cleaned. We would store our friends\u2019 luggage in our room. We checked again at 5 and the room was still not available. When we checked again at 6:00, the front desk clerk apologized and said that the hourly customer they had booked into that room hadn\u2019t left yet. Despite having already given us a terrible customer experience, Zeta made one of our rooms wait while an hourly customer did God-Knows-What in our room. When I complained that this was utterly unacceptable, she repeated the \u201cthe hotel is sold out\u201d line, despite having just shown us two rooms that were definitely available. I pointed out this out to her and she said, \u201cyou didn\u2019t pay for those room types. You can\u2019t have them.\u201d \n\nAs you can imagine, there was a very heated argument because of all of this. An allegedly luxury hotel doesn\u2019t book hourly rates, but more importantly, if they accidentally double book, they should do whatever they can to accommodate the mistake, not insult the customer. \n\nBecause that is what Zeta did. Zeta insulted me. She also took several steps back from the counter, crossed her arms and stared at me for several minutes. When I didn\u2019t say anything, she said, \u201cAre you done?\u201d In the most condescending way possible. \n\nThis kind of behavior went on for some time. Whenever I asked who her direct supervisor was, she said he was on vacation. I found out later that it was someone named \u201cPatrick\u201d and he would be gone for two weeks. I was told by Zeta that a different manager would be available in the morning. When my husband and I walked to the front desk this morning, Zeta was standing there, smirking at us. There was no one to talk to us. We could call Patrick in two week. It wasn\u2019t until the very uncomfortable front desk representative finally pointed out that Sara, the Rooms Director, was in-house, that Zeta went to go get her. The entire time we were talking to Sara, Zeta stood at the front desk, ignoring other customers, and stared, smirking at us. Sara promised to contact us as to how to resolve the situation, although we still haven\u2019t heard anything. \n\nIn addition to the insulting way in which Zeta treated my entire party, the hotel is beginning to fall apart. The hourly rate is a bad sign, but so was the faucet handle that came off in room 1110. There were no glasses in 509 and the outlet connected to one of the metal side tables was detached, causing the table to \u201chum\u201d with electricity. One of the bathroom light bulbs were out. On our last visit two weeks ago, the sink and shower ledge in 2201 were FILTHY. You could scrape the dirt off of both with your finger nail, which made it obvious it had not been cleaned properly. It\u2019s almost not worth mentioning that the Preferred Hotel Elite status perks were completely ignored in all three rooms. \n\nThese rooms were $460 per night. I paid $460 per night, pre-tax, for three problematic rooms and have Zeta treat me like a vagrant who walked in off of the street. My guess is that a better manager was let go to save money and Zeta was hired based on her experience at a Super 8 motel. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame. I used to love this hotel and happily recommended it to many friends. I am telling you that you should avoid it like the plague. I am going to have to contact my credit card company about refuting the charges based on their refusal to provide the service they promised as a part of the booking contract. Customer loyalty is means nothing. You hard earned money means nothing. Book somewhere else.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I came back for a business trip with my husband for a full week and am quite disappointed at this hotel that we chose. \n\nThis hotel has the bare minimum. The rooms do not have refrigerators or coffee makers. We don't have glasses to use to get some water from the tap. We only get two flat pillows on our bed, which I'm pretty sure is a full size bed. The bed is hard as a rock also. \n\nDuring my stay here there's a power outage where there was no electricity or air conditioning for at least seven to eight hours. We were offered two free bottles of water. You are supposed to, as a part of the $40 a day fee you are charged, get free bottles of water each day and also a $15 credit to be used in the hotel. We do not receive the free bottle of water everyday in our room and I have no idea how to use the credit. I'm going to find out today when I go to the front desk. This $40 fee is unnecessary as I don't plan on using the gym. The fee apparently covers the gym, the free waters daily, the 15-dollar daily credit, and a bunch of things to watch on the tv. It doesn't even cover the advanced version of their internet service whatever that is. When you log on to the Wi-Fi you have an option of complimentary or to upgrade at a price.\n\nThe carpet in the hotel room is the kind that always looks dirty as well. When I arrived I had a chair at a desk that was covered in stands and somebody else's hair. I sent the chair back and told them I didn't want it in the room. My room door lock also doesn't work correctly is I have to put my card in multiple times to get it to register and turn green. Tonight there's a karaoke bar across the street that kept me up for hours. I know the hotel can't do anything about that but if you do come here ask to get a room that faces Crosby Street to avoid having to listen to that.\n\nBesides all this I would say that all of the staff is really really nice. Everyone was super gracious at answering all the questions I had and attending to all the requests I had for the chair to be removed, more pillows, assistance with helping to get my phone and my air conditioning back up and running after the power outage etc.\n\nI definitely wouldn't stay here again though. I know it's New York City and you're not supposed to spend a lot of time in your room but for somebody that's coming for work perhaps you might spend time in your room. You might want to have a coffee in the morning while getting ready before leaving the room. My suggestion would be to get rid of this arm chair that they have there and put a Nespresso coffee station, add a refrigerator below the sink as there's a slot for one with a fan and ventilation and everything, take care of some paint touch-ups that need to happen, sure that needs to be replaced when it needs to be replaced and put the Free bottles of water in the room each day when it's cleaned. Lastly I would say be really transparent about the $15 credit and how you go about getting that daily.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This was a single night stay after a birthday celebration.  Upon arrival, you walk through the pretty greenery-covered-fairy-light-lit canopy and breathe in the sweet scent of flowers (or the hotel-version of rohyphol).  Neon lights point to the guest reception desk which was one flight up.  The staff was friendly but appeared frazzled due to a technology issue which disabled their ability to check-in electronically and create room keys.  We were informed of the $15 hotel credit during the \"duration of our stay\".  We were escorted to our room on the 23rd floor by a manager and were told to return a few minutes later to receive our keys.  \n\nThe view from the room was breathtaking.  We prepped quickly to go out for the evening as we were already running late.  As we exited the hotel, keys were still not available so we resumed our evening plans.  When we returned to the hotel at a quarter to midnight, there was no one at reception.  A couple of other guests were also waiting.  Keys were still unavailable and this time we were told to go up to our floor and wait for someone to open our room.  A hotel staff was on the elevator with us going to a different floor and told us that he had been running up and down for the past 3 hours.  We were finally able to access our room after waiting for 10 mins.  We were tired and my partner fell asleep while I got ready for a shower.  This was when the saga began...\n\nI found a pair of yoga shorts draped atop of the sink along with 2 bottles of water.  I assumed the shorts belonged to the previous guest and those bottles came from the fitness center because there was not a single bottle of water, nor a cup (plastic or glass) to be found in the room.  I turned on the shower and within a few minutes the drain began to overflow and nearly flooded over the 3-inch lip of the shower stall.  Needless to say, there was no shower to be had for me on this night.  It was too late to call the front desk because it was nearly 1 am by this time and I just wanted to go to sleep.  I wished I hadn't discovered the horror that was the shower drain in the morning.  There was so much hair that was clogged and VISIBLE in the drain that I threw up a little in my mouth.  But the saga continues... \n\nA bill was slipped under our door for the hotel fee of $40 for the use of their amenities.  We booked this stay through a travel booking site and everything was paid for in-full at the time of booking.  We were bewildered by the $40 fee at this establishment, because other than the use of their fitness center, WiFi, and ChromeCast-enabled TV, we were unsure what other amenities were available to us.  We are not first-time travelers so understand that some hotels will add an additional resort fee; however, most of these other hotels provide at least some if not all of the following: WiFi, plastic\/glass cups, coffee\/coffee-maker, refrigerator, more than 2 pillows, mini-bar, etc.  When we approached the reception desk to inform them of what transpired the night before and to see about how to utilize our $15 hotel credit, we were asked why we did not inform them last night and were told that we are not allowed to use the hotel credit since we were checking out on this day.  I asked her to clarify what \"duration of stay\" means since it was 10:45 am and we were planning on having breakfast at the hotel restaurant and checking out by 12 pm.  We were informed that we had to use it during the \"last night of stay\".  This information was misrepresented and would have been helpful at time of check-in. We were told by the hotel staff at the front desk to have our breakfast at the hotel restaurant and charge it to our room where adjustments can then be made.  To add more salt to the wound, keys were still unavailable.\n\nNoMo Kitchen is yet another Instaworthy space.  The same sentiments hold true as the hotel itself.  After we were shown to our seats, we were not greeted by a single staff member.  The space was large and at this time of the morning only occupied by a few tables. We were not provided with water or offered coffee.  No one even made eye contact with us.  After about 10 minutes, we were finally able to get the attention of our server who somehow made us feel as though we were interrupting him from something important.  The food left much to be desired.  I did not recognize the French toast I ordered and could not identify the cr\u00e8me fraiche that had congealed into globs on my plate.  My partner needed a mimosa to get him through his meal.  Our server was completely inattentive and again we had to get up to find him in order to get our check.\n\nUpon returning to the reception desk, we were informed that keys were finally available.  In addition, they absorbed the resort fee plus breakfast.  While we appreciated that NoMo provided compensation for our inconveniences, I would never stay at NoMo again nor recommend anyone to stay here, which is a shame because I love my city and SoHo is one of my favorite areas.  \n\nNoMo is not worthy enough to earn 4-stars \u2013 its feel is akin to a more upscale version of a motel or hostel.  Highgate Hospitality & Management needs to do a better job at managing its properties and training its employees.  In reading other guest reviews, the technology issue with the room keys is not something new. Others have also experienced similar issues or worse as us during their stays.  Hospitality is more than just banking on the perfect location or using NFT packages to attract your patrons - you can and should do so much better.  Incredibly disappointed by this experience and would also hesitate to stay at another Highgate held subsidiary.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Apparently included in these amenity\u2019s you get the morning tea and coffee and various other things like room service (which you would expect would be in the price). One thing it apparently included which again we only found out on check out was a $15 voucher at the hotel downstairs each day which would have been great to know that at the start as we used the bar many times and paid cash each time as we didn\u2019t want to run up a room bill, which ended up being over $300 after amenity\u2019s and also room tax.\n\nDon\u2019t get blinded by the photos for this hotel, it won\u2019t be as it seems when you get there.\n\nAs for good points, the downstairs restaurant is lovely and the staff there also are great but it seems like something run completely seperate to the hotel.

Brooklyn bridge also only a 15 minute walk.\n\nWith better hotel staff and more communication this place might be a 4 star but needs a lot of updating in hallways and rooms to be anything near a 5 star like British airways stated.\n\nAnd also to make people more aware of the amenity bill, it just leaves a really sour taste in your mouth if you don\u2019t know anything about it until check out. British airways should also advertise a lot more about amenity tax too","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Felt like a hotel that tried to be funky and on-trend, but really fell short. Staff during my stay seemed to be practically non-existent.\n\nThe thing that really brought this review down from a 3 to 1-star was that my company booked this hotel for me for a business trip. Upon checking in they asked for a credit card, as most hotels do as a hold before handing over the room key. When giving them my personal card (I didn't have a company card), I was not told that that was the card they put the whole booking on. That might be something you'd want to tell your guests... especially if the card you use for booking doesn't match the card given.\n\nIt wasn't until after I left New York, that I realized the $1,000 charge had been made to my card, significantly running up my utilization rate.\n\nWhen I called the hotel to share this feedback, the hotel receptionist seemed completely unbothered. Didn't even mention I'm sorry. From someone who has worked in consumer service in the past, the receptionist's nonchalant response left me feeling very taken aback and unsettled.  \n\nI've stayed in many hotels during my lifetime but this was by far the worst experience.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The service concerns started as soon as we landed in New York. When we were in transit from the airport to the hotel, I called the hotel restaurant, Nomo Kitchen, to order a pizza for us to pick up when we arrived to check in because we were starving from traveling all day. When we checked in I let the front desk know that we ordered food and asked where to pick it up, she stated that she would call down to the restaurant and have it sent to the room. We were STARVING and some time went by and our food had not arrived, I called down to the restaurant and the woman that answered the phone who stated \u201cif someone called I would be the one to answer because I\u2019m the only on with the phone\u201d had then mentioned that no one called down to request our food be sent up to the room, I then gave her our room number for the pizza to be sent, and still, the food never made it to the room, we were in the room for hours getting ready and planning the rest of the day so we would have been there if it arrived. The next day I went to the front desk to make sure the charge of the food was not on my room and the woman at the front desk said \u201cno, I show them charge was removed\u201d so this tells me, someone realized my food never made it to us, removed the charge, and never contacted us. Not to mention this girl at the front desk never apologized! Secondly, the air conditioner was not working in our room and we were staying on the 23rd floor, it was beyond hot in there. When I asked for them to send someone up to look at it they did and they did fix it. Lastly, which is probably the thing I\u2019m most frustrated about, I purchased A LOT  of dessert to celebrate my friends birthday and put it in the fridge, days later when we went to enjoy it, I took a bite and realized it went bad. The fridge was not working or plugged in. So our dessert from the famous bakery Dominique Ansel was warm and melted as well as all of our leftover food from the weekend. Hundreds of dollars of leftovers went bad. For the price I paid for this hotel for the weekend I would expect A LOT more. The aesthetic of the hotel is not worth the experience, I\u2019m very disappointed.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The subway is nearby, lots of shops and restaurants and easy to get everywhere in the city. The rooms are bright and pretty. All rooms in NYC are tiny, and they made theirs feel airy and spacious -  I was in 1411 and there were large East-facing windows with great views of the neighborhood, the desk was an \"island\" in the middle, sink separate from bath, decent closet space and under bed drawers. The front of the hotel is a restaurant which looks like a green house and garden. I enjoyed a drink at the bar (a post-vax celebration!) - they gave a $15 credit which covered part of a glass of wine. (the $40 \"resort fee\" is frustrating, but pretty standard in NYC). The coffee shop was not open so I went around the corner to Smile which is cute. There is also a Starbucks around the corner. The down sides were minimal, but I will share because these review websites demand details :) THe front entrance is a popular selfie spot and I often had to walk around all of the phototaking tourists.

Families stayed on 4th, 5th, 18th, 20th and 24th floor, and ranged from two double beds to a King room, so our experience isn't limited to one room\/floor. \n\nPros: \n- Great location in Soho, within walking distance of Little Italy, Chinatown, and subway stations.\n- Rooms were contemporary design-basically all white with a lagoon blue ceiling. They were cleaned well each day. \n- Hotel felt clean and artwork in lobby was fun. \n- If you are on an upper floor, the views are amazing. If you are on lower floors, your views are old, crappy buildings.\n- room 1812 had great AC\n\nCons: \n - No insulation between rooms. None. We stayed in room 1812, which happened to have an adjoining room and you could hear EVERY SINGLE WORD from our next door neighbors. There was simply zero privacy when your next door neighbor was in residence. One of our families had a baby next door to them, a third had a yappy dog, etc. If you like quiet, this is not the hotel for you.\n - no coffee pot in the room. The coffee bar in the lobby is only open from 7 am - 12 pm and it's $4-6 per very small cup of java.\n - The entrance is an Instagram hotspot. We crashed more 16-year-old photo shoots than any one person should be allowed to. It's a beautiful entrance, but when you are trying to get in or out of the hotel in a hurry, it's not happening. \n- you are charged $40\/day \"entertainment fee\", with a $15 daily credit to use at the hotel coffee bar or restaurant. Cocktails at the restaurant are around $19, and are very small. You are also supposed to get two complimentary bottles of water in your room upon arrival (part of the $40 fee), but all 5 of our families had to ask for the water.\n- two pillows per room. You can ask for more, but when we did, they had run out of extra pillows. \n - exercise room is a dungeon - no windows, black walls, minimal lighting. Five cardio machines in the room, two of which were \"under repair\". All had TV's on the machine and none worked. \n- room 413, 512, 2009 all had terrible AC. The rooms never got below 74 degrees, even when they changed the thermostats to the 60's. \n\nIf none of the cons bother you, then this is the hotel for you. As I mentioned, the location is wonderful. For all five of our families, the cons outweigh the pros and we will look for a different hotel for our next stay.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

The restaurant was at 50% and there were lots of plants shielding tables. The service was very good and I enjoyed a quiet and delicious meal.  Julian was very helpful with my bags and giving me directions to lots of places.  I will definitely stay there again.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Long story short. She is very understanding during this covid time and super accommodating. I asked her for her card and told her that I want to write her a review and hope that she will be promoted to a bigger job so she can train the all the staff to be like her.

No one came, so I went back to the reception desk and asked for assistance. What makes matters worse, the maintenance worker that was sent to check on the door stated the front desk staff knew the door was broken. Why check us in, without notifying us (checked in by male receptionist). The lady receptionist was trying to accommodate but the manager who could not place us in a so-called VIP room.

I recently stayed here for one night with my significant other over Valentine's Day weekend for a fun staycation as we both live in the city. The hotel itself was beautiful, the room was clean, and we had a great view of the city. Unfortunately, the service was far from enjoyable and quite frankly unprofessional.\n\nSunday morning, we were awoken by someone trying to intrude into our room without any warning. There was no knock and they used a key to open the door. Luckily, we had the top lock on so they were unable to enter the room. Shortly after, we received a call from the front desk asking if we were still in the room. We said yes, and then were informed that it was security who had tried to come in. Confused as to why security would be entering our room while we were asleep in the first place, we asked, and were informed that the hotel's system said we were checked out. So, instead of knocking or simply calling our room first to confirm if we were still there, security chose to attempt to sneak into our room without making themselves known. It is incredibly unprofessional and quite honestly frightening that hotel staff would try to enter your room unannounced while you are asleep. A hotel should be responsible to some degree to ensure the safety of their guests, and that has seriously been called into question if you employ security that attempts to barge into a guest's room without simply knocking first.\n\nWe then decided to order room service, as it was still Valentine's Day weekend and we wanted to salvage what was left of our stay. After an hour of waiting, our food finally arrived. However, the coffee we ordered was spilt all over the meals and we were missing several pieces to our order. We contacted the front desk and they informed us that the restaurant manager would be coming up to our room to inspect our order. After opening both boxes of food to ensure we were not trying to pull a fast one on them (despite the bag blatantly dripping the spilt coffee on the floor) the restaurant manager stated he will take it back down and have our order remade. However, he stated it was going to take at least another 45 minutes.\n\nAt checkout they informed us that they would be waiving the $45.90  resort fee due to the inconvenience (but not the bill for our food). Unfortunately, after leaving and checking our credit card statement, we were still charged the $45.90 resort fee.\n\nI have stayed in many hotels and have never had an experience like this. We came into this expecting a fun and romantic evening, with reasonable expectations of NoMo SoHo (ie, feeling secure in your room without strangers attempting to enter unannounced while you are sleeping and eating food without coffee spilled all over it), but this was apparently too high of a bar for them to meet. I cannot say I would return after this, especially due to the lack of empathy or concern the staff seemed to have when we brought up these issues during the stay. This is New York, there are plenty of hotels for the same, if not cheaper price, that I would recommend over this establishment. Look around and find somewhere else.","travelDate":"2021-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We never received it. We never received any type of congratulations. The next morning we tried to order room service and for about 10 minutes of calling \u201croom service\u201d and \u201cfront desk\u201d, we were not able to reach someone. Eventually, we reached someone but our breakfast sandwich and coffee took an hour to get delivered.

From the atmosphere, to the rooms, to the dining options at the hotel and nearby, this hotel is a true gem. \n\nI would highly recommend this hotel Under normal circumstances, And amid the current pandemic, I think the hotel has gone above and beyond to be a super clean and stunning home away from home. Whether you're visiting the city for vacation\nor just doing a staycation. Here are a few reasons why I love this hotel.\n\nThe service: during each of my stays, but particularly my most recent stay, I've been impressed with the hotel's team - they are truly five star, The hotel service has been phenomenal. I recently encountered one of the hotel managers Tenzin Basnet,  He went above and beyond to ensure my stay with my newborn baby and husband  was comfortable and enjoyable. We felt we were in great hands and an unforeseen issue with one of the rooms we had booked was seamlessly taken care of, putting us at ease. We had such a great time we even extended our stay an additional day.  We enjoyed breakfast vouchers - breakfast and coffee arrived at our room hot and delicious.\n\nThe rooms: I have stayed in different room types around the hotel - all are lovely. Base your stay on what you need.  I\u2019ve stayed in a standard king, the Crosby suite, and one of the suites on the higher floors. Each room was impeccably decorated, including all the essentials and some cozy items like a bathrobe for maximum lounging. It was really great to have Chromecast in the rooms so we could log into our streaming services. It was like an upgraded version of our home experience. If you can, I highly recommend splurging on a room with a terrace so you can enjoy some private time outside and an incredible view. \n\nThe location\/vibe: this hotel is flanked by the best neighborhoods in New York City for dining, shopping, art, culture\u2014 good vibes all around. There are so many cute shops and boutiques that are open, and you basically get a private shopping experience if you go during a week day. If you were coming from out of town it\u2019s super easy to get a cab. If you\u2019re driving in, it is possible to park in a nearby garage or street side. I think it says a lot that I stayed at this hotel as a treat for 30th birthday party, but also with my growing family! It's really versatile.\n\nThanks NoMo and especially Tenzin for an incredible stay!","travelDate":"2020-10","tripType":"NONE"}

After standing around in reception we were advised to use elevator to go up a floor. Check in was quick and easy. Room was compact but very nice decor and clean and comfy bed. We had a great stay until we had to check out when we found a hidden extra $45.90 per day per room which BA or check in staff failed to advise when we purchased the package and checked in, the fee which seems totally excessive when there is no turn down service, no real concierge or help in main reception. The few times I had asked for information regarding a day trip to shopping outlet I was made to feel a inconvenience by the front desk, and all I got was a fairly short response. Also not sure if they have smoke detectors in room but to be woken up by a pungent smell of weed 2 days running it seems not. If there wasn\u2019t the high amenity fee I would have given a better review but the amenity fee for the lack of hospitality we received really spoilt our trip ","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location in the middle of Soho is simply top. I love this area with its shops, bars and restaurants. The entrance area of the hotel is beautifully designed. To get to the reception you take the elevator to the first floor. Contrary to other reports I found the staff in the lobby and at the reception very friendly and helpful - ok, from time to time I was sent back and forth between the concierge in the lobby and the reception if I had any questions. My room Deluxe King on the 21 floor had a beautiful view towards Lower Manhattan, and the furnishings were a combination of coolness and elegance. The room also had all other amenities and plenty of storage space.  The bed was very comfortable, shower and bath had enough space.  The free evening aperitif with various wines was very well appreciated by the hotel guests. The ideal moment to get to know people and make contacts. (if you are looking for peace and quiet, the lobby is not an ideal place at this time of the day. \n\nNomo Kitchen is the hotel's own restaurant. Here I had lunch once. The location is super cool in a kind of winter garden. As a solo traveller I love to eat at the bar. This was no problem here. The small but nice lunch menu offers something for every taste. Also the drinks and cocktail menu invites to stay.\n\nMy conclusion:\nI would recommend the Nomo Soho to everybody who does not like the typical traditional 5 star service although there is a lot offered here. Surely I will return.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Here are the issues:  Payed full price for a room that was 200 square feet,  about the size of a prison cell.  The color is sterile white with an odd bizarre ultra blue hue.  The room was clean,  it's best amenity.  Only one small metal chair with small and tiny 18\" x 24\" metal counter with a box of extremely high priced offerings for sale including a \"sex kit complete with condoms, feather tickler(?), vibrator and lubrication, $10 bottle of water, Jascques Torres chocolates,  wine, etc.   You almost had to turn sideways to walk around the bed without hitting the TV mounted on the wall at the foot of the bed.  The bathroom, was slightly larger than a toilet stall you would see at an airport crammed with toilet and shower.  Toilet paper was one grade softer than sandpaper held in a vertical holder glued to the tank behind you in which you had to take off and use like you would in an outhouse setting.  A small towel holder above the toilet was the only storage for towel, no hooks or anything else beside the toilet to set your towels.  The shower head was located at about 7 feet and you had no choice but to stand under it when you turned it on adjusting the ice cold water waiting to warm.  The drain was completely clogged when I took a shower and the water flooded the room, in which I had to take the two towels I had to soak up the water.  I went to the front desk to complain and ask them to fix it,  the girl at the desk said it would be taken care of.  The following day,  I called the front desk to ask if it was fixed and was assured it was as I needed to get washed and out for a meeting.   When I was taking a shower,  the water filled the 3\" basin and overflowed again,  flooding the room.  They sent a maintenance man up who was not too happy.  He tried to clear it with a can of propellant which didn't work,  then had to get a drain \"snake\".  After 45 minutes, he unclogged the drain.  I was an hour late for my meeting.  The heating unit kicks on and off throughout the night with a loud humming sound if you'er a light sleeper.  You can hear your neighbors shower running and tinkle sounds which you can assume what they were doing.   I am happy to say the bed was clean and comfortable.  There are two night stands on either side about 12\" x 12\",  only enough room to set your glasses and cell phone.  no clock in the room.  They offer coffee in the morning, two pots that were empty and a line of guests waiting for 20 minutes for them to be refilled, at 8am.  I was one of them and people were not happy about this.  After all this,  a nice surprise sheet of paper left under my door the morning of departure for \"Amenities\" charges,  $90!  When asked what it was for,  they said it was for the \"free wine tasing, coffee, and other offerings that nobody ever uses or knows about.   I complained to the manager on duty about the flooding.

We were very excited to stay at this hotel in a part of the city we'd never explored before, but our experience at this hotel was less than extraordinary. We arrived in late on Thursday night and were told we could grab some food from either room service or the restaurant before 11 pm. We went down to the restaurant at 10:40 and were rudely told by an unfriendly hostess that the kitchen was closed, when we explained our situation (that we had been traveling all day, had not eaten and were staying at the hotel) she was unhelpful and did not seem to care.So we went back upstairs, told the front desk and they did nothing to help. Called room service a few minutes later and no one answered. Not the best customer service nor first impression. \n\nThe room itself was quite small for being a 'deluxe' there was barely enough room to walk around the beds. If you are ok with being in a tight space and paying over $250 a night for a room then you'll enjoy it. I don't think it was worth the cost just for the location. That was a plus, but the overall room itself was lacking - there were no glasses, not even a glass for water, and not even a soap dish for the bathroom sink. These are simple things to expect for the cost. Overall very underwhelming.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I have been very satisfied with the level of service from their excellent staff and the location of the hotel is outstanding with only short walks required to reach Little Italy, Chinatown, Soho, and Tribeca. Since the Subway entrances are nearby, travel to other areas of the city is easy. Also, my hotel rooms have always been clean, comfortable, and quiet. The price of each of those rooms was reasonable until my most recent visit revealed an item had been added to my bill which was non-negotiable. Apparently, the management of this hotel has decided to hide the true cost of a room by adding an \u201camenity fee\u201d of $40 per day. When I questioned this additional cost, I was presented with a list of \u201camenities\u201d which I never used and never would use. Again, there was no option to reject these \u201camenities\u201d and they were subject to city and state taxes totaling $5.90 per day. If the management of this hotel needs to raise the rates of their rooms by $45.90 per day, I would encourage them to do it honorably and publish their room rates accordingly. As a formally loyal customer, I feel betrayed and victimized by this shoddy and greedy business practice.

Great position in Soho with a quirky feel to it. \nBUT BEWARE\nthere is a resort\/amenities fee of $40 PER NIGHT on top of the room rate. It is stated but in small print. This charge entitles you to a room safe? And free Wifi? Also a newspaper in the foyer, water and fruit as long as you are up to get it before 9am. Use of the fitness room and a turn down service but you have to request it. They do provide bottled water on your first day. Now the big thing if you\u2019re a wine drinker is the free wine between 5pm and 6pm. Red and white and some nights Prosecco. Maybe the $40 a night is worth it if you\u2019re a big drinker and you\u2019re in the hotel at that time!! My other gripe is that there is no tea or coffee making facilities in your room. Apparently due to health and safety. (There is an iron in the room? ) included in the $40 per night is free tea and coffee in the foyer between 6am and 10am. So my husband gets dressed to go down 18floors to get our drinks. He scolds himself on the way back as the cups are so hot and spills some when trying to press the floor button in the lift.

He redally helped make our stay there special.\nThe only negative I have is that there was a bellman working there that was a bit on the creepy side.  He was older with dark hair, and he made us feel a bit uncomfortable by injecting himself into our conversation. Maybe he was trying to compliment us, but the way he was doing it made us feel he was a bit of a perv, and we didn't feel comfortable leaving our bags with him so we waited for the other guy who was very friendly.

We had stayed at Nomo Soho (when it was still called the Mondarian) several years ago during the Christmas holiday season and really enjoyed our experience so we decided to give it another try. Upon our arrival, we were delighted to see the hotel was just as beautiful as we had remembered it. When we got up to the lobby (1 floor up from ground level via elevator) we were introduced to the Front Office Mgr - who checked us into our room. He was great and was attentive and sympathetic in hearing our frustrations over the weekend. He gave us an unexpected room upgrade which was probably one of the only highlights of our trip. \n\nNot only was the room outstanding providing unbelievable\/unbeatable views of the cityscape but the hotel service was top shelf in all facets. We were thrilled with our in-room dining experience and the food was off the charts. Thank you again Tenzin Basnet and the Nomo Soho staff for your collective understanding, kindness and generosity during a frustrating time, it is greatly appreciated. \n\nWe will certainly return to this hotel when we return to the Big Apple!","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This additional night made the prices for the other four nights jump up for a total of $350 more than they had been two weeks previously. The reservation rep said that their system could only use whatever prices were currently in the algorithm, and if I wanted to negotiate the price back down I'd have to call the front desk. So the next day I did just that, and got a very nice woman who explained the same situation but said she had no power to change the prices back to what I'd originally booked, only the reservations manager (or a similar title) could do that. She took my info and said that that person would call me the next day. A week later, no one has called, and needless to say, I cancelled the reservation altogether. So instead of adding a night because I wanted to stay there LONGER, I dropped the whole reservation because their IT system, in 2019, can't handle looking up the price for a two-week-old reservation??? Or are they hoping people won't notice a $350 upcharge? I stayed here a few years ago and thought it was lovely, but now I feel like they were scamming.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

As I walked toward the front door, there were two young men on staff (perhaps bellhops?) that were leering at all of the young women that went by making comments. Yeep.\n\nWhen I attempted to re-enter my room upon my return, the keys no longer worked. So I went back down to get them reactivated (no explanation re: what happened and as I walked to the desk, I overheard one of the women complaining loudly about another hotel guest).\n\nBack to my room with keys that work, there's a pretty bad downpour outside that warrants a mobile weather alert. I hear a strange sound of water coming down hard close by and thought it may be outside, but quickly realized it was in MY BATHROOM SHOWER where the ceiling was peeling and bubbling).\n\nSitting back down on my bed, pouring an extra inch of wine into my dusty glass provided by this fine establishment, I pray the ceiling doesn't cave in during the night, waking me to the point of not being able to get back to sleep (early meetings you know?)\n\nCompletely resigned, I finally slip into bed only to discover no top sheet has been provided which is pretty gross.\n\nSome level of refreshed, I wake up to enjoy the coffee I'd brought as they do not have a coffee maker in the room. As I shifted around, I spotted a massive YELLOW stain on the pillow I just had my head on. Wowza.\n\nThis all in all was a pretty gross experience but I tried to have a good attitude about it.\n\nOne thing I did not note, was there was a loud child\/mother fight going on in the hall\/in a room with the door open for a good part of 3 hours.

With typical NYC rooms being on the very small size we opted for a suite. That being said the design for the bathroom is a HUGE problem if your a gal. First and foremost there is no privacy. The bathroom sink and mini fridge are one unit. The bathroom sink is the size\/depth of a \u201cdog bowl\u201d located on a very small counter with one light located off to the side. Very hard to put on makeup! The bathroom is apart of the sitting room area across from the desk beside the entrance door. The toilet and shower are in separate room with a feature picture window with a roll down shade if you don\u2019t want to share your shower time with the building next door. While we have stayed in many new concept rooms this by far was the most inconvenient bathrooms concepts that we have experienced in a hotel. If your staying on your own it may not be a big deal but as a couple it\u2019s may be a big problem. Again there is NO privacy. On the bedroom front it\u2019s very tight with a king size bed but it\u2019s workable. The bed was very comfortable which was the saving grace. The TV in the sitting room didn\u2019t get any of the main tv channels on Saturday after midnight. The next morning all was fine. And finally the sink drained ever so slowly. We reported to the front desk upon checkout. The restaurant with it\u2019s green house glass ceiling and beautiful chandeliers was definitely a high light. The food was delicious. We had breakfast\/brunch there every morning. The service was good once the service team discovered we were seated in their section.  The location is a couple blocks from \u201cLittle Italy\u201d and around the corner from some wonderful shopping experiences.

Given 24th floor during check in.  What a window and what a view.  \n\nLove the layout of the suite.  Extremely spacious.  The sofa becomes a sofa bed that can comfortably sleep 2 people.  Wide enough, but more importantly, comfortable and not saggy.  There is a work desk and big tv.  A sliding door separates the living from from the bedroom.  Bedroom equally spacious with a comfortable bed.  Bathroom is next to the bedroom.  Sink area is outside the shower\/toilet area, making it more practical.  Not drawers to put out clothes so we lived out of a suitcase.\n\nHousekeeping does a stellar job cleaning.  Generous with toiletries.  Folded some of our tshirts and lined up our toiletry bottles too!\n\nExtremely friendly service from everybody I came across with.  \n\nLocation turned out to be great.  Of course, all the shopping is just a stone's throw away.  But Canal Street Station is so close and can take you anwhere.  The staion might look dingy, but so many train lines cross it.  So easy to get anywhere from Canal Street.    \n\nMy only complaint is that the air conditioning compressor makes a loud vibrating noise (like a refrigerator).  If you are not sensitive to this, then don't worry about it.  \n\nHighly recommend this hotel should you want to stay in the Soho area.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Highly Recommended!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-07-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Had a short 2 night getaway to the city with a family of 4 (4 and 7yr old).  At first was a bit weary of booking this hotel or any Soho hotel for that matter because of concerns of room condition (cleanliness) and size.  However once we opened the door I was very very happy.  \n\nThe booking process through the hotels website directly gave me the best price (almost $100 lower than hotels.com!)  Once booked, a few days before checkin, I received a welcoming email from the GM.  Their system allows you to pre-select your room before arrival which seemed pretty nice.  However it did not work for me because I booked this just a few days in advance.  So I emailed back with a request for a higher floor with a view if possible.  They confirmed that my request would be sent to the reservations manager. \n\nWe arrived in the morning knowing the room would not be ready but to check our bags.  The lady at the front desk was very kind.  She pre-registered us and told us they would call when the room was ready and that she saw our request. \n\nStayed out the entire day and went back to the hotel after dinner.  Our keycards were waiting at the front desk and very excited to hear that our room was on the 22nd floor.  I believe the hotel has 24 or 25 floors but the top two are the penthouse floors.  \n\nWe opened the door to 2209 and were very happy to see that it was a corner room with views of downtown and one world trade center.  The room and bathroom were very clean, very bright, and with great views.  Even in the shower you had a view of downtown.  \n\nThe room is a bit tight, especially with two double beds, but continuous windows throughout the room make it feel spacious enough.  \n\nA few cool features worth mentioning are that the hotel provides free basic wifi and the TV has chromecast built in so you can stream from your phone.  Also there is a mobile phone in the room that you can use to call the hotel for free (I think) and use as a mobile phone without roaming charges (if you are visiting from another country).  \n\nIn conclusion, the room was great, the staff at the hotel was very kind and courteous.  \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will come again for our next city getaway!\n\nHighly recommend room 2209","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

For those who love boutique, it will be close to perfect. Sadly, I'm not so much of a fan of boutique as like the familiarity of brand names and the bonus of loyalty rewards.\n\nThis was a business trip and rather than staying the financial district, decided to stay here based on its location to some of the excellent restaurants in the area. As we were a party of 3 businessmen, all dressed in suits, ties etc, we didn't really fit in with the other clientele which are generally 30 somethings dressed as cool as cucumbers!  Checking in was easy but with one small problem, the front desk failed to inform any of us about the \"Extras\".\n\nDrinks were as expected in the bar but a little pricey but hey, your in Soho. Service was good and as expected. The following morning after a fantastic nights sleep in a super comfy bed (Note, each business had their own room), albeit typical NY type smaller than average room compared to other US cities, we all headed to breakfast. Again, good breakfast, a little pricey but certainly satisfying. We then headed to check out which was where it started to go wrong.\n\nThe overnight statement was showing minibar usage even prior to my arrival. Thankfully, this was resolved quickly. Sadly, when it came to the \"Extras\", these were now explained in detail and wasn't optional. $45.90 inc tax was the amenity charge as they call it. For this, you get a host of things other hotels offer for free such as Tea, Coffee, exercise room and a turndown service. The one item to note is the hourly wine tasting from 5-6pm. Unfortunately, if you check in after 6.00pm, you miss that perk which was exactly what the 3 of us missed. You also get spin classes so make sure you stay for 2 nights and these need to be booked a day in advance.\n\nAs we were all at the hotel for less than 24 hours, checked in after 6.00pm and missed the wine, all I can say is the three of us were fleeced out of nearly $150 for these \"Amenities\" so beware. One last thing to note is the Amenities also includes the WiFi which states its free on the website. Don't get caught out thinking that means you get free \"high speed\" WiFi as that's extra as well. Even the person on the front desk agreed \"free WiFi\" cant be free if included in the $45.90 amenity charge.\n\nOverall, a nice hotel but felt ripped off with these charges.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This came up as one of the more reasonable choices (price-wise) on Hotel Tonight and we went based on the reviews. The resort fee is ridiculous, as I still haven\u2019t quite figured out what resort amenities were available to justify that fee. There wasn\u2019t even free bottled water in our room! \n\nFees aside, the room was teeny-tiny, but serviceable for one night. If you have big suitcases, it may be tight for two people. The shower had excellent water pressure and the location is great, if you want to be near Soho, Chinatown\/Little Italy, Tribeca or the Financial District. Duane Reade is about a five minute walk if you forget anything. There\u2019s also a Handy phone for visitors traveling here from abroad. Our room had great light during the day. The entrance way to the hotel is quite pretty, and there were many people taking selfies for their Instagram posts when we returned from dinner.\n\nThe Cons: while looking for a cup or glass to hold our toothbrushes, we found a glass in the snack tray with pink lipstick on it. On the toilet, we found hair on the seat. The rooms and hallways have a heavy perfume circulating in the ventilation system. Every time our A\/C went on, a blast of the perfume would come out. We would have left the window open overnight, but it lacks a bug screen, and being that our window opened to a utility\/roof top area (3rd floor), we did not want to chance it with rodents coming in. A lamp in our room was on the fritz, and clearly needed a new lightbulb or wiring. \n\nThe lobby for check-in is upstairs; you need to take the elevator up from the ground floor. Better signage would have been appreciated. We had no bags with us, but I would imagine out-of-town visitors would not have liked searching for the front desk with all of their stuff in tow. \n\nWe gladly checked out early and will be looking for another hotel to stay in tonight. \n\n","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The lobby had the appearance of a homeless centre.  Tourists smoking in the front outdoor area and taking selfies, and lounging around in ( fashionably?) tatty old armchairs.  \nIn the lobby we were told to take all our luggage upstairs to the checkin area.  After queing, we were told check-in is at 4pm and we\u2019d have to take our luggage back downstairs to the lobby.  ( Why wasn\u2019t advised this when I emailed to confirm we would arrive at 2pm?  Why wasn\u2019t there any one to pre-empt this at the lobby? Or to take our bags from the checkin area?).\nMuch fuss was made of coffee being served in the library.  The breakfast coffee was available in an area of the lobby, and consisted of an urn and paper cups, with an opportunity to purchase a coissant, again served in a cardboard box.  \nThe hotel is a peculiar mix of a hipster grunge design decor, and once classic rooms.\nThe bedrooms are exceptionally small, but do have large windows and classic interiors - the \u201cleft overs\u201d of  the previous iteration of the hotel.  The floors and cushions are classic blue and bathrooms classic marble.  A minor gripe - but there was no complimentary bottled water and minimal toiletries, including no shower cap.\nOverall, the service was rather poor.  No assistance was available for touring or transport. Our keys were recoded to deny access to our room on the last day one and a half hours before checkout time.\nThe location is fine in a lovely street, but more importantly the hotel felt more like youth hostel in all public areas.

No one answered (I would say this is the downside, whenever you try to get in touch with with them, no one answers\/ is available - front desk or reservation desk-, and if they finally answer, they immediately redirect you to another person that, once again...never answers...).\nSo I had to personally come to the hotel and ask the person that was working at the time - Israel,  to show me a couple of available rooms. He was very kind and took the time to show me not one, not two, but three or four available rooms and made sure to put a hold on the one that I liked - as i was about to check in few days later.\n\nMy 1st night there was one of the coldest of this season , so there were some issues with the heating system of the chosen room. Next morning I got in contact with the manager of the hotel, Pablo, and was in awe by his professionalism. He personally took on the matter, switched the room, offered me a beautiful one, and made sure that I have everything I need throughout my entire stay- which was even longer than expected. I have traveled in my life quite a lot everywhere in the world, and, of course, it often happens that there are issues with the room you are given, but i gotta say, this has been one of the few occasions when the manager of the hotel was so considerate and accommodating - it was clear from the beginning that he was one of the few people that has a clear understanding of what hospitality actually means.\n\nI highly recommend the hotel.

Lovely hotel - from the gorgeous entryway on Crosby to the lobby and the modern rooms\n\n2.  Great location at the edge of SoHo and NoLiTa, which to me are the best areas of NYC by far.  If looking for shopping, dinner and drinks, you really don't have to leave about a 1\/2 mile area to get everything you could want.\n\n3.  Quiet room - I was a little worried because I was on the 10th floor (hotel has 24 or 25 floors) and thought I'd be able to hear NYC noises as you do in most hotels there (I am a super light sleeper).  I heard nothing at all.  It does help that Crosby is one of the quieter streets in the area, but I also feel they spent money on soundproofing.\n\n4.  In house reservations employee (maybe the mgr?) Victoria.  She is so nice.  I changed my rate when it went lower than the amount I had booked and then later upgraded my room type as I wanted a larger room.  She couldn't have been nicer to assist each time.  \n\nWe stayed in a king suite which is very nice and good sized for NYC.  It has a door between the bedroom and living room that you can pull shut if needed.  NOMO will definitely be the hotel I choose for all future NYC stays due to all of the above.  \n\nMy only (minor) suggestions for improvement to the hotel are that lighting is needed in the living room portion of the King Suite.  There were no lights around the couch that I could find at all.  If you wanted to read there at night, you could not.\n\nWhen I checked in and out, there was only one employee at the front desk and I had a 6-10 min wait both times.  There are two computers and I feel like two people should be working at all times so guests don't have to wait long. \n\nHotel has a nice on-site gym but it was pretty hot in there.  When I went there were prob 4 ppl working out in the room so maybe that's why it was hot, but I'd say it was prob 75 degrees or more in there.  \n\nEven with the above minor issues, for me it was a 5 star experience.  Fabulous choice in NYC!","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

One of my friends is on the Kelo diet and had no problem finding a lot of things to enjoy.  Some of my favorite appetizers were the beets and the calamari.  Yummy!  For dinner we each had something different so we could taste as much as possible.  My salmon was cooked perfectly and was delish!  My friend ordered his steak medium rare and it was perfectly cooked.  Not sure which one I liked the best but can certainly recommend the steak, pork and salmon.\nWe shared the apple crisp, which I understand they have their own pastry chef which is always nice.

Vi boede p\u00e5 hotellet i 7 n\u00e6tter og det lykkedes dem ikke en eneste gang at give os h\u00e5ndkl\u00e6der til 3 personer, som v\u00e6relset passede til og som reservationen var lavet til. Vores toilet l\u00f8b over en aften, hvor vi m\u00e5tte bruge alle vores h\u00e5ndkl\u00e6der til gulvet, s\u00e5 vandet ikke l\u00f8b ud p\u00e5 gulvt\u00e6ppet.

Jeg kontaktede hotellets concierge inden ankomst for at f\u00e5 hj\u00e6lp til at booke bord p\u00e5 en restaurant samt at booke transfer fra JFK til hotellet. Jeg har i alt sendt 12 mails til hotellet, jeg har brugt 3 forskellige e-mails som jeg har fundet p\u00e5 deres hjemmeside, jeg har sendt dem en besked p\u00e5 facebook og de svarede p\u00e5 en mail med noget ubrugeligt info, hvorefter jeg aldrig h\u00f8rte mere. \n\nPersonalet, som g\u00e6lder deres \u201cd\u00f8rm\u00e6nd\u201d, receptionister og ansatte i deres bar og restaurant er s\u00e5 \u00e5benlyst ligeglade med deres job, s\u00e5 det n\u00e6rmest er komisk.

The location of Nomo seemed interesting, so we booked a premium king room on the top floor- we always go \"high\" to try to mitigate street noise.  First, their lobby is too busy being \"hip\" and short on staff and organization.  Check in was a mess.   Two small desks, with the room key machine balanced on books, two people, and 30 guests in the lobby in various stages of check in, waiting for rooms to be ready, etc.  There is more space devoted to art and lounge chairs than there is to staff to make things move along.\n\nOur room was not ready, so we went to the restaurant bar.   It is again trying too hard to be SoHo edgy and not enough focus on the details.  The bar top has holes peeling in the surface- when the bartender poured my glass of wine and I went to reach for it, my shirt sleeve caught in one of the \"potholes\" on the bar surface and ripped a small hole!  \n\nThe rooms are, frankly, misleading.  We have a premium king- which on line says has \"a full size work desk\" and a \"sitting area\".   The desk is a tiny alcove built in- my shoulders almost touch both sides of the wall!   The \"sitting area\" is two small arm chairs separated by a tiny table, which I can touch while laying in bed.   If my wife sits in the chair, I have to step over her to walk by!   As noted, we always ask for top floor rooms for noise- but that is no help.   However this is built, the street noise on the top floor is clearly audible.\n\nOther little things just don't make sense.  For example, the thermostat for the room is very oddly located- a foot above eye level (I am nearly 6 feet tall) and on the wall above the \"sitting area\" chairs- so you cannot read it without standing on the chair!  Very poor design- should be over the \"desk\" (read, cubby).  \n\nPerhaps the most disappointing thing is the vibe of the place.  We thought it would be modern, SoHo energetic, but upscale and tasteful.  Instead- it is pretentious and somewhat crass.   There was a buyout of the restaurant our first night.  When we returned from the theater, 5-6 younger men were outside, smoking cigars, one vomiting, laughing and cursing loudly and clearly beyond drunk.  We tried to walk past but they just staggered into us, talking loudly, and heading back to the lobby.   It was very frat house-esque.   The restaurant is open to the lobby, so when we entered the party was in full swing with more drunken idiots staggering around in $1000 outfits.  Note- money does not equate with class.   That really summarizes this property.  It is no inexpensive, tries to be upscale- but is more just a place for self important people to feel self important.  There are too many nicer hotels in NY to deal with this.  If you want something not far away but far more upscale, try the Dominick or the Crosby.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had our children with us and when we checked in at 2 pm the floor already reeked of cigarettes and pot and it only got worse as the night wore on. I am no prude but at 5 am there were people sitting outside our room door talking, smoking and drinking. My daughter who is 10 actually poked her head out to ask them to be quiet and they told her to \"F*#% Off\". Nice clientelle.  In the morning every other door had empty bottles outside. When we went to let the manager know at check out the first person we spoke to just shrugged her shoulders and did not care and made no attempt to tell her superior. I waited and waited for him and he stayed on the phone on what appeared to be a personal call until I left. This may have been a nice hotel at one point but it is obviously now a place where a group of people rent a room to party for the night.

We booked a king suite for 5 nights and was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. The floor to ceiling windows have us fantastic views of NY. Even the shower had the same windows. Bed was comfortable with nice linen. \nPoints on the rest of the hotel. The lobby area is really small and gets quite crowded and the entrance to the hotel restaurant is there also and on Friday -Sunday evening it was packed with groups not staying st the hotel so unless you pre book a table you will have a long wait to get in even as a hotel guest. There are no tea or coffee facilities in the room but you can come down between 6-10 to get one. No juice or cold drinks are included in your stay. I found this to be very off putting at over $600 a night for our room. The little interaction that I had with the staff could have been more friendly. Mini bar prices are extortionate as in most hotels! Also there is a $25 charge per room per night (explained prior to booking) which covers your use of the gym, a newspaper, internet access ( basic) and yes it covers the cost of your Tea and Coffee in the morning if you want to get dressed and come and get one.\nOverall it\u2019s in a great location and the room was great but the amenities, staff and extra charges for a coffee in the morning really let this place down.

It has a stunning lobby. We arrived at the hotel and had 4 large suitcases and was the last hotel in a 6 week trip. The beautiful people who worked there smiled and said welcome but not one person helped with the bags, or noticeably...the person at the door didn't hold it open as I literally stumbled through. It was a bit strange. But we were given our room, no issue. Beautiful views...I mean stunning views!!! It was lovely. However, there were some issues with cleanliness in the room and the more we looked, we found out that it was unacceptable. We had to change room (the hotel were good about it but did argue that it was nothing..it wasn't, te bed sheets were filthy. I took photos of it to show them but they were dismissive.) The room had other cleanliness issues- i.e. really not clean and I see this is echoed in other reviews. We experienced the same. The next room was fine, however. As compensation, we were given free breakfast, which we appreciated. \n\nAt breakfast, the ambience is lovely, a courtyard restaurant. Everyone is taking selfie after selfie beside the fairy lights and of their beautiful breakfasts. However, we lost our server at some point after ordering. Meaning...our coffees and juices never came. We could see our server having a full disagreement with (I am guessing) the restaurant manager out front, some kind of work issue I am guessing. And alas...no coffee or juice...oh well. And no bill came after we asked another server twice. We never saw our server again (but are still expected to tip, hmmmm?)\n\nWe asked for late check out at reception (not given and the attitude was a little off- no apology, just \"yeah we don't do that\") but after we pushed harder (filthy room and not so great breakfast) we were granted a few extra hours which we appreciated. And we were perfectly comfortable in our new room.\n\nThe room we were in was lovely and we had a great time in NYC but in general, this place is all about face and little substance. The lobby is full of guests standing to take their Insta photos every second of the day and it is all about trendy but basic hotel service seems to be lacking. The staff were ok but generally not bothered to help us. I come to NY often and don't think I will be back here but the location is just awesome and the coffee shops nearby are great (don't count on getting one at breakfast from the hotel!!) \n\nBut not helping us with bags from the taxi into the lobby, while we were clearly struggling, is a minus point. They MUST clean the rooms more thoroughly and the personality of the hotel was just 'vacant' with regards to warm welcomes and polite chatty conversation that make you feel welcome at their fine establishment. However...one thing. The view was great and we enjoyed it for hours. Pic attached.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

However, on checking out it was a shock to discover a $25 + taxes charge per day for Amenities. This included coffee and flavoured water in the reception area plus use of the Fitness Room. The coffee was rubbish, and the so called Fitness Room was too small. In almost all other Hotels these AMENITIES are included. We had no problem with paying for the room at the rate booked, but I have strong objection to hotels that add these additional charges for services that may or not be used. They are optional and therefore provided at the hotels discretion. I feel strongly enough to take further action but my time is more important and I am sure that's what the management think too.

Let me first say, I have stayed at this hotel numerous times before and have loved it.  My company also stays here a ton, we are torn to go back.  Familiar faces like Allen and Julian are always welcoming you back, and being helpful with any situation.  Jasmin, Israel and Steve show support and are reliable in any situation and are pleasant to deal with, at the front desk. It is people like this and the location that makes me love staying here.  Unfortunately, there was a situation that came up and we had to deal with Fady, the manager on duty.  I have never met someone so rude in the service industry.  The lack of communication, the contradictions, and outright cockiness he had with me and a coworker was unbelievable. We had to reach out after hours, since nothing was communicated before he left, and the way he handled it was outrageous.  He would not let my coworker (who is seriously the sweetest person) get a word in, acted completely defensive, and cut her off several time.  I could not believe someone with that title, or anyone, would be so rude to a customer.  I have never been so frustrated dealing with someone.  He speaks without thinking, defensively contradicts stories and later apologizes.  It was too late, his true emotions had shown.  This is why I was torn to write a review about this hotel.  If you don't have any issues, this place is great.  If you do, good luck!","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

They are a bit small, but that is typical for NYC.  Basically the Crosby Suite is just two rooms put together - but the second room has a couch that pulls out into a bed - it is definitely not a queen size, and maybe even a bit smaller than a full - so probably best for kids, but son and gf are both smaller and they were fine with it.  My daughter and I had a Queen bed in the other room.  Each room had its own closet.  The showers are a bit larger than a typical small hotel room, and the sink was outside of the bathroom so someone could easily get ready while someone else is in the shower.\nWe found the service to be excellent, particularly the guy at the front desk who helped us checkin after a red-eye flight and then taking the AirTrain\/subway from JFK - it was nice to have a helpful and happy front desk person (wish I could remember his name - I think it was Isaiah or Israel).  Also, we arrived about 9am and our room was ready for us to check into which was very appreciated.\nThe restaurant is in a cool space covered like a sunroom and we had good service for drinks and breakfast one morning.  \nBellman was particularly helpful when we had him store our luggage after checking out, but then had to keep coming back to add something or take something away.

Our confirmation said \u201camount to pay at hotel in the local currency\u201d and gave a price and then said \u201ctotal to be charged by hotel\u201d and gave the same price. But that\u2019s not the actual amount the hotel charged. In addition to various taxes (ok) \nit charges an amenity fee of some $27.50 per night for the gym, basic internet, and the cucumber infused water in the lobby. According to the manager this is disclosed somewhere on its website and on hotel.com info. But it is inconsistent with the statement on the confirmation \u201ctotal to be charged by hotel.\u201d \n\nThe manager simply ignored me when I pointed this language out and it\u2019s plain meaning. He said  \u201cthis is not the confirmation statement\u201d because I had cut and pasted it into a word document. He repeated that the fee was disclosed somewhere and he\u2019d investigate where and get back to me. In short, he was really more interested in proving that the hotel had the right to charge me the extra fee rather than in the fact that my confirmation had given me misleading information on the \u201ctotal to be charged by hotel\u201d which did not include the extra \u201camenity\u201d fees.\n\nFine. Disclosed elsewhere or not, I found true  statements on the confirmation to be misleading. And I now find so have many other guests who have similarly surprised by this fee.\n\nSo if price matters to you, call the hotel and ask for the total fee for all charges for all purposes whatsoever and then hopefully you will get an accurate all in price.\n\nAs for the affiliated restaurant, we had one dinner there. The vibe was great, the chef is excellent and the food elegant. \n\nBut: this morning we sat down at 9am at a time when things were not especially busy and were completely totally 100% ignored for 15 minutes by the staff until we walked out. Not so much as a glass of water let alone the opportunity to order. Service was not poor - we were treated as non persons. I told the greeter who had seated us 20 minutes before. She asked me where we were seated. Since she had been the one who selected the spot and seated us, this was not the response I expected.\n\nWe went to a nearby old fashioned diner on Grand Street and had a great experience with waiters who paid attention to us.\n\nFor us, no mo\u2019 Nomo. I guess we weren\u2019t hip enough. Back to AirBnB where we found a gorgeous room in midtown with many more amenities and a host who cares about her guests at a fully disclosed price.\n\n","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Prima di tutto il ristorante \u00e8 molto bello, grandi lampadari di cristallo al soffitto if una tavolata lunga sotto di esso \u00e8 vari tavoli da 2 quadrati, un paio tondi da 8-10 persone, bancone fornitissimo ed aria condizionata a palla (a New York aria condizionata a palla dappertutto). Seduti ci accoglie la nostra cameriera portandoci il menu ed una bottiglia di acqua naturale sfusa. Men\u00f9 scarno con poche cose da poter ordinare: 6 antipasti, 6 piatti di pasta e 6 o 7 secondi (entree). Io decido per un pollo con verdure (c\u2019era scritto che verdure fossero ma non ricordo) mia moglie per una bistecca ai ferri con germogli di soja patate al forno in pi\u00f9 da bere una media per me. All\u2019arrivo dei piatti (dopo circa un\u2019ora al freddo e senza nulla da sgranocchiare) sono rimasto basito in quanto il mio piatto consistena in 2 cosce, un\u2019ala e mezza schiena (no petto) di un pollo che se fosse pesato 200gr da vivo era dir tanto, a mia moglie sono arrivati dei bocconcini di carne stracotti (richiesta una cottura media) che erano praticamente chewingum. Totale del conto 96$ con la mancia, quando i giorni prima avevamo cenato in giro egregiamente con 40$. Nel complesso bell\u2019hotel ma non mangiateci, c\u2019\u00e8 di meglio fuori ","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The experience was honestly among the worst at any hotel (including Marriotts, four points sheraton, mid-tier vegas hotels,etc.)  I've had. The location(i.e. a the hotel isn't itself responsible for) is great and convenient, but the rooms are extremely small, poorly decorated, have virtually no amenities to speak of (expensive, rarely stocked mini bar is about it) and the service is genuinely terrible. Room service took at least 45 minutes to bring me a tea, and then forgot a spoon when I specifically asked for it about three times. All of the room service arrives with plastic wrap they don't remove, and the milk for the coffee comes in a dixie cup. Considering its >$350 a night, and the hotel tacks on extra \"amenity\/resort\" charges, they treat you like you spent about $50. I'm glad I live in NYC because it gives me literally no reason to stay here ever again.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1786395,"title":"Great Location!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-05-01","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Great location! Entrances to all the major subway lines are only a few blocks away and you\u2019re on the border of Little Italy and Chinatown. Lots to see and great bars\/restaurants nearby.\n\nI stayed in a King Suite on the 23rd floor. Beautiful view. Even from the shower stall which boasted a large window in one entire wall overlooking the city. There was no curtain but the front desk assured me that it was one-way glass. I could see out but nobody could see inside. My two room suite was very quiet, comfortable, and immaculate.\n\nThey offer free internet access and invite you to upgrade to a higher speed for $10 per day. I had no problem with the speed level of the free version. However, I must ask why this internet access service is unsecured. Every time I logged in, I got a dire warning that my session was \u201cunsecured\u201d. I wish the Nomo Soho management would tighten that up. Why no password security?\n\nDon\u2019t ask for directions to their business center because they don\u2019t have one. This was disappointing but the front desk was able to check me into my flight and printed my boarding pass.\n\nA minor problem with my bill when I checked out. New York City occupancy tax is $2.00 per day. I was surprised to be charged double that rate. When I asked for an explanation, the desk clerk explained that I had stayed in a suite that could have accommodated 4 people Hence the $4.00 per day charge. Not only is this weird logic but also, there was only one king bed in my suite and the couch was NOT a sleeper sofa. Four people in one king bed? I think not. The amount per day was minimal but I feel like they tried to rip me off. Eventually the double charge was removed. \n\nIn spite of these few bumps in the road, I would not hesitate to return to this hotel again and I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to avoid the midtown tourist trap and experience a real New York neighborhood.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"SOLO"}
