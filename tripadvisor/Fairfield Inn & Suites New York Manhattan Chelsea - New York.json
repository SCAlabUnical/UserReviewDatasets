One hopes for a clean room in good condition. For a lower priced place in NYC anything above this is a bonus. We have stayed at other places in this area, such as the Hyatt Place a few blocks away. This was far better. The room was large enough. We even had a closet (as opposed to Hyatt Place) and a desk with a comfortable chair. The bathroom was a little inconvenient as the door was wide and room so small that you had to kind of navigate to get in and out. However, the plumbing was excellent and this was just a minor inconvenience. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised that breakfast was included. We had missed that on the website. It was fine. It is nice to be able to get a cup of coffee and a bite to eat to start your day.\n\nWhat made the stay so excellent was the staff. Every person we interacted with from check-in to check-out was very pleasant and not in that superficial way where they say good morning while looking at their shoes. These people looked you in the eye and went out of their way to assist you. For instance, one morning my wife had her hands full with coffees and a little breakfast to bring up to the room. The front desk clerk saw her struggling to call the elevator, came around from the reception desk, pressed the call button on the elevator. She then waited and when my wife entered the elevator she went in and pressed the floor button for her. We also had a minor leak at one point in the bathroom and they immediately sent someone to fix it.\n\nFor NY, this is an inexpensive place but it was really a pleasure.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As a bonus, you stroll through \u201c a series of gardens,\u201d as soon as you go out the front door and pass through all the plants and flowers on 28th St. You are near a wide variety of places and things to see and do. A small sample: You can walk to the amazing High Line and Little Island [perched on top of all those golf tees] Parks; as well as stroll or bike ride the Hudson River Park; take a cruise from Chelsea Piers [recommending the NY Architecture cruise]; visit the Whitney Art Museum, Pier 57, FIT and plenty of art galleries and even walk to the Intrepid Sea, Air, Space museum; enjoy a performance at the Joyce Theater. Of course, being in NYC, eateries abound and some of them in those cute covid-inspired outdoor venues.

Not only does she run that desk with poise, professionalism and care, but you can see she takes immense pride in what she does and the happiness of her guests.  She treats guests like they were her own, which is rare in this day and age.  Having grown up in a family that's been in hospitality for generations, I see so much potential in Mai.  I only hope the Marriott organization realizes this quickly before they lose such amazing talent.  Mai is the kind of young hospitality rockstar that Marriott should invest in big time.  Spend 10 years teaching her the ropes at better and bigger hotels and she'll run one of them for you one day.  THANK YOU, MAI!  Keep it up.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

From check-in to check-out, we received a very warm welcome from the staff and manager, which made our stay more enjoyable right away. Everyone is really eager to take care of any concerns.\nAs per the description, you could get ice cubes 24\/7 (due to lack of mini bar in the room) from the LL and various teas and cafe from the ground floor. Food was limited to certain dishes but tasty very good.\n\nThe only shortcomings were:\n1.the tiny bathroom with very small sink and undermount box - we had a 4-person room whereby we suffered very much from lack of space. We were always brought only 3 towels although we emphasized every time that there were four of us in the room. \n\n2.the dining room is unfortunately much too small in relation to the number of rooms and the guests accommodated in it at the same time - so that there was a big rush and waiting times for a free table almost every day. A hint or a request to the guests to leave the dining room as soon as they have finished eating would perhaps be a good consideration. Unfortunately, there were many guests who - although they saw the waiting people - froze in front of their cell phones although they already had empty plates in front of them. \n\nAll in all, we felt very comfortable and well taken care of here and give a clear recommendation.

We showed up quite early (12:30 PM) and our room wasn't ready which was no big deal at all.  Would have been amazed if they'd had a room for us then.  The woman at the desk offered to store my bag.  We accepted and off we went to spend our day.  We returned quite a bit later around 9.  My bag was easily retrieved.  We were given a room on the 18th floor as an upgrade due to our Marriott status.  The room was very quiet and had two bathrooms, a king bed, and a sitting room.  My one and only complaint was the bedroom area could have used a little more lighting.  We had plenty of hot water in the sinks and shower which is amazing on the 18th floor, too.  The room was clean.  The elevators worked very well.  \n\nBreakfast was also included and this was no tiny little breakfast.  The spread was ample and fresh.  My one complaint is the main food area did get crowded by the middle of our breakfast so we sort of rushed up as we were uncomfortable with the Omicron COVID spread rates.  Of course you can't mask while eating.  The vast majority of diners came into the area wearing masks and wore them while getting their food.  I only saw one person who entered the dining area unmasked.\n\nRecommend with no hesitation.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

There is also no upgrade for this particular room because it is a double bed room. I was told by the customer service line of Fairfield Inn and Suites after explaining the below numbered points that there was absolutely nothing they could do for me because I booked through a 3rd party website.

Think again.  We have no idea where they buy their bagels, but they are NOT anything near a NYC bagel.  We couldn't even eat the bagel.  We come to NYC a few times a year and we know we will not stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The first night was a little disorganised as they appeared fully booked and we were appointed a disability room that was quite tight for space and had only been set out for one occupant.  The problem was sorted thanks to the excellent staff Wendi and Gissell who were both apologetic and could not do enough to make our stay memorable.  Once moved we had a large room, with reasonable size shower room.  The room appeared to have been refurbished and had wooden floors and modern fitments. \n\nThere did seem to be an issue with housekeeping as towels were not left and the soap, cream shampoo had to be requested on a number of occasions.\n\nBreakfast was part of the package and was plentiful, with quality products that should suffice most residents.  There was an excellent supply of fruit and breads.\n\nThe hotel is in an excellent location within the \u201cflower\u201d district and within easy walking distance of Penn Station and other key areas of NYC.\n\nMy only other concern is there are no in room safes, with small portable safes available at the front desk.  So iPads etc had to be hidden in cases with passports and valuables carried around, which is not ideal!  There should be security in the rooms.  Thankfully, we did not loose anything during our stay.\n\nOverall, it was a comfortable stay, however, due to the safe issue I would reconsider future stays.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Our stay a few days ago was our second one.\n\nThanks to my husband's loyalty status with Marriott we were able to secure a room on a high floor during both of our stays.  The room size is typical for NYC.  What I love about it is that it's newly renovated, it's carpet-free, it has floor-to-ceiling windows, and the shower has glass partitions instead of a tub with shower curtains.\n\nThe front desk staff is what sets it apart from all the other NYC hotels we've stayed in.  They're very warm and very pleasant despite the always-busy small lobby filled with guests who are always in need of something.  Shoutout to Roxanne who thoughtfully prepared a welcome basket for us and to Giselle who gave us a great dining alternative!\n\nThe breakfast is standard American breakfast offered by hotels in the same price point and it's free.\n\nThe hotel is located on the same street as wholesale florists. There's a subway station at the end of the block (Times Square is two stops away), Herald Square and Penn station are a short walk away, and there's a Walgreens nearby for essentials.  There's a ramen place, a Korean BBQ place, an Italian restaurant, even a McDonald's just a stone's throw away.\n\nPlease note that there are several buildings under construction on their block so some portions of the street only have one lane open, this made it difficult to maneuver our SUV into their valet spot.  Plus the florists can make a mess on the sidewalk when they're cleaning.

Usually I won\u2019t bother with the room size unless I feel it\u2019s really too small, especially when the front desk told me they gave me a larger room. I really don\u2019t know how it feels to be in their standard room which stated only 180 sqft.\n\nSecond, I couldn\u2019t find the mini fridge anywhere in the room, so I called the front desk, the staff told me they will only deliver it upon request. Never heard of any hotel handle the hotel mini-fridge this way. \n\nThird, when I found no trash can under the desk, I was wondering if that is also delivered upon request? Called again, no, it\u2019s just that the housekeeper forgot to put one under the desk. \n\nOf course, toothbrush is also provided upon request, but the front desk staff didn\u2019t mention anything when checked in, you\u2019ll just have to find all those missing things one by one yourself.\n\nDuring the two hours waiting time for the room ready for check in, I found there\u2019s only one front desk staff taking care of everything, when the hotel customers left luggages at the counter for storage, she had to carry all those luggages to the storage room, while she\u2019s doing that job, nobody is presented at the counter, people had to wait until she finished the luggage job which should be done by the concierge or bell boy. It just occurred to me the Fairfield by Marriott seems like running by a family, such a limited working personnel at this hotel.\n\nLastly, when inquiring all those housekeeping related questions, like coffee maker didn\u2019t work, missing trash can, toothbrush, etc. etc. there\u2019s no direct line, had to go through the front desk, so when front desk staff is busy, you have to wait until they\u2019re done with their work at the front desk. It\u2019s indeed very inconvenient especially when you need something right away.   \nThe guy who delivered the coffee maker, trash can and toothbrush to my room for several times, I could feel he became impatient at the end, but all those things I asked for should have been provided in the room without even asking, furthermore, I was kind enough not to ask for the mini-fridge to be delivered to my room when I actually needed one.\n\nAnyway, Interesting experience at this hotel, but that\u2019s it, bye bye!\n\n","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"NONE"}

This Fairfield Inn not only fits the bill on those counts, but it has the added bonus of being smack in the middle of the colorful, bustling Flower District. The hotel itself is a typical tall, skinny Manhattan hotel crammed into a small footprint, so there are only a handful of rooms per floor. I was on a pretty low floor (the ninth), but noise from outside wasn't too intrusive at all. The staff here is extremely nice and helpful and my room was very clean and comfortable. I skipped the free breakfast on both mornings of my stay, as there are so many great places for breakfast and superior cappuccino nearby. But I really appreciated the hotel's living room in the back of the lobby, where there is seating and free coffee\/tea\/water provided all day long. One day, we bought great ethnic carry-out food from down the street, and were able to relax and enjoy it in the living room. All in all, I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant, comfortable base in Manhattan.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

The stay did not go as expected. \n\n1.\nI arrived too early on the first night and there was no room available for early check-in because, according to the front desk, half of the hotel rooms were under renovation. She told me that she'd let me know when the room became available. The notification came at around 7pm. This could have been an issue with the Marriott App? \nHowever, while I do understand that this is based on availability,I had requested the early check-in prior to the stay, so I would have appreciated if I was told that this was not likely to happen beforehand. \n\n2.\nThe next day, I found a centipede (a baby centipede, according to the personnel who came to take care of it) in the shower. To be fair, he offered to switch the room for me, but he confirmed that it's not harmful, so I decided not to switch and he made sure that I get the room cleaning later that afternoon. \n\n3.\nI was going to make coffee in the room only to find that one of the coffee packages has already passed the expiration date...\n\n4.\nOn the third day, I asked for a late checkout (guaranteed benefit for Platinum) so that I could take a shower after a workout before I leave but received a notice the day before that the water will be shut off from 11am to 4pm... Had I known this before the stay, I would have stayed at a different hotel and my reservation had been eligible for the chance \/ cancellation without fee until 4pm the day before. Anyways, I ended up checking out early and took a shower at the gym (not hotel). \n\n5.\nAlso, all throughout the stay, the street noise was considerable so I recommend that you stay on higher floors. \n\nThere are some good things about the hotel as well. \nThe location was the reason that I chose this hotel in the first place. The people at the front desk are generally friendly. They have free breakfast. The room was clean and didn't have carpeted floor. The room was relatively large; It was at the end of the hallway right next to the closet - maybe it has to do with it? Downside was that there was noise coming from that closet from early in the morning. The check-out process was quick and easy (even though they didn't ask how the stay was). \n\nHowever, given my experience, I don't think I'll stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

We first arrived at the hotel early in the morning by taking a short walk from Penn Station. The lady at the front desk was pleasant and offered to hold our luggage for us until check in. We went back to the hotel later in the day to check in and found the process to be quick and efficient. Our room was nice and newly renovated. I love hotel rooms that don\u2019t have carpet, and each day the housekeeper did an outstanding job making the room spotless and tidy. We found the mattress and pillows to be perfectly comfortable.\n \nThe breakfast is your typical Fairfield fare. The variety was good enough, but I doubt it could hurt to have plain unsweetened yogurt as an option. The eggs in these settings can be hit or miss, but we found them to be delicious each morning. We enjoyed the coffee, too. The breakfast room is small, but that's to be expected. We didn\u2019t find overcrowding in the breakfast area to be an issue during our stay.\n\nThe hotel also has a rooftop patio. Unfortunately, there are huge ventilation fans running up there that are so loud you can\u2019t have a conversation. The rooftop patio is basically only good for going up to check the weather and maybe taking a few photos.\n\nThe biggest complaint of our stay at this hotel involved the restrooms in the lobby. When first arriving, after having flown across the country all night on a red eye, I had hoped to freshen up and wash my face before going about the day. I was unpleasantly surprised to find the restroom in the lobby didn\u2019t have any soap. Instead there was a mark on the wall where the soap dispenser looked to have been torn off. This restroom was also next to the breakfast area, so it was disconcerting that people probably used this restroom before handling food. The toilet looked as though it hadn\u2019t been cleaned in a week. There turned out to be another restroom around the corner, and as I waited for what seemed like an eternity for it to become vacant, one of the breakfast attendants told me to go back and use the same restroom I had just been in. When I told him it didn\u2019t have any soap, he looked at me like \u201cso what\u201d and went about his business. When that second restroom finally became vacant, I was relieved to see there was soap in there. But as luck would have it there weren\u2019t any more paper towels. I\u2019ve generally found Marriott lobby restrooms to be in great condition, but the ones at this property majorly missed the mark.\n\nAll in all I\u2019d still recommend this hotel. The price was decent by New York standards, and a clean comfortable room more than made up for any of the drawbacks mentioned.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I arrived at the hotel\u2019s front desk and was greeted immediately by the clerk who took my bag to store it until the afternoon and invited me  to have breakfast with them even though our check-in was not until that afternoon. My stomach had been growling the whole walk east, and the smell from the breakfast buffet just off the lobby was enticing. The prospect of some warm scrambled eggs and fresh fruit was too much for me to turn down. I grabbed a newspaper and settled in at a corner table, enjoying the warmth of the delicious eggs and the chill of the fruit. In ten minutes, I was good to go to my office.\n\nI find this hotel perfectly fine for a night or two.  If you are a light sleeper, I strongly suggest requesting a room not facing 28th Street as the traffic noise continues well into the early hours of the morning.

In our second room (they had to move us so we had heat in 30 degree NYC), the same three things did not work, though the heat eventually kicked in, but not at the temperature we programmed.  Clearly, they are not checking these features when they remodel. Yes, there is free wifi, but there is no safe in the room, which surprised us.  Our second room had an adequate number of outlets for all of our devices, which our first room did not have.  In fact, we were unplugging clocks and lamps so our devices would not have to charge on the floor or near the sink.  I do agree that the service is excellent, which is helpful when the facilities are just average.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Having a king size bed made the room feel very small, but the room and bathroom was very clean and it was also nicely quiet, which is not always the case in Manhattan. My only complaint is that the room was very cold and I was surprised to see that it was a thin blanket on the bed, not a big puffy comforter, as I would've expected. For some reason, the air conditioning was on (in MARCH) when we checked in that evening. After not being able to turn up the temperature or get the heat going, I turned the system off and went out for the evening. It was better when we returned, but still cold.

As with any large city that you visit for the first time, you will have questions and it is a learning lesson.\n\nThe hotel was a very nice quick in and out hotel.  It was very clean, and the staff was super friendly.  I found the rooms to be very comparable to Fairfield standards in cities like Chicago.  The Fairfield brand seems to me to be a little higher in major metropolitan areas.  I do not mind booking them because they are a higher grade than their normal product.  You do have to remember that they have a breakfast that is more on the line of a simple in and out continental style.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable, there was not a noise factor from the outside traffic.  It was a pleasant stay.  The single bathroom was a little small, but in New York, real estate is a high price!  Everything was clean and up to standard.  It was very manageable for me.\n\nMy luggage was lost on this trip, but the staff jumped right in to help.  I was only staying two nights, but they helped to get it delivered, and then called me when it arrived.  The hotel was also very safe and secure.  There is a drug store right on the corner, so I was able to get the things I needed until my luggage arrived.   There are also a lot of eating places very close.  You are nestled right near 6th avenue, and within walking distance of the Empire State Building.\n\nCab rides were also reasonable, and I did not meet a bad cab driver.

Our room, comprising of two double beds and a small bathroom (shower over bath) was fairly depressing with dark furniture and carpeting and drab walls.We overlooked a brick building where it's workers had a direct view into our room when we raised the blinds which meant that during working hours we left both blinds down.  Still, you don't stay in your room much during the day so we were fairly resigned about this.  We had breakfast (complimentary to guests) at the hotel.  I really enjoyed the variety but did note that although there are two rooms accommodating guests these were very cramped at weekends with many people waiting for people to vacate tables.  Also, I was disappointed that breakfast finished at 9am (10am weekdays). Why would you do this when the majority of your guests are on holiday? There are no other meals or even a bar at the hotel so what's the rush?\nWe found the hotel easily accessible from Penn Station. It is only one stop on the metro to W28th street but we had quite a bit of luggage and walked down 7th Avenue to 28th which took us only a few minutes - no big deal.  With the metro at the end of the street we went to The South Shore for the free Staten Island Ferry and in the other direction to Central Park. - no problems at all.  We went to a bar called the Compton Ale House in W27\/W26 street which had good beers and food and there is also a cheap laundromat at W26th.  All in all, a useful location to be in.  I should add the young ladies on the front desk we're friendly and helpful. Thanks Ashley.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

After all, shouldn't have too many negatives for only an one night stay.  Unfortunately, I stayed at the Courtyard on W31st the night before, so this hotel's room and especially the bathroom became a major issue for me.  When I first try to check in early, I was told that no rooms are available for early in for that day, but I was hopeful that perhaps, someone would double check and see if a complimentary upgrade was available, but no such luck (I guess being a Marriott gold status member won't get any special treatments at this hotel).  Instead, they nicely asked me to come back closer to the check in time.  Thank goodness I was able to get a late check out from Courtyard.  When I return later for the proper check in, I was very disappointed that the room that was assigned to me was not on a higher floor, and was near the elevator.  Everything that I do not want on my profile.  The young woman at the front desk told me that I was supposedly assigned to a room with the view of the Empire State Bldg., I am sorry to say that the building view I had was not it.  So, the room was clean, but there was no floor space to lay my luggage on and the drawer spaces available were maybe 6 - 8 inches to the end of the bed.  This wasn't the issue that bothers me the most.  It was bathroom vanity space that I am not used to.  On top of it, you cannot leave the bathroom door open because the door opens inward and will block out half the vanity space.  This means you must close the bathroom door even if you only need to wash your hands.\nThe nice things I could say about this hotel is the location and complimentary breakfast.  For my personal preference, I'd rather stay at other Marriott properties in the future.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The rooms are nice and clean. The room had more than enough space for two people and a single suitcase. The bathroom was spacious and updated. It also had a ventilated fan, which it seems like few hotels have. There was no fridge in the room. The complementary breakfast was good. It had an assortment of baked goods, cereal, a waffle maker, fresh fruit, and yogurt. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great spot.  We were able to walk to time square and Central Park no problem. We were also close to Madison square garden, which is the reason we came to New York. \n\nThere were two reasons I didn't give this hotel five stars. First: we planned on doing the valet parking. But, because it had snowed within the week we were here, there was only a single small spot available to park in, and it wasn't cleared. Plus, the valet service is off site, so we would have had to wait about 10 minutes while blocking traffic to valet the car. In nice weather, this probably wouldn't be an issue as a full size spot would be available. We ended up doing the self park, which was cheaper anyway. Second: we left our do not disturb sign on the door when we went out for a couple hours during the day because we didn't want the room disturbed. When we got back, the sign was back inside the room, and it had been cleaned. Nothing was disturbed or taken, but I did find it surprising that the sign was ignored. \n\nThe hotel can't be blamed for this, but the street noise is extremely loud. We were on the 11th floor, and the horns and sirens woke me up multiple times throughout the night. I recommend bringing ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.

After our stay we received an email from the operations manager, asking for a feedback. I submitted it, but have never heard back. So now I'm posting my email here:\n\n\"Thank you so much for writing to me! Staying at your hotel was very pleasant & great! You were able to give us a very early check-in! And from all our hearts we want to thank you! \nHowever, there were a couple of things that I wanted to point out:\n1) The girl at the reception said that parking in your partnering garage facility was $35 flat fee. But she DIDN'T say that this was the price for only 24 hours. I asked if there was any stamp\/ticket\/validation for the parking garage to ensure they know we're staying at your hotel. The girl said that there was nothing special and we should tell the garage that we're staying at your hotel & if they doubt that, they will just call the hotel. We came to the garage to find out our that we needed a validation from the hotel. I walked back and the new girl placed a sticker on our parking receipt (different girl at the reception). I went back to the garage & were told that price for parking doubled, even though we were only 1.5 hours over the 24-hour mark & had to pay $70 because the girl didn't tell us anything about that. That was supper disappointing for our walet. \n\n2) The same girl at the reception told us that breakfast lasted till 10 am when we arrived. I asked if that was the end time all the time. She said 'Yes'. We woke up this morning & went downstairs at around 9.30 & discovered that breakfast is till 9 am on weekdays & 10 am on weekends. Again, the girl provided the wrong information & that was not what we paid for. Also, there were other people that went downstairs to ask why the breakfast was almost gone & I explained what happened (in from of the reception). They too, were told that breakfast lasted till 10.00 am & were shocked that it was over. \n\nSo we missed the breakfast & paid double for the parking. The reason why I wanted to stay at your hotel is because the price was great, convenient location for us, good price for parking & free breakfast.\nAll above went downhill except for the location.\n\nI never complain about microscopic things, but when something hits our wallet or we don't get what we paid for, then I bring such things up.\"\n\nThere.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Many other Fairfield\/Courtyards offer spinach, turkey and other healthy foods - not this one. They did offer soy milk, which I thought was a nice touch. The gym was small - two treadmills, one elliptical and one bike. Ther was one weight bench. At peak hours, it got packed - and a bit contentious about space and who had the weights first, etc. I appreciate the hotel for offering a fitness room, but given the amount of rooms in the hotel, they desperately need to expand the facilities.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1949647,"title":"Extremely overpriced ","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-01-04","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"Overall we had a good stay! One star was removed as it cost us $1800 Aus for just 5 nights! The room is equivalent to a 2 star Australian hotel room that you can get for $80 a night back home so it was very shocking to see that price, knowing it is New York and is very expensive to stay here we expected the price we just expected a more modern room for the price. Otherwise the room was the size we expected for NYC, just couldn't believe the price, however we did stay for new year, hence the price increase. Breakfast is included, all the hot food was always cold and coffee and tea are meant to be provided all day however they are always empty. Everyday we came and stocked up the tea, creamers, and sugars and cups from the cabinets below as they were ALWAYS empty, and had to constantly ask for coffee and hot water to be refilled which took them 20 minutes so we never bothered to wait. They provide coffee in the room however only provide ONE coffee pod of regular coffee a day (we have 2 people in our room) we asked twice for more coffee to be brought up to our room because the machines downstairs were always empty and we were on the 15th floor and the elevator takes 20 years to come, however the coffee pods never showed so we never had access to the complimentary coffee at all times that we were meant to have. That was disappointing, we thought the service would be better than that and that if you ask for coffee pods they should be brought up, but nope! Otherwise we greatly enjoyed our stay in NYC for new year, however we stayed in 2 different New York hotels (both by Marriott) and the other one was way cheaper and wayyyy newer so definitely wouldn't return to this Chelsea location during our next stay.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"NONE"}

It was clean, and (almost) everything functioned as it was supposed to.\n\nWe checked in on New Year's day, 2017.  The front desk clerk was not overly helpful and we did arrive about an hour before regular check in time of 4:00 (which seems like an excessively late check-in time).  They held our bags, but, I would suggest watching them because our bags almost got carried out with other bags that they had just pulled out of storage.  That there-in seems to be the biggest problem with this hotel.  The staff does not have any way of doing anything in an organized manner.\n\nSupposedly there was 24 hour complementary coffee available, but, every time I went to get a regular coffee it was completely empty.  Likewise, the breakfast buffet had no one to ask or assist and they were out of everything an hour before it was supposed to shut down (and again out of coffee #@%#^$).  Luckily there was a Gregory's coffee close by that satisfied my morning caffeine craving :)\n\nWhen we finally got to our room it was freezing.  I turned on the heat and the heater only blew cold air; I checked and made sure that the thermostat was set to heat and it was, but, it still just kept blowing cold air unless I turned it all the way up to 78 degrees and then it got so hot you couldn't stand it, but, anything less than 78 and there was no warm air.  \n\nIn general I can't say that I wasn't pleased with the stay.  It offered the amenities that we wanted with no frills that we needed while in NYC.  I just think the staff needs to organize, focus on giving guests a superb experience, and also respond with solutions and not just road-blocks to why something can't happen (like:  I'm sorry our handyman has already left for the evening and leaving it at that -- ummm...how about offering a room change when the heat doesn't work in January?).","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Since it was within walking distance of Penn Station I didn't have to pay for a taxi.  Front desk staff is very friendly and welcoming.  Some caution:  I walked right past this place on the other side of the street because it is next to a garden center and its shrubs obscured its sign and I didn't realize I had passed it until a block later.  Most buildings on the street don't have street numbers on their front.  Also, the earlier you can get to breakfast the better.  It gets really, really crowded and the staff has some difficulty keeping up with the demand.  Also, I was surprised when the housekeeping staff removed my personal water bottle from the desk in my room, something I was using during my travels.  And the hvac in my room blows air right over the bed, which was uncomfortable until I fell asleep. But the view of the Empire State Building from my room at night was awesome.

Initially I hopped around from a few different hotels before coming across this one. Since then I stayed exclusively at this hotel for roughly 6months straight. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. NYC can be an expensive city so having breakfast included is a great way to keep expenses down and something that should not be overlooked. Additionally the location is great. You can walk to MSG, Penn Station, Times square, Empire State building, etc. While all these locations and more are walkable you don't have to deal with the massive crowds\/congestion of times square at this location. There are plenty of great restaurants within walking distance. Additionally the proximity to Penn Station makes taking the LIRR to JFK extremely easy and makes planning trips to the airport without the worry of traffic.\n\nThe rooms themselves are not massive but they are clean and accommodating and I had no problems with my oversized luggage bags fitting. Additionally if you plan to visit NYC and desire to spend the majority of your time in any hotel room then you need to reevaluate why you are visiting NYC.\n\nI would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning to visit NYC for a brief or extended stay.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Now, if you have allergies or the bugs like you that's a second problem, so use insect repellant and have your allergy tables on hand, mainly pine , conifer if it bothers you. \nI had a great view of the Empire State Building, unfortunately between us was a building site, well a few in fact, opposite side of the road, and at the moment they are putting in the piles for the foundation. What that means is an excavator ramming in rods into the ground with a huge hammer, pretty much every 2 seconds and seemed to last all day (including Saturday) so dont ask for the view if you want to relax. \nThe hotel is constantly getting cleaned which is good, if you don't want to climb over bags of rubbish ask for a room away from the lift, ( the lift also makes a noise like trainers on a squash court when it goes past you floor)\nFinally, papers plates and plastic spoons and forks,paper cups for coffee for breakfast, bizarre \nNot for me, sorry not a Marriott","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Valet parking was $55 for the night but literally had 2 days of parking (that's important in NYC) the front desk even held our bags after checkout so we could eat lunch then return to pick up the car. Location of the hotel is great we were able to get to meatpacking district and midtown within minutes and being in the middle of the flower district was nice scenery as well. There is free starbucks coffee in the lobby ,free breakfast from 7am-10am (I love that this was a late breakfast I always wake up to late at other places that offered), and free bottled water if you ask the front desk. The rooms are clean and air condition is quiet and works well. Bathrooms are nice, good water pressure in the shower, hair dryer available and Paul Mitchell amenities. The staff at the front desk, housekeeping and maintenance are all so nice. We asked for late check out and they said yes without hesitation. \n\nOk, now the shortcomings...but nothing that was not handled appropriately and with a smile. The toilet would not flush on 3 occasions and maintenance had to be called (not our fault...just flushing mechanism did not work). The second time called was in the morning and took over an hour to get someone to fix it. We did have a bit of a wait (30min+) when we called valet for the car but the front desk did notify us of the wait time prior. The room smelled musty when we first went in for about 15 minutes until the AC cleared itself (front desk offered to give us a new room without question but we declined as the smell went away). Breakfast does get crowded even though there is a good amount of seating- we ate in the lobby on the couches...perhaps they need more outdoor seating. The hair dryer might have been overheated as it got very very hot without a lot of air probably would have burned my hair so it was not used. \nIn the end the front desk (each person from night shift to morning) was extremely kind and accomodating.

When we returned, it was pleasantly quiet.  The next morning, the noise started at 7 AM.  We couldn't sleep, so we went down for the free breakfast.

The hotel is ideally located near Penn Station, tons of restaurants, great NYC florists, subway stops, etc. I was thrilled to arrive and be the designated \"guest of the day\", with a complimentary upgrade to to the 18th floor (rm 1806). (...Proof that Marriott Rewards is worth signing up for.) The skyline view from this room, including a perfect angle on the Empire State Bldg, just can't be beat-- classic, charming NYC. I was taking pics from my window nonstop. If you need daytime sleep, there's some construction noise across the street, but it's not excessive & they were done by 5 pm during my stay. The front desk staff were always attentive, cordial, and quite helpful. My room (again, an upgrade) was a perfect size, the AC worked great (during a NYC heatwave), everything was impeccably clean and comfortable. The complimentary breakfast in the lobby is worth noting, as well-- nothing over the top, but perfect for my needs-- simple, but very tasty and fresh with various hot and cold items. This is simply a great, convenient hotel, such a terrific value -- incredibly clean & well-kept -- I will undoubtedly stay there again soon!","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It's on a street known for its flower and plant shops and as such the sidewalk is a bit crazy, but it makes for pretty scenery.\n\nI checked in online (use the Marriott app - it's great!) and was given a room on the 17th floor. No view for me but that's alright. I wish the room had a refrigerator but there was a coffee machine and the iron was clean (here for work - need a good iron). \n\nThe room itself was absolutely fantastic. Truly. The fixtures were far above what I'm used to in a Fairfield property. The shower was enormous - beautiful glass enclosure, strong water pressure - just ideal. I always wish that NYC hotels would consider going with just one nightstand and squeezing a soft couch chair in there somehow but the desk chair was adequate enough (people need to stop complaining about NYC room sizes). \n\nThe people were terrific as well. They couldn't find a package I had sent prior to my arrival for a bit but we eventually tracked it down. Breakfast is complimentary and served in a clean, bright room - kudos to the folks working that shift (very friendly). I had some struggles with a printer one afternoon and they dealt with that issue quickly as well. Just a really responsive staff.\n\nI'm definitely going to stay here again if\/when the price is right (the rooms even here can creep over $400 per - don't like that!).

The more frustrating part is that no one contacted me in advance to notify me.  \n\nWe then got two rooms next to each other at a reduced rate.

We said yes, but it bothered us to be woken up for something that they could have checked on in the lobby.  We then put our do not disturb sign up since we were still sleeping.  45 minutes later someone came and knocked on our door waking us up again to ask if we needed a towel, which we did not.  \n\nAll in all for a one day stay I thought it was more of a headache than a help and would not stay there again.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The best parts I liked were that the rooms were reasonably spacious for a Manhattan hotel, the reception staff was quite warm (there was a relatively senior lady one of the mornings who was so quick to understand I was a tea drinker and quickly arranged for everything in the middle of the morning rush), the breakfast restaurant was well-equipped (even during the snowstorm), the bathrooms were perfectly clean and I got a fantastic view of The Empire State Building from my room (1402)! Also, there was possibly a Hispanic member of staff, a young lady, who had this very special attitude of coming into the breakfast area in the morning and greeting whoever made eye contact with a very vibrant, \"Good Morning\" - she was very helpful with many of the senior guests too. The range of teas was also impressive and I was also impressed by all the healthy items that were available for breakfast as walnuts, etc. Overall, things were clean, of good quality and reasonably warm (just that Countryside, boutique feel with the New Yorkish touch of speed and efficiency).\n\nAnother big plus, given I am Indian, was that there were a whole bunch of Indian restaurants on Lexington Avenue, just a short walk from the hotel. Also, if you did not want to take a taxi, there were multiple train stations nearby. And Macy's and J C Penney and a whole host of branded shops were just a walk away.\n\nThere were a few misses, of course, (you expect some over a 12 day period), like the TV remote was just missing (though I got to noticing that only after a few days) and though they knew early on that I was not a coffee person, they did not arrange a tea kettle as a replacement and only on one day of the 3-4 days I asked, the receptionist just did not get me tea in my room in the morning since I did not want to use the coffee machine to make tea since it could smell of coffee!. \n\nAnother miss was that though I told the possibly Hispanic young lady about preparing all guests about the snowstorm since many of us were from outside New York or like me, not an American and though she said it was a good idea, she possibly could not convince the management to act on it and they did not send any information and we were left to figuring out ourselves. Luckily, I had a lot of friends whom I could call and figure out what to do. Like, since I am a vegetarian, I decided to stock up on a few essentials during the snowstorm and they promptly arranged a refrigerator (which honestly I expected in the room in a top hotel as this, and I am used to amazing hospitality in good hotels in India and I should have understood that this was the US and Manhattan at that and special things do not come without request or payment here - they did not charge me for that).\n\nAlso, one of the days I needed a taxi quickly and the staff just asked me to walk to the corner and hail a Yellow Cab which actually took a full 15 minutes to get and I will have expected them to call for an Uber or figure out a faster mechanism to get me a cab - again, this one was not an easy one to fulfill and I wound not consider this one as a big miss.\n\nThe internet was also patchy at times.\n\nOverall, if it were not for those misses, I will have given a 5-star rating here (I rarely give!) and nevertheless, if you are on a bleisure trip (business + leisure) trip or just a business trip, I will certainly recommend staying at this hotel - I have good memories of New York from here!","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room was comfortable, clean and exceptionally quiet, and the hotel, itself, was spotless, secure, and inviting. I arrived before check-in time, and while they prepared my room, I was made comfortable in a relaxing room provided with a TV, long table, computers and beverages for guests. Check-in was a breeze, and the receptionist was very welcoming. \n\nIndeed EVERYONE from the front desk, to the custodian in the elevator to breakfast room attendant was polite and personable. But I should mention two people, in particular, who made the stay exceptional. The first is sales manager, Kathy Mendez, who personally welcomed me and arranged for me to use the \"Green Room\" part of the breakfast room for a film interview. The stress that normally attends such a project was enormously reduced by Ms Mendez whose lovely, gracious presence was professional, warm and reassuring. I felt quite at home and supremely at ease.\n\nThe other notable is Jessica Jimenez whose genuine smile and natural charm at the front desk provide a wonderfully inviting beacon of assistance. She went out of her way to find me a choice of restaurants and was concerned as to my dining experience afterwards which precipitated a conversation that left me smiling and refreshed after a hectic day in the city. \n\nThe included breakfast was the an unexpected treat and was one of the best I have encountered in the city. Moist scrambled eggs, fresh orange juice, oatmeal, quality brand yogurts, and many other choices were available for guests to partake of in the accommodating glassed-in breakfast room with its pleasing natural light. \n\nThe location, a mere seven-minute walk from Penn Station, could not be more convenient, and an added bonus is that this section of West 28tn Street is the wholesale flower district of the city. So one's walk to the hotel is a pleasant mix of aromas and colors.\n\nBut it all finally comes down to people, and what truly makes this Fairfield an oasis in the city is the staff who seem to function like a happy family. I seem to have found a new home in NYC. I'd like to keep the secret to myself, but that wouldn't be fair.\n\n(Side note: at the same time of my visit a friend of mine stayed at a Fairfield in Times Square and had a miserable time with an overworked and under-attentive staff in a hotel that needed cleaning and was noisy. It's all about the management, and I hope the Fairfield on 28th St. in Chelsea keeps its present staff for a long time.)","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Upon checking in, there was a small hiccup with the rooms that were available but Teresa fixed it and we never saw the issue. Shortly after checking in we went to park our car and the lot attendant gave my husband a huge issue and almost got physical, we called Teresa not knowing what to do and she called the police and stayed on the line with us the entire time to make sure we were okay. The issue was resolved and as soon as we got back to the hotel all Teresa cared about is if we were okay, you could see in her face she was genuinely concerned. So that was our first night lol. The following night we saw her again and she wanted to hear about our day and was so sweet. We were sad to not see her the next morning for checkout but she really made our stay great! My husband is normally a tough critic when it comes to hotels mainly because he hates staying at them but this time I didn't hear one negative comment from him. \n\nOnly reason I didn't give the 5 stars is because the room isn't exactly what was pictured, I'm mainly referring to the bathroom. But I will say it was clean, and spacious. We payed half the price of our friends that were staying closer to Times Square and we had a bigger room than them! Everything was within walking distance and I loved that it wasn't so loud at night. Walking out of the hotel to see beautiful flowers lined up on the sidewalk was awesome. \n\nWe love Teresa!!

I had only visited NYC one other time and it was overwhelming.  On my daughter's recommendation of the Chelsea area of the city I booked this hotel and found it to be perfect.  There are two subway entrances close to the hotel- one right on the corner - the other a short walk that took me everywhere I wanted to go.  The hotel sits on a street in the flower district so everyday you leave the hotel and get to see all the beautiful plants and flowers being set out, it was great.  \n\nThe hotel itself was clean and the room was really comfortable if not exactly spacious.  The bathroom was fairly large considering the room itself had a king bed, desk with chair which doubled as your night stand on that side, a small night stand on the other side, and an armoire of sorts all of which took up just about all the available space.  You also don't have to worry about walking far to your room since you exit the elevator, turn left or right and your room is pretty much right there.  It was very quiet.  I was on the 5th floor facing the building next to us (not pretty but blinds closed) and could not hear the city sounds, which is actually amazing and a welcome relief after being out all day.\n\nProbably shouldn't have left the staff until last but they certainly are the best.  They remember you and welcome you back when you return from being out.  They work hard to be accommodating.  I asked one morning at breakfast if they had soy milk, the person attending the breakfast said no but they could have it in 2 minutes.  I said no don't bother, it was no big deal I would eat something else.  Next thing I know, here she comes with soy milk they had ran around the corner to buy just for me.  Pretty sweet. It did turn out that she was the assistant manager so it might have been over and above what another staff person might have done but she did make me feel like she was glad I was staying there and she wanted my experience to be a good one.

Decent, fast (and free) wifi for the duration of the stay was welcome too.  \n\nBe aware - it's in the heart of the flower district, which means that the flower wholesalers on the street below start work at about 5am.  The rooms are well soundproofed, so unlikely to disturb all but the lightest sleepers.  For us, it was a bonus - we loved getting up early and watching all the goings-on below us.\n\nBed was huge and comfortable.  Bathroom was snug but had a good sized shower.\nThere's a small gym in the basement (which we didn't use, but looked fine), plus a vending machine and ice machine.\n\nThere's no opportunity for evening meals, but you can bring back food and use the dining room.

It's only a short walk from Penn Station, and even with suitcases was ok, there's a subway station at the end of the street too, so getting about was very easy. The complimentary breakfast always helps when deciding what hotel to choose, and there was more than enough to choose, from;sausage, eggs, potato, to cereal, waffles, yogurt, fresh fruit,bagels and muffins! Overall, I would give this hotel a huge thumbs up, it was a great base for our amazing holiday!

We had a problem with housekeeping one day I felt ill so put the do not service notice on the door which was fine , however the next day we did not put out the sign but the room was not serviced so we mentioned this at reception and the housekeeping guyapologised. However I think they might have been annoyed as when we returned the beds had been straightened but not toiletries replaced no spare toilet roll and when my daughter opened the towels they were only re folded not replaced which meant we had those for 3 days yuk. Eventually after complaining again we were given loo rolls and towels but a big blemish on an otherwise perfect stay. No housekeeping tip left this trip.","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Less than 200m metres from two subway stations, almost in the shadow of the Empire State and Penn Station and Times Square are walkable.\n\nThis is New York so space is a premium and unless you have lots of money, hotels are small and tend to be a bit grubby. Accepting this, this hotel is OK. Our room was nominally for 4, but was basically two double beds in a single room. It was pretty cramped as our teenage kids are tall and so are we parents\n\nA well worked little roof terrace around the 19th floor with an incredible view of the Empire State building was a nice surprise. There is no bar in the hotel but we took a bottle of wine up on a warm evening admiring the view and listening to the sounds of the city\n\nBut where this hotel really scored was the staff. We had arrived from the rural south where the level of friendliness and courtesy are off the scale and so had braced ourselves more abrasive New Yorkers. All the staff could not be more helpful and friendly, getting us anything we needed and answering our dumb tourist questions without any hint of exasperation. We also witnessed the same treatment for other guests .A special mention for receptionist Britney who could not have been more helpful when we had to check out at lunch but were not flying until the evening. She tried to get us an even later checkout (tough as they were full) and then helped us store a huge amount of luggage and got us towels to freshen up on a sweltering day. Also got us a car which could cope with our excessive luggage. All this despite being on the late shift the night before and being heavily pregnant. All the staff (bell hops, cleaners, other receptionists and breakfast staff) was helpful, but Britany cheered up some sad brits who were on there way home after a great holiday .

Close to subway and pleasant walking distance to many attractions. In the flower district. Fast response from Uber drivers and cabs. \nAccommodation: Very comfortable. Small bathroom but the bed was great! We also had a great view of the Empire State Building\nCustomer service: Far exceeded expectations! Leo is fantastic!\nBreakfast: Satisfactory! \nGood to know: Wifi is good, there is a gym (we did not use it), comfortable rooftop access with view of the Empire State Building, Comfortable beds, blackout curtains, cold AC, hot shower, fast elevator.\n\nMy husband and I just returned from a one week stay at the Fairfield Inn in Chelsea. We booked our trip to New York as a belated honeymoon, celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary as well as my 30th birthday. As we are in our first year of marriage we wanted something that was not going to break the bank, but something that would do justice to the multiple celebrations. The Fairfield Inn met and exceeded our expectations. \n\nAbout a week before the trip my husband called and spoke with Leo letting him know the purpose of our trip. Leo went above and beyond making our stay special. He was able to offer us an upgraded room and greeted us with a warm welcoming smile when we checked in. As we arrived several hours early, the staff offered to hold our luggage for us (for free) so we could go explore the city while we waited. Once we came back and checked into our room we were incredibly pleased by everything. The room was very comfortable and the view of the Empire State Building was unexpected and very nice! \n\nA factor for our decision to book with Fairfield Inn was the included breakfast. We were not expecting anything spectacular and would have been perfectly fine with cereal and bagels. The breakfast did include cereal and bagels, but also muffins, toast, hot eggs, fruit, a breakfast meat (sausage or bacon), waffles, yogurt, coffee, tea and much more. We ate breakfast downstairs almost every morning and enjoyed the variety. \n\nThe staff were always very friendly and accommodating to us. We were meet with a smile and polite greeting every morning when we headed out, and friendly conversation upon return regarding our day. Everyone that we interacted with seemed to meet us where we were at. If we wanted to chat a bit, they kindly obliged and engaged in pleasant conversation. If we were worn out and just looking to get to our room, they did not intrude.\n\nThe day we were to check out was very rainy. Since check out was at noon, but our flight did not leave until 7pm, Leo was able to allow us to check out late so we did not have to arrive at the airport 7 hours early. \n\nThe absolute cherry on top of this fantastic stay was the little surprise we got one even upon returning to our room. The staff had decorated our room with rose petals, fruit, cupcakes, a bottle of wine and a card wishing us a happy anniversary. We were so blown away by the attention to detail and the customer service we experienced during our stay. \n\nMy husband and I plan on returning to NYC regularly (Yankee fans!) and I know where we will be booking again.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were attending a concert there Friday and arrived early.  We were told that early check in was to be determined upon availability on arrival. We were pleasantly surprised to find an available room on the 12th floor with a perfect view of the Empire State Building! The front desk clerk, Bethany, was a HUGE help and a doll to work with.  Another surprise was the rooftop terrace! We enjoyed many cocktails up there while enjoying the unobstructed view of the Empire State Building!  BYOB :) The rooms were clean and the bed was VERY comfortable, especially after a day of walking around the city. However, the bathroom was a tad small.  You're in NYC though, so it's to be expected.  I woke up the next morning early and came downstairs to find a nice continental breakfast spread.  They had eggs, sausage, hash browns, baked goods, juice, and STARBUCKS COFFEE!! We enjoyed a great day walking around the city on Saturday and found a great Sushi place for dinner, located within the Bryant Park Hotel, Koi.  It was delicious and Ya Ya the hostess went out of her way to seat us at the perfect table! On the morning of our departure, we called down to front desk to ask for the valet to bring our car and were told there was a two hour wait. We were not in any rush to get home. So, this didn't upset us, but if you need to get out at a specific time.  PLAN ACCORDINGLY!!! It seemed as though there was only one man working the valet service, and on a Sunday morning at check out time, it's VERY BUSY! So, we went to plan B.  Bethany, at the front desk couldn't have been more helpful and understanding.  There is a $1500 charge for checkout time past 11:00 and she waved that for us, as well as gave us some good ideas on what to do with our \"free time.\" We ended up taking a left out of the hotel doors and ran into the Highline walking trail.  I highly recommend it! We had an amazing view of the Hudson River and lots of surprises along the way!  Eventually we ended up at the Chelsea Market and were again pleasantly surprised!!!  We made it back by 11:30 to find our car waiting outside the hotel for us.  We had a great weekend and will definitely be back to the Fairfield Inn!  :)","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Big enough for two people but not a large suite. The bathroom was quite small and lacked bench space to put anything. The water from the cold tap in the bathroom in warm\/hot so not very nice to drink from.\n\nThe breakfast was basic; cereal, toast, bagels, yoghurt, fruit salad if you were lucky, and two hot options; either sausage patties, dry overcooked bacon, fried potatoes or scrambled egg patties which weren't appealing. There was also free starbucks coffee you could help yourself to anytime of the day.\n\nThe let down was that there was hardly ever water available to drink at breakfast, I think I counted twice there was a glass water dispenser by the coffee you could help yourself to, otherwise you only had juice, coffee or tea to drink. A hot chocolate option would be a nice addition too. Also, the cereals weren't refilled during the breakfast sittings and most if not all options were high in sugar children style options.\n\nThe fruit salad was also not refilled so if you weren't down there early you were tough out of luck.\n\nOur last morning there was a Sunday and the hotel clearly had a lot of guests. We had to go away then come back for breakfast as the first time there was no where to sit. Upon our return we noticed that even though there was clearly people still coming down close to 10:30 am (which is the finishing time for breakfast), possibly due to having to go away and come back again like us, the staff packed up breakfast bang on time. The breakfast maid was literally taking the bread away while people were still queuing for the toaster machine and locking up all the plates and cutlery etc. It actually felt quite mean and snarky and I witnessed a lot of disgruntled guests who missed out. We understand things have to run on schedule, but the dining area is too small for a large number of guests to use at one time and so maybe the hotel should either extend the weekend dining times or be a little bit lenient so nobody misses out.\n\nThe best part of the hotel was their front of house employee Daniel, who always greeted us when we entered, was extremely welcoming and helpful with any questions or issues and farewelled us like we were friends.\n\nOverall a good stay and we would recommend this hotel to others and would probably stay at it again if we ever returned to New York.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff was very nice, friendly and helpful.  The street is also interesting in that apparently this very block of Manhattan is some kind of \"floral district\" so regardless of the warm weather \"aroma\" NYC tends to give you this time of year... each early morning, the vendors start to set out their flowers, trees, shrubs and plants for distribution\/sale.  The bonus that this street smells wonderful!  Then each evening, they move them back indoors and it's like it never happened.  But all and all, to an out of towner, it seemed like a pretty average big city street with a couple of indirect added bonuses.  There are a couple of average-good restaurants nearby and a Duane Reade market on nearly every corner.\n\nAgain, upon arrival the front desk staff was very kind and immediately offered a dinner destination (which was just ok).  Be forewarned, most things about this hotel are quite small, including the lobby.  By far the smallest lobby I've experienced.  They they did somehow manage a nice little patio area out front to safely watch NY life go by.\n\nThe rooms are also fairly, if not quite, small.  I did have a King bed with 2 nightstands, a desk, a TV stand\/dresser, small closet and small bathroom.  All of which were very clean, including the shower (usual giveaway on cleanliness).  The room was semi-modern and had a reasonable amount of outlets for charging all of todays devices, but I would have preferred a couple more on the night stands (1 per nightstand) and possibly some USB chargers around the room as most new hotels do.  \n\nThe bathroom was tiny (door has to be opened and closed to get around it to use the vanity), but usable.  Again, shower\/tub with cloth curtain was clean and water pressure was decent.  Vanity was small but perfectly functional.  Vanity mirror had an ambient light that is a nice feature.  Bathroom did have a overhead light out that made it a bit dark though.  All and all, better than average all around the restroom though.\n\nUpon arrival for some reason the TV was unplugged and the remote seemed to not want to respond to it very well.  But ultimately it satisfied.  Street view was interesting (from 9th floor) and I was able to see the Empire State Building from the room\/bed - that was kind of cool.  Otherwise, interesting views of other building rooftops and city life.\n\nI opted to take the hotel up on their black car back to the airport on my final morning at their recommendation - they said it would ultimately be cheaper than a cab or Uber - but with tip (20%) it ended up just under $80.

Family members from Buffalo & Rochester came down on Amtrak to join me.  They chose this hotel because it was within walking distance from Penn Station.  I came in on local Metro North Railroad and took the subway down.  Easy-Peasy!  The hotel was small (11 floors \/ 10 or less rooms per floor.) but the rooms were very spacious for NYC.  The price was excellent.  The hotel is on 28th....which is where they sell wholesale flowers & plants.  So the walk from the subway, restaurants, and other local businesses was down a sidewalk filled with beautiful flowers.  How enchanting is that?\nHotel staff was friendly.  The breakfast was included....the dining room was a bit crowded during the \"breakfast rush\"...which was between 8 and 9 am.  Many times the coffee urn was empty, however, there was always coffee and tea in the breakfast room at all hours.  Afternoon tea ?  Yes you can!\nIf you are on a budget and don't mind a quite neighborhood hotel - this is the one for you.  It's close to 2 subway lines and there were lots of taxis available.  Two local markets within a block of the hotel....for a quick beer run after a busy sightseeing day.  Perfect.  Marriott never disappoints.","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It's near 34st and in a walking distance from union square. \nComplimentary Breakfast is a great bonus  !\n2 things disturbed us : 1. No wifi for a couple of days .\n2. On our second night someone opened our door room at 10pm while we were sleeping without knocking . We asked the front desk for some answers-until today non... ( one week already from our return)","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Se encuentra ubicado magn\u00edficamente, con dos l\u00edneas de metro muy cercanas, la l\u00ednea roja (1,2) y la amarilla (N,Q y R) y cerca de muchos puntos de inter\u00e9s, como pueden ser el Empire State o el Madison Square Garden. En cuanto al Hotel en s\u00ed, destaco la comodidad de la cama y el desayuno, que ten\u00eda gran variedad de productos y caf\u00e9 rico, y  a la chica latina que estaba por las ma\u00f1anas en el comedor trabajando, muy simp\u00e1tica y servicial. Adem\u00e1s cuenta con una azotea con unas vistas interesantes a la ciudad. Por ponerle una pega, el aire acondicionado de la habitaci\u00f3n puede ser algo molesto, puesto que de vez en cuando hace un ruido, pero es algo que se soluciona en cuanto investigas un poco y el fr\u00edo que hac\u00eda en la zona de desayuno, que ten\u00eda el aire acondicionado activado aun habiendo -10 grados fuera. En fin, recomendar\u00eda el hotel. No es el mejor en el que me he alojado en esta ciudad, pero la relaci\u00f3n calidad precio hace que sea una magn\u00edfica elecci\u00f3n si quieres tenerlo todo a mano.","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel was clean, front desk staff great, breakfast was sufficient. Did not use the gym but took a peek and it too looked sufficient. The Fairfield will validate parking in a covered garage steps away from the front door for 30.00 a day. Well worth it! Keep in mind these were weekend prices and costs jump significantly during the week. We're going back to the city mid May and unfortunately prices have doubled so we will be staying in Stamford Connecticut. I wish this wasn't the case because we enjoyed our stay at the Fairfield.","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

A great location, within a walking distance to all main attractions and surrounded by many cool restaurants. Subway station only 2 mins away. The room was very clean and modern, we got upgraded to a city view room and I would highly recommend it as the hotel overlooks the Empire State building. The breakfast was very adequate, with a selection of cereal, bagels, cakes and eggs & sausages, not very busy and the food never ran out. Coffee and tea available throughout the day which was very handy in winter. The room was cleaned daily. The staff were very nice and helpful. We will definitely be staying there again and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting New York. Stayed for 6 days in February as a couple.","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's a little bit of an adventurous street which seems to be converting to the minimum service hotels of every chain.  Check in was a little bit of an adventure with one agent being on the phone and having to help me at the same time.\n\nRooms are minute. (Not like 60 seconds, but like insanely tiny).  it's probably the smallest hotel room I've ever been in, including anything in the classic London hotels.  BUT....it is immaculate. The rooms was in top notch condition. Everything worked, there are ample plugs, free and functional wifi, the usual HDTV and a really decent shower.\n\nThis is not a luxury place by any means but it is a bargain for the neighborhood and actually kinda cute.","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Obviously, it's a Fairfield Inn and not a high-end Marriott, but the location in the northern part of Chelsea met my needs: a long walk to NYU (or take the nearby N train) but close proximity to the Empire State Bldg., Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and the ultimate Macy's -- all lots of fun to walk to at night (not a great nearby restaurant scene, however). Best was the dollar value: on a Sunday night, I spent less than $100, including taxes, which is an extraordinary bargain in NYC. Also important was the staff and basic amenities: terrific, super-friendly young woman at the desk, a free modest breakfast where everything was done right and seating was comfortable, a discount on nearby overnight parking ($35 a good price in NYC!), and good wi-fi, tv, excellent bed, and endless hot water in the shower.  So, while the room was much smaller than I'm accustomed to in a Fairfield Inn or other Marriott, the overall value was worth the compromise.  I'll stay here again (with a Hilton Garden Inn and new Hotel Indigo going up across the street, the prices will hopefully stay competitive).","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

From that perspective, the Fairfield Inn is outstanding. Sure, the rooms are small, but this is Manhattan! And anywhere else but NYC, you'd probably expect more for $300+ a night. However, the hotel is new, modern and very well-maintained. Our room was cleaned each morning while we were having breakfast downstairs. That's pretty unique. Again, as a former Manhattanite, I can attest to how quiet the rooms are, if you forgo the view (not much to speak of unless you're on a high floor) and take a room at the back of the hotel. You'll face other buildings and there is no natural light, but you won't have street noise. \n\nFrom the moment we arrived, the front desk folks were helpful and professional. They worked to find us a room to our liking. They greeted us every time we came and went. And they always asked if they could do anything for us. Even the staff in the breakfast room were helpful. One morning I wasn't feeling well and the staff helped my husband select and package some food to bring to the room. They are also very vigilant in terms of keeping all of the breakfast items restocked.\n\nThe location is superb. You can walk to Times Square, Chelsea, the West Village, and you are in the middle of NoMad, a new hotel and restaurant district. There is a subway on either side of the hotel--one line on 6th Ave and another on 7th. And the Broadway and Lexington Ave lines are only a few blocks away. \n\nThis is not a luxury hotel so don't expect plush towels and high-end toiletries. But if you want a great location and great service at a reasonable price, this is the place to stay.","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This hotel was great. We were surprised to find parking across the street and did not have to pay the muni-meter (check on weekdays tho). Very convenient access to shopping and trains. It is located in the Flower District, which was refreshing. The room is nicely furnished, comfortable bed but small room. Small is not a bad thing because they did it right with the shelves, desk, armoire, and bathroom layout. We only enjoyed a little breakfast (our own choice of brunch places), and it was nicely done. The breakfast area is nice, spacious, and updated. We are looking to come back in the next few months. Hotel staff helpful and nice.

This was slightly larger room than the standard room, and we were pleasantly surprised by the size. The bed was very comfortable, the shower large and clean. We had a terrific view of the Empire State Building, which was definitely appreciated. As with some other reviews, we also only had one set of towels on arrival, but a call to the front desk and this was fixed within 10 minutes. Breakfast was more than adequate, but did get a bit boring after a week. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the short walk to 2 subway lines makes this an excellent location for getting around New York. On a very positive note, this was a quiet location, and we never had any trouble sleeping. Only one critical comment, most of the towels are getting to the end of their useful life and need to be replaced. Overall, highly recommended.","travelDate":"2015-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff were welcoming and nice, the room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom modern and clean although only one bath towel supplied and had to request another on arrival. Bed\/pillows comfortable and air-conditioning was ok and the window could be opened a little for some fresh air. The size of the room was on the smaller side but all good as it is NY and spent the days and evenings out and about. Had a great view of the Empire State Building when it wasn't cloudy.Breakfast was slightly more than a continental breaky with a small but adequate selection of cereals, fruit, yoghurt and eggs and bread and pastries but it was a quicker than the dead exercise and noticed some people with big bags and coats with big pockets, making sure they survive any future famine! The hotel ticked the right boxes for location, close proximity  to a supermarket and bottle shop, restaurants, cafes and takeaway shops  and shopping and central enough for a good base for plenty of walking to Times Square, Theatre District etc and not far from Penn station for ongoing travel.","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This was booked through hotels.com,we almost always stay at Marriott brands and this was less expensive than those in times square.   It is close to the subway station, maybe a 5 minute walk, that made it nice to get where we wanted quickly.  Lots of little places to eat all around.  The hotel did offer fresh cookies each night.  The rooms were clean, but TINY, I was hoping for a great view of empire state building, but instead we got a level 4 room that faced another building and every evening we had to close the blinds because it was a yoga studio we could see them, and they could see us.  This hotel does have a roof top you can go & see great views of empire state building.  I did have a couple complaints, the first day at check in we get to the room, it had only one bath towel & 2 hand towels, I called down and asked for another towel , one for each of us & wash cloths, with in a few minutes they did bring us another towel and hand towel- not wash cloth but it was late, so we made do.  The following day of our stay we came back to the hotel & our room had not been cleaned, we got in and there was a do not disturb tag on our door, I understand why it was not cleaned but I didn't place it there, not sure if it was in the hall on floor or what - but again I called front desk, and at least asked for fresh towels, 30 minutes later we still did not have the towels, I called again, they came within a few minutes.   They offered breakfast, all the normal things, starbucks coffee, tea, hot chocolate, eggs, sausage, oatmeal, cereal, bagels, toast & muffins, yogart, boiled eggs.  The breakfast area got really busy in the mornings and one morning there was no seating, When we ate at 8 am or earlier it was busy but still seating, the last day it was almost 9, a lot of food was gone, but they were working on getting it replaced, but so many people would line up & take everything just placed out- I definitely recommend going earlier for better selection & enjoyment! They held our luggage while we toured city on last day since check out was a t noon and our flight was at 8:30 p,m,   Overall we enjoyed our stay. My biggest complaint was I didn't realize when booking through hotel.com we would not accrue our Marriott reward points, once I booked my delta tickets I was transferred over & booked directly through them, This was upsetting because of our week long stay I missed out on over 12,000 points, had I known this locations rules on that I would have called them directly. Also my preference of feather free room that is set up in my Marriott profile didn't go over, so I did ask on 2nd day to have linens changed because I am allergic to feathers and by day 2 my eyes were so swollen.","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we have had issues, and let's face it when you stay in a Hotel every week, you are going to have issues, they have been addressed immediately and the team makes us feel like valued \"friends\".  I want to also add that the Owners of the property have personally reached out to us to make sure we are being taken care of, and when do you hear of things like that happening today.

The other front desk, maids, maintenance, and food service employees were all extremely friendly, helpful and outgoing.  With the service I could've sworn I was at a Ritz.  The location is very good, not great, but very good, subway stations are close by, or cab fares to major landmarks are very reasonable, or you can get some exercise and walk to Times Square, Rockfeller, Grand Central, Penn Station, etc. Nice quiet (for NYC) street, nice rooftop to relax and look at Empire State Building.  Street is unofficial flower district, so it was pleasant seeing some greenery every morning\/afternoon. Parking isn't cheap, but thats NY, also valet can take awhile, so would recommend self parking. Decent food options in the area, not great but decent.Breakfast did the job, typical Fairfield, Residence Inn fare, carry you a few hours. My family found our new hotel when staying in Manhattan.

Un complimento v\u00e0 sicuramente al personale giovane e veramente gentile, sia quello della hall sia quello addetto al servizio colazione. Su booking avevamo prenotato una camera King con vista citt\u00e0\u2026..arriviamo di sera e ci assegnano una camera al 2\u00b0 piano\u2026..praticamente \u2013 come si pu\u00f2 notare dalla foto \u2013 eravamo in mezzo alla strada. Gi\u00e0 quando siamo entrati nella stanza non avevamo avuto una buona impressione perch\u00e9 la finestra sembrava essere proprio in mezzo al traffico newyorkese; inoltre, la stanza era molto buia e un po\u2019 squallida nell\u2019arredamento. L\u2019hotel si trova tra la 28^ strada e la 6^ Avenue in zona Chelsea, nel cosiddetto distretto dei fiori infatti la strada \u00e8 piena di fiorai che di sera tolgono tutte le piante che mettono sui marciapiedi per rimontare il tutto di mattina anche molto presto quando c\u2019\u00e8 un via vai di camion che scaricano piante e fiori (anche alle 2\/3\/4 di notte). Praticamente, la prima notte gi\u00e0 stanchi del lungo viaggio fatto di certo non abbiamo trovato comfort nella stanza d\u2019albergo. N\u00e9 io n\u00e9 mio marito abbiamo chiuso occhio, era impossibile, troppo rumore, stanza assolutamente non insonorizzata il che \u00e8 assurdo nella citt\u00e0 che non dorme mai. La mattina seguente gi\u00e0 alle h 7.30 circa eravamo nella hall per segnalare il tutto, devo dire che subito ci hanno capito (il personale parla quasi soltanto in inglese o spagnolo) e senza fare storie (sicuramente anche altri hanno lamentato lo stesso fatto) ci hanno detto che durante l\u2019arco della giornata ci avrebbero cambiato stanza, ma non sapevano bene a che ora sarebbe potuto accadere ci\u00f2. Nel tardo pomeriggio, al ns. rientro in hotel dopo un giro per la citt\u00e0, ci hanno assegnato una stanza al 14\u00b0 piano che sicuramente era pi\u00f9 silenziosa ma anche pi\u00f9 luminosa (c\u2019erano pi\u00f9 lampade), pi\u00f9 accogliente e con una bella vista sull\u2019Empire State Building. Il bagno in camera comodo soprattutto una grande doccia ma asciugamani molto sottili. E\u2019 consuetudine di questo albergo includere la colazione nella tariffa ma al mattino devo dire che mi ha lasciato un po\u2019 delusa perch\u00e9 c\u2019era veramente poco e soprattutto ogni giorno per 7 giorni di seguito sono state presentate le stesse identiche poche cose. In conclusione, dopo che ci hanno cambiato la camera siamo stati bene e ribadisco che il personale \u00e8 veramente super gentile e sempre sorridente, ma di certo non sceglierei nuovamente questa sistemazione a New York perch\u00e9,  con una differenza non esagerata, si riesce a trovare di meglio sicuramente in zona meno trafficata e quindi pi\u00f9 silenziosa. Non lo consiglio soprattutto a chi ha il sonno leggero come il mio.","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Great accommodations and lodging experience in the true center of Manhattan.  Great location and central to all our favorite haunts.  Situated between two major subway lines traveling the spine of Manhattan -- one block or less from the 1-2-3 lines on the west and the N-Q-R lines on the east -- 10 minutes or less via subway to Midtown and Times Square uptown and SoHo\/Canal Street\/Lower Manhattan downtown.  Situated in the middle of the block on a street full of florists and flower supply shops -- this portion of W. 28th Street should be named \"Flower Street\".  \n\nThe rooms are surprisingly modern and spacious for NYC, and had all the amenities we needed.  Roomy desk and closets, large flat-screen TV, spacious bathroom and sink area.  A bit tight on deep enough space to lay out two open suitcases, though.  Room thermostat and ventilation was more than adequate.  Free wireless internet service in our room and public areas was also satisfactory and easy to use.  Great view of the Empire State Building from our room, especially at night -- it looked so close I had to ask the front desk clerk for confirmation just to make sure -- making it slightly reminiscent of scenes from \"Sleepless in Seattle\". \n\nComplimentary breakfast in the morning was organized and very satisfactory.  Eggs and breakfast sausage, along with breads, rolls, cereals, juice and coffee was standard fare.  Surprisingly situated greenhouse dining area in the rear of the property made breakfast a very pleasant experience.  If that wasn't enough, there are Starbucks and McDonalds right down the block in either direction.  \n\nThis neighborhood is a shopper's paradise.  Macy's flagship store is less than 6 blocks walk uptown on 34th St and Broadway or you can take a train.  On Saturday, there is a long 9-block outdoor marketplace and farmer's market all along Broadway from 23rd St. to 14 St. (the street is closed to traffic).  Continue down Broadway to Canal St. to explore this great SoHo shopping district.  Also close by to the hotel are Madison Square Garden and Penn Station just a few blocks walk from the hotel to the west.  \n\nThe hotel staff and daytime manager were extremely courteous and helpful during the extent of our weekend stay, beginning with the complimentary chocolate chip cookies when check in.  The service (including Housekeeping) was excellent -- they accommodated our every request.  On the last day (check-out), they offered complimentary bag service in their locked storage area until our scheduled airport shuttle arrived.  \n\nAll in all, we had nothing but extremely positive experiences at this hotel.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat, and definitely plan to.  Highly recommended !!!","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They were very friendly and very attentive to my needs. They made sure I was comfortable in my room and helped me greatly when I needed to adjust my reservation. The valet service leaves a lot to be desired, not because of the facility but because of the service providers themselves, they were not very good at bringing around the vehicles in the time they should. Twice I had to wait more than an hour to obtain my vehicle from them.  I felt as if the room was bigger than I would have thought and I think it's because there is not a wall between the hallway from the door to the bed and the bathroom as there are with quite a few hotels in Manhattan. The room was very comfortable. I believe if you have a room to the northeast you will have of the city and the Empire State Building but you can ask the front desk as they were very kind to offer a room with a view, it will cost a bit more naturally but the view is really nice from a high floor.  If you're not familiar with Manhattan, this is the Chelsea area and the streets are pretty busy 24\/7 so be prepared to give yourself time to get to from the hotel if you are driving or catching a cab. 6th Ave is not even a 1\/4 of a block from the hotel so you can walk to pretty much everything you need without a long hike.","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We went downstairs shortly thereafter. There was a lot of construction on the street, so we asked the desk for guidance on where we would be met.

The price we found for this Fairfield Inn was the best rate for a centrally located h\u00f2tel. We were pleased we found it. The hotel is located amongst florist shops, and we walked right by it at first. There are tons of shops, cafes, and restaurants nearby. I love Argo for tea, and it's right around the corner. It's close enough to the theatre district to be an easy walk, but far enough away to avoid the crowds.  The rooms are clean. Beds are super comfortable. We didn't have much of a view, but we couldn't complain because our room was so quiet at night. My only complaints were the noisy AC and the very poor free wifi service. The staff was friendly, but not as helpful as the staff at our usual NYC hotel. Breakfast was included with the room and included cold cereal, bagels, toast, yogurt, fruit, scrambled egg and pork sausage. How nice it would be if they offered turkey or chcken sausage instead of pork! Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and this may be our second choice h\u00f2tel from now on when we go to NYC.","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was my fourth time in NYC and keeping in mind that most hotels in the city can be cramped, our room was perfect for the two of us, unlike hotels I've stayed in in the financial district and midtown.  It was nice to have a king sized bed and a large shower.  There is so much to do and see around the hotel, with many historic buildings within walking distance and two main subways within the block! We ate sushi at Kobeaki on 7th ave and around 26th street, a gyro from the street cart and one night we walked over to the flat iron building and ate at Madison Square Eats and Eataly.  BRING GOOD WALKING SHOES!!!\n\nThe breakfast was standard, but still very filling, and the view from the penthouse (which they say isn't advertised, but you can go up there) is amazing.  I do wish they had a fridge in the room, but it wouldn't impact my decision to stay here again.  I just loved being greeted by the staff every time we entered! It's true what you read, the hotel is VERY clean, and even though our view was of the back alley, it was still a nice view of the old buildings, and I found it mostly quiet. 28th street was busy during the day, but very quiet at night.  Not scary, but always be careful into the late night in the city. \n\nOne thing to be cautious about is airport access.  It's completely doable, but be sure to give yourself ample time. We flew in from Newark and took the air-train to Penn Station for $12.50 and walked the 4 blocks to the hotel, which worked great, but on the way back we didn't want to chance having to wait for a train back to the airport so we got a car service for around $100. But we did feel less stressed and also didn't have to lug our bags around as much.  If we would have timed it better, we would have taken the train back to the airport for cheaper!!","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel.  We love this hotel because of its location, as it is within easy walking distance of several attractions.  In addition, the hotel is not located in a congested area of New York, so noise is not an issue.  We arrived shortly before 1 PM, and there was a room available, but it was not a city view, which is what we prefer.  The checkin time is 3 PM, so we were advised to check our luggage and return at that hour.  My wife and I had lunch and toured High Line Park and then returned at 3 PM.  A city view room was now available on the 9th floor.  Our room was very clean, and it had a nice view of the Empire State Building.  The air conditioning worked very well, and it was quiet.  My wife and I had no problems sleeping that night, as the bedding was very comfortable, and there is minimal noise.  We had breakfast the next morning at the hotel, which is included in the price.  There was more than enough food to satisfy one's appetite.  In summary, my wife and I vow to stay at this hotel when we return to New York.","travelDate":"2014-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I can't comment much on the price because I paid with my points but seems pretty avg for nyc. \n\nThe room was great! We had a city view and it sure was a view! Loved waking up to the sight of all the bldgs. The room was a nice size- nothing huge, but not small either. The bathroom just had a shower- no tub, but it was updated and nice. \n\nThis location also serves breakfast every morning which I thought was a real winner. You can easily spend $20 on breakfast for two people in Nyc, so having a free meal was excellent. (we would fill up on sausage, boiled eggs, and yogurt then we would stop into a local bagel shop to buy one bagel for us to split. Best of both worlds!)  coffee was hit or miss. Sometimes the coffee (starbucks btw) was good and other times it tasted burnt or old. Not sure why. But, what was really cute about the whole breakfast thing was that they have a sunroom kinda place that is indoors but all windows for you to enjoy your breakfast. What a nice touch! It was kinda like you were eating outside! \n\nOK and now about the location..... This hotel is perfectly situated! It is close to the flatiron district, Chelsea, curry hill, Korean town, subway stops, etc. Loved it! \n\nPs: they also have a little courtyard in front with a few tables and chairs.

Every employee (too many to mention each by name), from those we spoke with by phone prior to our visit to those with whom we interracted during our stay, were both professional and personable. They made us feel right at home.

Although I hadn't stayed there the night before, the friendly desk attendant offered me breakfast.  That was unexpected and I was impressed.\n\nThe next morning, though, I was disappointed when I went to iron my shirt and suit.

I requested another board and iron from two -- yes, two -- people at the front desk, but never got it.\n\nAnother problem with the room was something that's all too common.  Style and function are a balancing act, and when it comes to bathroom renovations, far too many hotels come down way too far on the side of style.  Hip tile and fixtures are great, and I do appreciate them, but not at the expense of functionality.\n\nIt get it -- NY bathrooms are notoriously small, and there's not much room for counter space.

I would get cold so I pushed the thermostat up one degree and then the room would get boiling hot so then I pushed it down a degree and it would go off and never come back on (or worse yet one time the a\/c kicked on) till the point the room was so cold you had to go push it back up a degree.\n\nAlso the room has no draws or anyplace to put clothes or anything down. To work I had to spread out things on the bed.  There are tiny (useless) shelves in a corner and a small cupboard with hangers.  I ended up using the stone windowsill which meant everything got freezing cold.  Only other place would be to pile things on the floor and climb over them because there is no chair or bureau or .... Same in the bathroom no counter top or shelf or place to put anything other on the very small edge of the sink.\n\nThey say they have a \"full service business center\" but that turns out to be two computers in the corner of the breakfast room.  I had a word processing file to print out but there are no programs on the computers.  I asked at the front desk and the staff said they would look into it.  I asked later in the day and they attitude was \"oh well\" and the staff suggested you can go down the street to Staples. (As I pointed out later to the manager if I go down the street I can go the Indigo Hotel or the Hilton or the Holiday Inn or the Doubletree or .... all within a stone throws and better equipped for travelers.)  I said that is not a business center and the response from the front desk: complain to management.  I said you are management as far as a guest is concerned and they laughed.  I did later complain to management that the computers had no programs like Word and the response was we can not do that because of licenses.  I have stayed in a LOT of hotels (business oriented and otherwise) and this is the only one which does not have its computers set up with a basic programs.  The manager says you can down load a viewer program if you want.... really if you say you have a \"full service business center\" and want to have business travelers you need to be better set up and not expect us to be searching out and downloading programs or going down the street for a BASIC service.  \n\nPersonally as I said I would suggest one of the other hotels all within a block or two (some across the same street) any of which I have had better experiences with than this one when I stayed at those other hotels.\n\nFor a hotel in the Marriott band I expected better service and better facilities.  This hotel comes across as discount no service hotel.  Is that what Marriott wants?","travelDate":"2014-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

After all, we have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria and for much more money had no more room.\n\nBath - Small.  A very nice bathroom, but very small.  Two people cannot get ready at the same time.  Once again, we experienced the same size issues at the Waldorf.\n\nBreakfast - Perfectly Adequate.  I stay in hotels quite a bit on business.  Some offer cook to order breakfasts, others have prepackaged pastries.  Like all Fairfields, this is in the middle.  Eggs and sausage taste fine, but are obviously mass produced.  Cereal, bread, yogurt, and other options are also available.  While not fancy, the breakfast is sufficient and right in line with what others offer at this price point.\n\nLocation - Convenient.  By subway we found it was (including walking to\/from stations):\n- 20 minutes from the 9\/11 Memorial\n- 10 minutes from Times Square\n- 12 minutes from Rockefeller Center\n- 30 minutes from Central Park\n\nComplaint - Internet.  It continues to baffle me that hotels offer such S--L--O--W internet service and think it is sufficient.  If going back to NYC for business, I would have to rule out the Fairfield.

They're too cheap to provide proper heat!  Room was freezing, I turned on the heat and it never adequately kicked in. I raised it to 77 just to get some heat pumping, but it never rose above 65, and I'm being generous on that. I asked for help, the maintenance guy came in and told me that it was 77 in there because the thermostat said so. I complained an hr later, and the front desk told me that they cap the heat to save energy costs. Nice in the fall, bad when it's 20 degrees outside with snow on the ground. The \"tip\" was to set it to 74, so that the room would at least heat up to that temp. But it never even got there.\n\nWorse, my room didn't even have an extra blanket. As is, the comforter on the bed was way too thin for a winter day, even with heat. There's no way I could have spent the night there without the extra blanket. So for $250, I had the privilege to sleep in thermals. \n\nBeyond that, the free WiFi was horribly slow and unusable. Even the wired Internet connection cut in and out constantly.

When I asked to change rooms to a non-smoking floor, they informed me that the whole building was non-smoking. I don't think they ever caught the guy because my room smelled again when I returned to the room later that night.

We wanted to stay closer to Chelsea and The Village rather than uptown as we have done in the past. Also didn't want any surprises so as a Marriott Rewards members I was familiar with the hotel standards and amenities.\n\nPros:\n- Very easy access to subways to go just about anywhere.\n- Location close to Chelsea and Greenwich Village sights.\n- Located on flower district street. A beautiful, aromatic walk on the sidewalk.\n- Clean, quiet, modern room.\n- Free breakfast. Free coffee. Free WiFi.\n- Really great front desk service. Fast, friendly check in. Evening front desk (Robert) gave us good advice on local bars and restaurants. (Try \"230 Fifth\" rooftop bar and \"The Library\" at the NoMad hotel.) Plus EVERY employee we bumped into was friendly, smiled and said hello. That doesn't always happen.\n- For NYC the price was a good, competitive price.\n\nCons\n- Breakfast not exactly Five Star but we were very pleased with it. We just wanted basic eats so we could get on the move for the day. If you want fancy or full service, go somewhere else. Marriott brands serve Starbucks. Coffee drinkers either love or hate Starbucks. We aren't all that fond of it.\n- The hotel footprint is a rather small square. This makes the reception area and breakfast area kind if tight and congested. Also, saw prior comments about one guest being close to the elevators. The elevators are in the center of the building so ALL the rooms are near the elevator towers. Our room was just across from the elevator doors. NOT ONCE did we hear any elevator noise. Bottom line this is a non-issue.\n\nWe would highly recommend our new go-to hotel. Thanks to the management and staff at this hotel. We had a very nice stay.\n","travelDate":"2013-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The minor complaint is that this hotel is located in the midst of the wholesale flower business in NYC, meaning the sidewalks are narrowed daily by (a gorgeous array of) flowers and plants, making it a little tough to get down 28th Street.  My room faced out onto 28th Street, so the noise at 4:30am was a little much--maybe try to get a room that faces another direction.

Trying to match price and quality is often a challenge and we believe this hotel is a solid choice.  The staff were friendly and accommodating.  The room is totally functional though a little tight on space, especially the bathroom.  We thought with the KIng City View room we booked and that we had booked the room for a week we would have been a bit higher in the building; as it turned out we had an okay view of the Empire State building from the 8th flr and a much better view of the condo's across the street.  Breakfast each morning was the same but provided everything you needed.  The serving area is quite cramped and a few things could be moved around to make access a little easier but that is a minor complaint.  We felt sorry for the lone staff member who tried to keep all the stations full and clean up at the same time.\n\nThe hotel is located near 2 different subway stations and near bus stops heading both downtown and uptown.  Times Square is walk-able (we enjoy walking) at about 20 minutes and even easier with the subway.  Being in the Flower District was interesting watching all the stores move all those plants in and out each day.\n\nThe building had a little more noise from the street than we would have liked. The air conditioner was a little loud when it was turning on but really no worse than many other hotels\/motels we have stayed at that have individual units in the rooms.  WIth that said increasing the white noise in the room and my wife (who is a light sleeper) wearing earplugs we got the sleep we needed.\n\nThere is a Penthouse level that allows you a commanding view of the New York skyline, the only thing that was disappointing was the fans(?) or what ever they were that were roaring on the roof.  Didn't make for a very enjoyable atmosphere on the roof top.\n\nAs an aside and nothing to do with the hotel, New York can be very expensive or it can be reasonable.  Do your due diligence if money is a concern it can be the difference between between a $5-$8 glass of wine verses places that there are no selections under $15 a glass.  We were able to find many great restaurants and bars that were fun, had great food and atmosphere.

We were in the back of the building, so our window was literally looking into another building, which was a little strange (caused us to keep the blinds closed). The rooftop deck was awesome! Not much up there other than seating, but the view was amazing and so worth the trip up. I think we were up there close to a half hour just staring.\n\nI didn't get to take advantage of the breakfast area, but my husband and daughter did and said that some of the stuff was gone by the time they went down. \n\nI will definitely stay there again. Maybe with a better view next time ;)","travelDate":"2013-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We found the room to be very clean which was one of our main worries. Free Wi-Fi service is available throughout the hotel however the speed of the connection is very slow and which makes it only suitable for very light web browsing. The flat screen TV had a nice choice of channels including some premium ones such as HBO.\n\nOne of the main problems we had with the room is the lack of available power outlets near the beds. Nowadays we all travel with numerous electronic devices (iPhones, iPads, cameras, computers) that requires charging at night and with three persons in the room it was a little puzzle to get everyone's devices plugged in at night. \n\nThe hotel provides free breakfast every day which includes scrambled eggs, sausage patties, toast, bagels, cereal and fruit cocktail but to my surprise no waffles. I think I have never been to a US hotel that offers free continental breakfast and didn't have a self-serve waffle maker available in the breakfast area. That was a little disappointment for me because I really like hotel waffles but even without those the breakfast was really good.\n\nLocated on W 28th Street the hotel is within walking distance from Penn Station which is very useful for those arriving from JFK airport via Long Island Rail Road train. Macy's flagship store and Herald Square are also located close to the hotel as well as a good number of great restaurants. There is also a McDonald's, a Starbucks and a Duane Reade drugstore located within less than 5 minutes walking distance. Times Square is within 20-25 minutes walking distance from the hotel, even tough it is a feasable walk we prefered taking a cab most of the time to go there which is about a 6-7$ ride plus tip.\n\nOverall, we are very satisfied with our stay at this Fairfield Inn location. Being one of the least expensive accomodations we found on Manhattan island we were very impressed with the quality of the service we received from the front desk and housekeeping staff and would not hesitate to stay at this property again on a next visit to NYC.","travelDate":"2013-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The parking is very close, just after crossing Sixth Ave and was just $25 with hotel validation.\n\nCheck in was easy and Bethany who hails from Texas and later Brandi were super friendly and helpful. They allowed us to check in about an hour early at 2pm. Our room on the 8th floor was clean and certainly large enough for the two of us. However it's possibly a little too small to practice the hammer throw or discus!\n\nAir conditioning worked a treat and I must single out the bed as perhaps one of the most comfortable we've experienced so far. I hope Fairfield management can point us toward purchasing a similar mattress! We also loved the bathroom and large walk in shower.\n\nPublic areas were spotless, the rooftop \"penthouse\" (observatory) was a nice distraction and the breakfast area was spotless, cheerful and well stocked - not bad for a free breakfast. I also loved the small number of rooms per floor, resulting in lots of peace and quiet and the elevator responded quickly on all but one occasion. I could say that a small fridge would have been nice, but it's really difficult and probably a little bit unfair to even consider leveling criticism at this superbly run hotel. \n\nWe loved the area too and short walks south on Sixth, Seventh and eight Avenues led to a wide array of excellent eateries with the West Village within walkable distance too. I'm glad too that the hotel is south of the touristy mayhem that seems to start at around 33rd Street and move north.

The front desk staff were helpful in safely storing our baggage after checkout so we could continue sightseeing and responsive to needs like calling cabs, setting wake-up calls, getting the internet password, etc.  In one instance, a front desk clerk who helped check us in was still at the desk when we returned from sightseeing around midnight and she revealed that another staff member had called in sick so that she would have to stay until about 7 the next morning.  Even though she had every right to be tired and surly under those conditions she was funny and charming.  In speaking with the staff, they not only seemed to care about the guests of the hotel, they seemed to care about each other, which evidently makes it a pleasant working environment that they freely share with the guests.

This was a mother-daughter get-a-way planned since Jan. We took a shuttle from Newark Airport, and on arrival were greeted by friendly staff. We stayed in room 207 which does not have a good view, but was nice and quiet, so we didn't mind, and like other people have mentioned, we didn't spend much time in our room anyway.  We did go up to the terrace which was fun.  The beds were super comfortable.  Room was clean.  It was great having the breakfast included.  We always found lots to eat. Starbucks coffee was great. We did find our air conditioning very cold.  It seemed like the temperature couldn't be adjusted, so that in a matter of a few minutes, it went from being warm in the room to freezing! Especially with the room being small. We tried leaving just the fan on, but it didn't make a big difference. It was so nice to see all the flowers on the sidewalk as we stepped out in the morning. Overall, we had a great experience there, and I would have returned except for one thing that happened.  My daughter left behind a shopping bag in the wardrobe in our room (never mentioned to me that she had put it in there out of the way). She had gone to one of her favourite stores and bought 2 blouses and had also picked up a souvenir t-shirt and put it in the bag.  We did not put anything else in the wardrobe.  On arriving home, approx. 12 hrs. later, she realized that she had forgot it.  She phoned the hotel the next morning and explained to the staff, described the bag, where she had left it, what was in it, etc.  She indicated that she has a friend who lives nearby and could go and pick up the articles left behind. This friend is actually coming  to our city next month. After a couple of phone calls, she was told that the bag wasn't found. That's it. No other explanation.  She phoned back and left a message with the manager of the hotel, but he did not return her call, and it's been well over a week. There is no doubt in her mind where she left the bag. There must be a policy in place at the hotel for articles left behind, but since my daughter did not hear back, we don't know what that policy is.  So unfortunately this has left a bad taste, and we would not stay there again.","travelDate":"2013-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Prices ranged from $109.00 for a room with a bed and common bathroom to $1000.00 for rooms that looked like standard hotel rooms.  I decided to go with The Fairfield Inn because it seemed like what I had in mind and offered some things that all hotels should include free of charge, those being a continental breakfast and Wifi. Sorry but free wifi is more important than having a phone or Bible.\n\nNowhere did I see that Wifi was available in all rooms so I took that chance. Wifi is available in all rooms. I told them upon checking out that they need to make sure everyone knows that they offer this and it's a pretty big deal.\n\nWhat was a bigger deal was how nice everyone was at the hotel. I had perhaps the best experience I've ever had in the city and a lot of it was due to The Fairfield Inn. I was taking a class at the Parsons School and had to print out papers for a test, no problem, printing free of charge, as many sheets as necessary. Candy at the counter, cookies on Sunday, everyone extremely happy to help out with great personality as well, it was just a great experience. The room was $249.00 a night. There were additional taxes and fees upon leaving but I knew that would happen and I think that is the case at any hotel in the city. Those totaled about $40.00 per night and seemed if anything, slightly lower than other hotels I was pricing. I was pleasantly suprised to see the breakfast choices available, also included in the price. Bagels, scrambled eggs, sausage, starbucks coffee, yogurt, more than enough choices.\n\nThe room was a little dusty in the corners but this could be just me. I'm a little wary of bedbugs so I gave the place a good going over and saw nooks and crannies that hadn't seen the light of day for awhile.

I booked this at 11:00 Saturday morning at an excellent price, and hustled over there by 12:30. All of the staff behind the desk hustled to accommodate me, and Joanne in particular helped arrange for me to get checked in quickly. The room is clean, the furnishings are new and, particularly important for NYC when it gets above 90, the air conditioning is excellent. Marriott's higher end brands have been third or so on my preferred list for business travel in the past, and I've tended to favor Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton when paying for my own travel. Service was cheerful, proactive and created an excellent impression of the hotel and of the Fairfield brand. I spent twelve weeks in six trips to NYC on business last year and I've bookmarked this hotel in the browser and will continue to check it for availability. Thanks Joanne and crew for your help!

It was even better than what I expected.  We arrived on Thursday morning (we took the red eye from California) at Newark and took the AirTrain to NJ Transit to Penn Station. Super easy!  Then we walked 5 blocks to the hotel and even though our room wasn't ready, they held our luggage and let us use the restroom to freshen up.  They even said that we could help ourselves to breakfast even though we weren't checked (it was 9:30am).  So nice!  We returned around 2pm and we were quickly checked in and given our room keys to room 1002.  Our luggage was already put in our room.  What a great room!  Tenth floor, overlooking the street below, with a fabulous view of the Empire State Building.  \n\nThe room was bigger than expected (one king bed), very clean, had a nice little closet, and the shower was great (no tub, but I'm not a bath person).  The bed was a dream! The only downside was hearing the sounds of honking cars throughout the night, but after one night, we quickly got used to it.  Plus, we ran the fan and it basically zeroed out the traffic noise.  \n\nThe breakfast was very nice with a wide range of items, including English muffins, toast, muffins, bagels, fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, sausage patties, and juice (orange and cranberry).  There was also a coffee station with Starbucks coffee and hot water, with a large assortment of tea and hot chocolate.  Yum!  On weekdays, breakfast ends at 10am, 11am on weekends.\n\nThere are also two computers in the breakfast room with printers.  What a nice touch! We used the printer three times so we could print tickets for the 9\/11 Memorial and Top of the Rock, in addition to our boarding passes  And best of all, free Wifi in the room!  I find it so crazy that some of the high end hotels out there still charge an arm and a leg for internet access.  It's so nice and refreshing when it is included in your stay, free of charge.  Did I mention that we got a sweet deal on this room?  We booked pretty far in advance, and it was worth it!  We checked the price of the room a few days before we left and it had nearly doubled. \n\nMy husband and I also used the breakfast room one night when we brought our dinner back to the hotel.  It was so much nicer than eating in our room.  There is a large TV in there and it's very relaxing and no one else was there.  \n\nFor being my first time in NYC, you can't really beat the location.  We got around mainly by foot, but we occasionally took the subway which was conveniently located on the half a block away.  We walked to most of the sites including Times Square, Theater district, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, High Line, West Village, Chelsea Market, and SoHo.  While some of these sites were farther than others, it was so much fun to see the city by foot.  \n\nA major plus was the local flower market.  It was so nice to step outside the hotel and see these beautiful flowers and plants lining the sidewalk.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this hotel and can't wait to return to NYC.  I'll be back at the Fairfield Inn without a doubt.","travelDate":"2013-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The street outside was lovely during the day, with all the flowers laid out and it never felt unsafe when we walked back at night.\nCheck in was very quick, but we were initially a little disappointed with our room as we looked out at the building(yoga studio) directly at the back of the hotel (4th floor). The room itself was small but had everything we needed and to be honest we only slept and showered there so it was ideal. The bed was very comfortable and by putting our cases under the desk, we had enough space to move about easily.\nThe complimentary breakfast was ideal, enough choice for us and replenished frequently. The hot drinks were available at any time day or night.\nThe rooftop terrace was great to see if we were missing out by not paying extra to have a front facing room (great view but as I said we wernt in the room very often).

We wanted to stay somewhere close to Times Square without blowing our budget, and we thought this was a great option.\n\nWe traveled by Megabus from Washington DC, and we were dropped off very close to this hotel.  We were a little early for check in, and they gave us the option of checking in right then, or waiting until actual check in time for a room with a fold-out chair for our daughter.  We opted to wait, and they were happy to hold our bags while we killed some time.  All of our dealings with the staff were very professional and personable.  They even gave our daughter a little cow toy, which she played with the entire stay.\n\nThe room itself was smaller, but that was to be expected in New York City, and for our short stay we didn't mind it.  Our three year old thought the fold out chair was one of the coolest things in the world.  For an adult, it would be a little tight, but she slept soundly on it all night.  We enjoyed the king bed, it was very comfortable.\n\nI'm a big fan of anywhere that offers free breakfast, and this spread did not disappoint.  They had lots of good options for all of us.  To name a few options, they offered cereals, toast, bagels, yogurts, Del Monte grapefruit and fruit cups, hard boiled eggs, orange and cranberry juice, apples and bananas, coffee and hot chocolate, and Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches.  It was so nice not to have to worry about breakfast every morning, especially with a child in tow.  There was plenty of seating available.\n\nThe location was great.

I was in New York for a concert at Madison Square Garden that Saturday night.  Ley's begin with the location.  It's on West 28th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues.  You are going down a street that seems to be all strew front stores, and then poof, you see at tall, skinny, 18 floor hotel that is the Fairfield Inn and Suites.\n\nThe Lobby:  The lobby is a small as everybody says it is.  And I could see if a large group showed up, that it could get very, very crowded.  That being said, I found the lobby to be clean, the front desk staff to be most pleasant and comfortable.  There is a small 4 seat seating area in the front lobby.  Straight ahead is a set of 2 elevators which zipped you up to and down from the floors.  Around the elevators to the rear is a separate seating area which contained the continental breakfast, which I did not use, but it had the usual bagels, fruit, cereal, and assorted coffees and juices.\n\nThe Room: I was in room 707 on the 7th floor.  As I said the hotel itself is a very skinny building, and the hotel only had maximum of 7 rooms per floor.  I have been in some small rooms in my travels over in Europe, and I have to say my room was a very tiny room.  That being said, I found the bed to be extremely comfortable, with 5 pillows.  The room had a 42 inch plasma\/lcd TV mounted on the wall.  The room had a small work desk and a small cabinet that held a ironing board, iron, coffee pot with setup and the ice bucket.  Plenty of hangars were available, and there was 2 small drawers on the bottom.  There is a temperature interface that hooks in with the wall mounted heating\/air conditioning unit that is mounted on the wall under the window.  When its on heat, it purrs like a kitten, but, when the air conditioning comes on, it is somewhat noisy.  However, when the ac is on, it's like the north pole is coming out of the vents, great for a hot day.  The window did not have much of a view, basically the buildings next door, so if that is important to you, ask for higher floor.  It was not a problem for me.\n\nThe Bathroom: The bathroom had a 2 person shower, that I found very clean, excellent water pressure, and plenty of hot water.  The sink\/vanity area was fitted with Koehler faucets.

Primero hab\u00edamos contratado otro hotel que hab\u00eda tenido un caso de estos insectos, por lo que poco antes de viajar decidimos cambiar. Y gracias a Dios encontramos el Fairfield Inn & Suites New York Manhattan\/Chelsea!!\nHace 3 a\u00f1os estuvimos en Los Angeles y nos alojamos en el Residence Inn by Marriott y nos atendieron de maravilla, por lo que esta vez tambi\u00e9n quisimos encontrar otro establecimiento de la cadena Marriott. \nPrimero que nada, el servicio de parte de todos los empleados fue excelente. Llegamos unas horas antes del horario de check-in pero igualmente nos asignaron la habitaci\u00f3n y pudimos subir a descansar. Estuvimos en el 3er piso y no tuvimos problemas ni con el ruido de la calle, ni del ascensor, ni de la calefacci\u00f3n... Nada. Habitaci\u00f3n bastante espaciosa para ser New York, cama gigante! Televisor de plasma, cafetera, caf\u00e9 de Satrbucks, vasos... Hasta pedimos un refrigerador y nos lo llevaron a la habitaci\u00f3n.\nLa ubicaci\u00f3n buen\u00edsima. El McDonald's de la esquina significa que hay gente a todas horas y que si uno vuelve tarde, siempre puede encontrar algo para comer ah\u00ed. Cerca de estaciones de subte (metro) de varias l\u00edneas y a pocas cuadras de Macy's.\nEl hotel cuenta con un gimnasio abierto las 24 hs con toallas limpias, agua y m\u00e1quinas que funcionan TODAS y perfectamente. Tambi\u00e9n hay un microondas en la zona de desayuno que puede usarse todo el d\u00eda. Nosotras le sacamos provecho ya que lo usamos casi todas las noches dado que de tanto cansancio, no quer\u00edamos salir a comer. Buena forma de ahorrar unos d\u00f3lares a la hora de cenar.\nBuen\u00edsimo el desayuno. Caf\u00e9 de Starbucks, jugo Minute Maid, cerales de Kellog's,muffins, mermeladas, bagels... Muy bueno.\nLa verdad, s\u00f3lo tengo palabras de agradecimiento. Si est\u00e1n buscando un hotel limpio, espacioso, c\u00f3modo, con buenas personas a su disposici\u00f3n y un precio razonable, esta es la elecci\u00f3n perfecta.

A food item had run out at breakfast and one of my daughters asked an employee if they had any more of it and he happily sought it out. We felt very welcome.\n3. The rooftop patio. We made hot chocolate down in the dining room at night and brought it up to the rooftop to enjoy while we took in amazing views of the city. The Empire State Building is just a few blocks away and made for a breathtaking skyline. Nobody else was up on the rooftop. The seating area was comfortable.

I have never had so little noise, especially in a relatively low rise building. I was on the 15th floor, facing away from the street. I was dead silent during the night. So if you want a quiet place, this is it. I was in 1501, and this hotel is like many midtown hotels, room face front and back only. No side views. So I know rooms ending in 01 and 03 face the rear for sure. Not a great view, but quiet.\n\nOther than that I have to also say the staff here was very nice, helpful, and efficient. Gave great restaurant suggestions, directions, and other advise. \n\nRoom was good size, clean, big bathroom, shower only. No refrigerator. Breakfast was typical Fairfield fare, which was fine. Fitness room was also typical. I went to Planet Fitness on 27th to work out.\n\nParking is $25.00 per night if you validate, and is about a block away from hotel. The one thing about this location is the street itself is pretty grim, especially when the daily flower vendors are wrapped up for the day. Not a pretty block.

I arrived from the West coast via a red-eye flight around 11 a.m. on a Sunday morning and was told my room wasn't ready. That was totally cool, as check-in isn't until 3 p.m. However, the woman at the front desk told me she would give me the first open room that became available. I told her I would sit in the small waiting area not 15 feet away from her in her eye line to make sure she remembered I was there and ready. More than two hours later, at least one other person checked in successfully and it was only when I went up and asked if a room was available did she say \"yes,\" which made me irate because she knew I had traveled without sleep to NYC.\n\nSecond? I woke up Monday morning and prepared to depart. As I was gathering my belongings on the bed, I noticed an array of blood stains all over the white comforter. Absolutely disgusting.

Not only was the young woman at the desk friendly and very helpful, she asked if we had breakfast yet.  We had not. She immediately took us to their breakfast room and made us feel right at home!

We had a great day and came back to the hotel in time to check in, change clothes, hop on the subway and zip off to see a Broadway show we had tickets for.  All went like clockwork.  The afternoon hotel crew was friendly and very helpful as well.  I have stayed in the Time Square area several times and the rooms were always small, cramped and at times, the hallways were scary.  At the Fairfield we stayed on the 16th floor, the room was bright, modern and a decent size.  Even provided a coffee pot! It was quiet and absolutely more than met our expectations!!!  In the morning the staff was great.  Breakfast was the typical Fairfield Inn start to the day, but they were right there to replenish anything that ran low.  We had another great day exploring new neighborhoods.  Later in the day we came back to retrieve our luggage, grab a quick cup of coffee to go.

Our actual bill was only $3319 .All but $700 was put back on our cards. It has taken me 30 days of constant emailing to try and get this released.

The Marriott Fairfield is a modern \"no frills\" hotel with a very good room design.

It\u2019s one of the very few hotels we've stayed in, in the U.S. and overseas, where the free wired and wireless Wi-Fi worked very well at all times even in a fully-occupied-hotel.  There is a comfortable chat and computer lounge behind the lobby, which is also the food-service area for the free continental breakfast.  That space opens into a large enclosed glass atrium with tables and chairs for those lingering over breakfast.  Coffee and tea is available at all hours.  We had a 2nd floor room facing W. 28th Street, and the room was absolutely quiet.  The 2 elevators are fast and responsive.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.

Not expensive for Manhattan, very well located (flower district, close to lots of subway lines and a short walk from SoHo, Times square, High Line Park etc). We felt safe even at 4am! \n\nFront of house was amazing! The ladies at reception were so friendly AND helpful. Special mention to Mia (?) who was all smiles, we absolutely loved her. We had a king size room and I can\u00b4t understand the complaints on the size. It\u00b4s a budget hotel and the room size is great, bed is comfy and we didn\u00b4t experience any noise. \n\nWe pretty much left early in the morning and went back late in the afternoon for a shower and out again and the hotel was perfect for our 6 night stay. We mentioned that it was our anniversary and they left a little bag with some water, chocolates, very considerate. \n\nBreakfast wasn\u00b4t amazing but one could go and get some fruit, cereal, muffins, yoghurt, boiled eggs and have a quick bite before going out. \n\nI will definitely go back if in New York again, 100% recommended. Best budget hotel I\u00b4ve ever stayed in.","travelDate":"2012-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are quite spacious for Manhattan (king bed with plenty of floor space left over) and very clean. The bathroom is also nicely finished with a large shower, even if it's all a little squashed in. \n\nThe included breakfast is a continental breakfast which is enough, but don't expect too much from it, and if you arrive late on there isn't a huge ammount of seating.\n\nThe staff are very helpful and polite, and let me check in almost 2 hours early to make my statue tour ferry, and stored my bags for almost 5 hours after check out until my flight.\n\nThe location isn't the best for viewing the city sights on foot, but there is a subway station at the end of the street which if you take the number 1 train (every 10 minutes or so), it takes you straight to times square and central park uptown in about 5\/10 minutes, or to battery park and the island ferries downtown in about 15\/20. If you like shopping the best thing to do is get the subway to times square then walk 2 blocks over to 5th avenue for the major shops.\n\nI was really happy with my stay as the rooms were nice and the subway connection was very useful. At $150 inc. tax and charges, for the middle of Manhattan it's great value for money. I would definately stay there again and reccomend it to anyone going to visit NYC.","travelDate":"2012-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The service was the worst I've experienced.  The Front desk clerks were rude and unfriendly.  The room was decent, however personally had to tell the maid not to clean my room at 9:00am I needed time.  She shows up comes in while I\"m sitting in the room and cleaned around me.  I was staying two more nights.  She didn't speak english and she ignored my request.  She rushed through the cleaning barely making the bed.  Their complimentary breakfast was more like boxed breakfast.  NO restaurant or room service.  NO movie chanels.  I wouldn't stay their again very disappointed the whole way around.

The hotel is a couple of blocks from Penn station, and was able to walk to hotel after arriving in NYC via Amtrak. The hotel itself is tucked away on a sidestreet, opposite the Hotel Indigo,and is in a neighbourhood which has access to a number of Subway lines and some good eateries. \nThe rooms are very clean, have been refurbed recently. The breakfast on offer is standard, but with a really good range of food. There's usually hot coffee on standby during the day, which is nice when you get back from a day's touring. The wifi is fine, and there are a couple of PCs with printers, which were handy for printing off train tickets and boarding cards. The staff are very friendly and helpful, with a good knowledge of the area. \nI can't emphasise enough how pleased we were with this hotel, it was really nice coming back to it every evening to relax. \nI would definitely stay here again, we really enjoyed our stay and it's my preferred hotel in NYC from now on.","travelDate":"2012-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location was good -- walking distance to Penn Station and a reasonably short taxi ride to many other attractions.  The room was clean, nothing to complain about there at all.  Upon getting off the elevator I was dismayed to see our room was right across the hall.  I figured we would hear the elevator all night, but I never heard a thing from it.\n\nThe buffet breakfast was adequate. No gourmet food but more than just carb-heavy sweet rolls and bagels.  The bedroom was simple - the bed, a desk area, and a chest with the TV on top.  The toiletries were OK if you hadn't brought your own.  They were not a luxury brand but they would suffice.  About the only disappointment was that there was no little safe in the room.  I find that to be a nice peace of mind amenity when staying in the city, not that anything happened to our possessions.  \n\nEveryone who worked there was very pleasant and helpful, right down to the housekeeping staff.","travelDate":"2012-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1949647,"title":"Low Key-Good Hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2012-08-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"When I say \"low key\" I mean it's not a big fancy hotel, it's very simple with a small lobby area and the entrance is on a quite side street (West 28th Street).  It's easy to pass by if you're not looking for it.  In my opinion, Low Key is very good!\n\nI stayed here for one night on the 4th of July and used my Marriott points for the stay.  I do think this hotel prices good for it's location in NYC, but NYC hotels are VERY expensive.  If you are a senior or AAA member you will get a discount.  \n\nLOCATION:- very good, just off 6th Avenue and a short walk to the subway on 7th Ave.  Right along 7th Ave there are plenty of restaurants and quick service places to get a nice meal or something on the go.  There's a McDonalds on the corner of 6th Ave as well.  It's right at the tip of Chelsea, so mid-town is maybe a 10-15 minute walk that will get you to Times Square, the theater district, Empire State Building, Macys, etc.  Greenwich Village is also a 15 minute walk in the other direction.  You'd need to take a subway or taxi to lower Manhattan or Central Park unless you LOVE to walk & explore.  The 2 closest major streets are 23rd Street with a lot of stores & restaurants and 34th Street where you will find Macy's, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden & lots of fast food places nearby.  \n\nAs I said, the lobby is small and comfortable, there is a small sitting area there and outside there is a small area to sit as well.  The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful, they really made me feel welcome.  \n\nTHE ROOM - my room was on the 7th floor and I could see the Empire State Building from my window, they gave me a room upgrade which was nice of them.  The room isn't terribly large but very comfortable.  I had a king bed, which was one of the most comfortable beds I ever slept in.  There was a nice flat screen tv with a good amount of channels, a desk with a lamp & electrical outlet, coffee maker with coffee & tea supplied, free WIFI, phone & clock\/radio with alarm.  There was an iron & ironing board in the closet.  The AC kept the room quite chilly if turned up.  The window does slide open slightly on each side if you want a bit of fresh air.   I don't recall seeing a mini-frig.  The bathroom was nice, but small.  It was odd how the door opens into the bathroom.  When you open the door the sink is then behind the door.  So you have to scoot in & close the door to get to the sink.  It wasn't a big deal though, it's NYC-space is at a premium.   The tub\/shower was very nice and after a long day out & about, the shower is very soothing.  They had some amenities in the bathroom like a small bottle each of shampoo, conditioner, & lotion.  The hotel also offers a complimentary continental breakfast each morning.  Unfortunately I slept in and didn't make it down for the breakfast nor did I see the breakfast room - sorry folks!  I enjoyed 4th of July evening a little bit too much and got in very late.  Speaking of that, we left the hotel around 10-1030pm to go out and even though most stores were closed (McDonalds on the corner was open) & the streets somewhat quiet, we felt very safe walking around the area as well as coming back around 130am from The Village.  It is a major city though, so be careful. \n\nParking - NYC is not a good place for a car as it is expensive to park and street parking is extremely difficult to find and you often have to move the car for street cleaning.  They have a deal with 2 parking garages within a block from the hotel.  I parked at one between 5th & 6th Aves (on 28th St).  It is $25 a day for hotel guests and you MUST get your parking voucher validated at the hotel - you pay the garage when you pick the car up.  I checked around for less expensive parking but couldn't find any.  \n\nI would stay at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2012-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}
