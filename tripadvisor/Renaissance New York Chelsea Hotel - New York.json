Overpriced even for New York and this is not my first time to visit NYC.\n\nAs Bonvoy member and stayed for 10 night, they allocated us in the worst smallest possible room available in the hotel. Room 2509. Avoid this room !! Very dark, very small with no view. Similar to Ibis style hotel. No bath robe, no slipper, no minibar and very small closet even for 1 person. I attached the photos how they setup the hair drier in the bathroom. \n\nThe breakfast wasn\u2019t included . You have to pay their low quality breakfast USD 38 \/ person where you get dry pastries and coffee in a paper cup served by unfriendly waiters.\n\nPrior to my arrival, I tried to send them e-mail as I have some requests. They simply didn\u2019t care. When I check-in and asked why was my e-mail wasn\u2019t replied, They were just smiling. No bother giving explanation. The attitude of front desk staffs here shall be urgently fixed. No customer service oriented at all. No greeting, no welcome, nothing. The first thing they asked was my credit card. This hotel seems like having bad management.\n\nThey did not replenish the coffee and tea automatically until you ask. HK was placing DND letter as fast as they could, even before 1 pm. The cleaning lady was nice, but was difficult to communicate as she doesn\u2019t speak and understand English at all. Cleaning quality can be improved.

We went in first and asked what we could do and we were basically told that we still have to pull up regardless of the busy street. I knew something like this would happen: it's the city and parking sucks. But it would've been nice if the staff at least tried to be helpful. It could've been a liability issue but they could've told us that. Check in itself was cold and it felt like they just wanted you out the way. At check out, right as we finished packing the car and got in (it didnt take very long), we were immediately told to move by either a doorman or valet. How can we do that when we cant even get to the road?? I understand, they need to pull around more cars, but being just told to move is especially rude. As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry for a long time, how you say things to customers can form nearly their whole experience and set the tone for their stay. \nThis hotel also charges you a $30 amenity fee which you can apply to food. The buffet breakfast was $35 per person I think, which is incredibly expensive since the selection of food that was just the basics (eggs, bacon, bagels etc). This was not ideal for us and not worth it either. In the evening, the menu wasn't as limited which is great because we were all able to get something to eat. But some of the pricing is ridiculous. I know it's supposed to be a \"higher end\" hotel, but half of the menu items I could get down the block for way cheaper and way better most likely. For a place offering so little for a credit you have to use in order to not be charged for it, they're really trying to give you a marathon for your money. \nThe elevator was very hard to use, half of the people we got into it couldn't work it either. The high-tech elevators with touch screens just simply don't work. \nThose complaints aside, there were staff members that genuinely cared about our experience. One front desk agent followed up with us about our housekeeping requests, the bartenders were very attentive despite their big crowds and very personable. Regardless of our feelings about the food, it was still very good and filling (but my chicken was dry). The hotel itself is beautiful and you can walk basically anywhere from it. We still walked to the \"major landmarks\" like Times Square, Central Park, museums... but we don't mind the walk. We were also able to request a mini fridge for our stay which was very helpful given that we brought some food with us too. I'm not sure if I'd stay again, but other things were able to make up for the things that made us feel it wasn't worth it. ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Hotel also gave free bottles of water every day which was super nice.\nSurprisingly little space for clothes.... very little closet in the double room. In the shower the water tap was little tricky but we learned to get hot water.\nWi-fi worked nicely. Rooms were cleaned nicely every day.\nThey had a breakfast buffet and served every morning scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, bacon, bagels, bread, fresh fruit, fresh strawberries and blueberries, porridge, yogurt and some sweet. Juices, coffee and tea. Some mornings they also served pancakes and fried potatoes as well as some kind of sausages. If you can't eat yogurt and don't like porridge.... quite a limited selection for eight mornings so some mornings we went to diner. \nLocation was ok - subway stations were quite close. Also Madison Square Garden where we watched hockey one night was in walking distance. \nIf I would choose a hotel for 8 nights' city break again I would choose a different location however. The kind where there are lots of good restaurants nearby in walking distance. But the hotel itself was nice and I could stay there again if just the location would be different. \n","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

As with many other hotels in NYC this hotel sits on a small plot of land and only has about 8 to 10 rooms per floor. The rooms are rather small but are well equipped with interesting touches. The property offers a small bar and restaurant on the main floor. Free bottled water is always available in the lobby which was a nice touch. Breakfast was included with our status and it offered a decent selection of items. As with many hotels in NYC this property also charges a \"resort fee\" without any resort offerings. You can use your $25 'non cumulative' credit at the restaurant or bar. The problem is that the bar is closed for part of the afternoon and if you have plans in the evening you won't be able to utilise your credit, convenient for the hotel but not for the guest. I wish that 'non resort properties' will give up charging such silly fees. The hotel shares one of the elevators with an external night club - it didn't bother us during our stay and we were on a high floor an had no negative experiences with either long lines for the elevator nor noise across the hotel.\nOverall it was a good experience and I can recommend the property to anyone staying around Chelsea and the Flat iron district.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I find this practice as annoying and voiced my concern on checkout.  I wish they would do away with it and just reflect it in the room rate as things used to be that way.\nThe gym was alright, on the warm side in the basement. As others remarked there is a lively night club and a lot of people around the lobby and elevators.  They had a bouncer there and a dedicated elevator for the patrons of the club.

And i changed my room 3 times at different nights because of the AC which wasn\u2019t working properly. The last room they gave me has a great view of the empire state building . The complimentary coffee was always there also you could grab water at the front desk. Most of the front desk are perfect except a one or two who are not that friendly others were really helpful.\n\nThe breakfast was not on the room and it was ok . They haven\u2019t tried to bring up new things or at least change some items so everything was always the same .\n\nThe most annoying part is the noise coming from the club which is located at the roof top of the hotel and specifically at the weekend wouldn\u2019t let you sleep till 4 am . I had a bad experience of an extra noise from the room above me which gave me headache and i called the front desk several times so you could imagine paying around $300 p\/n and couldn\u2019t sleep . \n\nThe worst part was the new years night i think it was Saturday night 1st of January the black guy was sitting in front of the restaurant and i asked if the restaurant is open which wasn\u2019t. So he start talking to me and I politely answered that from which country i coming from and he talked about politics and the normal conversation.Later on he saw me again and told me how can i find you to say hi specifically at night ???? Which was disgusting. I don\u2019t know how a personnel would let themselves to be this rude . I didn\u2019t see him again .i hope the person who is in charge will take care of this . \nOverall experience was good . But since i pay cash to extend my stay and they ask for deposit as well i had an experience that they told me your balance is $16 which i asked please double check and they said oh yes it\u2019s $116 !!  And I don\u2019t know how the big hotel like this could made a huge mistake .and when i told that she said i gave you discount i hope you appreciate it!!! I paid almost $5000 for my stay and the extension.\n\nAnd last but not least when i moved to the second room at night i found the safe box is not open so the staff came and fixed it for me since the AC still didn\u2019t work they gave me a new room for the next day when I supposed to change the room i took my stuff from the safe box and i found a sunglass cover .i called the front desk and told them shall i leave it here and they said they gonna send someone to picked that up . I gave it to the staff and one minute later he knocked at my door and said it is empty . I said i have no idea since I didn\u2019t checked that and not even opened it . Later on the front desk called me and said the same thing !!! It gave me the feeling that i have to know why it is empty ???? So i think the person who pays 17 nights for this kind of expensive hotel obviously doesn\u2019t need a sun glass .

I was meeting my friends who were running the marathon and really needed a nice long relaxing quiet weekend. I had noted in my profile that I wanted a quiet room away from elevators, etc., yet when I went up to my room on the 35th floor it was a bit rough around the edges. the view was fantastic of the city, yet that didn\u2019t make up for the fact that it was extremely tiny, threadbare towels, tiny bathroom and the list goes on. Unbeknownst to me, at around 11pm the 1st night I was hearing loud club music, thinking it was in the hallway or something. No, it carried on and at midnight called the front desk. They informed me it was the nightclub a few floors above me on the rooftop, which they failed to mention at check-in. after scrambling, they moved me to an even smaller room until they could find something they next day. Of course, by then it was 1pm & had a hard time getting back to sleep. When I got back later the next day to get a different room, management was nice enough to take off the daily fee + give me a couple of breakfast vouchers. Granted the $25 daily fee is steep and not entirely sure what you get for that. The room I was moved to was away from the nightclub which was a plus, I wasn\u2019t upgraded which you would think that they would have done something for my troubles. The towels were threadbare in this room as well and looked like the room could have been refreshed as it was beat up pretty bad. For the price, I would have thought that the rooms were a bit more upgraded like the pictures shown on the website. \nNo room service, tiny tiny tiny gym, no ice machines that I was aware of, plastic cups in the room, 2 towels that were very worn and a host of other negatives that I won\u2019t be returning to this property again.

The room didn\u2019t have a mini fridge and they brought one over quickly. \n\nIt\u2019s a bunch of little things that prevented me from giving it more stars. \n\nThe breakfast leaves a lot to be desired. It\u2019s a higher end version of what you\u2019d get at a Residence Inn. It was also consistently cold because no one lit the burners under the metal trays - at least two of the three things (eggs, potato and bacon) were off every day. One day there was no hot water only coffee. If you asked the staff they\u2019d fix it but you had to ask. \n\nThe hotel rooftop pool - we never figured out how to access it. We were told it wasn\u2019t open \u201cuntil the fall, you know that season before summer\u201d. That was part of the reason we picked the hotel - to be able to use the pool. However there was one floor where there were parties. It was loud at night. I thought this was the rooftop bar but that can\u2019t be right if it is closed until the spring. \n\nThe WiFi cut in and out a couple of times during our stay which made business Zoom calls challenging. Only a couple of times but enough to be irritating. \n\nAnd one day they didn\u2019t come to clean our room until 3pm. And they only clean until 5pm. That isn\u2019t a big deal but it meant no room cleaning that day. \n\nThe other thing that got me is that the hotel charges a $25 daily fee, but gives you back a $25 credit on food (if you spend at least $50) and does the same with laundry with a $20 credit (if you spend at least $25). Our little one needed some baby clothes washed bc of an accident. We gave the front desk a few items and labeled the baby stuff as best we could given the form is designed for grown ups. They decided to charge us $12 for a onesie when men\u2019s undershirts are charged $9.

One of the best Marriott hotels I\u2019ve stayed in the NYC chelsea area. \n* Plenty of bottled water provided complimentary at the front desk. \n* the property\u2019s gym is adequate. Good amount of space and towels\/bottled water available + core gym necessities.\n\nCons\u2014\n* Service is severely lacking at ALL areas of this hotel- starting with the front desk but I will say the absolute worst service was the staff at the Cotto restaurant for breakfast (more on that shortly)\n\n* $25 \u201cdestination fee\u201d for no amenities except bottled water is astonishing. They will offset spending at the hotel on food and beverage with this fee - and trust me, you\u2019ll use it at that nightmare of a breakfast restaurant - Cotto. \n\n* Cotto - where do I begin? I was encouraged when I checked in and learned that Cotto honored either a complimentary continental breakfast or $20 voucher towards breakfast for Platinum elite. This is where everything turned sour with my experience at this place - I visited 4 mornings for breakfast, the first morning was painfully slow (almost 2 hours for 1 person to have breakfast - a simple omelette with toast) and the 3rd morning they refused service due to being \u201ctoo busy and understaffed\u201d \u2014 on a Saturday! The prices at this restaurant are a joke - $20 does not get you much folks. Coffee is $6, juice is $8, toast $4, oatmeal with 3 blueberries and 1 strawberry $18, an omelette that you can only have bacon in for a protein (?) but you could order sausage, salmon on the side of course.  And the rudest staff I have encountered at any Marriott property to boot. It was as if they were really doing me a favor to bring salt and pepper to the table. \n\n* Rooms are very small. I was upgraded to a room with \u201c20% more room\u201d but really can\u2019t imagine what a smaller room would look like. I did have to use the desk regularly for work and was traveling alone and it was very tight quarters. \n\n* Pool is not for hotel guests. They should work on allowing some dedicated hours for hotel guests at the pool considering we are inconvenienced by the club the entire stay. \n\n* check in was a disaster. Granted I requested an early check in and understandably those are not guaranteed - however, I did the mobile check in and then chatted w the front desk and they said they could not add me to their \u201cwaiting list\u201d for check in until I arrived in person at the property - what is the point of mobile check in if you require folks in person?

Because I was working, I needed a few amenities: room service, shipments to the front desk, a quiet room\u2026and not much more. Upon check-in it became apparent that Renaissance Chelsea hotel was challenged in providing these very basic amenities, for the \u201cbargain\u201d rate of $600-$800\/night, for a single king room. After flying in on a red-eye from the West Coast, upon check-in, I was told the room I booked would not be ready until later in the day. I had to point out the actual calendar date to the reception associate, and also remind them that I had specifically booked the room a night in advance in order to check-in when I arrived early in the day. Once that was sorted out, I made my way to said designated room, only to find that the room key was inoperable.  Though it was cumbersome and time consuming, I was moved to another room. \n\nWhile the hotel did make an effort to accommodate my room request (quiet and away from the club on the 30th floor), the hotel restaurant and morning room service was among the worst I have experienced, anywhere. I was required to rise early and attempted to order in-room delivery of, 1) a pot of tea, and 2) toast. Both items appear on the in-room dining menu. First morning, I was told by the woman running the dining service, \u201cNo toast. Only bread.\u201d Day two, I attempted to refill my tea cup with hot water directly FROM the restaurant downstairs, and was informed by the SAME woman, \u201cNo hot water.\u201d A short walk down the hall to the coffee station revealed, a) coffee to go, b) hot water, and c) all the necessary accoutrements (cups, milk, sweetener, etc.)  This woman was by far the rudest, most hostile \u201chospitality\u201d worker I have encountered, anywhere. It is worth noting that my requests were made politely and patiently, and I have no pre-existing gripe, disagreement or relationship with any of these people.\n\nFrom there, items that were shipped to the front desk for business purposes were misplaced.  I was told they had not arrived (they had, and surfaced after much back and forth and several phone calls.) \n\nThe worst experience of the stay was when a tragic incident occurred on my floor in the room across the hall. I returned to my room one afternoon, and encountered several NYPD officers stationed outside the door. I asked if there was cause for concern, and was not fully satisfied with the response. Leaving the room an hour later and encountering two new NYPD, I inquired again if there was cause for concern. The officer then explained what had happened, and a short time later I witnessed emergency workers pushing a gurney up the hallway. It is worth noting that at no time during my 4 days as a guest did the hotel notify me that there was an \u201cincident\u201d and I was likely to encounter this scene upon returning to my room. Nor did they offer to move me to a new room\u2026or offer any explanation whatsoever. Once the matter was resolved, the room remained sealed with NYPD tape for the remainder of my stay. Come ON, Marriott! I expect more from a company of this size and reputation.\n\nWe paid more than $3,000 for a 4-night stay accompanied by some of the worst service I\u2019ve encountered, anywhere. I will add, there was one very helpful \u201cnavigator\u201d named Leonardo who deserves props for good customer service. Also, the rooms were clean.

The food was tasty and moreover the staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Everything was served with a smile and they went out of their way to accommodate my family.\n- location was excellent for my needs.  I loathe Times Square and tourist traps, so this was a wonderful location in Chelsea.  We are a walking family, so walkable to things we like to do in NY (Flatiron, Madison Park, etc) but may not be as good  for people who want to spend more time in the crowded chaos of Times Square.  It is a very short Uber ride to the Theatre District.\n- I read other reviews complaining about noise.  I heard nothing from our neighbours and I heard no noise from the rooftop bar or the street.  It was very quiet.  The 11th floor was perfect!\n\nCons : \n- elevators are SLOOOOW.  Four elevators, but one tends to be reserved for private rooftop club not available to hotel guests. \n- rooms are dark.  Needs more lighting.\n- it\u2019s disappointing that the rooftop pool isn\u2019t available to hotel guests.  It had previously been advertised as a hotel with a pool, but things have changed.\n- for guests who would like more space, the hotel only has a limited number of suites, so it is hard to book them.\n- the bartender and the housekeeping staff seemed stressed.  Nothing egregious, but nowhere near as friendly as the front desk staff or the restaurant staff.\n\nOverall a decent stay.

It was our first time at this particular hotel, but we've been to NYC many times. I think the location is convenient, but it's a bit more gritty in my opinion compared to other areas we've stayed like the financial district and soho. \n\nThe front desk staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful, extra towels, coffee and water were offered during our stay since we did not have maid service. The room itself was definitely compact although esthetically pleasing. It seems like a lot of the new hotels now have poor storage which is true for this Marriott. For a short stay, I don't think it's a problem. The bed was comfortable and we had a nice view of the city.\n\nRegarding noise, we asked for a lower floor due to the complaints about noise coming from the night club on the top floor. We were on the 25th floor and did not hear any music. There is now one elevator roped off that people use for entering the club, the other elevators are for guests and we didn't have to wait at all getting to and from our room. The walls are definitely thin and we could hear people talking next door. It's unfortunate that the hotel has the club situation preventing people from enjoying a higher floor and better view. We did get a drink from the bar in the lobby, but the bartender definitely prefers the female guests and our drinks were poor. \n\nOverall our stay was fine, but with so many hotels in the city, I'd be a little hesitant to return given the room size and potential noise issues.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Unfortunately, instead of that happening, COVID is being used as an empty excuse just to not rehire people, have bad service, and oh by the way charge more than pre-pandemic prices. The strategy being \u201csince all hotels are doing it, we can charge the same prices and do way less, why stop now!\u201d So basically luxury hotel prices for motel service.\n\nIn all of my 130 nights in Marriott\u2019s this year that was the case. No matter how nice the hotel had been or how expensive, every stay was mediocre at best with ALL the compromises and adjustments pushed onto the guest with an incredible lack of empathy from management or staff.\n\nI got used to it and resolved to expect nothing more and just deal with it.\n\nSo when I checked into the Renaissance New York Chelsea hotel, it was a shocking surprise. From the second I walked in the door at 7am to check-in and was greeted with a, \u201cno problem and thank you for being an Ambassador\u201d (don\u2019t remember the last time that happened) to the great rooms, to the OPEN lobby bar, to the fact that they actually clean your rooms, to the unbelievably happy and friendly staff. I was there for a business meeting in a conference room and even the catering staff went out of their way to smile and make things pleasant. And the food, and we\u2019re talking buffet food for 40 people, was outstanding.\n\nI thought about it for a while. Was this hotel experience so great because I had be treated like crap for 2 years straight? Or were they just really great? And the answer is they are twice as great at the Renaissance New York Chelsea Hotel. First, they run a beautiful, well oiled hotel with an amazing staff. Second, they do this while all the other hotels in the country are taking advantage of the pandemic situation to not make taking care of their guests not a priority.\n\nSure, there were some things closed because of COVID at the hotel, but the staff never let you feel the inconvenience.\n\nThey next time I check into hotel and they start the conversation about all the things they don\u2019t have, followed by the DoorDash QR code, I\u2019m going to have them call the Renaissance New York Chelsea Hotel to tell them how it\u2019s done.\n\nThanks everyone.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Then comes the partying. Our first night, \"our neighbors\" checked in around 3am and one of the \"guest\" vomited violently until 5am. The sound proofing isn't great, so we heard EVERYTHING through the vests. It was as if the person was vomiting in our room. It was clear they partied too hard and had to check in to the hotel. The continental breakfast in the morning is only good until 8:30am. After that, it's DECIMATED and the kitchen has a hard time keeping up.

My wife was cold one night so I messaged the desk asking about an extra blanket. They knocked on the door and woke us up at 3am (2hrs 45mjn later) with the blanket. Also, no fridge in room and only one ice machine in the hotel. Also, it\u2019s 2021 and they still have drip coffee machine in room. Most hotels have gone to espresso machines and that would have been nice.\n\nOverall good stay and nice hotel but they couldn\u2019t definitely make it significantly better by improving on the above.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}
{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":15530677,"title":"New property still working through things","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-10-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"For two nights in October 2021, I settled into Room 402 at the Renaissance New York Chelsea.  This is a new property and my first time staying here.  I booked the two-night stay on the Marriott App, but when I arrived the front desk system only showed my stay as one night.  They looked up the reservation number I had been provided and were eventually able to find the reservation and adjust their system.  They also had the wrong nightly rate.  Both were corrected and they said their system was a little bit older and did not always sync well with Marriott\u2019s system.  I thought it was odd that a new property would have an older system, but ultimately, they were able to quickly correct the information.\nThe decor of the hotel is a little bit on the modern side but with classic touches.  It was not overdone and overall appealing.  I read reviews that the nightclub caused lots of noise and could make it hard to sleep.  I think the club wasn\u2019t in operation during my stay and overall found the property extremely quiet.  Being on the fourth floor, I expected some street noise but it was quiet, especially for New York standards.  The first morning at 7am I ventured to the concierge lounge for coffee.  When I returned to my room, the coffee was cold.  I mean cold, not even room temperature.   That was very disappointing as I didn\u2019t want to make another track downstairs.  It was surprising as I was clearly one of the first guest of the day.  The coffee should have been freshly made and hot.  I called downstairs to make them aware hoping to save someone else from the same cup of cold coffee.  They offered to bring up a fresh cup, which I greatly appreciated.  However, when it arrived, it was cold too.  The second morning, I didn\u2019t even attempt to get a cup of coffee on property.  I dined at the onsite restaurant, Cotto, for dinner on night two.  I had a question about the wine and the manager couldn\u2019t provide much detail past what was written on the menu.  I choose a cabernet and it was nice.  I\u2019d highly recommend the pappardelle al ragu.  The portion was more than enough.  It was flavorful.  While it was filling, it wasn\u2019t heavy.  That evening had there been a restaurant of interest nearby I probably would have chosen other than the hotel restaurant but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t.\nRoom 402 is an accessible king.  It is appointed with king bed, a small desk and chair, sofa, side chair and coffee table. There is floor to ceiling windows looking out over 25th street allowing in tons of natural light.  There is both a sheer and blackout curtain that automatically will open and close with a slight pull of each.  Both the bed and sofa were comfortable.  There is a cabinet which provides a few doors for storage, a microwave, safe and houses the iron\/ironing board.  Space to hang clothes is almost non-existent.  Maybe one or two items but not even worth bothering moving the items being stored in there to use.  There is also a large bar area to the left of the bed, offering counter space and a few drawers for storage. The in-room coffee\/tea was Starbucks and Tazo\/Bigelow.  I\u2019d prefer if it were a Keurig as those seem more sanitary than the units which hold the water in a reservoir.  It looked clean and I hope it was given how new the property is but overtime, it could get pretty gross.  There is also a small bar sink and refrigerator in this area.  The bathroom was spacious but offered absolutely no counter space or shelving for toiletries.  That was maybe the most disappointing feature of the room.  The shampoo\/conditioner brand was a generic.  I would have expected a little nicer option but not worth any fuss.  The one feature of the room which probably gets overlooked but actually makes the room pretty great is the very tall ceilings.  When most New York hotel rooms can feel cramped, the large ceilings and windows really made this room feel extremely spacious.    I actually booked this room for the balcony and paid more for it.  The weather turned out to be a little cooler than forecasted so I didn\u2019t get to take advantage of the space as I was hoping to.  It is furnished with a small sofa, chair, coffee table, a few artificial plants and screens on both sides to provide privacy from the neighboring balconies.  As mentioned, the room overlooks 25th street.  Directly across the street are low rise buildings so the view expands beyond a couple blocks but certainly not the views that I saw in the online listing.  The balconies are not covered nor is there a heater so really only useful when the weather is nice, which for New York, is probably less than fifty percent of the time.  And hopefully, the neighboring balconies are respectful of the semi-private space.  In the end, I wouldn\u2019t book the room again given the price point.\nWhile it has been a couple of years since I was in the Chelsea area, it was not an area I would recommend for now.  Traveling alone, I didn\u2019t feel as safe as I expected.  I walked the 9 blocks to Macy\u2019s and overall it was fine, but definitely clutched my purse tight and was on guard.  The crowd is a mix of characters, some which made me feel concerned for my safety or at minimum, on high alert.  There were store fronts shut down and more grafetti than I saw in other parts of the city, such as Mid-Town.  Until New York fully returns to pre-pandemic crowds, I think I would choose another part of the city for my next stay.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

On Sunday when we tried to get downstairs we waited over 30 minutes for an elevator.  We saw people were walking down the stairs.  My husband who has heart issues and difficulty walking any distance was forced to walk down 12 flights of stairs with his luggage so that we could make out train.  No employees in sight to help.  No signs.  No warning.  When we got to the front desk the clerk laughed a little when I told her what had happened.  When I asked her if the situation amused her she did not apologize and merely stated two elevators were out and the engineers had been called (at least one elevator had been out for over 12 hours).

Rooms here are standard NYC sized (read: small), which is fine for me. The bed was very comfortable, but I found the closet space (less than 1ft of hanging space + 1 drawer) a bit challenging. \n\nThroughout the week, my room was not made up twice while I was away for the day (I was out of the room 9am to 10pm each day, and there was no do not disturb sign up either time). The first time it happened, I called the desk and the concierge apologized and offered to send towels. Unfortunately, it took over an hour for those fresh towels to arrive, so I didn\u2019t bother asking the second time it happened. I also never received my welcome gift during the week, which I normally get as an elite member. \n\nThere is also a strange dynamic between guests for the rooftop bar and guests of the hotel, where the former get priority over the elevator use. On several occasions, I had to wait well over 10 minutes to get in an elevator to go up to my room because any available elevator would be used for the bar guests.\n\nWhat was most disappointing was at checkout, when I reiterated the challenges I had during my stay, the staff member just commented \u201cthat\u2019s strange\u201d. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting, but I felt disappointed with how my feedback was handled. \n\nThe only silver lining for this stay was that there was a room available for my early check-in at 12 when I arrived. However overall, I felt the experience was disappointing for the $ spent. I travel to NYC for work frequently and am not sure I will return again for future stays, despite it being my only option for Marriott hotels nearby. \n\n\u2014-\nOne other note if indoor masking matters to you - little to no members of the staff wear masks indoors, and neither do most of the guests.

Not having used it before, I read the instructions carefully and made the request several weeks before my trip. Imagine my surprise when I received an email four days before arrival that an upgrade to a suite had been confirmed! This five day trip to the Renaissance was a very special one for my wife and myself and I didn't let on that we were going to be staying in style. Once the confirmation email arrived I looked at the hotel website to see what the suites looked like and was in awe, wondering which one we would be assigned.\n\nWe arrived at the brand spanking new Renaissance Chelsea and was immediately impressed with the property. After a quick check-in we went up to the room and I opened the door, anticipating my wife's excitement. Then it happened.. it was an ordinary, small New York City hotel room, and then I had to spill the beans to my wife that it was supposed to be a suite. Knowing that I had the suite upgrade confirmation with me, we went back down to report that we were given the wrong room. But as it turned out, it was anything but a mistake. I politely spoke to the person who checked me in and without a flinch she sought the help of the desk manager. After some fancy keyboard work the manager said that there weren't any suites available and that at this property a suite upgrade isn't really an upgrade to a suite but a one room level upgrade, you know, the kind that Elite's are supposed to be given if available. I'm a type \"M\" personality (mellow) and didn't raise my voice or give her a hard time, but I did try to stand my ground. In the end she wore me out as I tucked my tail up between my legs and walked away, totally defeated, seething and worst of all - feeling slighted. I wasn't even offered a goodwill gesture like a bottle of wine, the attitude being that I was granted an upgrade from a 225 square foot room to a 226 square foot room and that I should be thankful for having received even that.\n\nAccording to the Marriott site, I have stayed at Marriott's a total of 1,760 nights over the years, and that doesn't include stays which were in my wife's name, so I would venture to guess that's it's more like 2,100 nights. I have been to hundreds of Marriott's worldwide, from Australia to Zurich and have never been more disappointed and felt dejected as I did last week. \n\nI will follow up with my assessment of this property.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

But if you care about cleanness, you might think twice about staying at the Renaissance NYC Chelsea hotel. I suspect the Marriott is understaffed or unwilling to pay for staff with hotel management and hotel housekeeping experience. Housekeeping is practically nonexistent at the Renaissance. Yes, kudos on the chic club vibe the hotel is going for. I prefer to sleep in clean sheets and not find the previous guest(s) hair all over the bathroom floor and shower. And I don't mean a strand of hair, here and there. I mean balls of hair! The shower didn't drain. There were water (or urine?) stains on the floor around the toilet.  The sheets looked clean at first glance. On the 3rd (and last) night of my stay, I noticed housekeeping made the bed but left all sorts of lint and trash that I left on the bed that morning. I then wondered, if they failed to shake the bed cover and remove trash off the bed, yet the bed is made, what else are they not removing. I removed the bed covers to find dark stains (fluid stains) on the sheets by the foot of the bed. I had been sleeping on dirty sheets my whole stay!!\nYes, I reported it all to front desk management twice. There weren't rooms available. I suggested to the front desk manager to send in housekeeping to clean my room while I was out. At the very least, vacuum and clean the bathroom floor and shower. That never happened. BTW, upon checking in, front desk will charge your credit card $25 per person per night. Mind you this \"resort\" fee was not disclosed in the reservation. The hotel justifies the daily $25 fee by offering a hotel credit in the same amount that you can redeem for breakfast at the hotel restaurant or drinks at the hotel bar.\n\nHousekeeping staff did not wear masks.

From the outside, its a Renaissance, newly built slightly over 1 year ago, with upgraded finishes.  When you check-in, you realize there is no restaurant and no room service due to Covid.  You can't even get a coffee in the lobby.  The rooms are small, even for NYC standards.  The Aveda toiletries advertised are gone and replaced by another brand you've never heard of that is an inferior quality.  The walls are thin to the point where you can hear conversations in the adjoining rooms.  While the bathroom is slightly above average it also lacks the ability for someone to put on makeup directly in front of a mirror with good lighting.  Also, and its not the hotel's doing, but the homeless encamped on the sidewalk is unsightly but harmless, at least in our experience.  Lastly, like other posters have commented, our AC unit struggled to keep the temperature cool.  It was humid when visiting and our clothes, while hung in the room, became damp as the AC wasn't able to cool the room.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The rooms are small but brand new and with great decor. Bed was comfortable, showers are nice. Our bathroom door did not close properly, and a maintenance worker was unable to fix it, but not a huge issue. We asked for a high floor as I am a light sleeper and we wanted to avoid noise. We got a room on the 34th floor, thinking we\u2019d be far from street noise. Unbeknownst to us when booking, a rooftop club opened the weekend of our stay on the top two floors of the hotel. Hotel guests have no special privileges or access to the rooftop club or pool\u2014we were just told you have to get your own reservation separately. Very strange for a higher end hotel to offer no benefits to guests or help with access. Also, these were advertised as amenities for the hotel and are absolutely not.\n\nThe real problem started our second night\u2014Saturday night, we arrived home to go to bed to find a massive crowd around the hotel of people trying to get into the rooftop club. No issue, we went around them and up to the room. Except we could hear loud bass through the walls\/ceiling from the club FIVE floors up and music through the window. This noise went on until FOUR IN THE MORNING. And was audible over the earplugs and sound machine we brought. We called the front desk about the music, and they said no one else complained and the club was closed. A lie. After another call at 4am with the music still going, the front desk said they were wrapping things up upstairs.  \n\nThe next morning, we requested to be moved to a lower floor away from the club. The front desk was very helpful and accommodating and we had great service. However, they said no one else had complained, but we met a women in the elevator saying she had also complained and could hear the music on the 35th floor. We did not hear music on the lower floor after moving rooms, but not sure if it was because the club closed earlier that night (Sunday).\n\nOverall, the noise issue was ridiculous. We wish we had been informed of a 4am club and poor soundproofing when we were put on the 34th floor and had specifically requested a quiet room. Were it not for this problem, I would have given this place 5 stars. They seriously need to sort out the noise problem. Definitely do not stay anywhere near the rooftop club on a weekend.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Holding for 30 minutes, who can do that? Essentially customers are an inconvenience to this organisation and any opportunity to cut back on customer service has been taken resulting in a very alienating guest experience.

This newish Renaissance checks all my boxes.  Great front desk staff (if your nice, some guests are deplorable), an Excellent General Manager, Chris and its a new property well kitted out.  It's location cannot be beat, blocks from Fashion institute of Technology, Macy's, Chelsea, over 100 restaurants and bars.  Pre-Covid rates were around $275-$375 +tax and fees per night....so anyone staying today is on a half price sale if you book smartly.  Coffee shops on both corners as well as a strong creative, gay and homeless population all living together in that \"Flower district\", this is a great NYC edgy Neighborhood and one I would even consider living in.   Rooms tends to be rather small as most are 230 square feet but they are perfectly planned and the beds are super comfy as are the linens.   Lobby Bar and Restaurant is due to open soon and the roof top pool with a spectacular Empire state view I was told is opening around Memorial day.   During my 7 day stay, I asked for housekeeping services every day and they came 7 days....some days they were more thorough then others, but during covid, you must be realistic.  Even 7 days cleaning is far better then most hotels around.....  There are only 5 suites out of 341 rooms so if you want one, book it.  Even if you are the Marriott king.....There is no upgrading to those suites.....People are paying full wack and hotels are indeed a business where $$ talks.   Currently bottled water at the front desk.  They actually helped with my vast luggage which was greatly appreciated, as I said, lovely staff.   I left because I had friends coming in to another hotel which was indeed less $ but cannot compare...While its been fun, I look back at my time in the Renaissance Chelsea with much fondness and I will return soon.   There are some great rates out there, so look around.  Please don't steal the sheets.....ooh yes,  with lower rates they are getting some players who are outrageous guests and you can see them if you sit in the lobby and work for a while with your ears open......   You are also allowed to order in food to the lobby to eat if you wish and avoid the strong smell of dinner \"lingering\" in your room.    They have really made the best of what they have, given the circumstances.  Stay healthy and I wish Safe Travels to all.  Cheers!","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Sadly, with covid, restaurants are closed at the property and of course you must wear your mask in all common areas.\nThe rooms are a great size for the city (without paying an arm and a leg) and it had a beautiful view. We reserved a Corner King View room and were granted an upgraded floor the day prior due to a special occasion. Unfortunately, the room was taken by another guest upon our arrival; however, we were placed on the 23rd floor with a corner view and the gentleman working that evening graciously discounted our rate a bit due to the inconvenience. \nValet didn't seem to be an option during our stay there, we arrived in the middle of the night and valet typically doesn't run that late anyhow; however, I saw none during the day either. We didn't have much trouble finding parking on the street the hotel is on though - or one street over, no biggie. \nWe had no trouble with customer service, requested towels a few times, tooth brushes, laundry bags, etc. all were met with happy tones and immediate deliveries.\nWe walked from the hotel to Times Square and back, it's a good walk - but a beautiful one. There are tons of restaurants within a few block radius - highly recommend 2 Bros Pizza on the corner, as well as The Smith a few blocks up. Lots of local shopping nearby as well!","travelDate":"2020-09","tripType":"NONE"}

When I  informed the receptionist that's the room that I booked, I was told that there were no upgrades available.  After getting to our room, I checked the Marriott app and saw that there were at least 1 corner room available (for $30 more than my booked room).  I called the front desk, and the receptionist then went to presumably speak with her manager and came back to tell me that I can have that room for $100\/night more.  I suggested that this was  not the usual response I get from  other Marriott properties and was told that the manager would call me back in about 20 minutes.  The manager never called.\n\nNext the room.  The rooms looked good in photos but in reality, it were much smaller than expected and looked rather cheap with faux tiles and cheap furnishings.  The closet is also tiny and pretty much useless for anything more than a couple of coats.  In addition, there was no safe in the room and we had no real view.\n\nSUMMARY\nDon't stay here.  While the hotel is in a good location and has a cool lobby, it isn't enough to justify a stay there.  There are a lot of Marriott properties in Manhattan and a many are better value and treat elites much better.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Being a Platinum member, I was surprised that I could not check-in (even after doing the mobile check-in and having it confirmed) when I arrived at 12.  Even when I offered to wait, I was told nothing was available until 3:30.  There were several of us in the same boat.   The first time in over 50 stays at least.   Also, when I was able to check in and waited for my stored luggage which was clearly stored somewhere far, far away, I observed all four front desk chatting with a guest about his trip to Barbados when clearly there was another guest waiting and getting increasingly irritated.  I like their enthusiasm and personal attention, but there needs to be more training and efficiency.  My check-in process took over 5 minutes, which is long for a check-in process.\n\nThe outstanding part were the guys out front standing in the cold--a huge shout out to Andrew and Chris.  They provided phenomenal service.  From the moment Andrew patiently waited for me to exit the taxi, which took about ten minutes because of a payment snafu, to their efficiency and professionalism, I was impressed.  Believe me, usually, I'm in a rush in and out so don't notice these things.  And, anytime I tipped, they were appreciative--other hotels, especially in NYC, they feel it's their due.  Whoever is in charge for the bellhop\/valet.\n\nLove the funky\/quirky style fo this hotel.  The rooms are nice but super small.  Also, there is a design flaw in the bathroom sink.   The custom cement\/concrete sink is smaller than average with a shelf above it.  When I lean over the sink, somehow my face is over the ledge with the faucet underneath the ledge.  If I move back a step to wash my face, spit, etc., I'm not fully over the sink.

Everything is brand new since the property was built from the ground up and opened four days before I arrived, and everything worked perfectly (including the bunny shaped light and coffee maker (Starbucks provided); there is no fridge).  The bedding was comfortable and the towels were awesome. Not a ton of storage - the closet area was literally about 16 inches wide and held the ironing board, so clothes horses might have some troubles.  But the three cute bunny hooks on the wall can hold a coat and other things, and really I had no issues at all with the amount of storage space.  The walls were a bunch of different textures and designs but they worked well together and all in all the bedroom is very nice to look at.  There was a cozy chair in the corner, a couple of handy little trays for your pocket stuff, and both sides of the bed had two nesting tables, more great details. Lots of places to plug things in and lights everywhere you need them.  Wifi was fine.  Housekeeping sadly took my little shampoo bottles and bar of soap after the first night - incredibly wasteful but probably a training issue.\n\nThe bathroom again was on the smaller side but was perfectly fine.  In fact the rainfall shower (no tub - yay!) was one of the best hotel showers I\u2019ve ever experienced.  And the concrete sink and cool etched mirror with nightlight feature were also nice touches.  The framed picture in the bathroom also matched the framing of the bathroom door.  Nicely done!\n\nService was good, and I almost never had to touch a door handle thanks to the many doormen always eager to assist.  The elevators require a key tap before you can type in or tap a screen to choose your floor.  I never had to wait for an elevator but the card reader was very finicky.\n\nBreakfast for Platinum guests was a definite lowlight and almost has to be a temporary solution.  The best I can describe the spread is \u201csad\u201d.  It was brought in from some outside caterer on a cart and consisted of bins of scrambled eggs, potatoes, and bacon, a bowl of yogurt, a bowl of cut up fruit and some bread for toasting.  It was all laid out on the bar, separate from the dining room, and just looked and felt like an afterthought.  But at least it was offered and it filled me up fine, but I\u2019ve had better breakfasts at a Fairfield Inn.  Even the coffee was brought in from the outside in urns, and my coffee was brought to me in a paper cup even though a nice mug was on my table.  I also had a bottle of beer one night at the bar - disappointed that it was $12 but that\u2019s life in the big city.  \u201cRoom service\u201d is handled by an outside company but the prices were very reasonable.  \n\nThe room I had on the 22nd floor featured great soundproof windows but alarmingly for a brand new hotel the soundproofing didn\u2019t seem to extend to the walls. I could fairly clearly hear people coughing and having normal conversations in other rooms, though I never heard like a tv blaring or anything that kept me awake.  But I do wonder what it might have been like had I had bad neighbors.  \n\nI should mention the basement gym is small but had maybe 4 treadmills, a spin cycle, a recumbent bike, and a couple of elliptical machines, along with some dumbbells and mats and things.  Pretty small but functional, and all brand new.  There was an odd filtered water machine that looked like a coffee maker - I\u2019ve never seen a contraption like it before.\n\nOverall I liked the new Renaissance and look forward to seeing the new rooftop pool and bar when they eventually open. But hopefully the walls are not as thin as they seemed and the breakfast situation sees some improvement.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}
