There are only a handful of employees, and you will probably meet them all during your stay, and every one of them will make you feel happy and at home. There is a nice lounge to grab a drink or a bite. It closes early, but trust me, there is plenty else to do in the neighborhood. There are lovely tile finishes on each floor that have a groovy art deco vibe.  It\u2019s small, so you aren\u2019t waiting constantly for the elevator to arrive. It\u2019s clean, clean, clean.

My boyfriend and I stayed in Manhatten for 5 days, and we wanted somewhere with good connections to other areas of the city, and a bit of life at night.  Last time I visited NYC, I stayed on Park Ave near Central Park.  The hotel was much fancier, but also ~ double the price of this.  There also wasn't much going on around there really, as it is all hotels and offices.  Value for money doesn't really exist in NYC, but I would say that Washington Square Hotel is better value than a lot of other places.\n\nThe hotel was clean and served as a good base.  The room was cleaned daily and the bathroom was spotless.  There was also a coffee machine, TV, hairdryer, iron + ironing board, and thankfully good air con.  There were robes if you wanted to use the spa facility - we didn't bother with this.  We also didn't use the hotel restaurant or bar.  We simply wanted somewhere we could sleep and shower, as we were out for the majority of the day\/night exploring - and the hotel served this job perfectly.  The staff were also polite and professional.  The corridors were a little tired and dated, and could do with new carpet and a lick of paint - but ultimately this is not something which causes problems!! \n\nIn terms of the location - it is great for getting around NYC.  It is right by W4 St subway station which has about 5-6 lines running through it.  You can be at central park in ~ 10 mins, and downtown in the same time.  I think we even used the same subway to get to the Bronx and Brooklyn.  Getting around is easy from this spot!  It is also v close to the famous Bleecker St where there is great bars and music\/comedy venues.  The area around the hotel is a student district for NYU, and Washington Square Garden is lively and entertaining (about 2 mins walk from the hotel).  I wouldn't say I felt unsafe, but there were times when we saw multiple people taking drugs, so if this is something which would bother you, then it might be important to consider.  One afternoon we saw a man injecting himself in the street moments away from the hotel.  We never had any issues, and generally the area is busy, so you don't feel isolated or vulnerable, but maybe just be aware about this and be cautious. ","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":6,"locationId":93382,"title":"To have so much potential squandered is so sad.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-05-01","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"At the suggestion of a follow traveler, because he felt that it was important as a long time customer (20+ years) of WSH that I share the reasons for my decision to no longer stay at the property with the hotel\u2019s management, on March 8, 2023, I sent a detailed email to Sonny Christopher the general manager outlining my escalating dissatisfaction. I have received no response. Now I know that the failures are coming from the top down.  So, here is some practical advice offered up based upon many many nights spent at WSH:\n\n1.  If you drop your bags off because your room isn\u2019t ready when you arrive, come back AT 3:30 pm to check-in particularly on the weekends. Because they no longer take your credit card info and check you in when you arrive you are not a guest of the hotel.  If you have plans that consume your day and you don\u2019t return to the hotel until later in the evening you run the risk of discovering that the hotel is full and you have no place to stay.  (Telling the front desk you will be out all day\/evening falls on deaf ears.) The on-line check-in email you receive the morning of your stay is for their purposes, not yours and does not check you in. You are checked in when they run your credit card and not one second before.\n\n2. The day front desk staff have become openly contemptuous, disrespectful, and rude. (This started before Covid. During the height of Covid they were terrific. Martha\u2019s level of customer service should be the standard.  She was phenomenal.) If you are from out of town it isn\u2019t a NYC \u2018tude.  So when they are condescending it isn\u2019t you, it is them. I began to think of checking in as a gauntlet of unnecessary nastiness I had to endure at the beginning of my stay.  The evening front desk staff are usually very kind.\n\n3. Avoid staying on the second floor. Some rooms are okay but, in general, they are noisy either from the street or lobby noise (even #15).\n\n4.  Interior rooms with no windows may look a bit odd and are cramped but trust me, as someone who has stayed in room 15 on every floor, they are spectacular for a good nights sleep.  \n\n5.  In the winter months the interior rooms are hot, very hot, particularly on the lower floors. The colder it is outside, the hotter the room. The maintenance crew is incredibly responsive and will do the best they can to make the room\u2019s temperature less tropical, but bring summer pjs.\n\n6. If possible, once you\u2019ve taken your bags to your room, take the stairs.  The elevators are old, small and slow. The stairs are faster.\n\n7.  Don\u2019t be surprised if one of the doormen brings up politics.  You can refuse to engage or try to change\/avoid\/redirect the conversation, but he will not back off.  He has very strident opinions.\n\n8.  The room the front desk likes to refer to as the 9th floor penthouse is a kidney shape closet with a twin bed and a gorgeous view. They will claim it is one of the best rooms in the hotel. To each his own, but I stayed in it only because I wasn\u2019t able to make it back to check-in at 3:30 pm. It was not the type of room I reserved. The front desk was very clear - take it or leave it, it is all we have left (at least I had a room). He was the only evening desk clerk I\u2019ve encountered who had the day staff nasty attitude. Happily that weekend was the only time I encountered him.\n\nI\u2019ve had the pleasure of trying out 2 different new NYC hotels since my last WSH stay.  I really miss my #15 rooms at WSH and the comfort of the familiar but being treated with kindness and knowing I\u2019ll come back to a hotel where a room is waiting for me even if my bags are being stored no matter what the hour I return is far more important.\n\nThank you for the many years of fond memories and the terrific staff I have enjoyed getting to know. I sincerely hope that the management improves because the property and its guests deserve better. ","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

While the rooms admittedly are small, as some reviewers note, well, that's NYC for you unless you are prepared to part with a lot more cash. \nThe hotel's location could not be better if you are a walker: it's near several subway lines and is smack in the middle of the Village, directly across the street from WS Park. \nRooms: I love firm mattresses and this one was the best I've ever slept on. Everything was spic and span, with bathroom amenities from Bigelow's an almost 200-year old pharmacy around the corner. (Check it out, it's beautiful, with everything from toothpaste to $200 hairbrushes.) This time, my room had no view, but it was super quiet. \nThe gym is improved since last visit: it's small but I never see anyone in it, so you get the Treadmill and Elliptical, and free weights, to yourself. It also faces the street and gets natural light. \nAs a guest of the hotel, you receive a 10% discount in the WSH restaurant, which you can access through the hotel. It's lovely and won't break the bank. Service is great. \nFinally, while some complain that the area around the hotel has deteriorated in the past few years, while that is true, this is not a function of the hotel but of Manhattan in general, where it is impossible to walk two blocks without smelling weed and working one's way around trash and the homeless, with the combined effects of Covid, the legalization of marijuana, and a stuttering economy wreaking their predictable havoc on the city.

We were in town for the Whitney\u2019s Hopper exhibit and wanted to stay in the area.  Our regular hotel was the Marleton but we were blown away how at the WSH we could have a spacious King room, COVID safe quieter lobby, and a great lounge & restaurant - for less $$. The WSH is not glitzy nor is it quite as \u201cpolished\u2019\u201d as the Marleton, but the room was twice the size and very well equipped with a desk for work, bathtub, and seating. Our room faced away from the street , so it was quiet with expansive views.  The two elevators to each floor meant we were never waiting from our 6th floor room.  Critical to us, was that we felt COVID safe.  They recommended masks as soon as we entered which of course was optional, but a significant percentage of people did wear masks, as did all of the staff in the restaurant at Breakfast.  The lobby was never crowded.  A big plus was having the lounge and restaurant connected to the Hotel; meaning in the cold (highs in the 20\u2019s that week), we could simply walk through to have a drink (great Happy Hour) , enjoy the Sunday Jazz in the bar or have breakfast.  The menu was good and we were pleasantly surprised how good dinner was when we decided it was just tooooo cold to make our reservation.  The menu was innovative and reasonably priced. The standout were the desserts - and we are not dessert people - but this had been the recommendation of another guest.   The area around Washington Square is always interesting, plenty of restaurants, bars and things to do. Transportation links are strong and it was a $15 taxi ride all the way to the Met!

It has a style and charm that make it feel like a top-quality European 3 star hotel. \n\nIt's an old building with beautiful art nouveau features, room decor which complements that look.  You'll never wake up and wonder what hotel and what city you're in.  And, yes, the corridors are narrow and the elevators small.  \n\nBut what really makes it for me is the operation.  Maintenance is meticulous, and housekeeping top notch.  The housekeeping and front-of-house staff are all pleasant and cheerful, and almost all have been there for years -- a rarity in NYC.  My understanding is that it's been owned by the same family for decades, and the staff stability, continuous improvements and eye for detail suggest they manage the place for the long run.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I think for sure they need to invest in some renovations. I was surprised that although my rooms were supposed to get breakfast they did not offer due to Covid.

The location is amazing with easy walking access to so many interesting areas, shops and restaurants. The staff was excellent and very helpful. We booked a double room (2 beds) because these tend to be bigger and we were not disappointed. The room and bathroom, by any standards, were large with lots of windows overlooking the park. The beds and pillows were very comfy and we both slept well each night. But, there are some downsides...\nThe hotel itself is a bit run down. Some might find it charming...I thought it was in desperate need of some paint and TLC! It is clean but because it's so run down, it doesn't always appear that way. It reminded me very much of small hotels in Europe rather than North America - tiny elevator, very narrow hallways, worn carpeting, peeling paint, etc. The walls were also very thin - we could hear conversations coming from the room next to us and every step taken by the people over us. That being said, the hotels seems to cater to an older clientele so no one was partying late into the night and our sleep was never disturbed.\nBeing so affordable, and well located, I can overlook the faults of the hotel - but, really, these are things that could be quite easily fixed with a fresh coat of paint and some deep cleaning.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Even though I booked on a third-party site, I was treated, from the get-go, like a VIP guest.

No, there were no phone trees or menus, this is a hotel with real people who are truly awesome and helpful. Further was amazed when Charles said he would ask that my room include a refrigerator upon arrival.\n\nOf course, upon arrival, a room was blocked that had the refrigerator and I was all set for a nice 3-day stay. As it turned out I had such a great experience, this day extended an additional night as I just did not want to leave.\n\nWhy? From the awesome front desk staff including Charles and Beverly to the amazing doormen - such personable, upbeat, friendly and just all-around genuine nice folks.

Amazing eateries, shopping, and scenery. Plus for the most part, in a very residential neighborhood with a different side of NYC that you would encounter in the more touristy areas.\n\nThe room was well appointed, with a very comfortable bed, the best water pressure ever shower, and super-quiet.

The hotel building is old so expect beautiful art deco decor in the lobby, classic (small\/slow) elevator, carpeted hallways, and thick walls.  My room was a mix of classic and modern with newer hard surface flooring in the room and art deco tile in the bathroom.  Shoutout to the housecleaning staff for my room being spotlessly clean.  The linens and mattress were so comfortable. And I had enough open space to not feel the least bit cramped. The hotel staff was friendly, efficient, and still wearing masks.  Their other Covid protocols are still in place as well.   As I arrived at 6pm on a Friday, I scored a parking spot right on the tree-lined street out front of the hotel.  But I believe they validate if parking in the nearby parking garage. There is a large citi bike station to rent bicycles on the side of the hotel.

I love Greenwich area and there are not a lot of hotels there. We've stayed here before & the location is perfect.  We have 2 kids (8 &11). The park across the street was perfect for them.  They loved playing there & it seem like there is always something going on there.  'I am Legend' was partly filmed there as well so it's neat to see.  You're minutes away from Soho & a 18 minute walk to Chelsea Market. WSH has a bunch of places to go in the area...they posted it on their website which is fantastic.  i'd like to add Kest\u00e9 pizza on Bleecker to the cheap eats for $5 pies that are amazing & you cannot beat the price or the taste. \n \nWSH has a continental breakfast in the am...fruit, toast, coffee, OJ, yogurt, scones, muffins, jam, peanut butter, nutella, granola, pastries. Which is great. It's near impossible to find any hotels that offer complimentary breakfast in Manhattan and that saves you money because everything is so expensive.  \n\nOnly complaint are the beds.  We took a room w two double beds for 4 ppl.  The beds are tight. We were ok with it tho as everything else was perfect.  The elevators are small...I mean small. Maybe 4-5 can fit in the one, 8ppl in the other comfortably. The hotel is in an Art Deco Decor - which is probably the era of when it opened. The hallways are a little dated. Everything is clean and tidy. We stayed on the 9th floor and the view was amazing. We pulled up the shades at night when the lights were out & its a beautiful view. This is a boutique hotel. It has character but it is smaller.\n \nRon at the front desk is great!  He is a wealth of knowledge & helped us out a lot. We would definitely go back to this hotel.

I booked the King Penthouse and my understanding is that if you really want to go all out you could book it and the adjoining queen or double penthouse and you would have one HUGE space.\n\nAs other reviewers will tell you, this is not your fancy corporatey-feeling hotel.  It is relatively small, the furnishings are simple but here's the thing: the staff is super nice and helpful; the location is outstanding (you literally can walk right out the door and be at great restaurants, historical spots, bakeries, park, etc. immediately) and the price is extremely reasonable for what you get.\n\nSo if you are going to be disappointed that your room doesn't look like a Doubletree or Hilton or Ritz, probably shouldn't go here.  If you are looking for great value, supporting an independently-run hotel, would recommend you go for it.  \n\nI don't know how big the other rooms are - I suspect not as large as the king penthouse - which by the way has three windows, each of which looks out in a different direction.\n\nMy ONLY negative comment is that there was one sort of sketchy looking person who seemed to just be roaming about the hotel - every time we took the elevator, this person magically appeared out of nowhere, which seemed a bit odd.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Housekeeping is on point with cleanliness and plenty of towels.  Front desk was friendly and accommodating to store my luggage until my room was available as well as for a slightly later check out in the end.  Continental breakfast is standard bread products, yogurt and fruit.  The hotel gym is packed, perhaps a bit too much, with equipment, so there isn't much space to do free weights or floor work\/yoga though I was the only using it each time so an area was found.\nThe actual rooms vary greatly in quality, though.  First room I checked into was quite small.  There were two beds that took up the whole space; don't even know how two people could maneuver in the room, with the bathroom being the size of a closet.  Nothing like what was pictured on their website.  I booked the room based on what I saw on the website to meet my needs for the long weekend stay, which included having professional in-room hair and makeup done for an event.  In this tiny room, that wouldn't be possible.  I called the front desk and politely asked what happened.  I was initially told the hotel was fully booked though I could be moved to a larger room by the end of the next day.  Luckily the front desk staff then talked with a manager, and called me back within minutes to say that they were able to move me to a slightly larger room at that moment.  The next room (221) was as seen on the website.  It was also much larger, not slightly larger, then the initial room.  The bathroom was large with two sinks.  The room had three windows for good natural light as well as a vanity.  The shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water.\nAs its an old building, the walls\/ceiling are thin and noise from neighboring guests may be heard.  Also, being on the 2nd floor was convenient to be able to take the stairs rather than the elevator though it was also closer to the city street noises.\nThe beds and linens were comfortable and afforded a good nights sleep.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

All were executive king rooms and we were totally satisfied with them. First of all, they are really huge, and not just compared to other New York hotel rooms which are generally small. It seems that each floor has one executive room (number 2, so we had rooms 202, 502 and 802) and those rooms look out across the front of the hotel. The beds are comfortable, the bathroom is large and well-appointed. The closet is a bit narrow, but there are lots of drawers and shelves, so plenty of space to unpack your things. Bathrobes, umbrellas, a Keurig machine with plenty of pods are some of the useful features of the rooms. The only complaint would be that with all that space they could add more furniture. There is one leather reading chair, but it has no arms, one ottoman, and a desk chair. There is room for more seating.\n\nThe complementary continental breakfast is very good and if you take it in the dining room you can always add items like eggs for an additional cost. \n\nThe small fitness room is well equipped with machines, weights and yoga mats.

I felt safe as a lone female traveller knowing there was someone downstairs.\n\nMain Room\nThe room on the 8th floor was fairly small but I didn\u2019t need much space. The bed was a twin pushed together, however as both beds where on wheels they moved around a lot!!. The door isn\u2019t exactly into its frame so there was light from the corridor coming into the room with the lights out. The room isn\u2019t soundproofed so you hear a LOT from the surrounding rooms but a good bonus is there is little traffic noise. Generally everything is a little scruffy, marks, not super clean and dated. There wasn\u2019t enough desk space for me to work which was a big disappointment.\n\nBathroom\nThe water in the shower never got hot, and I ran it for some time!! Liked the toiletries though. The bathroom was clean but small.\n\nIn room service\/amenities\nThere is no room service here, and rooms come with a coffee machine and water only. There were robes and slippers which was a bonus. Safe was good and worked. TV ok but very high on the wall!!\nI should mention the room cleaning after day 1 - for some reason rubbish wasn\u2019t cleared so I had to leave it outside the room over night. The cleaner also spilled shampoo all over my toiletries and left it - which was annoying as it ruined a compact.\n\nLifts\nDon\u2019t use the smaller of the 2 - it does t always work. Which means the main lift is busy.\n\nBreakfast\nI only needed breakfast 1 of the days I was there. It is meant to start at 7.15 but at 7.20 nothing was put out yet but I was told i could go down to the kitchen? The guy could not have cared less!! The croissants were pretty stale.\n\nCheck out\nThis was the oddest part - I came down and was presented with the bill - no good morning, how was your stay, can I get someone to help with your bags. As I was paying he answered the phone to someone else so I wasn\u2019t sure if I was done - so no goodbye........ it\u2019s company money so I\u2019m not going to complain or ask for a refund or anything but it would have been nice to get some acknowledgement.\n\nWhilst I wouldn\u2019t stay again, or recommend the hotel based on the room - even if I did, the service killed it for me!","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I say \u201cshort stay\u201d because the rooms are not large, so it could get claustrophobic after 6 days. It\u2019s in a quiet spot right off the northwest corner of Washington Square Park, with easy access to many subway lines and PATH trains. Very quick trip to and from Penn Station. The service is friendly, and they have a free continental breakfast in the morning (though the breakfast room is pretty cramped). The elevators are small, and there are only two of them servicing 8 floors. The biggest shortcoming with this hotel is the gym. It is cramped and not well-ventilated (steamy in August), and the equipment is old and frankly kind of grim. They really need to spend some money to update the entire thing. Still, the price is very modest for a NYC hotel, and the location cannot get any better if you want to spend your time experiencing all the Village has to offer.

At first the ambience appears dated but you get the feel that all the locals eating there like it just like it is.\nWe would definitely stay at the WSH again.

I'm glad to say this hotel is it. Perfectly located in neighborhoods and not tourism central, walkable and bikeable to everywhere, the citibike rack is a 10 second walk from the front door and THE cleanest hotel I have probably ever stayed in.  \nThere wasn't carpet in our room but rather wood laminate floors which were squeaky clean, I loved not having to think about nasty carpet under my feet. \nThere was plenty of floor space and area for keeping suitcases in our room (#310) did not feel cramped as other city hotel rooms I've stayed in. \nExtremely quiet, no sirens or car horns, no hallway or elevator noise, no noise of any kind.\nExtremely helpful and friendly staff, always someone standing in the main lobby to answer questions or help in any way. We called down for housekeeping two times to swap out our dirty towels (in the evening) and both times they delivered them in well under 5 mins. \nThis is a fantastic old building that is extremely well cared for and it shows. You get to enjoy the quirks of a building that age with narrow winding hallways, a gorgeous staircase bannister, small elevator (works like new) the lovely tile (CLEAN) in the bathroom and the water pressure was perfection....there is nothing bad to say of this hotel!

Leider wurde das Larchmont geschlossen und wir mussten uns ein neues Hotel suchen. Es musste unbedingt im Village liegen, denn gerade abends ist es der sch\u00f6nste Ort. Jede Menge Restaurants, Caf\u00e9s, Clubs. Alles in kleinen Stra\u00dfen, f\u00fcr Manhattan sehr ruhig. Genau das Richtige, um nach einem aufregenden Tag ein wenig runterzufahren, ohne sich zu langweilen. Da im Village kaum Hotels sind, waren wir froh, das WSH zu finden. Die Lage direkt am wunderbaren Park ist ein Traum. Und das Hotel ist auch gro\u00dfartig. Leider deutlich teurer als das Larchmont, f\u00fcr New Yorker Verh\u00e4ltnisse aber immer noch eher g\u00fcnstig. Abgesehen von der sensationellen Lage bietet das Hotel saubere, gut ausgestattete Zimmer, sehr nettes & hilfsbereites Personal, ein leckeres Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck (absolutes Muss: das homemade granola) - in der Auswahl nicht riesig, aber nach unserem Geschmack absolut ausreichend. Alles, was man braucht. Der A-Train bringt einen noch dazu direkt vom Flughafen JFK zur n\u00e4chstgelegenden Subway Station (West 4th) und auch die Path-Train-Station (Newark Airport) ist nicht weit. \n\nWer abends nicht im lauten und grellen Trubel von Midtown oder Uptown wohnen m\u00f6chte, aber trotzdem ein lebendiges Nachtleben um sich herum m\u00f6chte - der wohnt im Village. Im Washington Square Hotel! Wir f\u00fcr unseren Teil haben zumindest unser neues Lieblings-Hotel gefunden :-)","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were able to walk to most of the restaurants, shops and venues we needed to get to. And if we couldn't, the subway is minutes away. Or you just walk out and there are loads of cabs going by.\nWe appreciated the breakfasts being free and they were delicious, nutritious, fresh and kept us going until dinner time. \nThe room we had was spacious, comfortable and clean. The bathroom was large and we were able to do washing as there is a line for hanging up clothes to dry. Our room looked out over Washington Square park and was light and airy. We had 4 seasons in one day as far as weather went so appreciated the warmth of the room when it was cold and the air con when it was hot.\n\nBut the huge attraction of this hotel is it's staff. It is so personal. We stayed for 7 nights and then had a couple of nights in DC. When we came back for another 5 nights we felt like we were returning to family or friends.\nThank you so much to Charles who was incredibly helpful when I was at the booking stage. Assan was super welcoming when we arrived in the small hours of the morning. Curtis was a sweetie and Nate was so helpful with a great sense of humour. Assata did an awesome job keeping our room lovely and clean and we loved our brief chats we had with her. And lastly, Ronnie. This man is such an asset to the hotel. He gave us so many tips and directions on where we needed to go.

After getting off of an 8 hour, international flight, we came to the hotel. It was too early to check in, but in my experience, it's sometimes possible to check-in a bit early. Since it was nearly 3:00, I asked the front desk and the gentleman met me with such disbelief that you would have thought I asked to kill his cat. We left and came back after 4 and asked to check in and was met with \"I'll see if the room is ready\". \n\nThe next morning we were awoken to the smell of gas (propane?). The window was open, so we closed it and left for the day. The same thing happened that evening, so we closed the window and went out for dinner. When we came back, the smell had dissipated, so we just decided to keep the window closed for the rest of the visit... another 3 days.\n\nUnfortunately, the vent in the bathroom wasn't able to adequately vent the shower, which was apparently also drawing from the source of the smell. This was compounded by the cleaning staff opening the window (I am sure to air it out because of the shower). By the time we got back to the room, after spending 5 minutes in the room, we both had a headache and went down to let the front desk know. \n\nI spent nearly a decade in the hospitality industry, including the Ritz and Amangani, and if I had ever responded to a guest the way I was spoken to, I would have been looking for a new job. When I informed the front desk that the room smelled like gas and I suspected it was seeping in from the \"courtyard\", he rudely asked me what kind of gas. After bickering with me for a few minutes, the other gentleman indicated that they would go check it out. When we got back to the hotel after getting a bite to eat, they indicated that they had brought in the ozonator and aired out the by opening the window. I was then told that was all they could do because the hotel was at capacity. No apology or compassion of any kind. We quickly ran up to the room and shut the window to avoid the smell and kept the light off when we took a shower to avoid activating the fan. \n\nThis hotel was recommended to me by frequent visitors who have always found the hotel accommodating and charming and who were extremely disappointed when I told them what happened. Honestly, for nearly $300, the stay was absolutely appalling.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When spending a week in New York, it\u2019s important that your hotel is the place you\u2019re comfortable coming back to and feel relaxed in and for us Washington Square Hotel wasn\u2019t that place. \n\nWhen we arrived from the airport, our rooms weren\u2019t ready as we were ahead of check in so needed to wander for 2.5 hours until they were meant to be ready. Arriving back at 3.30pm and our rooms were still being inspected so had to wait again. The person on reception said he was arranging two spectacular rooms for us on the same floor so we hoped it would be worth the wait. Eventually we got into our rooms. \n\nOne has a bright window over the street with the park off to the left but was very small despite being described as a Deluxe Queen Room. It was clean but wardrobe was small and there was nowhere to store our suitcases. Bed looked like a double not a queen. \n\nThe other was even smaller with two small side windows which looked onto other hotel room windows or if looked to the left you could just see the corner of the park. The room was pretty dark as a result. The wardrobe was tiny with 2 coat hangers only so very limited storage space.  Not quite what I call a deluxe queen room with a park view. \n\nOverall it turned out to be somewhat basic for the high price being charged and lacking the amenities we were expecting. The staff were friendly. I can understand it is well located for NYU so good for parent visiting their children but not what we were expecting on our week visit from the UK.

The room itself was a bit older and could use some updates. \n\nThe hardwood floor was lovely but also it was uneven. You could feel it walking in and a dropped pen rolled across the room. Not a huge major problem, but it was a bit harsh and disconcerting at first. The bigger issue that I had was that there didn't seem to be much sound insulation, both regular sounds and impact noise reverberated through the room. Sounded like the people above us were doing aerobics in high heels! You can also hear discussions in the hallway and out on the street (we were on the 2nd floor so maybe it's better further up). Just like living in NYC!\n\nWe adjusted the thermostat lower and lower but it was still pretty hot in the room. I don't know if the thermostat was broken or if the surrounding rooms had the heat cranked up and therefore also affected us. Of minor note, the grout in the bathroom seemed pretty dirty and in need of a deep clean, but I'm sure they mop in between guests so that's mostly just an aesthetic. Still, for the money, I expected it to be kept up a little better.\n\nThe linens were nice, fresh, clean. The soaps\/cleansers were good quality. The staff were very nice.

Its not very often that you get a double sink and a view of Washington Square Park at such a value.   The beds were very comfy and we had no problem falling asleep each night.  No noise from the street below.   Our room was actually right next to the elevator, and never had a problem with noise.  \nEvery single staff member we came into contact with was extremely nice.  Check In and out was quick and dropping our bags off was easy.   We were always greeted by at least 3 employees whenever we walked in or out.  \nBreakfast is included and they have an express breakfast on the lobby level, or a sit down meal was in the attached restaurant.  If you decided on the sit down option, there are two sides of the menu.  The free breakfast was cereal, toast, bagels, fruit, yogurt, and juices. I was very surprised to see they have gluten free toast and muffins available. If you wanted a warm meal, they did charge more for this, but the prices were reasonable.  Honestly, we like to grab a quick breakfast before heading out and walking all morning.  That saves room for all the good food in the city.  \nOur last day in the city was a messy one with Winter Storm Maya making its way across the East Coast.  Most of the flights out of the area were either delayed or canceled.  Luckily we found out early our flight was canceled until the next day and the hotel had a room available for us.  The staff helped us feel better about not getting home on time and worrying about what to do in the situation.  Even though the second room was smaller, we still had a great room and time.  The only complaint in the small room is the shower curtain, why have fabric shower curtains, the floor was soaked in minutes.    So don't put anything on the floor of the bathroom you don't want to get wet.  \nThe location was amazing with two subway stations within minutes of the hotel.  Restaurants and nightlife are within a block or two with the Comedy Cellar just 3 blocks away.  Easy walk to East Village bars, SOHO shopping, and West Village restaurants.

The bathroom was nice (again, small), and the shower was probably the best shower I've ever experienced ... it took a while to figure out, but it was totally worth the time.

Washington Square Hotel is a perfect location to explore The Village. I had been traveling for more than 14 hr on an international flight and called the hotel from baggage claim to ask if they have early check in.  To my delight, they said my room was ready!  I really appreciated that.\n\nLocation: A few steps away from Washington Square Park and NYU. I walked all over - to restaurants, food stores, bakeries and even to Chelsea and Chinatown. The hotel is also close to a subway station.  \nRoom: My room had 2 twin beds on the 7th floor. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable.  The bathroom was well=appointed.  The hotel provided robes and slippers.  There was an ironing board and hair dryer. The only thing I would have liked is a small fridge because I like to drink milk before bedtime so a fridge would have been nice to store milk, or other goodies available from the great bakeries nearby. Because this is an old hotel, sometimes I can hear the plumbing and some voices but the sounds are not really startling and I drifted back to sleep with no problem.\n\nReception desk\/sfatt: Very easy check in and check out.  The staff is very helpful, pleasant and accommodating.  They made my stay worry-free and relaxing.  Requests are handled promptly and cheerfully.  One of the staff even waited for my taxi with me and made sure it was the taxi I called (via Curb app).  The staff gave the hotel an easy feel and really made me want to go back.\n\nExtras: An ample continental breakfast was provided with granola, Chobani yogurt, fruit cups, bananas and an assortment of bread and pastries, plus of course coffee or tea.\n\nI gave this hotel an Excellent rating even though there were some things I would have liked to have (like the room fridge) because of the overall experience I had.  It contributed to a very memorable long weekend in Greenwich Village.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Our flight was delayed coming in but we arrived at the hotel in time to get to our room, freshen up, change our clothes and take the short walk to the event.  It was pretty cold so we were glad to get inside to check-in.  I gave our name to the desk receptionist and he immediately told us that unfortunately the room being held for us had a plumping problem.  I thought he was going to tell us they were working on it or that he was going to upgrade us to another type room.  But no!!!  He told us he had booked us a room at the Chelsea Holiday Inn and would pay for a cab to get us there.  He handed me $10 and had me sign a voucher for it and that was it--not even goodbye!\nIt took almost 10 minutes for the doorman to hail an empty cab as we stood on the sidewalk in the freezing cold with our bags.  We were literally dazed and confused as to what was happening and worried we weren't going to make the event on time.\nDid I mention it was a Saturday night and the night of SantaCon???????\nIt took more than 20 minutes to crawl the 11\/2 miles to the Holiday Inn and cost $15+tip.  \nThe Holiday Inn is pretty shabby yet they charged us close to the same rate as the Washington Square Hotel and they aren't within walking distance to the venue we needed to get to.  This is not a hotel we would have chosen to stay in and couldn't believe the Washington Square Hotel thought this was the right thing to do to a guest.\nWe then had to Uber through SantaCon crowds and Saturday night traffic again to head back to the venue which was less than a block from the Washington Square Hotel, where we had started!  We were late.\nWhen we got back from the trip I called the WSH to get the manager's email and was given contact info for Sonny.  I emailed Sonny Dec. 10th and got back a quick response.  He apologized, told me he was traveling and would get back to me in two days.  I thanked him.  That was the last I heard from Sonny even though I reached out to him 2 more times.\nSo not only were we treated badly and uncaringly by the desk staff, but also by management who had promised to address our poor treatment.  \nThe point of this review is that if they would to this to us they would do this to another customer and apparently not care one bit.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Very central and close to a subway. \nThe hotel itself is lovely and well presented. The gentlemen on the doors were very very welcoming.\nCheck in was easy, but the young lady who checked us in did not look happy. She didn't smile or make us feel welcome.\nOur room was on the 2nd floor. It was OK in size, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was also clean and stocked with all essentials. \nThe downside, the only window looked out to a brick wall which meant the room was in complete darkness 24 hrs a day. It may not seem like a big deal, but as an international traveler staying for a full week, it makes you very disorientated as you can never tell what time of day it is and your body clock is confused. \nOverall, a great hotel in a great location if your only staying 2-3 nights. But, purely because there is a chance of getting a lower ground room with a brick wall as a view....I would not stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The reviews were an accurate reflection of the accommodation and I was pleasantly surprised and overall happy.\n\nThe hotel is conveniently positioned in a nice neighbourhood close to a subway stop just one block away (2-3min walk). Local amenities are in close proximity to pick up the odd essentials. The Washington Square Park is an attractive and cultural\/diverse place, and also has nice views of the World Trade Centre.\n\nThe rooms were clean and presentable. The interior is a little dated in appearance though has aged well giving off some character. The beds are comfy and there is very hot water on demand. The bedroom we stayed in overlooking the rear courtyard is quiet (with no view), which at first we thought was unusual being situated in such a busy city. The rooms were a good size, just big enough to lay out two cases. The passesnger lifts (elevators) were quick, which is refreshing when contending with a pram\/stroller each day. \n\nContinental breakfast served from 7:15 is good, particularly the bagels together with a side of cheddar cheese. Simple but effective morning calories with a side of orange juice. The restaurant staff are fairly robotic but occasionally crack the odd smile. Staff were helpful in providing a high chair each morning (we stayed six days) and bananas to leave with for a snack for our 11 month old. \n\nReception staff were generally helpful and friendly, even when I called in advance flying to check our booking information. One down side, the manager found it offensive to display our 'birthday banner' in the restaurant during our breakfast for my 30th, which was a kill joy. \n\nGood money to value and would recommend.

During past trips to New York we have stayed near Times Square, but we decided to get away from the huge crowds in that area this time.  We were so happy with this hotel's location in the Greenwich Village area.  Washington Square park is just across the street.  A subway station is just around the corner, so you can get anywhere in the city quickly.  There are many nice cafes and small restaurants in the area within walking distance if you don't feel like taking the subway.  Everywhere in New York is busy, but this area is easier to get around in without the crush of people in the high tourist areas.\n   We stayed in the penthouse king, room 912.  Even though this is the most expensive room in the hotel it is very large so you get much more for your money than in many of the uptown hotels.  The rooms we have stayed in on past trips were similar in price, but much smaller.  I'm sure the other rooms here are a better value, too.  Our room was nicely decorated with a sitting area.  The air conditioning was good.  There was a coffee maker in the room.  The king bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was very large with double sinks and a huge walk-in shower.  The shower had good pressure and plenty of hot water.  Both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean.  The added bonus of this room being on the ninth floor was an unobstructed view of the Empire State building...especially beautiful at night.  \n   We booked directly with the hotel.  A continental breakfast was included consisting of orange juice, coffee, yogurt, and pastries...enough to get you going in the morning.  There is also a restaurant on sight.\n   Check in went smoothly and the front desk stored our baggage until our room was available.  The staff is very helpful and available at all times.

The rooms are newly renovated and comfortable with good A\/C and a large bathroom with good lighting. We were on the 8th floor and at the rear of the hotel and it was very quiet. The down side from the room restorations was that the mattresses on the beds were not replaced and in need of retirement. Consequently sleep quality was poor. We had 2 singles and the side that you enter the bed on was low and you could feel the tendency to roll to that side when sleeping. Secondly, I cannot comprehend how you can completely renovate a bathroom and reinstall the old make up mirror that is rusted from top to bottom on one side? The continental breakfast, we had read about and knew it was not elaborate was a disappointment. One morning we overheard an older gentleman complain about the toaster that was broken and in need of replacement to be told, and I quote \" the owner did not want to replace it\". Every customer, including myself had to try to use the bread tongues or a metal fork to poke down inside the toaster to retrieve your toast and it was almost impossible never mind the safety issues coming into play! The location is excellent, very safe and is surrounded by NYU campuses and a good central hotel for sight seeing. The employees were not overly friendly except for housekeeping. Not a great experience but not a bad one either! Just replace the toaster, improve the continental breakfast and replace the mattresses and smile more and you have a great hotel.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

C'est sur base de la note \u00e9lev\u00e9e de 4\/5 sur tripadvisor et de 8,6\/10 sur booking que j'ai r\u00e9serv\u00e9 une chambre.\n\nHormis la fa\u00e7ade en r\u00e9novation, ce qui est monnaie courante \u00e0 NY, la premi\u00e8re impression fut bonne. Le r\u00e9ceptionniste \u00e9tait agr\u00e9able, le hall d'entr\u00e9e conforme aux photos sur internet. Vint ensuite la d\u00e9sillusion : la chambre d'h\u00f4tel. Bien que de taille correcte, avec une salle de bain tout autant convenable, s\u00e9journer dans cette chambre nuit apr\u00e8s nuit fut une \u00e9preuve \u00e0 elle seule. Le premier b\u00e9mol vient du tapis appos\u00e9 au sol. Il est vieux, d\u00e9gage une odeur extr\u00eamement naus\u00e9abonde, et n'est de toute \u00e9vidence jamais nettoy\u00e9 comme en t\u00e9moignait un morceau de c\u00e9r\u00e9ale sur le sol pr\u00e9sent de notre arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 notre jour de d\u00e9part.\n\nLe deuxi\u00e8me probl\u00e8me vient de l a\u00e9ration, qui \u00e9tait tellement mauvaise que le lit tout comme nos affaires \u00e9taient moites. En t\u00e9moignent des feuilles de papiers tellement humides qu'elles ont fil\u00e9 \u00e0 la poubelle. On fait mieux pour dormir dans de bonnes conditions. Nous avons \u00e9galement d\u00fb faire face \u00e0 un bruit constant, comme celui d'un frigo allum\u00e9. Peut \u00eatre est-ce le cas dans tous les h\u00f4tels \u00e0 NY, mais je n'ai pas pour habitude de devoir mettre des bouchons d'oreille quand je s\u00e9journe \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel.\n\nVient ensuite le probl\u00e8me de propret\u00e9 globale de la chambre et de la salle de bain. Outre le tapis jamais aspir\u00e9, la salle de bain n'a pas eu droit \u00e0 un meilleur traitement et \u00e9tait tout aussi sale, comme les cheveux que nous avons d\u00fb nous m\u00eame ramasser faute de nettoyage. Je ne consid\u00e8re pas les femmes de m\u00e9nage comme des bonniches, mais il me semble tout de m\u00eame normal de passer un petit coup de serpilli\u00e8re dans les chambres dont vous avez la responsabilit\u00e9. \n\nAutre probl\u00e8me : la propret\u00e9 des essuies et des draps. T\u00e2ch\u00e9s, et au look pas frais, ils ne vous donnaient pas l'envie de vous essuyer ou de dormir. L exp\u00e9rience m'apprendra \u00e0 ne plus jamais aller \u00e0 l'h\u00f4tel sans mes essuies, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de pouvoir prendre mes draps \u00e9galement. \n\nDerni\u00e8re d\u00e9ception : le petit d\u00e9jeuner. L'offre est extr\u00eamement limit\u00e9e, encore plus si vous y aller trop tard, les produits n'\u00e9tant pas renouvel\u00e9s. Ainsi, \u00e0 10h, vous n'aurez par exemple plus de croissant - seule ga\u00eet\u00e9 du d\u00e9jeuner - ni de banane.\n\nJe terminerai ce commentaire par le positif; la localisation de l hotel ainsi que le personnel. L'h\u00f4tel est tr\u00e8s central, situ\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de deux stations de m\u00e9tro qui permettent de faire quasi tout NY. Un chouette parc est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 et les environs plus calmes permettent de se reposer un peu du centre bouillonnant de times square. Quant au personnel de la r\u00e9ception, nous n'avons rien \u00e0 redire. Tous \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s serviables et gentils, sp\u00e9cialement Ronnie, toujours souriant et disponible. \n\nEn conclusion, je ne mettrais qu une note de 5\/10, pour un h\u00f4tel qui m\u00e9riterait une r\u00e9novation totale de ses chambres.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

One or two nice extra touches like slippers, umbrella if needed. As with the coffee making items the (quality local) toiletries were excellent and always replaced and well stocked each day. Really good room service each day though the wooden (effect?) floor could have done with a better clean now and then. Shower\/bath good.  Impressed with the air-con system too when needed. Assume it was one the new systems which are gradually being installed but worked really well. Self-serve breakfast was fine near the lobby. Decent enough choice but if you maybe want a more leisurely breakfast time wise the other option in the downstairs restaurant was nicer.

It is great for visiting NYU as it is walking distance to dorms and many NYU buildings. Close to many subway stations. Greenwich Village is a great area.\n2. Friendly doorman.\n3. Good response to the issues we had while staying there. Broken hair dryer was replaced right away and an in room hot water issue was fixed but not before I had a cold shower! An adjustment was needed in our room after a hotel wide hot water shut off. \n\nCONS:\n1. EXTREMELY small room - maybe 2 feet on either side of a double bed and 3 ft from foot of the bed to the wall. Room and bathroom were dark and old. One tiny window that faced an outside wall in the room and one frosted window in the bathroom. Tiny TV.\n2. Very limited seating in the lobby. This was a huge problem as we took the red eye from the west coast and arrived in the morning but our reserved room was not going to be ready until check in time. It would\u2019ve been just fine to wait, but there was nowhere to sit. \n3. 8:30 am hammering, drilling, and loud talking in the room next door. It was a full blown construction zone. We checked out of WSH this day and in to another hotel that night.\n\nSadly, I will not stay here again. Prices here are outrageous for what you get.

Continental breakfast at the hotel restaurant was great because you have the option to order other things on the menu or simply get the continental which was completely free. The location is the best because it's not in the hustle and bustle of midtown. With NYU close, lots of students and so many great things to see.

Room was small which was to be expected , however the bed was terrible. Rock solid. I\u2019ve stayed at hotels all over the country and world and this was the absolute worst. Layout of the room was not thought out, bed rock hard, bathroom was stuck in a time warp and gave a creepy feel almost like you were in a prison or hospital? Very strange. Needs renovation .

I should\u2019ve taken pictures because the real room looked NOTHING even close to what they advertised .

If you want a Village or Park view then choose the Deluxe room or better....in my opinion not necessary as it is easy to walk outside and enjoy Washington Square.\n\nThe express breakfast was self service with coffee\/tea, orange juice, yoghurt, granola, toast, muffins, croissants and fruit available to select eat in or take away. It was included in the room price and ideal for starting the day.\n\nThe hotel is perfectly located for enjoying Washington Square and Greenwich Village with a subway station just around the corner. On previous visits I have stayed in hotels North of Central Park and around Times Square....this is the best located thus far as it is within the Greenwich Village area and close to NYU and with a large number of delis, coffee shops, restaurants and bars within easy walking distance. \n\nI throughly enjoyed my stay here and would recommend the hotel for tourists and those travelling on business. When I return to NYC there will be no need for me to look around for a hotel as I will again be booking the Washington Square Hotel!","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

In the middle of Greenwich Village on Washington Square Park. The decor is beautiful throughout the hotel. All arranged by the current owner's family. The uniquely decorated tiled walls with such beautiful pictures. Each room has large black & white pictures of the stars of the 30's\/40's\/50's. Every member of staff were really helpful & friendly. They could not do enough for Philippa & I. Our room, 220 1st floor was more than large enough, very clean & comfortable. The house keeping staff made sure it stayed that way during our 5 night stay (Thank you). Continental breakfast was perfect for us (cooked breakfast was also available at cost if needed). A variety of cereals, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, yoghurt, muffins & cheeses, fresh juice, tea's & coffee. Either in the North Square restaurant or  a smaller self service dining area. We ate Sunday Jazz Brunch in the NSR. It was perfect. The band were brilliant. The restaurant has a huge vase of freshly cut flowers to enjoy each day. The WSH is ideally located for the best jazz clubs & some very good restaurants. We visited the Blue Note & The Village Vanguard Clubs. Only minutes walk away. By the way only a few years ago, a young waitress who served Sunday Brunch in the North Square Restaurant, offered a CD of her music to the management, they liked it and offered her a gig or two on Sundays.... It was Nora Jones... Well done WSH. Whilst in the area you must visit McSorley's Old Ale House. Have a Liverwurst, onion & mustard sandwich, with light or\/& dark ale. Also Arts & Crafts Beer Parlour & have a hot pretzel with beer cheese dip (you wont get it anywhere else).We ate in other local restaurants, Malay food so authentic & delicious, The  Rasa. Oh & The Meatball Shop is a must too. We walked the length of Central Park in the snow one day & took the metro upto Harlem & walked the length of 5th Avenue back down to Washington Square. We also took the metro to Brooklyn Bridge City Hall & walked over Brooklyn Bridge & had lunch in Brooklyn Heights. From the WSH the metro stations are just a short walk away.

It has become our \"go to\" NYC  hotel. The staff is wonderful--polite and helpful--and the accommodations are comfortable.  The hotel is family owned and operated, and it feels that way.  Small and cozy, with touches that make a difference.  On the last visit (Jan. 25-29, 2018), there were hot apple cider and fresh baked chocolate chips cookies in the lobby lounge in the afternoon--just what was needed after trudging around on a cold January day. We stayed at the WSH during Christmas week (2016), and had a wonderful experience, too. Breakfast at North Square Restaurant or in the lobby lounge is included and substantial. In addition, ala carte items on the breakfast menu are very reasonably priced.  Restaurant staff is wonderful, too. The North Square lounge is a cozy little gem--with a great wine selection and a fantastic happy hour with unbeatable prices on substantial appetizers and drinks.  During our last stay we had a double room on of the interior the building--which was very quiet, with a comfortable bed and nice strong shower.  Bigelow toiletries, plush robes and slippers, and a Keurig coffee maker are provided, too. We have stayed on the ground floor, facing the street--in June (2017) and had zero problems with street noise.  Location cannot be beat.  Right on beautiful Washington Square in the heart of NYU\/Greenwich Village--conveniently located near a bunch of train lines.

This was our second stay at WSH, and we can't imagine booking anywhere else.  The soulless tourists who desire cookie cutter, chain hotel charm can have Times Square, I won't go anywhere near it.  Staying at the Washington Square Hotel is like having your own small flat in the middle of the charming neighborhood that is Greenwich Village. Historic Washington Square Park is across the street and it's so quiet at night, you'd think you were in the country.   Moreover, a subway station one block away will carry you anywhere in the city.

Certo non \u00e8 economico ma d'altronde \u00e8 in una delle zone pi\u00f9 pregiate di Manhattan. Inoltre, aspetto da non sottovalutare, la colazione \u00e8 inclusa (o almeno lo era nella nostra stanza) e sono almeno 20 dollari a testa al giorno risparmiati. Non aspettatevi la colazione \"all'europea\", non ci sono prodotti freschi, per\u00f2 \u00e8 abbondante e varia (pane, cereali, yogurt, frutta, bagel, marmellate, ecc.) e si pu\u00f2 scegliere se farla \"self service\" al bar o serviti nella sala ristorante. Personale cortese. Insomma se dovessi tornare a New York non avrei dubbi e lo sceglierei di nuovo.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is located between 5th and 6th Avenue on Waverly Place in Lower Manhattan.  It is also close to the NYU campus and there appeared to be parents of staying here. The Washington Square Hotel has been home to writers, artists and visitors to Greenwich Village for more than a century. It was even home to Bob Dylan and Joan Baez back in the day (for a short time). \n\nI stayed here with my wife for 2 nights in mid-August and generally thought the hotel was nice and I loved its great location. Our room was small and came with an undersized queen sized bed. While every room was non-smoking I thought our room had a strange smell (kind of a wet towel like smell). The bathroom was not very modern and could have used a facelift (in addition it was small). The cost of the room was about $295 night plus about $45 in taxes. The hotel staff was very friendly and efficient and the doorman was really friendly.  They even let us check in early which was greatly appreciated since we arrived after an early morning flight.\n\nOverall I thought the Washington Square Hotel was nice and I recommend it. I enjoyed staying in this neighborhood versus a less interesting neighborhood in mid-town. To make it even better the continental breakfast was pretty good and was included in the price of the room.  The best part of this hotel was the location since the room was nothing special. The art deco lobby was interesting and helps give this hotel a cooler vibe.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon arrival we were told that the room would not be available before 3:00 pm, which is totally understandable - that's check-in time. I tried to distract my 5-month old baby until then. I called at 3:00 pm, and I was told it would be ready in 10 minutes, so I gave them 20 to be on the safe side, and arrived with my exhausted baby ready to go to our room, only to find that it wouldn't be ready until nearly 4 pm. Then I saw the crib. I had been assured days before booking that they had a good crib that they could place in the room. The attached photo doesn't show how terrible it was - tiny, with a mattress that wasn't really a mattress, hard as a rock, and with the \"protection\" all broken, so it was just a hazard to place a baby there. \nTo finish up the stay, I had to get off work and go back to the hotel because they didn't pay attention when I asked them to swipe the credit card I was giving them upon check-in. They said they only had the one used when booking, the person at the front desk hadn't registered the new card. \nExcept for only one guy, the ladies at the Reception desk were always in a hurry and not at all nice.

We felt safe walking the neighborhood at all hours, and the lovely Washington Square Park is only steps from the hotel entrance. Furthermore, the hotel restaurant is exceptional, at least for dinner.\n\nOur room (710) was small, clean, has a nice size bathroom and a well designed shower tub...meaning the shower head worked well, the tub drains promptly, there were plenty of places to put stuff. The windows in bath and main room open easily, but not far, and there is a small desk. Two caveats: 1) The room consistently had a slight, but distinct, musty odor which was minimized, but not eliminated, by leaving the windows open while we were gone. 2) while the mattress was comfortable, with 6 pillows to choose from, it is protected from bodily fluids, or spilled wine, by one of those waterproof mattress covers that caused us to sweat in bed (while sleeping) nearly every night.\n\nThe breakfast area is small, often requiring either a wait for a seat, or the use of the restaurant where essentially the same breakfast is available, but from a waiter, which is nice except when in a hurry. The included breakfast offers nothing hot, but there are bananas,  fruit cup, bagels, small muffins, yogurt, and an excellent granola. Tea, coffee, orange juice, cold water to drink.\n\nWe would stay there again. Did I say the location is great!?","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

But they deserve the publicity and the compliments.  This historic hotel was quaint but updated, super clean, superb location steps away from subway, Starbucks, drugstores and markets.  Perhaps the greatest part of the experience was the staff.  This is their neighborhood and their property and they are proud of it.  They treat everyone like old friends.  They go out of their way to provide you with whatever you need, recommend local amenities, and just generally make you feel like they are taking good care of you.  You are immediately greeted by the most charming gentleman I have ever met (Hi Ronnie!)  I've stayed in many parts of Manhattan, but I will now continue to return to the Washington Square Hotel.  \n\nAs a reference, I reserved the double twin room for my daughter and myself.  The room is small but not claustrophobic and very well laid out.  The beds are literally side by side so could serve as a king if desired but was perfect for our needs.  The beds were quite firm, which we normally stay away from, but I'm telling you we slept like logs. Bathroom was small but again very functional, including a tub and a window, which is rare and refreshing.  No mini fridge or microwave but I don't know if larger rooms are equipped with these.  We just visited the local market and the ice machine and we were fine.  Did have iron, small ironing board, keurig, hair dryer, robes, nice tv.  No safe in room, but I'm sure desk would hold items if you desired it.  Very quiet rooms, didn't hear neighbors at all.  We had a 6th floor room and I recommend higher levels for better views, but even lower rooms wouldn't be bothered by street noise because this is a nice quiet neighborhood.  Nice restaurant downstairs which I didn't try so can't comment on, but nice option.  Cab ride to JFK was about an hour.  Sorry I didn't take photos to share, but trust the hotel site photos...they are accurate!  Also, I thought this property was a great value $$\n\nI can't say enough.

For the purpose, its location could not be better, as it is at one corner of Washington Square Park.  My wife had to be at an early session of a conference, and the hotel was very accommodating; there was a room available(414), and they allowed me in at about 9:30 a.m., at no extra charge.  It had no view to speak of; I expect that the rooms with views had been occupied, and thus were not available yet. Not a problem.  The room is small, but not extraordinarily so at this price point.  Everything worked, there is a small closet and a bathroom. Furnishings have an art deco vibe. It was an extremely cold day, and I watched TV for a while, until it was time for me to leave. \n\nThere is a passage from the hotel lobby to the hotel's restaurant, which was very convenient on a frigid evening.  Dinner there was excellent (reviewed separately.)\n\nNext morning, we had breakfast in the small cafe area off the lobby, where the offerings included bagels, small croissants, bread, small muffins, fresh fruit cup, jellies, Nutella, coffee, juice, etc.  If you wish to go beyond the free continental breakfast, a full breakfast menu is available in the restaurant (in addition to the continental breakfast buffet).\n\nThe staff was quite friendly and helpful in all respects.

We had reserved a room with two double beds in the hopes we would have a little more room.  No complaint there.   However, the first room we were put in had a wall that was adjacent to the elevator shaft.  The noise from elevator going up and down bothered us all night and the hotel was able to put us in another room far from an elevator the next day.  It was much better even though we could some street noise, but that did not bother us.  Management was kind enough to send a complimentary bottle of wine to the room as one of the days was my wife\u2019s birthday.\n\nWe had taken a taxi to the hotel from the airport so I cannot say much about where to park if you are driving.  You have your typical NYC street parking and I did notice a parking ramp around the corner about a block away.   A subway station is also located about a block from the hotel.   We did stay in on a rainy night and ate at the restaurant in the hotel.  We did not have anything fancy, but what we had was good.   My wife did use the workout facility a couple of times and found that it was equipped with what she likes to use.    The room price included a breakfast buffet which we really did not take advantage of, so I cannot comment on that.   When departing, the hotel made arrangements for a limo service to pick us up to return to the airport.\n\nThere are all kinds of restaurants and shops in the area, so if you like to get out and walk, things are close by.\n\nFor an older hotel, the place is in pretty good shape with the remodeling that has been done over the years.  We enjoyed our stay and would return again.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The subway was a block away, and super easy to get to Times Square using the subway. I got an excellent price because I paid in advance at the time of booking.

For this jaunt, we wanted to stay away from chain hotels and opt for a more local feel.  The Washington Square Hotel was the perfect option.  If you're looking for a cookie cutter chain hotel experience, the WSH hotel may not suit you.  The historic property is 100+ years old and is somewhat dated.  However, if you're seeking a property with CHARACTER, HISTORY, and CHARM, you're in for a treat.  Due to massive gentrification, NYC is quickly losing the character that has made it such a fascinating city.  The WSH is one of the last family owned hotels in the city.  It was delightful staying in a hotel with so much character and history.  Joan Baez and Bob Dylan are rumored to have lodged in Room 305 in the 1960's when the property was a flophouse (see Baez's song \"Diamonds and Rust\" written partially about their time in the hotel).  Fortunately, the current proprietors have renovated the property.  While the paint and carpet are still dated in some rooms, the property is kept EXTREMELY CLEAN considering the age of the building.  The quiet stillness at night would make you forget you're in NYC.  Yes, the hallways are narrow, but this is characteristic of most hotels in NYC.  It always amuses me when tourists complain about the small size of NYC hotel rooms.  You're in one of the largest cities in the world, small spaces are expected.  In fact, the rooms at the Washington Square Hotel are rather large by NYC standards.  It was wonderful to GET AWAY from the bland madness of Times Square Tourism and Mid Town Chaos with a retreat to the WSH in tranquil Greenwich Village.  Oh, if those walls could speak, the stories they could tell.  For the first 3 days, we stayed in room 810 with a view of the park.  Deciding to extend our stay another 4 days, we were assigned room 310, which only had an interior view, but was just fine.  We asked for one of the new renovated restrooms, but the staff were unable to accommodate that request.  All in all, we had an excellent stay.  The room included a safe and coffee maker, and housekeeping did a great job daily.  I'm a NYC history fanatic, and I sadly lament that the city is losing so much of its history and character to gentrification.  I would rather spend my tourist dollars supporting independently owned properties like the Washington Square Hotel to ensure that class and character continue to exist.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Do note that December hotel prices in NYC are sky-high (as they are in the summer, too) because of holiday events, so it's best to look away from midtown. Since I used to live in the West Village, I recalled the Washington Square Hotel and decided to book there. Their rates -- about $275 a night, including tax -- are very reasonable for NYC, and especially good at this time of year. \n\nPros:\n\n** Great location steps away from Washington Square Park. Subways (including different lines) are within a 5 minute walk; plenty of restaurants and shopping etc.\n\n** The room was very small (like a European hotel) but clean, well maintained and had everything you'd need in it for a short stay (it would get very cramped in there for a longer stay). The bathroom is also quite small but also very clean and nice. \n\n** My room, on the 9th floor, had a direct view of the Empire State Building --- beautiful!\n\n** A quick walk from one of the best bookstores in the world -- The Strand! (12th St. and Broadway). \n\nCons:\n\n** The front desk staff is not welcoming at all. Both the woman who checked me in (she wasn't rude, just unfriendly), and the man who checked me out (who was borderline rude) were totally disinterested in me (their \"guest\"). At check in I was asked for my license and credit card, and also if I wanted one key or two -- that's it. No \"have a good stay\" or anything else. It was brisk (I'm all in favor of moving things along, but maybe with a smile or two, too) and unfriendly. Check out (very early morning) was downright frosty -- no \"how was your stay?\" \"have a good day\" or anything at all. In fact, I had to ask for a printed copy of my invoice and the man at the desk seemed put out. He also did not thank me for staying with them (and paying for it) etc.\n\n** The small rooms could be a problem for a couple, and are not conducive to a family or a long stay. I actually liked the room just fine for a night (and it would probably be fine for 2 or 3 nights, too).\n\n** This is an old building, and the hallways are narrow and rather claustrophobic. The hotel has tried to open this claustrophobic feeling up by painting the hallways in a lighter color, and also making sure the room doors are pleasant looking.\n\n** The elevator is so small that it feels like a tomb. They do, however, have stairs that are easily accessible (and wider and well lit).\n\nI would have given this hotel 3.5 stars if it was possible to do so. I couldn't round up to 4 because of the unfriendliness of the front desk, and the lack of actual hospitality.. I did, however,  meet a very nice man from housekeeping in the elevator, and there were two nice staff guys (one in the afternoon and one in the early morning) in the lobby -- perhaps they should be behind the desk greeting travelers instead!\n\nEven though this review isn't a rave, I did like a lot about the hotel -- the location, the room etc., and might give it another try if I ever needed to stay downtown again. \n\nPlease excuse typos.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We booked directly through the hotel a few months in advance.  But when we arrived on Friday shortly after check-in time, we were told that the room we had booked was not available.  The best they could do, the front desk clerk said, was to put us in a much smaller room for the first night, then have us move into a larger room for the second right.This was a first -- in my 30 years of business travel, I have never arrived at a hotel to be told that I'd have to take a smaller room than I'd booked, much less have to move rooms in the middle of my stay. And, by the way they added, the smaller room wasn't ready yet, even though it was past check-in time.  We probably reacted too politely, because they then wasted 3 hours of our weekend keeping us waiting for the tiny room to be ready, while they repeatedly told us, \"The maid is in there, it'll just be another 30 minutes.\"  When I asked for a late check out as compensation, they told us they could extend our check out by only 2 hours.  The rooms were very banal, done in muddy colors with skimpy furnishings. Bottom line: at this room rate, there are dozens of better places to stay in Manhattan.

The location is perfect. Near great bars, restaurants, the park, etc. The staff here is tremendous. I saw a couple reviews where people talked poorly about the staff. I cannot even fathom how that is even possible for anyone to have anything negative to say about these people. \n\nWe were greeted every single time we passed through the lobby. The doorman offered us unsolicited advice on some fun places to go.....which we thought was awesome. We didn't even have to ask:) They gave us a late checkout at no extra charge. The sweet lady who took care of our room made it look so nice and welcoming every time we returned. The maintenance man was so nice and friendly. Honestly, everyone there just exuded warmth and hospitality. But the cherry on top... One of the front desk employees (he had a unique name and I cannot remember it) told us to go to a club called Cafe Wha to hear the band. Not only did we have a blast, but when we returned, he had gone to Insomnia Cookies when he got off work and gotten us a box of cookies and had left them at the front desk for us. Who does that???? Seriously....WOW!\n\nOur room was awesome. This was a girls weekend. We had the 2 doubles room. It was a corner room and for NYC it was huge. There were lots of windows which even opened. The decor was trendy. Super comfy beds and linens. Bath robes. The bathroom was incredible. I kept reading comments about the shower in other people's reviews and all I can say is that now I get it. Loved the tile, the lighting, the double sinks, the windows, the water pressure, etc. There were plenty of mirrors and counter space for 4 women to get ready simultaneously. I did see another 2 double room and it was much smaller, so be sure to request a corner room. The building heat had not been turned on yet and we were freezing. They had another room they could move us to that had an individually controlled thermostat. We checked it out but opted to stay in our larger room. When we returned they had brought a portable heater in and our room was toasty. Every night when we returned, they had come in and turned our heater on for us.\n\nThey do offer a complimentary continental breakfast. It's yogurt, granola, fruit, toast, muffins, coffee, tea, etc. \n\nSo, YES, we will be back to this hotel sometime. \n\n","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Sadly, though, I've deliberately used the past tense here as, whilst the bedrooms & great bathrooms are clean & tidy the corridors and landings remain in a past age (and not a particularly nice past age!) with Artex swirls on the walls and day glow 70's carpets all well past their best. In fact none of the communal areas we saw were particularly inviting.\nBreakfast, on both days we stayed had rather surly staff in attendance whilst you had a DIY breakfast with little or no attempt at presentation - plastic pots of fruit and granola, quartered bagels (that got lost at the bottom of the toaster!) all of which was fresh and tasty even if the surroundings were a little institutional in atmosphere.\nAll-in-all it felt like a hotel which has in the past been lovely but which now is suffering from a lack of investment.

An a-la-carte breakfast can be purchased but we found the inclusive breakfast to be quite sufficient.\n\nThe staff are attentive and friendly and a special thank you must go to Ronnie who provided us daily with a list of local attractions.\n\nThis is not a hotel for guests who prefer the bright lights and party atmosphere of other NYC hotels. For guests who like personal and professional customer service, an intimate and cosy atmosphere, then look no further than the Washington Square Hotel.","travelDate":"2016-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I had been recommended this place by friends, and I love the Village and just generally Lower Manhattan (Lower East side, Chelsea, the Meatpacking district, SoHo, etc.), so I decided to give it a try for what was at the time very reasonable rates. I must say, the hotel's location is amazing, right on the same Washington Square where Bob Dylan used to go for inspiration, and on a very quiet, leafy street (for New York that is!). Staff were very friendly and always helpful, and the free breakfasts, whilst not sophisticated, offer plenty of choice and gives you that extra unexpected value. Rooms are of course small (this is New York after all!), 'in-room entertainment' is provided by an old TV, and the style of the property, whilst recently refurbished, is still slightly quaint and bordering on the kitsch. Make no mistake, this is not a 5-star hotel, or a 4-star at that, but it does deliver a great experience as an extremely good 3-star hotel, in the cut-throat competitiveness of NYC, and for that it should be commended!!","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our room on the 7th floor was a good size for NYC and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was the standard continental with fruit, yogurt and pastries.  I was trying to book a car service to take us to NewarK Airport but was having trouble doing so on my phone so I called the front desk (at 1 am) and I so glad I did.

The hotel is best described as old, rundown and with narrow staircases and maze like hallways.  The rooms are small and with outdated furniture, and a small tv that hangs near the ceiling.  Good customer service eludes the front desk staff, they were consistently rude at check in and check out.  I was charged a rate different than the room rate I reserved under, so definitely check your bill.  I checked out at 5:30 a.m. before going to the airport and when checking my bill, noticed that they charged me for the night that I was checked out for.  When I pointed that out, the front desk person indicated that technically I should be charged since it was the morning of that day\/date!  Puzzled, I explained that since I am checking out at 5:00  a.m. and they will rent the room still that day, that I shouldn't be charged.  He then indicated that he doesn't know how to fix the computer or to adjust the charges.  Worried about missing my plane, I left and told him to work it out and I will call to double check.  I called an hour later and was told that he was able to adjust the charges.  The only thing that is good about the hotel is the location across from the part and near the subway, otherwise it is very expensive at $300.00 a night (and more).

It's a small boutique, extra friendly establishment and a refreshing change from the chain hotels where I've stayed on previous visits to NYC. Reasonably priced. The staff are great.  Special shout out to Ronnie, the concierge who's a real asset and can help you with anything at all, even giving my daughter and niece a free baseball cap to shield them from the sun. We stayed in a double double for 4 people. Yes the room isn't massively big but, you're only sleeping there and the beds were very comfortable with enough storage space for 4 women and all the baggage that came with us!. The bathroom was the biggest I've seen in a NY hotel with constant hot water and a really powerful shower. Air conditioning was a godsend because it was very hot last week. \nWe stayed on the first floor facing the street but, because it's a quiet area, we weren't really bothered by noise. The odd siren but, hey, it's New York! Continental breakfast, included in the price was more than enough in the morning with delicious pastries and fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereal etc. \nThe location is great - right across from the park and close to a subway for uptown and downtown. Greenwich Village is one of my favourite areas of the city but the biz of midtown is a subway ride away if you want it. I'll definitely be staying again on my next trip.  Only slight negative for me was no de-caff coffee in the room and that taxes aren't included in the price upfront but that's not enough to put me off - and I'm very fussy about hotels. \nI've found in some of the bigger hotels that the staff just don't have the time to be attentive so I think the fact that this is a smaller hotel allows them to give great service.\nHope to see you again soon","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I just thought of Melville who has associations with the area and his character, Bartleby.  But if I were on vacation I would want to look out on either of the streets.  I liked my room and was quite comfortable.  I loved the lobby which has beautiful tile and wood work.  A copy of Sargent's scandalous Madame X hangs in a corner.  The reception and housekeeping staff are wonderful and one of the porter's is so avuncular he is a walking invitation to return.  This excellent location in the West Village is very convenient.  Poe lived near by at both West 3rd Street where NYU's Law School is (we don't like NYU) and also on Waverly Place at No 139 I believe.  Both he and Melville attended a Saturday evening literary salon across the street at No 116.  Babbo, also across the street, continues to attract throngs of diners.  There are movie and legit theatres in the area and a surfeit of music venues.  Two blocks away is Sheridan Square where the Stonewall Inn is back in the news and The Northern Dispensary which is, alas, closed so you can't get your head cold treated here as Poe did around 1840.  The No 1 train can get your downtown to the World Trade Center or up town to your Broadway show.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

A, C, E and B, D, F just a block away. Arrived super early, no problem, they took my bag and let me check in a couple of hours later. \n\nOK, the room was tiny and the bed was just 6 feet long, so if you're tall ask for a King room. But it was immaculate and the shower was outstanding! My room's window was on an air shaft, but it didn't matter because the real view is outside. There's a coffee maker, iron, hair dryer, cool terrycloth robes, and a safe in the room. It was also super quiet (when I arrived the only room they had ready was next to the elevator, and the desk clerk said \"You don't want that, we'll find you something better when you come back.\")\n\nSince I was there for a weekday breakfast I didn't get the buffet, but they seat you and offer you a menu, and you can choose from the items on the left hand page at no additional cost. So I had a toasted bagel with some cheddar cheese slices and a bowl of sliced bananas and all was well (they also offer complimentary coffee and juice, which I don't drink, but you might like).\n\nI see that other people consider this \"expensive\", but in NYC to get a room for $139 a night is an absolute bargain.

We saw no drug-crazed guests in the current common areas that recall more distant times, i.e. the Gilded Age and Hollywood's Golden Age. Our Waverly Street view room was very quiet.\n\nBecause February room prices were quite fair, we opted for an executive room, with two sinks, one great shower, and plenty of space to roam around.  The room furnishings are not lavish, but the bed and pillows are luxurious.  Room attendants diligently replenish necessities for the Keurig. The \"included' breakfast is just fine.  Although the menu itself is not clear, you can ask for anything on the left side and they will promptly bring it.  The guys who serve you are friendly and helpful.  \n\nThe stars of the hotel are its bellman and the location.  Ronnie not only greets you warmly, but he will answer your questions and help remove the stress from your departure, i.e. printing boarding passes, storing bags, and\/or securing a ride to LGA.  About the locale: right across the street from Washington Square and less than one block from the Sixth Avenue\/Eighth Street subway.  Unless you happen to love riding in a taxi -- or think Harry Chapin just might be your driver - estimate the number of train rides you need and buy a MetroCard, then take direct rides to stations serving MOMA, the Whitney, and Times Square.  Walk east to the #6 at Astor Place and you're at the Metropolitan Museum in less than 30 minutes. \n\nIn the past, the Village might have been intimidating for some.

Generally, the hotel is situated in a nice part of Manhattan near Washington Square with an easy access to some cafes and restaurants or subway. It takes about 5-7 mins walking to the nearest subway station. As majority of the hotels in NYC the room was quite small and dark however clean. In the room we had a little wardrobe, hairdryer, ironing board and iron that could be handy for some travellers like us. We could get ready planning to go out to the restaurant that evening.\nThere was a big mirror in our room  and the air con was working really well. The room did not offer any window views so all we could see was a wall of the building near by.\nThe only complaint I would have will be breakfast as it is simply scam. Guests have a choice of self service breakfast or served to the table breakfast which is obviously much more expensive. We wanted to try a buffet (self service) first but after finding out what food they serve as part of it we decided not to use it. Self service breakfast variety of food was disappointing for the price charged. Nothing warm you can get as part of it, only muffins, bagels, toast,  cereals, croissant and jam. No eggs, no meat (at any form) no cheese no anything.   Breakfast in the restaurant offers cooked options where you can get fried eggs, bacon etc. \nIt terms of the restaurant staff I have noticed that it was too many of them at breakfast and they didn\u2019t have anything to do so they have been hiding around looking at mobile phones and speaking to each other in Spanish. I personally don\u2019t mind that however if I can suggest something I would recommend for the restaurant staff to hide better so guests cannot see it.\nCheck in\/out was good with no problems and reception staff were nice and professional. \n\nOverall I would recommend staying in this hotel however not for long as the room size wasn\u2019t that great so there was not much room to pout your belongings away or walk around bed. The reason why I rated it as average is because it doesn't offer anything extraordinary other than good sleeping base in Manhattan.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rest of the staff were friendly but didn't necessarily go out of their way to say hello or good night unless you said something to them. That's fine though.\n\nCheck in was easy - which is much appreciated.\n\nI was unimpressed with housekeeping and the breakfast on this trip. We were here 5 nights.\n\nFirst, the hotel doesn't let you really request a specific floor or room. That's okay, but something they told us even if you make a request when you book online that they can't take it into consideration. I am just not used to this having stayed at other NYC hotels where for special occasions they are happy to set aside a room to you for a specific view on a special occasion. That's okay though, just know they can't guarantee a room with a view.\n\nWhen we got to our room, a queen, I found it slightly smaller than the queen room we stayed in last time. That was fine. The rooms at this hotel lack one of the most important features in my opinion, a mini-refrigerator. This was again a disappointment but we knew it would be having stayed here before. We like to buy snacks, wine, cheese, etc. for the room and luckily it was winter and we could put them in the window sill and they stayed cold. There are plenty of space in the room to put a mini-fridge, but I'll leave this one alone for now.  The room only had one tiny ( and I mean tiny) trash can located in the bathroom. It could use another in the bedroom.\n\nThe rooms are decorated fine and have nice lighting, which I appreciate. Not too bright or dark. The bathroom was mostly clean, but there was hair in the drain from the guest before us. Ew.\n\nThe room was supposed to have a city or park view. It did. We were in the middle of th hotel on the side and had a slight view of each, though not good ones. There is construction going on at Washington square park on the corner near the hotel so we maybe saw one tree without its leaves and that's all. You don't come to NYC to sit in a hotel and look out the window anyways. Especially in winter when so much is going on.\n\nWaking up the next morning I discovered that the sheets we slept on had dried blood stains on them. I was disgusted. Rather than making a big fuss in the lobby in front of guests going to breakfast, checking out, and checking in, I just said something to the housekeeper who said she would change them for us.  I used to work in a hotel at a front desk and also know what a pain some guests can be who love to complain about every little thing. And that's not me. Plus, I believe in karma and in the realm of life I'll probably forget this one day. If it's the worst thing that happens to me this year, then I'm in good shape. So I felt it was hardly worth being overly dramatic about, though the next guest after me might feel different. The next few days everything with housekeeping went okay except that they gave us sheets on the bed which were worn, ripped, and had holes in places.  That wasn't a deal breaker for me, so I just didn't bother saying something else.\n\nA final thing which again wasn't a deal breaker, but was slightly annoying as an Eco-conscious traveler is that I typically like it when hotels ask guests to reuse towels and help them conserve energy. But when you hang towels up so they won't take them and wash them and replace them with others, and housekeeping changes them out anyways each day... Then what's the point of saying you are Eco-conscious asking people to help you conserve energy when your housekeeping changes sheets and towels no matter what. Oh well, not a huge issue in any way, just something I have over time noted at many hotels.\n\nBreakfast was disappointing. The cereals (we tried two of them) were all high sugar choices and the two we tried were stale. One was so old it had gotten stuck and gummed up in the dispenser. The rest of the breakfast offerings ( the continental breakfast side mind you, not the sit down restaurant side) were all high sugar pastries, bagels, and yogurts. I'm kinda picky about breakfast not being a high sugar meal and every offering they had except the fruit was high sugar. Though fruit has its own sugars. Plus we're in NYC which has the best bagels in the world and the ones they offered here were not great. The coffee was cold on 2 occasions. Another day they were not fast getting things out and they ran out of spoons and forks and guests just sat there with nothing to eat with but knives. I'm sure the restaurant side was different.\n\nMaybe we had just arrived after a big rush of people but after a couple days we decided to get something to eat out in the city on the go. We didn't want to spend all our time in the hotel anyways, we were there to get out and explore the city! Getting brekky on the go worked out fine!\n\nThe hotel has a nice feel and amazing location. I appreciated the fast wifi. I had no issues with it. You are in one of the best locations in the city staying here. Lots of amazing restaurants all around you within a 10 minute walk. Not to mention good shopping and subway connections nearby.\n\nI'm no longer a novice when it comes to NYC and every hotel has its ups and downs and quirky things, but overall despite the small faults this is a nice place to stay. The poor housekeeping service, breakfast issues, etc. could happen anywhere and it really didn't detract from my trip to the city in any way. I was happy to ring in New Years in New York as I have the past 6 years and I would still consider this hotel again in the future. \n\nBest of luck to this place. It's historic and has been around a long time and I'm sure it will continue to!","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Room 408 was clean, nicely appointed, with a comfortable bed and crisp linens. The only sort of hesitation for me as a solo traveler was that the room was the absolute last on the floor, which had narrow halls. I arrived around 6pm and the front desk was professional although not exactly warm. The attendants in the lobby both the night I checked in and the next morning were very friendly and helpful. The room was outfitted with a vanity\/desk with a footstool and a chair, with good lighting. The toiletries are from Bigelow and good quality. It was a chilly evening, the only reservation about the room is that the windows were completely closed but drafty. The baseboard heat was turned on but the room never got terribly comfortable. The split ventilation system was on when I arrived but the temperature never got warm. The decor throughout the hotel is eclectic and nicely done. There is continental breakfast served in the restaurant just off the lobby--the service there was helpful and the food delicious. Centrally located in the Village right off of Washington Square close to subways, this is a well priced, nicely run hotel. I would definitely return.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

From an online search this fit the bill. Although it was on the high end of what I was willing to pay. In the long run, the facility and it's location made it worthwhile.\n\nThe staff was welcoming and gracious and we were immediately comfortable in the setting. \n\nThe sleeping quarters were small, but served their purpose. We needed a clean, safe and comfortable place to sleep. We didn't come to the city to hang out in a hotel room and I doubt that many do. \n\nThe heat was easy to adjust to our comfort. Coming in to crash late at night, that was a necessity. As I began to melt into the mattress, I realized that the window mount air conditioner was still installed behind the pulled shade and emitted just enough draft to be a nuisance. A quick adjustment of the thermostat created a reasonable balance and I drifted off to sleep. We awoke to an ideal temperature.\n\nAlthough the sleeping quarters were small, the bathroom was well sized and amenities for the room abounded. The shower had the usual shampoo, soap, conditioner and moisturizer; but also a shower gel. In addition there were robes and a Washington Square embossed umbrella, which I had foolishly missed when I went out for a late night walk in the rain. The fact that I could walk alone late at night is a statement of how safe the area felt. (I was amused that walking alone in my black leather seemed to put two other sets of night strollers ill at ease). Trust me, I am not imposing to others by appearance.\n\nThe staff was more than accommodating. I kept thinking of different places I wanted to go during the stay and they were great about confirming my directions.\n\nThe continental breakfast included in the stay was good. I had  fresh squeezed orange juice, cereal, yogurt with fresh fruit and fresh from the oven scones and muffins. The wait staff was very pleasant. I finished with my hunger well satiated.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant stay in a comfortable environment. In quick evaluation of the stay, I intend on returning here again.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Hotel is just a few yards off Washington Square Park and a few blocks walk to Bleecker St., and the numerous bars, cafes, and restaurants for any taste or budget. Superbly located to maximize time on a short trip like ours. The hotel front was tastefully and beautifully decorated for the holidays. This boutique hotel appears to have been remodeled from an old mid-rise dorm of NYU, at least, that's what we were told by one of the guests. There is a full time door man to help with bags, directions, taxi's, etc. The front desk staff was friendly and informative. Beautifully furnished marble floored lobby area. Our king room was very spacious by Manhattan standards and worth the $24 extra to get it. Nothing fancy but comfortable and clean, and the shower pressure was fantastic - the best I can ever remember at a hotel. The bed mattress rested on a platform and was firm for my taste, but my wife liked it fine. There aren't a ton of places to stay in the Village, but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

With over 1000 hotels there are plenty of options.  I have stayed in the New York area only two times previously, once in New Jersey (had a good rate) and once in the Upper West Side (loved it).  I wanted to experience Lower Manhattan.  I needed two beds.  I did not want to pay a fortune, but I didn't want a dumpy place.  I was really hoping I didn't need to use a chain hotel.  \n\nWashington Square Hotel was mentioned in the forums as a possibility and after searching other options we chose to stay here.  I am so glad.  We loved the older character of the hotel, that was still well cared for and in good condition.  We loved the price.  We loved that it was right at Washington Park.  We loved that it was within walking distance of so many restaurants and classic venues, not to mention the subways.  We loved the Village vibe that we had right outside the door and everywhere we could walk.  It was perfect for us.  \n\nWe had a two double bed room on the third floor.  It was a bit of a maze to find it, but that was part of the charm.  The staff was good (though would it have been too much to ask the efficient front desk clerk checking us in to smile?)  The room was clean, the beds very comfortable, the heating worked and we were warm on the chilly autumn nights.  The bathroom was a good size, the shower was warm and had good pressure, (which I love and don't always get).  We realized about the second day that one of the photos of old actresses on the wall was of Maureen Ohara who had just recently passed away.  It seemed appropriate.\n\nThis was a perfect hotel and base for my friend and I to visit New York.  I would return here with no hesitation and highly recommend it to others.","travelDate":"2015-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

On arrival the doorman greeted us, the best greeting we have had from a doorman ever, very polite, joyful and a pleasant chap. Likewise the reception staff were very polite and pleasant. T\nhe interior d\u00e9cor was classical and splendid. We were quickly checked in and in our room in minutes. On entering the room, the hotel staff exceeded our expectations by having not only a bottle of prosecco for us, but a birthday card for my wife, absolutely brilliant.  \n\nThe room itself was sizable compared to other similar sized hotels I have stayed at in NYC. The room was well lit, with a selection of lighting which could be selected to change the ambience\/mood of the room. The bed was a good size and height, with crisp clean white linen bedding, extremely comfortable.  The bathroom is a good size, very clean and stylish. The room also has a wardrobe, electronic safe, hair dyer, iron and ironing board, all of which is needed by travellers, well done on that!  The room also has heating and air conditioning.\n\nOnce we settled in our room, we headed to the bar, and what a great bar it is. Great friendly staff, fantastic ambience great music and a good selection of beers, wines and spirits. On the first night, after eating out we returned to the bar and had some more drinks and a little late snack. The food we tried and what we saw others having, convinced us that on the second night we would eat in the restaurant at the hotel. As it turns out, we didn't make it to the restaurant but we had the restaurant food in the bar, what a great choice that was, yet another great night complimented by the great staff. \n\nOn both mornings we enjoyed a superb breakfast in the hotel.\n\nOn the whole I cannot say enough good things about this place, the only criticism would be that the bar and restaurant doesn't open until 5pm.  \n\nOne thing is for certain, on our next visit to NYC we will be staying at the Washington Square Hotel again without a doubt, for us there is no better place to stay and I've stayed in several hotels in NYC over the years!","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}
