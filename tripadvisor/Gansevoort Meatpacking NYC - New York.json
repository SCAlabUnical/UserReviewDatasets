Eh. I've seen nicer lobbies in bus stations. Well, I don't actually go to bus stations, so that's not true. But it's what I'd imagine a bus station lobby might look like, with a little cafe crammed into the corner, and a couple sad little chairs insufficient for the 15 people waiting around because some technical glitch was holding up things at the front desk... \n\nI will say that poor staff, struggling mightily through who knows what was going on, were all troupers (this is how you spell it, people!), dealing with cranky guests with grace and best efforts. And the valets and bellman were unfailingly friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Very welcoming.\n\nRooms are nice - the window seat is a charming touch, though if your neighbors are sitting in theirs... hi?! \n\nFor what you're paying, though, things should be a little nicer - street- and neighboring room-noise (including a barking dog) got annoying at times. And why is there no coffee maker in the room? I can't be the only person who would like a cup of coffee - even a mediocre one - before having to get dressed to go get one. Our sink was clogged (though fixed quickly), but that's kinda gross, and inconvenient for us to schedule its repair. \n\nLocation was great (well, other than the robbery at Gucci across the street) with everything the Village and Chelsea have to offer within a few minute's walk. All in all, not what I was expecting, but not terrible. If half star ratings were possible, I'd give it a 3.5 for the price.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location and the room were the stars of the hotel.  We reserved a Grand Deluxe King and it was a beautiful and recently renovated room.   It was large by NY standards, quiet, and comfortable.  The hotel is in the heart of the meatpacking district and you could not ask for a better location to explore the bottom half of Manhattan.    We did do a broadway show and visited the Christmas sites in and around Rockefeller Center and it was an easy subway ride with the station a block away.   There is a rooftop bar which we did not visit.  The lobby bar and restaurant were both pretty average and not worth visiting in a city with so many great options close by.    We drove and valet parking was about what we expected\u2026ridiculously expensive at $85, but that\u2019s sort of the going rate to park a car for 24 hours in the city.    Finally the service level was fine, but not up to the rest of the hotel.  Nothing tragic, but oddly a lack of pro activity.  Both checking in and checking out we were struggling with our luggage and the doorman and the valet sort of stood by and watched.   Again, not tragic, but not up to what you\u2019d expect from a high end NYC hotel.   I rated it 4, but would have given it 4.5 stars if permitted.

Gansevoort was one of those hotels , along with the likes of the Dream Downtown, Soho House, The Standard, etc.  The issue is when I travel to NYC , the Meatpacking district is my base, so when I heard the Gansevoort had gone through a renovation, I jumped at the chance to actually stay in the Meatpacking district. \nI was not expecting much , as the Gansevoort hotels have been closing. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel has managed to exceed its original luster, while attracting  a more mature client base, reflecting the maturity of the Meatpacking district as well.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":287626,"title":"Disappointing and dingy","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-06-25","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":2,"text":"Me and my partner booked one night at the Gansevoort for Pride weekend. We were expecting a swanky NY hotel, that i've often passed in the streets, or heard of people staying at, and it looks beautiful. The room was $685 for one night, a lot of money but we expected a lot too. I know this isn't a four seasons, but i expected a really nice experience.\nUpon check in we asked if we could get a lower floor room because my partner has a fear of heights and elevators.\nThey couldn't accommodate and the 9th floor was the lowest room they had. We got into the elevators, which frankly appeared like freight elevators, their state looked extremely poor and dingy. OK.\n\nWhen we got to our room, our key card folder said to just use \"OK Google\" because there's a smart nest thermostat in it. Well, sorry to spoil the story but there was no Google Nest. We had an old off brand thermostat. The room had messy caulk all over the molding and ceiling and floor. The aesthetic I guess they are going for is white and black, so for example white door, black handle. Well the black on the black handle had been shredded off so it looked like faded black into silver. Kind of like how you would imagine a hostel in Central Europe perhaps. There was a puddle of water in the bathroom next to the bathtub when we arrived, and a weird stain on the bed that we didn't realize until we laid down to go to sleep at 2 in the morning. No fridge in the room, but two cardboard boxed warm waters with \"$8\" on each of them. The toilet seat was black (remember the aesthetic) but looked like it was from an old apartment building and not in a good way. There was dirt and possibly mold in the corners of the bathroom.\n\nAfter waking up in the morning we called room service to order 4 hot coffees to the room, and they said the wait would be over an hour (?). So I got dressed and headed down to the restaurant to get them to bring up, and they (l'm not kidding) cost $32 for 4 160Z coffees. The coffee was fine. The woman at the restaurant was very nice.\n\nAll of this to say, I paid $650-$680? something like that for this room and I expected quite a lot. If this was a Marriott courtyard or a hotel in the $300-400 area I wouldn't be complaining about this at all. But if the Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons were $985 for the same night, that $300 difference should add up to more than just a basic room with out the amenities even promised on the hotel keycard folder.\n\nIf you're looking for a really nice hotel in NYC, I would honestly suggest looking elsewhere","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

One chair for two people w\/ a queen bed, so the other must sit on the bed. I want to start the day off with coffee or tea. No coffee or tea in the room or the lobby in the morning when I was in the lobby before 7:30 am. Front desk workers said both nights when I was there coffee would be available in the lobby next morning, but was not. I would have been charged extra on top of the $700\/night for a coffee maker to be brought to the room and charged $2 a pod. Gee, thanks. I was told by front desk worker I could walk to a Starbucks for coffee. Instead I walked about 10 minutes to an upscale grocer w\/ a self-serve coffee bar that charged me only $2.50 w\/ condiments included. Still, I would have much rather preferred the comfort and privacy of sipping coffee in my room while getting dressed for the day than wandering the neighborhood for a basic hospitality beverage, and it was raining. No clock or radio in the room. Did not use the yoga mirror. Marshall speaker is a nice vibe touch, but it didn't power on and we didn't have a compatible cord to plug in our phones. \n\nIf you want to hang out at the rooftop or need to be in this neighborhood, then this is a good hotel.

The hotels brushes it's stylish innards  with modern decor and tantalizing art (even an original Banksy is installed).\n\nI was impressed with my Deluxe Room outfitted with high ceilings, large windows and sophisticated colour scheme.

Bath was marbleized with stainless sinks and all the usual accoutrements.\n \nThe Gansevoort encases a fleet of dining and drinking venues. The Chester is a classic American bistro & bar that is open breakfast, lunch and dinner and serves food fare from avocado toast to nifty burgers. Gansevoort Rooftop is an escape oasis serving inventive cocktails and Mediterranean food. Saishin,  also located on the rooftop, is the place that caters to sushi lovers (not my cup of tea). Coffee + Cocktails, is an establishment with a European vibe and a reputation for its French Toast. A great way to start and finish the day; with a sensational  coffee and a comforting cocktail. There is a mid-sized gym and a popular heated  rooftop pool opened all year round.\n\nSo, if you are looking for accommodations in a prime location near the art galleries of Chelsea, smart boutiques of the Meatpacking Area and the brasserie styled restaurants of West Village...........then try the.....Gansevoort .......A Seriously Swanky Hotel. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

On arrival after a long haul flight from London I was told the room which I had written confirmation (double checked pre arrival) and verbal confirmation as I called ahead to confirm as well, was not the room I was getting and there was nothing that could be done as the hotel was fully booked.  The worst part was not even that this was the case despite all efforts to confirm a room with 2 beds one each for my friend and I but that the girl checking us in told me I had was the one who misunderstood and that was not my booking despite showing her the written confirmation.  She had the attitude of a spoilt teenager who did not want to be there, not the front of house one would expect of such hotel.  Finally we got to speak to a manager who could also do nothing but was marginally more polite than the first girl with the attude, we were given a free drink voucher in the bar whilst they out a fold out bed in our room.\n\nThis hotel has zero sound proofing, great if you are out until 4am every night, if you are not and you don't wish to listen to every single noise on the street I would look for another hotel with adequate noise proofing.\n\nThe rooftop bar is overrated, something close to a store cafe would be a better assessment.  The front of house again was poor, no consideration for guests v anyone who walks off the street and just told to sit whereever and go to the bar to get yourself a drink.\n\nI can honestly say I would never stay at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

For which I never received a reply.  I removed the names of employees.\n\nGood Morning General Manager, \n\nI've not had the moment to write you back as I've been quite busy.  I was married on the fifth and was entertaining family who flew in for the wedding.  \n\nI cannot begin to tell you how disappointing our stay at the Gansevoort was.  Aside from the deplorable state of room 1005, which had clearly not been properly cleaned for weeks; the overall experience of the stay left me wishing I'd never booked with you.  The only reason we did not depart to another property was that we were getting married.  Too many moving pieces for a move like that on such short notice.  And proximity to the wedding venue was of great concern.  \n\nAside from the state of the room I was very curtly informed upon arrival that the early checkin I'd been assured I had by your reservationist, was not available.  I told the woman working the desk that I had been promised an early check in when I'd called a week earlier.  She simply said that early check-in is not a guarantee and only a request.  No apology, no concern.  It was my problem.  This was the first of several charming exchanges I had with a Ms.  X as she is referred on my invoices.\n  \nIf I had been aware of that early check-in policy I would not have adjusted my travel Itenerary to be at the hotel early.  As you might imagine the hours and days immediately before getting married are quite valuable.  I would have used that time more efficiently than showing up for a room which was not ready.  And the less I spoke to your employees the better the stay would have been.\n\nThe approach Ms. X employs in her communicating with guests can be found over and over at your property.  The young lady who works the evening desk shift seems genuinely annoyed by my approaching her.  The only woman who works the door is also extremely annoyed about having to do her job.  The general sense I get from the woman working the door is disdain.  Interrupted only by the occasional rolling of her eyes.  It's as though someone forces her to go to that job every day.  And then doesn't pay her.  \n\nMy hospitality experience is extensive.  I've been in the industry for twenty two years.  Most of them in Manhattan.  I ran venue's X and X; amongst others.  It's as though your staff is under the impression that the name Gansevoort does the actual work for them.  They've collectively gotten their feet under the dinner table and now they get to relax.  And whatever problems arise are those of the guests.  \n\nI'm sure you have many guests who buy into the lure of Gansevoort.  I'm not one of them.  I'm not paying for a name.  I want the actual experience.  And the experience was an embarrassment.  Especially for the price we paid.  I'm not the person who wants to speak with the manager.  I'm not the person who calls out employees.  But this was outrageous.\n\nI'm really an easy going customer.  But not at $685.00 - $745.00 a night.  And I realize that with the money we spent we are still likely on the low end of money spent by your clientele.  But if this is as good as it gets for spending $5200.00 +\/- in your hotel than you should should make that information public.  So people know what they are actually going to get before they commit. \n\nYour bellhops and valet were good.  Genuine guys.  Actually looking to do their job without seeming incovieninced.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":287626,"title":"The worst experience ever","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-08-02","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"Staying at this hotel was the worst experience we have ever had in NYC (during 20 years). \n\nThe bad experience started already before we even checked into the hotel. We had booked a transportation through the hotel (they tried to raise the price after we had already agreed on it and booked it) from the airport to the hotel with a child seat and reconfirmed the reservation before the arrival. Once we met the driver at the airport, we instantly noticed that the child seat was missing. The real struggle started at that point after an 9hr flight and multiple hours\u2019 time difference, with a baby and a pregnant lady in our party, as when we instantly phoned the hotel and informed them of the situation, they apologised but at the same time said that we need to handle the situation by ourselves. Simultaneously the driver who originally came to pick us up left with his car and we were forced to return back to the terminal to start to fix the situation. Finally, after multiple calls and messages later, the transportation company\u2019s driver went to buy a compatible child seat, returned to the airport after which WE spent almost an hour installing the car seat in the car at a busy pick-up spot. Finally, we arrived at the hotel 4 hours after our flight had landed, and all the while with nobody from the hotel having contacted us or having expressed any concern for our wellbeing or safety. \n\nWhen we arrived at the hotel, we were offered an upgrade on the lowest floor with hotel rooms right above the restaurant next to the elevators (in the original reservation we had asked for a room on high floors away from the elevators). As a result we refused that room and were moved to a suite one floor higher on the fourth floor. In addition we were offered the first night without charge, and instead of any further compensation we requested for, they said that we can leave the hotel earlier than what we had booked it for. So in between the lines, we read that after everything that had happened we are also undesired guests at the hotel.\n\nExcept for all this, the hotel is well located, but there were many issues in the room. For instance a fire alarm going off in our room and only after contacting the front desk we learned that it was probably a false alarm as well as the almost constant smell of weed and loud noise at nights from the surrounding bars in our room. \n\nAt the check out the hotel offered to compensate almost our full stay because of what had happened, but nonetheless, we definitely cannot recommend this place to anyone.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and due to a series of complications needed to cancel and rebook a number of times. When we finally made it in on July 4th, we were greeted with warmth, courtesy, water bottles and a super early check in! From the valet, to Lauren at the front desk, the entire staff could not have been nicer or more welcoming. The star of the show here, though, is John Ross who brought us to our room and seems to wear many hats. I think he should be promoted to manager immediately. His smile lights up a room and he gave us a fist bump every time we passed him in the lobby, it made us feel so special. He told us about fireworks on the Hudson from the roof (saving us a crowded trip to the East River) and was a huge help at check out with our car. Can't say enough good things, give this man a raise immediately!! The hotel itself is spectacular, from the fun location (Little Island, Highline, Chelsea Market) to the Banksy in the lobby to the very trendy rooftop pool (shout out to Clarisse who helped us find chairs.) I also loved that you could fit some of your own things in the mini-fridge and that they offer L'Occitane products that are individual, not attached to the wall like so many hotels now. We are already planning our next getaway in August so we can bring our teenage daughter who, if it's possible, will love it even more than we do.

While my daughter was away at college. I brought my wife and son to NYC for a spring get away (we live just outside Boston). I used to live in the meat packing district in the 90s, so I am always in awe with it's transformation. \n\nStepping foot in the The Gansevoort is like the first sip of coffee in the morning, or that much needed drink at the end of the day. The patio surrounding the hotel is a nice buffer from the street and provides a sense of importance as you are one of those who gets to go beyond the crowd and into the hotel. Once inside you are greeted by the warmth the guest services people and the perfect temperature and fragrant clean air.  There is a stylish little eatery in the lobby which is perfect to start your stay if you arrive before check in or a great place to end your stay with a snack before you hit the road after check-out. \n\nThe rooms are surprisingly large. With big bathrooms and walk-in showers. The place in clean (which for me is super important - and there are no pillows or throws that you need to put away for fear of those not being changed). The plugs are in all the right places as are the lights. The sheets and towels are top quality and the shower soaps and personal provisions are generous and luxurious. Each room also comes with a small balcony that provides a great view of the Meat Packing District (the hotel is among the taller buildings in the area so every room has a view - that's rare in NYC)\n\nThe rooftop lounge is awesome! Great drinks and food. Best bet to stick with apps. And the rooftop pool is so refreshing for a morning swim, It's heated, big enough for some laps. Offers an amazing view and provides such a vigor at the beginning of your day.  Words can't describe what it adds to your stay  - you just feel great afterwards. And that feeling makes the rest of the day so much better.  \n\nThe area is like a little Madison avenue. The surrounding stores offer a great selection of European luxury and American style. I highly recommend Belstaff - the British rugged clothing maker. Also the Highline is right there as in Chelsea Market and the most upscale Starbuck you'll ever see. \n\nThe Gansevoort was everything I hoped it would and more.

The hotel worked with us to find a great solution - a suite where we had 3 connected bedrooms\/sleeping areas and 3 bathrooms ensuring everyone had their own personal space, excellent views and most miraculously their own bathroom to get us all out the door on the time. I cannot emphasise enough how helpful the hotel team was in finding the right solution for us on this trip. \n\nThe location is fantastic - step out the door and you're in the heart of the Meatpacking District, surrounded by great shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. Inside the bedrooms are great - spacious, fantastic city views, extremely comfortable beds (you won't want to get out), and stylish bathrooms. They also have great luxurious touches like nice linens, fresh flowers, Loccitane toiletries and fitness mirrors. It is also surprising quiet to sleep with no street or city noise.\n\nThe public spaces are equally great.

Dining was no pricier than comparable options. \nConvenient location- nice neighborhood with plenty to do (shop, eat, museum, walk around, people-watch) and easy access to taxi or public transportation.\nI can\u2019t emphasize how wonderful the staff was- Robin and Karen took care of us at the front desk, and Raul and Gem took perfect care of our luggage and valet service. If you\u2019re driving, get valet service. It\u2019s worth it.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Everything in the room was modern and luxurious. \nAs a woman I was impressed that the hairdryer and hair straighteners were of a good quality standard. \n\nThe staff in the hotel were super friendly and could not do enough for you. \nThe hotel has an incredible rooftop bar and swimming pool with views of the Hudson River. Also on the rooftop is a fabulous sushi restaurant called Saishin. \n\nThey also have a American Bistro restaurant on the ground floor called the Chester which offers drinks at their bar, lunch and dinner. Food was delicious. \n\nIf you have been to New York before and been to \u2018old\u2019 Manhattan hotels\u2026.I definitely recommend a change. Get down to the Meatpacking district and stay at the trendy Gansevoort hotel. It\u2019s fabulous and I will definitely return.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The warmest welcome from General Manager Anton and the Banksy in the lobby set the tone - and the rest of the hotel did not disappoint! \n\nWe had stunning views from our spacious rooms with balconies which were connected by a living area.  This made for a very harmonious family trip.  The beds, linen and robes were pure luxury after a long day sightseeing. The technology in the rooms and the perfectly equipped gym were not lost on our teenage sons.\n\nEnough cannot be said about the location..the nearby Highline is stunning by day and night. This walk never got old. There is a real neighbourhood feel with so much to do. We all loved the restaurants, and fabulous shops. Chelsea Market was a highlight and the golfers had a great time at the very impressive driving range at Chelsea Piers.\n\nChristmas Eve was spent at the exquisite Saishin Japanese restaurant on the top floor with panoramic views of the twinkling lights of Manhattan. We had the 12 course Omakase sushi which can only be experienced to be believed. 15 courses next time as we did not want it to end. Christmas morning started with a rooftop swim followed by a beautiful breakfast downstairs. A 5 minute cab ride to Madison Square Garden for a Knicks game made for a very different Christmas Day.\n\nAnton and his team are doing stellar work here.  We were made feel very special and will never forget our Christmas at the Gansvevoort Meatpaking.  We will back!","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Location is fantastic just next to the Highline and Chelsea Market and with great views over the Hudson. We had booked 3 rooms through booking and the rooms and beds were quit small for 2 people. So we asked if we could get a different room, and the hotel offered us a great upgrade (one room with two beds and one room with a double bed) for 50 dollars a night per room. our room had also more space, an extra sofa and a great view over the Hudson. Rooms are recently renovated, clean and very nicely equipped. After three days we decided to extend our stay with two more nights and this was handled very well by the reservations manager (we kept the special booking rate and the same room).

Serious housekeeping should have identified the problem prior to making the room available. We called the front desk who proposed to sent a technician who never showed up. After a second call one hour later, a technician came by , confirmed the high frequency noise problem but could not and could not solve it. The front desk daid they could not offer another room because the hotel is said to be full.\n\nOn a side note, the music a of the bar at the 14th floor can still be heard at the 12th floor, but the nuisance is very minor in comparison to the air conditioning noise.\n\nThe room refurbishment, compared with our stay 5 years ago is a plus and nicely done, although superficially performed in the bathroom. There is no central command for managing the lights, especially for turning off the night light in the bathroom which cannot be turned off and jeeps slightly illuminating the room. Eye shades are a must.\n\nSo , still nicely situated hotel in the meat packing district, nice rooms, but technology of air conditioning and lighting ruin the experience at more than 700 dollars per night.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}
