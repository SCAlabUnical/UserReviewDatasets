So I booked the room for Friday night knowing we were not going until Saturday morning. Saturday we arrive at 11am, go to check in ,  and we are told they re sold our room and they are now sold out. I can see this happening if we had just put a deposit, but the entire stay was prepaid, and nothing on their website said to call and let them know when we were coming, what should it matter we paid for the room for the 2 nights. The young lady working the desk tells us sorry but if you call we will refund the room. I would hope so, as the now have been paid for the same room twice . We leave and have to last minute book a room at The Domenick ( which is always outstanding service).

This hotel ticked all these boxes with ease.\nThe tempur-pedic beds (we booked another stay within the same week upon check-out after our first stay) in both our rooms were some of best ones we've ever experienced, it was a joy to take a hot shower (and bath) during the cold November days and the staff were always friendly, knowledgeable and greeted you with a smile every time you passed through the lobby\/reception area. And as many reviewers before us, a special shout out needs to go to Seki and Gina - you won't find better people in any hotel anywhere.\n\nThe continental breakfast (served between 07:00-10:00 AM) also outdid our expectations. As we've travelled a lot in Europe, a continental breakfast usually means a few slices of white toast, jam\/jelly\/marmelade and maybe a cup of watered down coffee.\nTo find both delicious bagels with several choices of cream cheese, yoghurts, fruit and pastries with your coffee\/tea - together with the beautiful skyline views over the city (breakfast is served on the 20th floor) - wasn't the worst way to start off your day, on the contrary.\nAnd as others have mentioned, in the afternoons, before heading out to dinner, they offered wine hour everyday (free of charge) between 5:00-6:00 PM, on the same floor, this time accompanied by nighttime views of the same skyline.\n\nYes, the hotel in general - and the rooms - have some wear and tear to it\/them which we're certain will be rectified once their renovations are completed.\nWe would like to point out, that the staff was more than welcoming to receive, and took notes, on any feedback you would give them during your stay in regards to the hotel and its facilities in order to take the necessary action either immediately or to be added to their \"renovations list\" for the future. Always with a smile and thank you.\n\nOverall we felt that, all of the main features were in order, so we didn't care if the elevator upholstery is dated - it took us up and down all the floors safely, and fast, we might add.\nCould the breakfast and wine hour area (on the 20th floor) use a minor 'makeover' with dimmed lighting, a few more plants, candles on the tables, some Ibiza chill tunes (playing during wine hour) and a generally cozier atmosphere? Definitely.\nBut we enjoyed our fresh breakfast every morning while watching the sunrise and in the evenings we enjoyed small talking for an hour and a few glasses of ros\u00e9 wine on the house - so what's not to like - if you've seen the prices for a glass of wine in any NYC restaurant.\n\nWe have stayed at several different hotels and locations throughout the years in NYC when visiting, but this is the first time we honestly can say that we know that we will come back the next time we're in town - it was simply the perfect fit for us and our budget.\n\nWell done Hotel on Rivington!","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It\u2019s a long review but I just have to sing their praises!!! I have been eyeing the atelier suite here for literal years. As soon as I saw those soaking tubs I was DETERMINED to save enough to stay. Came here for the weekend of June 17-19 for a street fair on Christopher Street after saving for a bit and getting a better new job.\n\nFirst off, I wanna give my biggest shout out to the staff here. Every single person I interacted with was so sweet and accommodating and most important they were CHILL. I\u2019m young I\u2019m 27 years old and i always am afraid traveling solo about running into unfriendly staff who judge you on your appearance and treat you accordingly for the rest of the stay. This was the exact opposite.  When my keycard stopped working at 2am and I went outside to ask the security to call someone, not only did he wait with me but we had such a great conversation. To John in security, I truly hope that million dollars you\u2019re manifesting comes to you one way or another. They were also very nice to my friends who came to visit during the day and check out my place. made them feel very welcome which is great considering how some hotels treat you when you dare to invite your local friends to check out your sick room. \n\nObviously the room is incredible; gorgeous bathroom with soaking tub, balcony with a view of downtown and plenty of closet space. Room was clean spacious and the linens were great. Also super close to lots of places to eat. \n\nOverall I hope I can save up enough where this can be a regular hotel I stay at when I\u2019m in the city. Thank you again to everyone there for giving me such an incredible stay \u2764\ufe0f","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

Hotel on Rivington is one of these treats.\n\nAfter bursting onto the Lower East Side scene almost 20 years ago, it now might appear to be neglected and washed up. With no real lobby, bar, restaurant, coffee shop, etc., built-in, it might feel more like an apartment building than a hotel. With its monochromatic art-free rooms it might feel under-designed. And yes, the building is 20 years old and shows it here and there.\n\nTHAT SAID, what you can get here are INCREDIBLE rooms (very large by NYC standards), with bonkers views through floor to ceiling glass walls, balconies, soaking tubs, sex appeal, a secret hideaway feel, and a location smack in the middle of the coolest stuff to do in Manhattan and right on the way to the coolest stuff to the do in Brooklyn. Also the world's most comfortable beds. All at a cost that would get you only a normal room at a cool-ish hotel elsewhere.\n\nAs other reviews have mentioned, the staff is also excellent. All five stars from the manager and then gentleman working when I checked in to Seki to helped us when checking out.\n\nFor me, this hotel is a no-brainer in NYC and I can't wait to go back.

The gym has 2 treadmills, a Peloton and an elliptical. The elliptical was out of service completely and the Peloton had cycling clips so only useable if you decide to travel w spin shoes??

If you want to stay at the Ritz, this may not be the place for you. This is the LES after all, but if you want a modern, clean, and cool place to take in the city, you can\u2019t do better. Having stayed in many NYC hotels over the years, this is hands down the best hotel staff I\u2019ve ever encountered. They actually treat you like a real person, and really strive to make you comfortable. While most NYC hotels gladly pocket your amenity fee, the Rivington actually provides things like breakfast w\/ NYC bagels and pastries and a comp wine happy hour. It\u2019s small touches like this that really make this place standout amidst the other LES hotels. Special shout-out to Lester who went above and beyond to look after me. I hope the owners recognize how special their staff is and do right by them. Thank you Hotel on Rivington!","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

Two people that we would like to point out especially, are Liz and Seki; they truly made the most of it and we hope they will be rewarded for such great service.\n\nMy boyfriend came to NYC to surprise me on our 3-year anniversary and informed the hotel beforehand. Upon entrance to our room, there were rose petals on the floor and bed, chocolates, and champagne for two. It was a very romantic experience and it made us appreciate it so much.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be more happier, it was a beautiful weekend with so many memories that we\u2019ll never forget and all of our needs were met.\n\nThe bath was amazing. We experienced a deep tub where we appreciated every moment of it and felt so relaxed, as we were also given complimentary wine and champagne as well.\n\nThe balcony was one of our favorite parts of our stay with beautiful views and natural lighting that was great to wake up to in the morning for both of us.\n\nEven when we thought we had it all, they were able to give us a complimentary small breakfast as well every morning. This was a great start to our day and made a big difference. It\u2019s really about the small things that matters most, and that\u2019s what we realized this hotel was really good at.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to tell our friends and family about this wonderful hotel and all it has to offer.

It didn\u2019t have a view at all, but we were there to get out and explore so this was not a problem.  The size of the room was nice when we needed a break and to drop our stuff.  \nCons:  the water pressure was a trickle and the A\/C compressor kept crapping out in the middle of the night so we woke up sweating two of the days\n\nI talked with Seki (the most amazing front desk person ever) and she moved me to a different room.  There was a bit of an upgrade price ($30\/night) but it was WORTH IT!  My new room had a separate lounging area and floor to ceiling windows in every room.  The bathroom had double shower heads (now I know all the water was being used by floor 10 and apparently couldn\u2019t make it down to floor 3!).  \n\nThe second room was divine.  Quiet floor with only a few rooms on each level.  The bedroom\u2019s floor to ceiling windows on two sides was amazing.  I slept with the curtains open and awoke to the most beautiful sunrises overlooking the Williamsburg bridge.\n\nThe doormen were lovely and helpful.  Seki was amazing as a front desk person offering tips and just being amazingly helpful.  \n\nI would definitely stay here again on my next trip to NY for business or pleasure.  I hope they reopen the restaurant because I got a glimpse and it looked amazing.  The artwork is representative of the rich history of the Lower East Side.  The breakfast buffet was simple but covered all the bases.  I wish they used the rooftop terrace for entertaining guests, but maybe some day?\n\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel.  They\u2019re recovering after this horrible pandemic and I think they have a few staff who are fully invested in making the hotel successful.  Maybe if they created an incentive program that gave high performers a night or two in one of the executive rooms, they could replicate the amazing service Seki provided.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I had seen such wonderful reviews online and was so excited to stay at this hotel, only to be completely disappointed by the room and the service I received.\n\nPrior to checking in, we found it extremely difficult to contact the hotel. We would call the number on the website and the phone would either ring and ring endlessly or the call would just drop. I also sent an email to\u00a0them asking questions about my reservation a week prior, but never received a reply.\n\nMy partner and I checked in on Sunday and were disappointed by a few details at first. Regarding the room itself, the TV remote did not work and we had to have someone come up to help us, the shower leaked through the door all\u00a0over the\u00a0floor and we had to use most of our towels to clean it up, and within an hour of checking in, we were told that the water would be shut off the next day for a few hours for maintenance. The room also boasted a balcony - it was a glorified fire escape that we were too afraid to step out onto.\n\nWe also booked the Romance Package, but it was not at all what we expected. When booking, I was enticed by this offer as the website boasts many things,\u00a0\n\n- Early check-in, based on availability (unable to check in early, but understood that it was not available)\n- Bottle of champagne - we did not receive champagne, but instead a bottle of red wine (which we did not enjoy nor finish)\n- Rose petal turn down\u00a0(we were disappointed to see that the rose petals were synthetic, and they left bits of debris and little fibers all over the floor and bed)\n- Sugar Sweet Sunshine cupcakes (did not enjoy)\n- Babeland Massage Oil Candle (we did not receive this)\n- Guaranteed late check-out of 2 p.m (issue outlined below)\n\nWhat really upset us was the experience we had regarding our late check-out. When checking in on Sunday, I made sure to double-check that we had a late checkout, which the attendee at the desk confirmed. On Monday, my partner left the hotel to retrieve breakfast (since the breakfast we were told would be available until 11 am had apparently ended at 9 am). He returned after 11 am to find that his key had been deactivated; the attendee at the desk explained that all keys were automatically deactivated at 11 am - he then reactivated his key and reminded us that our late check-out was at 2 pm.\n\nWe thought there were no issues and carried on with our morning. However, at around 12:30 pm, a woman began pounding loudly on our door saying that we needed to vacate the room since check-out was at 11 am. Obviously, we were confused by this - and frankly a bit flustered and very upset since we were trying to enjoy our anniversary and were suddenly interrupted. Through the door, I inform the woman that we had a late check-out - she is apparently unaware of this and tells us that she'll be calling the front desk to verify. I opened the door and, while still on the phone, she simply turned to give me a thumbs up - no apology, no explanation.\n\nMy partner and I were both extremely upset by this as it had ruined our entire mood, and neither of us appreciated being treated like criminals for enjoying our room for the time that we paid extra for. At that point, we decided to leave earlier than 2 pm (between 1 pm and 1:30 pm, I don't remember exactly).\u00a0I told the front desk attendee why we were checking out early - including some of my other complaints listed above - and she was apologetic but didn't really say much else (which I understand that there wasn't much she could really do for me after the fact).\n\nOverall, I am very unhappy with my stay and the service I received - particularly my experience regarding the late check-out and the rude treatment I received from that staff member left a bad taste in my mouth and is what solidified my decision to never stay at this hotel again.\n\nSo yeah, don't stay here and definitely don't book with the Romance Package - not at all worth the exponential price (we paid $450 for just one night). Save your money and go literally anywhere else.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

In addition, when we returned after a full day out, the room had not been serviced. Typically in these COVID times, hotels explain their policy on how the room is to be serviced at check in. We weren\u2019t even left clean towels. \nI blame all these problems on the upper management. The individuals working at the front desk, the bellman, and the engineering department did the best they could to honor all requests\/complaints in a timely manner. \nThis hotel should be advertised as a no frills boutique hotel, because that is what it is.

It was my worst stay ever. \n\nDon\u2019t go to this hotel if you want to feel clean. The hotel is really dirty. They advertise the amazing views you\u2019ll have from your room which is true but they forget to mention that you cannot enjoy them well cause the window is super dirty. On top of that the window had a couple of spots with a sticky dirty substance on it. The bathroom is horrible and very dirty. It has all kind of dirty spots on the floor, next to the toilet and in the shower. We wanted to have some wine to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve but the two glasses that were in the room were dirty so we could not have our wine. There is a painting on the wall which seems to have blood drops on it and it is disgusting. \n\nAs soon as I discovered that the room was dirty I informed the receptionist and asked if housekeeping could stop by and clean the room. He responded that they were already gone for the day (it was only 5:45 PM at that time). The room could thus not be cleaned. He said that I could go to another room if I wanted and I went with a staf member to see the room. This room was dirty too so I insisted that someone could come and clean my room. The staf member consequently went down with me to see the issues so I showed him all the dirty spots I discovered until then. He did not dispute the fact that it was dirty, even took pictures and then responded that he will ask housekeeping to clean more thoroughly next time. So basically he said: \u201cI know that the room is dirty, but although you pay almost $800 for one night you should just be happy with and we\u2019ll try to pay attention to it in the future.\u201d  \n\nOn top of that one of the elevators got stuck during our stay (with people in it on New Years\u2019 Eve) and the other one was shut down by fireman which made us use the stairs to go up 18 floors. \n\nIf you would like to have a nice breakfast in the morning, definitely don\u2019t go to this hotel! Our stay included breakfast and the breakfast they offered was very disappointing and just a joke. It was a brown box with a muffin, an apple and a yoghurt.  This was just ridiculous. \n\nI travel frequently and stayed in numerous hotels, but this was my worst stay ever. Once we got home we showered for almost 30 minutes, washed all our clothes because we felt very dirty. This is supposed to be a 4  star hotel, but really is not. We paid $800 for this awful hotel and are very shocked about our stay. \n\nP.S: we added some photos to show you wat we mean, but some of the dirt was very difficult to capture on photo like for instance the glasses and the window.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Was very excited because the pictures and reviews made this place look great and it seemed like a really solid deal for the price.\nPulled up out front to unload our luggage and were greeted by the bellhop. Gave my card on file and my drivers license to my girl so she could check in while I parked the car. When I returned, I found her looking frustrated on a bench in the lobby. Even with my cards and license they wouldn't let her check in and were quite rude to her about it. We brushed it off and went up to our room.\nI had upgraded our room to a corner suite and was very excited because the pictures looked amazing. We were immediately disappointed. Very awkward decor... strange giant pictures and cheap uncomfortable furniture in a frustratingly dim room. Looked closer and found incredibly shoddy contractor work (paint mishaps, bad caulk jobs, loose screws, outlets that come out of the wall when you remove whatever you plugged in to it).\nThe cherry on top was when we opened the closet and found a variety of sex toys and a menu for any additional toys or lubes we may want. Not knocking that stuff in general... but man is it bold to just leave that stuff in a closet without having the guest maybe elect to have it when booking the room.\nAlso found an open bottle of lotion tucked in to our bed... so.... guessing they didn't change the sheets after someone enjoyed that lotion... in bed....\nI went to the desk, complained of our issues with the room and explained how nothing in the hotel (down to the lack of an advertised game room on the website) was as it was portrayed on the website. The gentleman at the desk informed me that the hotel \"changed owners a couple years ago so a lot of those pictures are out of date\/inaccurate\". He said they won't give me a refund, but offered to let me change rooms. They called someone to show me another room, but it was just a smaller version of what we had for the same price so we stuck it out.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Let's just say that the experience was the worst we had ever had in the city.  They were entirely unprepared for people to come; we had purchased a table and upon arrival (at 11pm) were told that they were at capacity and that we would need to wait for people to exit before we could go in. After much arguing with the doormen and a manager (we had paid well over $3k already) they let us up, but it took three elevator trips to get up because their capacity is so low.  It was clear that our table was not ready, so they threw together two tables and told us to wait there.  It took 30 minutes for any alcohol to get to the table, which was accompanied by a dirty plastic bowl of ice, plastic cups, and a bottle of cranberry juice (in the plastic bottle).  We had better luck getting drinks from the bar than with our table service (which had no waitress or attendant).  The table was located right next to the only bathroom in the entire place.  This event had hundreds of people, and one single occupancy bathroom.  What a terrible job of planning.  No event like this should ever have occurred in such a location.  \nManagement is clearly inept and you should not expect to receive any help in the event of such a disastrous night if you were staying at this hotel.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Nice touch with candles.\n- Shower was great. Lots of space and high water pressure.\n- Great quality (but a bit small) towels. Lots of towels provided. Great bathrobes. Also high-quality linen.\n- Good selection of TV channels (when the TV worked - see below)\n- Nice to have a balcony (albeit not a very cozy one)\n- Huge selection in the mini bar (also a downside - see below)\n- Good Wifi\n- Parcel delivery was smooth and without issues\n- Location is brilliant, on LES right between Delancey and E. Houston\n\nWhat we didn't like:\n- For a \"High floor\" room, we ended up on lowest possible floor (9 \/ 20) - no view really. Reception staff were not able to accommodate a move, despite asking three times over two days.\n- Reception staff ranged from completely disinterested and borderline rude to decent\/alright, no one would go out of their way for anything. Most seemed to consider their an income and nothing more, with zero passion for hospitality. Several times, the same person asked me \"checking in?\" in the same day.\n- There were sex accessories, lots of 375 ml booze bottles in the minibar, a stainless steel coffee table and a fur throw in the room. Tacky and a bit of a ... dated approach. Place for hookers and parties?\n- Quite a lot of noise from water pipes, wind gusting and the climate control. I'm not a light sleeper by any means, but woke up several times. Had to use earplugs some nights, which I've done a total of two times in my life until then.\n- There's a weird feel to the hotel. Walking in, you take 10 steps and go straight into the starting-to-fall-apart-red-leather-covered elevators. As the reception desk is one floor up, there' no real lobby on ground level to hang out in. Most public areas had a smell of cheap\/heavy perfume. There's no ambiance. Doormen had \"uniforms\" making them look like they were guarding a drug nest. (But they were all very friendly, so nothing bad on them)\n- TV didn't work for 2 days, turned out to be a major issue for at least the whole floor.\n- Bathroom door handle fell off\n- No slippers in the room (but provided when inquired about)\n- Slow or no replies to e-mails prior to arrival\n - A shopping bag in our room was likely thrown away by housekeeping. Only had postcards in it (but for a $30 value) Reception staff said they would look into it. Never heard a word again. Never offered anything to compensate for it (two cocktails on the house would have been enough)\n- There's no service elevator, so when there's an event on the second floor, you can expect loads of tables and chairs in the elevator.\n- Flushing the toilet was pretty weird, required you to bend down and hold the handle for like 5-7 seconds. Paper would frequently not flush the first time. Sometimes water wouldn't refill.\n\nAll in all: Not too bad, but certainly nothing we will recommend to friends and family, nor will we return. A shame, as the property could really be turned into something very cool and nice. Would rate 3,5 but as I can't do that, it's more of a 3 than a 4.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

It started out as a place that was a bit of a scene but the size of the rooms and decent service made up for it. \n\nThe last time I was there was 4 years ago. I decided to drop in (I started staying in midtown) and give it a go and...what a disappointment. The condition of the hotel is deteriorating. They've got the same artwork\/carpets from a decade ago. Looks and feels really dated. Flakes of paint and leather in the elevator peeling off. \n\nBut the rooms are still a nice size so I figured I'd stick it out. In my 10 night stay here's what occurred in the first three days...Bathroom door handle falls off. Ok. No biggie. Closet door nearly comes off. Two of the four hinges are busted. Ok. Then the electrical outlet by the bed (next to their pad of paper) blows up and sparks fly out of the outlet and over the nightstand. No joke. I call down to get all these things fixed. Someone comes up and 'takes care of it.' Next day the closet door is off again and the outlet blows up. Again. But this time when it happened my iPhone was plugged in and charging. Charger stops working. iPhone is acting funky since. \n\nI relay all this to the front desk and am told that it will definitely be rectified and that the manager will be contacting me directly to take care of things. One day passes. Two days. I check in with the front desk and I'm told, \"Oh, strange, he's aware of it I'm surprised he hasn't contacted you. I'll def let him know.\" Five days go by and I finally check out and nothing. \n\nThis place is ramshackle. From the service (Aside from the bellmen. Nice guys) to the upkeep. BUT...if you're looking for a good sized room by nyc standards and you don't care about a possible fire hazard or handles and doors falling off...this is the place.

I  probably should have pushed to switch but I typically don't like to make an issue out of such things, especially since I don't go to NYC to spend too much time in the room.

We had a suite on an upper floor. Here is the good and bad of it\nThe Good: the views from the upper floors are amazing. Had a view of the Freedom tower and most of Manhattan...really spectacular. The door men are really helpful . The cleaning staff did a great job and the room was always clean with cookies at bedside when we returned at the end of the day. The manager was great and sent a bottle of champagne to the room. The decor is trendy with hardwood floors throughout the room. The bed was the most comfortable I had ever slept in. The location in LES is great and just an Uber or cab ride from everything.\nThe Bad: Even on the upper floor the street noise at night during the weekend is unbearable and made it difficult to sleep. The room was very cold even with the heat on so I can't imagine what it is like in the winter. The lighting in the bathroom is seriously the worst i have ever seen, it is impossible to put your makeup on and sometimes I had to wait until the sun came up and streamed into the bathroom to do so. Wifi was very patchy. The place needs an update. Cracked windows, reading lights that kept going on and off, damaged furniture all needs to be fixed. The restaurant downstairs was never open, couldn't figure that out. The front desk staff were rude at times. The bathrooms with their exposed ceiling to floor windows to the outside is a bit unnerving. While it is cool to have a great view of the city while showering if I can see them, they can see me. Luckily we weren't too close to anything.\nAll in all the hotel was just okay.

Worst NYC hotel (among close to 50 we have stayed at)","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-03-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Unbelievingly negative experience. Do not take our word for it, check our profile to see our reviews of close to 50 different NYC hotels we have stayed at in the last 5 years. Absolutely and certifying the worst. \n1. Prior to our arrival, we have tried to contact the hotel via their website's \"Contact Us\" option. No reply whatsoever for 3 days. After my comments on the hotel's Instagram page, we were given the email address of the reservation and were promised that our rather insignificant request of checking in 2 hours earlier, at 2 PM instead of 4 PM would be taken into consideration. Not only that didn't happen, but after being told that our room wasn't ready, we were prompted to schlep our suitcases to the ground floor. How about the hotel's staff taking care of it? \n2. The bellboy, upon seeing our suitcase, told me to get it to the storage room, without moving himself. No assistance whatsoever. \n3. We were asked to provide our cell phone number and were told that we will get a phone call when our room is ready. To no avail. Shortly after 4 PM, when we inquired about the update, we were given the nonsensical explanation that after 4 PM, there was no need for a phone call, due to the customary check-in time. So, when exactly our room was ready? 3:59 PM? Or 3:55? If it was 3:55 why no promised phone call followed? \n4. The upkeep is below average, with scuffs on the walls and doors. \n5. No reading light by the night tables, only the overhead light fixtures. \n6. The so-called fitness center, a tiny room with cramped in two treadmills, one elliptical and one bicycle (and a few resistance training machines and free weights) was nothing but a joke, with only one treadmill working. When asked the employee about the issue, the gentleman kept plugging and unplugging the machines with zero end result.   \n7. Upon checking out of this nightmare of a hotel, we were told repeatedly that the receipt would be sent to Expedia. What Expedia? We booked our room via Amex Platinum Traveling.  \nOur King Corner with Balcony featured a nice view to the Lower Manhattan, but unlike Midtown hotels, so does every other hotel in the area, be it Sago, Public, NobleDen or 50 Bowery, all due to the different urban architecture in the area, and the absence of the mass of skyscrapers. \nAlso, our rate was $428.08 per night, and that is during off season. For that amount of money, you will be so much better off at any of the decent neighborhood hotels. \nThe final proof to all of the above is the total lack of management response to the reviews on TripAdvisor, both negative and positive. It is considered a good practice on the part of hotel's management to respond to their guests reviews. Nonexistent in the case of Hotel on Rivington. \nOur experience with hotel's Cafe Midi, even though only visited briefly, while waiting for our room, proved as negative and sub-quality as of the hotel itself.\nWe found a good and affordable parking right around the corner, but won't mention it here, for we absolutely suggest you pick a different hotel for your stay in the LES.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Potential safety issues - balcony door cannot be locked and room was facing and close to other apartment buildings. Upon asking the reception to switch rooms, it was said that ALL balcony doors cannot be locked \"for teh customers wellbeing so that customers cannot be locked out\". This is poor logic - hotel can install balcony doors that are does not AUTO-LOCK. i have stayed in many residences with balcony with doors that dont lock you outside.\n\n2. Privacy issues in toilet -  We stayed on the 6th floor.The Full length glass Panels in the shower area faced a car park and also other apartment buildings. What is shocking is that these glass panels are a mixture of transparent (top panel) and semi-translucent. This mean, people viewing from the top of the car park and higher floors apartment building are able to completely see us showering; and tThe outlines of your body are potentially visible. Upon expressing this concern, the hotel seems to be aware of this issue and sent us \"privacy screens\". To our dismay, the screens are 2 pieces of small cloths that cover only the top half of the glass walls. Upon further bringing up this issue, the receptionist said \" its not visible when its fogged up (during hot shower bath). It can be so during the winter - but I am skeptical during summer. To be honest, it does not take too much effort not money to simply change the coating on the glass panes to make it opaque, or simply install some blinds.\n\n3. Decor issues - our room had a terrifying HUGE picture of a woman with heavy eyeliner. Not very pleasing to see to say the least. Does not make you feel very comfortable with someone \"staring at you\" all the time.\n\n4. Lack of amenities - There was not many amenities in the room like cups, plates. Whats a lot is alcohol and even a fleshlight for male pleasure. We were sincerely considering if the hotel is actually intended for a one night stay \/ love hotel.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon arrival the reception area was on the 2nd floor. Checking in was fine however when we entered the room we were extremely disappointed. The room was small, full height window view was of a neighbouring room with an air con system. The windows were mouldy and the shower tray had not been cleaned at all. There was no kettle or cups in the room and no bedside tables at all. To make matters worse there was not even a sofa bed for our child despite booking and paying for 2 adults and a child in advance. We complained at reception area and they indicated that the room we were in was unsuitable for 3 persons and as such they would have to charge for a double bedroom room instead at extortionate rates. Having showed them the booking confirmation they said there was nothing they could do however they would consider providing a foldaway bed, once again at an additional charge. By this time we had had enough and the argument created scene at the reception area. The manager had heard the commotion and informed the staff member in a derogatory manner \"just give them the foldaway bed\" and then walked away again. That evening the roll away bed had indeed been delivered to the room however with the two sofas left in place there was no room to walk round the bed at all nor get into it either. The mattress was that bad that our son was essentially sleeping on the springs. He had to endure this for the 6 nights of our stay. During the booking process there was no mention of any surcharges by the hotel for service charges at all however on departure a service charge for each day was added onto our bill. By that stage I did not even have the energy to contest it and just wanted to leave. I asked reception if they could organise a taxi to the airport 60 miles north of New York. They confirmed the price in advance of the booking which was \u00a3210 which was acceptable by us and the booking was made by the hotel. Upon departure the porter was kind enough to put the cases into the boot of the taxi closed the door and when inside asked if we had received the updated price which was \u00a3280. We said we had not and had agreed the price prior to making the booking through the hotel. The porter confirmed this was the cost and having no time to re-organise this due to our flight departure time we simply had to accept the amended fare. The taxi firm the hotel booked was shambolic to say the least. The journey is usually 1.5 hrs to the airport. Our trip took 3.5 hrs and as such we almost missed our flights. Three times the driver missed turn-offs despite the sat nav clearly indicating the correct route which resulted in a 15 mile detour in each direction three times!!. We thought the Hotel would have booked through a reliable firm and that was simply the icing on the cake for us and we do stay in many hotels and make fair reviews however this was our worst experience by far.

Quite a \u2018gritty\u2019, old school feel to the area - some graffiti but I really like that as it doesn\u2019t feel overly polished or clinical.No concerns over safety.Arrival slightly uncomfortable as street level signage seems poor and the area and hotel bar\/cafe was busy with revellers on a Saturday evening. Reception is up elevator on second floor.Had a lovely eighth-floor room with floor-to-ceiling windows and no noise. The huge bed was so comfortable. Decor has a very stylish, modern feel.Lower East Side is handy for Soho and Greenwich Village and a 20-minute walk from Brooklyn Bridge. There\u2019s a subway station round the corner from the hotel too which can take you to Coney Island, Brooklyn and uptown.Hotel\u2019s Cafe Medi was good and reasonably well-priced for breakfast.While many holiday-makers may opt for midtown (Times Square, Fifth Avenue etc), Hotel on Rivington is well worth considering if you want to be based elsewhere or see a different side to the city. I enjoyed my stay, although depending on price would possibly still prefer Soho as my first-choice location.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

The location is so ideal, there is so much going on. We stayed in the \"regular king\" and our room was beautiful I loved the decor it was bright and the perfect size with great views, and the staff in the hotel was so lovely! Right when we checked one of the employees gave us 2 free coffee and wine vouchers for Cafe Medi right next door, which was so kind. Throughout the evening an employee came a brought us up warm fresh sugar cookies which I thought was a very sweet touch...but then about 20 mins later another employee knocked at our door with a complimentary bottle of cabernet and a delicious fruit plate for our anniversary!! I was completely WOW'ed, I thought this was so overly generous and I've never been to a hotel that have given us a free bottle of wine for a special occasion. It really touched me and I just want to give a huge THANK YOU to everyone working at the Hotel on Rivington you all were so wonderful and hospitable. The only negative I would have to say was that our room was 80\u00ba when we first came in and I think the heat\/air system may have been broken or old in our room specifically because it took me a while to get the room cooled down. And lastly we were not able to go out onto our balcony, and I know we're allowed to be out there because we heard the people above us sitting outside that night so I guess in our room the door was jammed shut, that was a little disappointing but to be honest it was all made up by the complimentary wine and fruit plate.I would definitely come back to this hotel I would just maybe upgrade from the \"regular king\" to a more expensive room.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I am extremely disappointed that not only did the hotel charge me for something I did not consume, but they don't have the decency to return a call and follow through to fix a mistake. Here's to hoping this will improve their customer service for future guests.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We chose Hotel on Rivington mainly because of the location, and to be honest the photos looked great online.\n\nWhen we arrived at the lobby on the second floor we were the only two waiting. The guy at the reception was speaking on the phone for at least 3 minutes. When he finished his phone call he didn't greet us, he didn't welcome us to the hotel and he didn't apologise for leaving us standing there. We didn't mind having to wait while he was on the phone but he at least could've apologised and said 'hello', not just 'You're checking in?' - friendlier reception staff or some basic customer service should be a necessity in any hotel.\n\nEverything looked fine when we got to our room on the 5th floor, until I saw the bathroom. I can't understand why anyone thought it was a good idea to put clear glass in a shower that looks directly into the back of people's houses? Clearly very easy for anyone in these houses to see you while showering\/using the bathroom. Bizarre! When we spoke to reception, he laughed and said 'A lot of people complain about this, we'll send someone up to your room to put a privacy screen up'. Shortly after, someone from maintenance came to our room and stuck a sheet up on the window. Seems silly that they created windows like this in the first place. Very uncomfortable!\n\nThe photos of the room on the website didn't match what we got at the hotel. First of all from the photos it looks like the room has a city view, ours had a horrible view of an alley. We asked if we could change rooms to a nicer view, and were told that we weren't in the right price bracket for a room with a nicer view. The room we chose showed photos of a city view from the window, not an alley view, feels a bit deceiving? \n\nThe rooms are missing simple things that a lot of other hotels are supplying. I don't care if someone pays for the most expensive room or the least expensive room, there are some things that should be in every room i.e. A full length mirror (Only one mirror in the bathroom, had to look at every outfit I wore in the elevator), bedside lockers (had to leave my phone on the floor charging along with my bottle of water), no ironing board or iron (travelling for 3 weeks, you need to be able to iron your clothes).\n\nThere were positives - great location, shower was powerful, bed was comfortable, housekeeping staff did a great job, air con was excellent. \n\nAll in all, I don't think we will be rushing back to stay here any time soon.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The tenement museum is just on the next block.  The hotel lobby is on the second floor and quite dark, not very inviting.  Our room was spacious with lots of light and a king size bed. No bed stands on one side, so you have to put your glasses, cell phone etc on the floor.  The bathroom is interesting with one full wall of glass. Beware the shower  has a full glass window, half frosted facing the outside ally. Some may think its cool, and others may not be comfortable.  There is an nicely stocked bar and snacks available.  Quite frankly, I would have liked a less-stocked fridge of booze, so I could store some cold water.  Also, I would have liked more counter space and drawers in th room, instead of a big coffee table.  I guess that didn't fit into the boutique feeling.  There is  Cafe Medi on the first floor and we received complimentary wine and coffees.  This is a nice cafe where we had breakfast.\nBeware, that there is a lot of private space in the hotel which is for those people who use the hotel as shared office space.

This hotel use to have a swank upbeat contemporary entrance,  It was curvy and colorful; red and powerful.  But for some reason they took it all out and remolded with this older 70's retro look that makes me think I am going to visit my grandmother in Oklahoma.  Wood paneled waist coat and golden brown woven wallpaper. The furniture and paintings to mach, so you know it was deliberate. So it went from Live with a vibe to dank and restful.  Like, I said she is getting tired, but the remodel seemed to put her right in the old folks home.  The restaurant was also remodeled to look more country french and that is what the hotel began to remind me of- a hotel in Paris - tired and in desperate need of cleaning.  However,  the rooms still have great views of New York and with her floor to ceiling glass she shows it off 24\/7.  I enjoyed watching fireworks from two to three location and if you can get past the down stairs the rooms look pretty much the same as they did 4 years ago.

There are many positives about the hotel but let me go directly to main negative: the front desk. \n\nUpon check in, we were greeted by a woman named ELMARIE who will go down in our books as one of the worst receptionists we have EVER dealt with. So this is what happened: We checked into our hotel room on the 9th floor and were surprised by how untidy the room was (hair on the couch, hair on the bed, dust on bathroom, chipping walls, candle wax in the bathroom burnt, sticky floor). We called Elmarie and told her our situation. She then started arguing with us over the phone saying the room was cleaned. BUT IT WAS NOT. I had to practically beg her to send up housekeeping to inspect it. She then told us that we can be transferred to another room if we are willing to wait outside for a couple of hours. The housekeeping came and we showed them the room. No response from Elmarie for the next 4 hours. We had to call her to ASK FOR AN UPDATE. She said that the room was inspected and it was clean and that there was nothing she can do. SERIOUSLY?! She had to wait 4 hours and us calling her to tell her this? I asked to speak to the manager and thankfully he moved us to a much better room on the 14th floor. Honestly, we've stayed in different kinds of hotels - from the Sheratons of the world to the St Regis to the Ritz - never have I encountered a receptionist as plain arrogant and unhelpful as Elmarie. \n\nBut wait, there is more... Strike 2 is when I called the front desk the next day asking for complimentary water. It was again Elmarie. She told me that they should have refilled the fridge. I told her they haven't. Instead of just sending up two freaking bottles, she told me sorry just wait the housekeeping to refill it. It was 7pm. I was done dealing with his horrible receptionist the entire stay. \n\nAside from Elmarie which is the main negative, the hotel had a lot of positives:\n\n- great view from the room\n- comfortable linens and bed\n- good airconditioning\n- absolutely wonderful location\n- great manager who helped transfer us to a better room\n- delicious breakfast every morning\n- really lovely hotel housekeeping lady who cleaned our room every morning! She was the sweetest!\n- rooms bigger than most in NYC\n\nIt's really sad and eye-opening that instead of the 5 star review that this hotel could have easily gotten, I have to take off 2 stars all because of Elmarie and her horrible attitude. And it seems like a lot of people have noticed. When we were at breakfast, we chatted with a couple visiting from Europe and they had the same negative feedback about the receptionist (surprise surprise: Elmarie) and her attitude. \n\nTo the hotel management, please hire front desk people who help guests solve problems and make their stay better and not the other way around. People like Elmarie are doing a disservice to the great amenities you offer.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I\u2019m serious, he went above and beyond to make sure our first stay in New York was the best it could be. When we checked in, he upgraded our room to a higher floor (19th floor) with an incredible view of the city and told us he was born and raised in the area if we needed directions, suggestions, or ideas on what to do. \n\nWhen we got to our room, there were complimentary red velvet cookies, popcorn, and bottles of water waiting for us (we thought it was a nice touch).

That\u2019s what I call quick service!\n\nOn our last day, we were told check out was at 12:00PM (noon), but not for us. We told Ken we couldn\u2019t check in to our next hotel until later that day and he arranged for our check out time to be at 2:00PM free of charge. Once 2:00PM came around we went downstairs to check out (even though we could have done it online). There was a small line for the front desk, but Ken had everything for us ready to go (paper receipt as I asked for on the first day) and even came around the desk to shake my hand and thanked us for choosing the Hotel on Rivington for our first time in the city. \n\nIf I knew I was going to receive this level of service, I would have never booked the second hotel and just stayed here. Ken, thanks a bunch! You made this a great trip.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

First of all, there are some positives to the hotel \u2013 it\u2019s in a great location on the Lower East Side, the room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. The turndown in the evening with the cookies was also a nice touch. The corridor was a bit noisy at times and I wouldn\u2019t bother with Caf\u00e9 Medi \u2013 coffee was awful and the food is only ok. Lots of better places to go for food nearby instead. My partner had great trouble trying to arrange breakfast in bed for the morning of my 30th birthday as the front desk wouldn\u2019t take his order and sent him to the caf\u00e9, then the staff there wouldn\u2019t help and told him he had to fill in the room service sheet in the room. This just seemed like unnecessary hassle as when he filled out the room service sheet it wasn\u2019t even lifted so he ended up having to take it down to the caf\u00e9 himself anyway! Frankly, I would expect better service from a 4 star hotel.\n\nHowever, the main issue that marred our stay was the lack of hot water at the hotel. Lukewarm (and at times cold) water was available in the shower on the first three days of our stay. After this some workers came in to look at the shower one morning but the water then stopped working completely so it wasn't possible to have a shower at all for the rest of the stay. Despite repeated complaints to the front desk, they were unable to tell us when the water would be working again and only offered complimentary wine to make us feel better about it! The service was really unacceptable in my view - at one point a member of staff just waved a list of rooms experiencing water issues in front of me in an exasperated fashion and it was only on my third trip to the reception desk that someone actually apologised for the inconvenience. My partner had booked a meal at a nice restaurant for the day of my 30th birthday but there was no water at all on that day so I couldn\u2019t even have a shower beforehand. Thank goodness I had brought dry shampoo with me at least! The lack of a shower put a real dampener on the outing \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t have minded so much if it hadn\u2019t been my 30th! \u2639  \n\nI don\u2019t normally leave trip advisor reviews but the poor service from the front desk and management have left me feeling very disappointed. The issue was clearly impacting on lots of rooms in the hotel but the staff were completely unhelpful \u2013 any half decent 4 star establishment would make a greater effort to placate their customers, especially when it was expensive enough to stay at the hotel. To be honest, the responses even left me wondering if this is something that has happened on other occasions and therefore the staff have just become indifferent to dealing with frustrated customers. I have since complained to the company that I made my booking through and received a partial refund for some of the days impacted by the lack of water which I appreciate. However, I remain unable to recommend the Hotel on Rivington. Basically if you value being able to shower in your hotel or having staff\/management that are interested in whether their guests are enjoying their stay, give this place a miss!\n","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"NONE"}

It is truly a wonderful neighborhood with a blend of multicultural tradition and new creative energy. The Rivington is one of the nicer hotels in the neighborhood and offers some competitive packages. Kristen, the Reservation Manager was very accomodating in booking our stay. The rooms are large for NYC and beds very comfortable. Unfortunately the rooms are missing a coffee maker. Although that may sound old fashioned, it is pretty standard and guests should be able to make a cup of tea before bed and coffee in the morning. Not the case and with no coffee available in the hotel (restaurant) until 7AM, I was unable to enjoy a hot cup of coffee before leaving for an early flight. The hotel has great potential, but no one seems to be orchestrating. Unfortunately there was confusion from the moment that we booked. With different staff communicating different information, both by phone and in person, things got unnecessarily frustrating...over and over again. Suffice it to say that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Due in part to the fact that the restaurant is not owned by the hotel, there doesn't seem to be much pride in ownership or guest satisfaction. In addition to grumpy breakfast waiters (except for one lovely Bangladeshi waiter), there was a miscommunication about what package we booked and with 3 different breakfast menus, it got confusing. We were there to celebrate my birthday and birthday breakfast turned into a 2+ hour frustrating ordeal. The upside was that with every problem or confusion, there was a staff member who took the initiative to fix it. Helpful staff included Alex, Elvis, and Idalia. Unfortunately, I left in the same confusion that I arrived since the car to JFK that I ordered through the bell captain the night before was apparently never ordered. As a marketing professional and frequent business traveler, I can honestly say that although the brand has great potential, but will not get there until internal communication is improved and all brand ambassadors are singing the same tune.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Seamless check-in\/check-out. 4 free drink tickets at Cafe Medi, the hotel's ground-level restaurant. We did not use it, but the mini-bar in the room was one of the most stocked ones I have seen. Rooms were, by NYC standards, very spacious. The bathroom was phenomenal - soaking tub is huge and shower has a window overlooking the downtown skyline.\n\nThe only con, and it's not one the hotel has much control over, is that there was a pretty noisy generator at a neighboring building that sounded like it was broken.

Finding the hotel was very easy. It is located a few blocks away from the bottom of the Williamsburg Bridge in Manhattan. There was ample street parking and because we stayed on a weekend, it was free. The staff also informed us that there was a municipal parking garage a few blocks away in the event we could not find parking.\n\nCheck in was a breeze. The lobby was located on the second floor. The staff was very accommodating and even upgraded our rooms. We called and requested to check in early or as soon as the room was ready and they obliged. We also requested a 1PM check out and staff did it, no problem. \n\nThe room itself was a nice size for my girlfriend and I. The bed was a tempurpedic. I know this because I checked for a foam mattress topper, but to my surprise it was just the mattress. The bathroom was also very nice. Very large shower and plenty of mirrors for getting ready. \n\nThere was a table and two chairs that were comfortable but also very chi\u0107 looking as well. The room had a small balcony that had a great view of the city. We were upgraded to the 19th floor and the view was spectacular. \n\nWe were only there for one night, but our stay at the Hotel on Rivington was one of our best. I would 100% recommend this hotel to family or friends. We really liked the fact that it was in the Lower East Side which gave us the opportunity to have a more authentic New York experience. \n\nHotel on Rivington is 10\/10 or 5 Stars.

Expect noise outside until the early hours and lots of car horns. We had this every night.\n2. It felt like the General Manager of the hotel needed to get a grip on the small detail things that make your stay a five-star experience. It felt like it lost the touch they had 10 years ago. We saw on most days dirty dishes on trays at the top of stairways for example.\n3. Concierge was a complete disaster. They had very little knowledge of restaurants or provided options on where to dine. For those completely new to the city, the team demonstrated very little knowledge of options available.\nI would definitely stay again, as I said, this is a great place.

If you want to stay in the LES area, and have the budget for the corner king it's worth it, great views, spacious room and bathroom, and natural light due to being on the higher floors.  Positive points for the standard double, I had a room on the 5th floor, very spacious, contemporary and comfortable, negative points - facing onto the walls of neighbouring buildings - not unusual for NYC I know, but it meant very little natural light - wouldn't be so much a problem if the room and bathroom lighting was bright, but it's not - it's very subtle, with every light on in the bathroom it's still not possible to see enough to put make up, or see properly at all when getting ready.  The shower was lacking any power, maintenance tried to address this and made an improvement but still not good enough.\n\ngenerally the staff and service is good.  Our Corner King room was not ready until after 5pm (check in is 4pm) and staff organised complimentary breakfast in the attached restaurant to compensate for the inconvenience.  Complimentary coffee and wine in the bar are offered on arrival.  my requests re. lamp and shower were addressed quickly.\n\nrooms and beds are comfortable, with turndown service each night and cookies left by the bed which is a nice touch.\n\nlocation was great for exploring chinatown, little italy, soho, all close walking distance, subway station a couple of minutes walk away.  The LES is lively at night so expect some noise if in a street facing room.  one point on the corner king, and this is not the hotel's fault obviously, but something I wish I had known - there is an enormous amount of construction going on in NYC and the view included two huge construction sites which contributed quite a bit of noise if you plan to sit out on the balcony - if I'd known we were splashing out a premium for a room with a view I really would have reconsidered it if i'd known the view to include this, or checked if the hotel had another room with an alternative outlook before booking.\n\nOverall, it is a good hotel if looking for something cool in the area, but for me there are other good alternatives at a similar price for a standard room, but i would recommend it if you go for the higher class of room.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Fabulous bathroom).  \n\nLet's also get one important thing straight:  HoR is no longer the 'It Girl' hotel.  It's long since passed the cool torch onto other, newer properties and is now an expedia.com sale staple, catering to the needs of people who want the look of Lower East Side 'cool' without the high price tag.  \n\nAnd with that low cost comes the many caveats:  Rundown rooms, walls that need repair, painting, cleaning, etc.  They thankfully have replaced flooring, but even that is beginning to show age.  Elevators routinely break down.  The tech in the rooms is laughably outdated.  Mold in the showers.  Dirt in all cracks. Window cranks that fall off and are unusable.  Thank God the toilets are all black, otherwise I fear what I'd really see.\n\nWith a dozen or so new properties having gone up on the LES since The Riv opened, it's surprising to me that the owners haven't tried harder to remain competitive.  Down the street The Ludlow, while having smaller rooms, is spectacularly beautiful (and clean).  The same goes for the Indigo, Trump Soho, Crosby St and LES60.  \n\nOn a positive note, I can say that The Riv still has an incredibly comfortable bed, outfitted in Frette sheeting.  It's not worth the stay, but it's better than sleeping on a god awful bed.\n\nRivington, if you're reading this, consider you're in one of the most competitive hotel markets in the world and no longer the only 'upscale' option in your neighborhood.  It's time to either put up or shut up.  You can do better.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I mean top nightclubs are hidden behind derelict graffiti laden doors with no indication of what lays behind.\nAnyway the Hotel Rivington was very cool with large and well appointed rooms. I was, however a tad disappointed as the pictures showed wall to floor glass rooms but I didn't have one of these :-(. Maybe its worth checking exactly which room you get. I believe the good ones are on floor 9 and above.\nAnyway the highlights for me were Ashleigh in reception and Jerry on the door. Two native NewYorkers with an amazing insight . Jerry was from the neighbourhood. I loved it when he said the Lower East Side was like a c**p shute when he was a kid but now it's all trendy and gentrified with cool bars n bistros and the pavements awash with models and city slickers. \nAshleigh likewise was an insightful character. Her vivacious personality and laugh rebounded off the walls of the reception area delightfully. What a gal .. pleasant, funny, welcoming and knew so much about NYC. Her tips of where to go were truly great, the highlights being the walk over Brooklyn Bridge and a stroll on the HighLine located in the Meat packing district.\nI found New York very expensive but found a great Taqueria around the corner .. The Essex Taqueria I believe .. I love Mexico but found the chef un poco sosa (grumpy) but I said cheer up man .. your food is muy rica!!! he got to know me over the days I was there and he did brighten up for sure .. but definitely try out the tacos n quesadillas ...\nThe hotel is in a great position to walk to SOHO, Little Italy and Chinatown and the F line subway is just round the corner (in fact you pass the Essex Taqueria on the way!) The subway is next to McDonalds, a great option for breakfast, especially since the Rivington have stopped their complementary breakfast :-(\nTwo blocks away is Katz's the world famous deli .. you can grab yourself a $22 pastrami sandwich after queuing for about an hour but it sure made Sally happy dining there (Was featured in when Harry met Sally) so give it a go. The cutters are well funny and the place is a must see really.\nI also got grabbed by a random guy who took me to a comedy club (well a room behind an Irish pub) really close to the hotel .. Jerry will know all about it! And it was free to go!! and they ordered free pizza for you too! The comedians were so funny, a couple in particular had cutting new york humour which definitely satisfied my english palate!\nOh .. next door to the hotel on the corner of essex\/rivington is a bodega owned by a lovely indian family. They sell coffee at $1 a throw!! It should have a sign saying New York's cheapest coffee jut like in the movie ELF where a similar establishment claimed the World's best cup of Coffee!\nWell New York was great and the Rivington is in a perfect location in the neighbourhood as Jerry says ... Staying in midtown, Times Square is good but you lose the quirkiness of somewhere with that local feel .. I really liked it and would like to come back even to eat the $22 sandwich!","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Arrived to hotel and in an area with a narrow street.  Hard to even find entrance to hotel.  Once inside you have to go to 2nd floor to check in.  Check-in was quick.  Two elevators but are small and take a while to come up.\nRoom I had was 74.  Room was decent size.  Looked out windows and basically no view with view of a wall to building next door.   \nAs far as room was quite disappointed throughout stay.  Stayed for three nights.  First off, the room was extremely noisy.  You could hear noise all day and all night.  Doors closing and opening, people in and out and could hear conversations.  Noise from people showering upstairs.  Luckily always travel with ear plugs and that allowed me to sleep.  \nHotel itself needs a major renovation.  Just looks like it\u2019s in need of a major makeover.  \nOne of the biggest disappointments was with the bathroom.  I did not get one of those showers people can see in as I had a bathroom with an interior bathroom.  But the room is all black.  Black walls, black vanity, black tub, black shower walls, black curtain and black floor.  Room is so dark and just one light in the bathroom.  Very hard to see when you\u2019re getting ready.  Some of the floor tiles were broken. Toilet sometimes would not flush.  Had to flush several times.  AC door opened up and filter was filthy.  Looks like it had not been cleaned in months.   Bed was comfortable and linen looked clean.  Small sitting area with small sofa and a desk\/chair.  If you need an iron and ironing board you have to call front desk to get one delivered.  Quick delivery though.  Safe in room.  Has a mini bar and one of the most well stocked mini bars I\u2019ve ever seen.\nThis hotel would not have been my first choice but stayed because of an event at hotel.  Would I return to hotel?  Probably not.  Just not my type of hotel.\nCheck out was quick.  If you want a late check out though they will charge you $25 dollars per hour past noon check out time.  \nThey do have drivers that will take you to airport and to Newark they had an $80 flat rate (not including tip) as long as you paid in cash.  Much nicer car than taxi you get at airport.  \nHate writing reviews that are not positive but have to be honest and give an honest opinion of this hotel.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We enjoyed our stay in the area.  We are in our 60s and this hotel as well as the Ludlow is mainly younger, more hipster.  The hotel itself was ok with some problems and in my estimation not worth the money we paid.   We chose to pay for a higher floor room and stayed on the 12th floor.  The room was nice enough: quiet, clean, comfortable bed and pillows with a good view and sitting area.  What we didn't like was the all black bathroom with horrible lighting.  I found the all black color scheme depressing and hard to judge it's cleanliness.  The one small light over the sink cast horrible  shadows on the face and made  applying make up a real challenge.  But perhaps the worse thing was when the cover for the air conditioner filter in the bathroom opened up accidentally and exposed a filter with a couple of inches of accumulated dust, which appeared not to have been changed in years.  Yuck!  We complained and they replaced it later in the day, but does make you wonder about their maintenance standards.

Despite mentioning the special occasion in the comment section on my booking and at the front desk upon check-in, there wasn't any special thought or surprise but into the experience. The only reason I had expected this was due to other TripAdvisor reviews of the property and experiences at other hotels of this caliber\/price range.

Both the room and bathroom had great views of the city through the floor to ceiling windows which brought lots of light into the modern, mostly white rooms. The shower and soaking tub were huge and very comfortably fit my 6'5\" boyfriend.\n\nAlthough we didn't eat at Cafe Medi downstairs, it was always busy and must attract customers outside of the hotel guests.

But 2 things (1) As other visitors stated, there are rooms with a floor to ceiling window in the shower! I don't understand why this \"design\" was done in such a ridiculous way. For one-half side (see pictures), the lower piece of glass, basically from your waist down, was frosted enough so you couldn't see through it. However, taking a shower at night with the light on, someone could see that there was a naked body in there. The upper piece was a working swing out window with no frosting whatsoever -- your entire upper half of your body is visible to anyone hanging out on the rooftops (and there were many people out), or rooftop parking lot a few buildings over. The other half of the window, from top to bottom,is lightly frosted but you can still see right through it. I asked for a more private room, and they said they would come up with a \"privacy screen\".. Well, \"privacy screen\" = white contact paper on the clear window only! They should just provide a shower curtain with a tension rod!\n\nThe 2nd issue, is a HUGE BEWARE... They take a photo copy of your credit card and license, send it to accounting department for billing, and then they said accounting will 'destroy the information\" -- I'm sorry that is not good enough. As your desk clerk explained this to me, he opened a draw with all of the papers, pulled one out and held it up for me to see. With today's available technology, there are other more-secure ways to handle this. You are putting every customer at unnecessary risk. I do not recommend anyone staying here until this is resolved. I will be telling the travel site, that we use for work, to exclude this hotel.\n\nOtherwise, you have a decent hotel, in a decent area. Your staff is very friendly and helpful (although one made a mistake during the explanation on payment), and your rooms are nice and clean - excluding the contact paper.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We stayed on the 14th floor in a corner room with floor to ceiling windows.  The room concept is great but somehow it just doesn't quite come off.  The room is light and airy and the view is fabulous but the room is a little shabby and rough around the edges.  The bathroom really let the room down - the floor tiles were cracked with one coming away on my foot when walking into the bathroom, it was also dusty. The toilet did not flush easily or fully.  The sink layout is not practical, there is very limited space to put anything.\n\nBreakfast at Cafe Medi was included in our rate.  The restaurant was not busy but the server was insistent the guests all sat in the same row of tables.  We suspect this was to make it easier for the staff as they did seem a little short handed.  It took a while to be provided with menus and to be asked if we wanted a drink.  We were only provided with the set menu included in our room rate, no other options were offered up.  The choices were limited - four items were shown from which you could choose two.  I chose the bagel, offered with cream cheese - why no smoked salmon?  The bagel was so stodgy it was inedible.  My husband's croissant was not much better.  We asked for cappuccinos and were advised that these were extra - fair enough but $26 for two cappuccinos - outrageous especially since they were luke warm and weak.  There is no issue with offering a limited selection of food but what is offered should be fresh and of a high quality.  For the price we paid for the room we expected more.  \n\nWe did complain and we were offered breakfast in our room the next day which was appreciated.  However, since the food  would have come from the same kitchen as the rock hard bagel we decided to decline.\n\nWe did follow the walking tours on the hotel's website which were really enjoyable, especially the walk over the Brooklyn Bridge with its fabulous views.  \n\nOverall, Hotel on Rivington was a let down and especially given the price we paid.

It's a well appointed, stylish hotel that belies it's size and has quite a boutique feel. We stayed in a room with 2 sides floor to ceiling windows on the 16th floor. The views were breathtaking, not only back to the city but across all the Lower East Side. It has a good subway link up to midtown close by, so it's easy enough to get to all the sites, but is a great base as the Lower East Side is such a vibrant place to be in it's own right. All the staff were extremely helpful, and the doormen\/bell boys know everything you'll need to know. The only downside is that the roof top bar is only available for private hire currently....those helpful staff I mentioned sneaked us up there and the views are brilliant.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My room was spacious and had a comfortable bed.  The mini bar was well stocked.  There was popcorn and water and cookies waiting for me.  All of these nice amenities were cancelled out by the fact that my shower had a massive window in it which looked directly out onto a parking garage and neighboring buildings.  The glass was not frosted.  It was not mirrored so strangers could not see in.  I called down the next morning to say how uncomfortable I was.  They offered a privacy screen.  I asked that it be installed while they serviced the room.  I did not get back to my room until midnight that night and there was no privacy screen in place.  I called down to the desk again and they said they would send someone right up.  A man arrived several minutes later holding a cardboard box and a roll of masking tape.  THIS was the \"privacy screen\" they intended to hang.  I told him I would rather deal with the window than have cardboard falling on me during my shower.  They said they had run out of the screens and would have one installed the following day.  Once again nothing was installed.  I complained at check out about the situation and was told that they have rooms with interior showers and that for my next stay they would put me in one of those.  I don't understand why this couldn't have happened the first time I called the front desk.  I would have gladly moved rooms.  To cap off a bad stay I asked for my minibar charges to be charged to my personal debit card (leaving my room night charges on my corporate card).  Instead the woman at the front desk moved ALL charges to my debit card which will now take days to credit.  Needless to say I will NOT be returning to this property.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We typically stay midtown and wanted to change it up a bit. I stumbled upon Hotel on Rivington while I was looking for somewhere that had good views and larger rooms. This seemed to fit the bill. We booked a high floor king suite and were just blown away. Upon arrival, we had a handwritten note from Kristen wishing my husband a happy of continuation of his birthday celebration (I had briefly mentioned to her in an email prior to arriving). Along with the note were cupcakes and a bottle of nice champagne. He was absolutely floored. Then, on our last night, we came in to a beautiful gift bag with a candle, ear plugs and nice note apologizing for any noise on the penthouse floor, as it had been rented out for a private party. The note also stated that breakfast was on them (the hotel) in the morning, should we choose to have any, downstairs. Again, floored. We could barely hear anything. But the fact that the hotel anticipated any issues and tried to counteract them with act of generosity and something useful, like earplugs, is just plain excellent customer service and something so many other businesses could take a lesson from. The room itself was just beautiful, crisp white linens, comfortable bed, wonderful views from the floor to ceiling windows and the bathroom tops it all. We can't thank you enough, Kristen and staff. You exceeded our every expectation and made my husband's turning 40 much more bearable! He forgot his age. Mission accomplished.

The curtains were hanging off the rail and the furniture old and dated. The complimentary breakfast was a nice touch, although more quantities of food is required. Most days they ran out of cups, bagels, hot water, yogurt and had to be asked for more. We had a very unpleasant experience with the doorman who I am very happy to name. When we got to the lobby to call for a taxi he was nowhere to be seen, so we asked another staff member who was passing by and he called the doorman. Well we received an outburst of frustration, as he said he shouldn't even be at work as he was sick and therefore could not help us get transport. We were less than happy with this response and in fact in Australia he would of been terminated on the spot!! He reluctantly called for an SUV which was not what we asked for but in the end accepted it out of sheer anger and frustration. To make our stay even more unpleasant there was an all night party in the room next door which kept our whole family of four up all night. When we complained during the night a staff member did tell them to quieten down but the room full of people continued to be very noisy, people slamming doors all night long. When we reported this to reception the staff could not really of cared less and made no attempt to compensate us for the very unpleasant night.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The curtains didn't cover that window, so if you wanted to sleep in  and have dark room you had to figure a way to pull the curtain to block the light.  Also, there is a a none frosted window in the shower, so women be aware of the men with binoculars below on roof tops taking smoke break.

Close to several subway lines, tons of restaurants and bars on the surrounding streets, plus great LES institutions like Katz's and Kossars a few minutes away. Rooms are nice and large. Great showers.  Some rooms definitely have a killer view.  Can be noisy on the weekend due to the neighborhood and noise from the hallway is very penetrating.\n\nTo their credit, they did send up a bottle of wine for a birthday.\n\nHowever, in this price range, they are competing with the boutique brands of chain hotels like Indigo or Andaz, and there they drastically fall short.\n\nDuring breakfast, every table was dirty and most things were not refilled, including yogurt, cream cheese, coffee, napkins, glasses, and fruit. (leaving just bagels with no cream cheese, juice with no glasses, toast, and dry cereal) When we asked the attendant about refilling the yogurt, he said curtly \"Finished.\" We asked what that meant, since it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect them to refill the yogurt at a $400\/night hotel. Plus, it was the only non-carb thing on the table. He began screaming (!) and gesturing at us - \"Don't you understand? It's finished! There will not be any more today! Finished! Finished!\" It was 9am, and breakfast goes until 1100. We felt bad for any one who comes at 1030.\n\nI complained to the front desk, and the food situation was better the next day. However, I never received an apology or consideration from the hotel management for being yelled at, something I have never experienced in years of frequent travel.\n\nOther service lapses:\n\n- The initial check-in at the front desk was cold and abrupt.  When I asked about the complimentary coffee, tea, and wine that they advertised as available every day from 12-6 up until the day before we arrived, I was told that now they that changed it to ONE complimentary cup of coffee and ONE glass of wine during our stay.  This is a material change that should have been advertised or at least they could have offered those who already had reservations an unlimited number of coupons. Then when we went to the restaurant for our \"free\" coffee, we were directed to a self serve thermos with paper cups.  Not quite what we were expecting. \n\n- Cookies are supposed to be left at turndown. We got them the first day but not the next two. We asked a maid and she said they frequently run out. How do you run out when you know how many guests are in the hotel? Why promise something simple but not deliver? \n\n- Toiletries not refilled despite being almost empty.\n\n- Used glasses were removed but not replaced. So the first day we had water glasses, then they disappeared, so we used the wine glasses, which also disappeared and were not replaced.

I have to be honest, it was rather disappointing. Firstly i think this hotel has a major identity crisis in so far as i believe they would rather be a party venue or nightclub than a hotel. One look at the mini bar confirms this, which whilest i can admit is pretty comprehensive, I also got the distinct impression that most of their effort, time and budget went into the mini bar stock.  Every other hotel we stayed at during our trip in California and New York gave at the very least complimentry bottles of Water and Coffee machines in the rooms yet for whatever reason, and on top of the hefty room rates Hotel on Rivington didn't offer this. $4 for a bottle of Water is pretty disgraceful and complimentary tepid coffee in the lobby was the best you could wish for.\nThe bathroom felt like I was getting ready in a cave. It was seriously dark. When we complained about this we were met with a total blank expression and asked \"have you turned the light up\" I gave up at that point. There was no clothes iron in the rooms so that involved another trip down to reception. There is very little room in the rooms for luggage and the hotel was slightly \"rough around the edges\" so to speak. Still, at least i could get stuck into the over priced mini bar...","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was greeted at check in by a very nice front desk person. I had to wait about mins for my room but after that was underway. \n\nThe room I had booked was a high floor king. On entering the room I noticed how compact the room is. There is a sense of space toward the windows and the seating area, however the bathroom is small and has little ventilation. Based on the map behind the door this is one of the smaller rooms on the floor. The key issues I found with the room were the noise that could be heard outside the door anything going on in the hallway is 100% audible in the room. Also the front door is very high compared to the floor letting in a lot of light, combined with the fact the bed faces the door almost directly it became an issue.  \n\nThe other problem is the level of service, on the first night I returned to the hotel and asked the porter if he could take a photo of my wife and I. We were the only people at the front of the hotel and this gentlemen was leaning against a door doing nothing. He said verbatim \"it will have to be fast as I'm busy working\" in a very odd tone, then did not take the camera and just stared at us. It was very strange, I could understand if he was trying to be funny or he was just rude never the less no photo was taken and we were made to feel quite awkward. This gentlemen only seemed to work at night all the other porters that worked the day shift were beyond courteous and friendly. Moving forward the noise in the room was insane one morning from the room above somebody walking in heels for over an hour at 6am, I tried to call the hotel 5 times from my room and could not get anyone at the front desk to answer. I even tried to call the hotel from my cell phone and no luck. this happened twice more during the stay when I tried to reach the front desk. It seemed that the hotel was full and the hotel was really understaffed. \n\nI think because we were paying $500 a night we were expecting a lot more. At a lower rate I could except the flaws in service but not at the price.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The facility is nice and the PH has some great views.  However, my experience was impacted negatively by their approach (or lack thereof to customer service).  I checked out yesterday and checked my bags with the bellman before I left for the second day of the workshop.  At lunch I realized I left my iphone charger in the room and called the room to inquire if it was recovered by the housekeeping staff.  The front desk manager said he would check and let me know when I arrived for my bags.  Upon arrival he told me that nothing was found in the room and that it had been checked by the HK managers as well.  When I asked if I could check the room myself he said no.  I then asked if a new guest had checked into the room, he said no and that there was no way I could have access to the room.  At this point it wasn't about the missing charger - it was about the customer service.  The head of security overheard our conversation and even inquired if he could accompany me to the room to check and the manager said no.  I am not sure if he did not want to be proved wrong or if he didn't want to admit that the HK staff took it or threw it out, but I will not stay here ever again nor do I recommend it based on this experience.

Gio is the day manager and he will take care of anything you need-- as will just about everyone. From the doormen to the cleaning staff, we couldn't have been happier. The only critique I will give here is that some of the staff could be better informed about the area and its amenities, restaurants, bars, etc. But otherwise, the staff could hardly have been better.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I saw a review from last week that said the same thing and hoped the problem was fixed, but it wasn't.  \n\nI also requested a wheelchair for my partner.  The one they gave me was filthy, covered in dust and dirt.  When I spoke to the man at the front desk about both the air conditioner and wheelchair, he didn't even apologize.  He implied that most people don't request wheelchairs and made it sound like they did us a favor for supplying us with one.\n\nLastly, there was a room of loud guys directly below us yelling on their porch all night.  We asked the front desk to speak to them, but it never quieted down and we barely slept.\n\nThere was one woman at the front desk who was really nice and did her best to accommodate us.  She even sent us a free bottle of wine and ultimately, the wheelchair was cleaned off.\n\nThat withstanding, it was a disappointing experience given the price point (over $600.)

Just getting out of LES due to the construction is terrible. \n\nProperty:\nThe lobby is under construction so you're walking into basically a dark and barebones lobby.

Let me begin...The construction is subpar and none of the interior doors would shut properly unless you slammed. The TERRACE door would NOT close. I finally got it to shut. When I left my room for the day, I came back and their was maintenance in my room. Why? Because the terrace door came off the hinges and almost fell off the terrace.

The room, although certainly not palatial in size, was suitable for the four nights we were there, and we enjoyed the grand view towards the south. It should be noted that the balcony really isn\u2019t suitable for more than a quick look as the grating could cause some to feel squeamish, and it\u2019s too small to drag a chair out to sit on.\n\nIt was fun to shower while watching over the city \u2013 no problems with privacy for us - but then, we\u2019re Europeans.

Located in Manhattan's Lower East Side neighborhood, it's walking distance to Soho, Village, Bowery, Chinatown, Little Italy and even Williamsburg, Brooklyn (pedestrian overpass on the bridge).  The lower east side itself is a fun little neighborhood with lots of bars, restaurants and even some remnants of its immigrant history (the tenement museum).  The hotel is located in a modern glass building among all of the old tenements.  The hotel is small and a little quirky with a second floor lobby.  Service can be a little slow or spotty but everyone is super nice.  Get a room above the 4th floor to see the sky, otherwise you will be facing brick buildings.  Our room this time was on the 7th and we had a corner room with floor to ceiling windows facing lower manhattan.  Fixtures are all standard fare for a boutique hotel.  Overall for such a tiny hotel, the rooms are quite large.  But the best part of the hotel is its location - you can walk to many of the best neighborhoods in manhattan, and you are far away from the cheesy tourists staying near times square or uptown.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My boyfriend and I checked in this weekend for a romantic overnight in the city and were immediately disappointed. The hotel had a run-down feel and after waiting 15 minutes to check in we were told the CO-OP lounge\/restaurant was closed for renovation. That would have been useful information when we booked. Then we were told the 12th floor room we were guaranteed was not going to be ready until 6:00 (it was 4:30 and check-in time is 4:00).  I was already frustrated but we ended up with a decent room.  The service continued to go downhill from there. The hotel is run by a bunch of inexperienced kids who could not give less of a crap about the comfort or needs of their guests. And the fact that there is no bar or restaurant, and the fact that you can't order room service at any hour of the night in NYC is beyond ridiculous. I then waited 15 minutes the next day to check out and even longer for the valet to get my car. Again, no one seemed to care or have any desire to take care of their guests.

The doorman was also inconsistent and often absent. When around the doorman was not polite. No please\/thank you's not what I expected. We arrived at 22.00hrs very tired from the UK hungry and thirsty. There was no bar (there was an extortionately priced mini bar in the room but I never use them) and we were told room service had finished! Seriously in the CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS. I had to go out to the a convenience store around the corner at 23.00hrs to get a couple of cans of coke. We were also not  told before booking that the restaurant was closed for refurbishment. Which in itself caused breakfast to be served in a dirty\/disorganised conference room. On arrival the tables were not laid or clean and we waited 45 minutes for breakfast to be served which delayed our check out. When the breakfast arrived due to the distance and logistics of getting a hot breakfast from the kitchen and lobby it was dry and only luke warm. We had no apologise, no warning of any of this and the lack of room service to compensate means this hotel should be rated 2-3 star. No one apologised once for the inconveniences. New York City in 2016..no room service in a hotel that claims to be luxury boutique. Not a chance, I could have stayed at the Marriot on the East side for less money.\nAll of this could have been cleared up we were made aware on booking but it wasn't which is why I am so disappointed. Of course hotels need to be refurbished from time to time, but when they do, the staff need to make up for this in extra special service. The service here was non-existent.

Also came with a private balcony.  Well put together, great amenities - and that tub was HUGE and so great after walking all day.  Tempurpedic bed was great, though a bit firm for my tastes. We also had a great view looking towards the Williamsburg Bridge and the new World Trade Center.\n\nNeighborhood - Lower East Side - is great for some new bars \/ restaurants as well as great history (Tenement Museum, Jewish - American history).  Easy to get to multiple subways (6 train at Spring Street goes to the East Village as well as to Grand Central, from which you get access just about any place in the city).  BONUS - within walking distance of Katz's Deli, Grilled Cheese, Pickle Guys, and Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse!\n\nAll doormen were wonderful, pleasant, cheerful but respectful, and very helpful!\n\nHowever, some things to note.  I was disappointed in a few things about the room that made me think the management was not quite to the level they advertised - some missing tiles on the black tile floor, a broken seal in the (glass) shower door, holes in two towels, and a window (in said shower) that did not close \/ latch.  Cleaning staff put our toothbrush in a glass to neaten up, which only left us with one drinking glass.  Also, the hotel advertised that their lounge had beverages at certain times (including wine), but when a private event was in that space they did not post \/ notify guests that there was an alternate location (if there was).\n\nThey are VERY strict about their 4 p.m. check in time, and there were many people waiting in the lounge (free wine) to check in.  I have no argument with this - it's their policy - but we had one woman who was very rude when we tried to check in early, telling us we should have booked the night before to guarantee the room. (Whereas another woman was very kind, pointed out the lounge, and told us we could stow our luggage and call back and see if a room was ready early).\n\nMy only real complaint, which isn't really their fault, was that when we were there it was VERY windy and we heard the wind whistling through something all night - kept us up both nights.  Not sure if it was the bathroom window that didn't close, the balcony door that didn't lock, or just the balcony (wired railing) itself. \n\nI would stay again, though I'd check the room more thoroughly before I unpacked.","travelDate":"2016-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff, Ashley, doormen, desk people where all super helpful in guiding us to some great local dinning. It's location was fabulous, the LES, is such a vibrant area. I've read some who were put off by the neighborhood and noise which we had no problems with. A special 'thank you' to one of the best housekeeping services I have ever encountered. They were invisible but available within minutes for any extra towels, etc. I believe they even folded clothes I had left astray every morning!! This trip was a close second to our Honeymoon and we most definitely will return to catch the few attractions we missed this time around. Really the best hotel we've ever stayed at!!!","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are lovely, the views spectacular, and the staff friendly.\n\nHowever, after arriving home after 21 hours of flights, I discovered a rather high charge on my credit card. Thinking this was odd, I emailed the hotel immediately. They informed me that the charge was for mini bar items, specifically 2 bottles of high end champagne. Since I do not drink wine I was perplexed. I responded as such, and also suggested that had I used minibar items, I would have informed staff upon checkout. After several emails back and forth, the hotel still claims that the items were consumed during my stay and refuses to provide a refund. To have my honesty questioned like this seems the height of rudeness. The experience has soured what was a very pleasant experience until that point.\n\nI can only suggest that people check the minibar when they arrive and leave, as the Hotel on Rivington seems to ascribe any discrepancies to its customers, not themselves. Massively disappointing.","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

The bathroom had a great shower and very deep bath tub which was modern but I imagine a bit hard to get in and out of.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens luxurious.  They leave treats at night for the turn down service.  One night was home made rice crispy treats, the next night oatmeal cookies. They also left bottled water and fresh popped popcorn.

One night at Beauty and Essex which was fantastic and the next at a local sushi place which was good but someone limited in its menu.  Its not necessarily easy to get a cab first thing but there are Uber drivers nearby.  Good location if you have to be way downtown for work or pleasure.

We booked at the Ludlow a couple of blocks away for what was my 40th birthday trip. From the moment we arrived at the Ludlow we regretted it, it was cramped, the aircon was ridiculously loud and the bed was broken so that every time we moved in our sleep it creaked so badly it woke us both up. \n\nThe next day we called the Hotel On Rivington and, despite the Ludlow making a fairly half baked attempt at fixing the bed, we moved to Rivington for the remaining three nights. Ashleigh at reception was amazing. She booked us into a really high room and told us to come back for 4pm. The room wasn't quite ready so we sat in the lobby for about 20 mins drinking the free wine on offer. The concierge was v apologetic for the small wait and gave us vouchers for free drinks. \n\nWhen we got to the room, it was amazing. 18th floor with a balcony (although I was too much of a wimp to spend much time on it!) and the biggest, comfiest bed I have ever slept on. A bath big enough to do laps in and a shower with a glass wall. Hopefully there were no neighbours with binoculars opposite!  :-) Although the nearest block was really far away so if there wasn't much chance of that! There was a complementary bottle of wine waiting and some popcorn. \n\nI suppose if I had to find any negatives, the elevators and the entrance are looking a wee bit shabby. But how much time does one spend in a lift anyway?! \n\nDefinitely try to get a high floor - I've stayed in a lower one before which was lovely, but it's nice to have no one overlooking (which for showers with no frosted windows is quite useful!).\n\nThank you Hotel on Rivington for helping salvage the trip and making it a brilliant holiday!","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}
