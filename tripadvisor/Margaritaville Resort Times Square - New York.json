When we checked in we asked specifically about resort fees coming out of our security deposit, the member of staff said we had already paid this through the travel agency and nothing would be taken out of the security deposit other than for damages. When we checked out we were then charged the resort fees so I explained this situation to the woman at the check out desk. She checked our confirmation email through the travel agency and said that because it didn\u2019t confirm any resort fees and what we were previously told, we would get this refunded. The woman was on the phone to a manager at the time who confirmed this. We were then given an email address and invoice and told if we just emailed this across to the email provided it would be refunded. This was not communicated and I have been told that it will now not be refunded a week later when I am home in england and can\u2019t do anything about it. I called customer services who were useless and kept talking about the confirmation email rather than the fact 2 members of staff lied to us about $300 charged.

Great location and relatively quiet on 25th floor. Reception friendly on check in. Room clean and small. Ok for 2 of us. Bottled water replenished daily and room service kept room tidy and neat. \n\nAs previous reviewer, room was HOT! Set at 65, never got below 72 and even reached 76 at one point. After 2 nights of 4, we asked for assistance. Facilities called at 5 pm. We returned to the room and it felt colder, but the thermostats shut down with one touch and had to restart. Called front desk again at 11 pm. Sent facilities who said that he realized there was still a problem. Thermostat would take hours to change, 15 wires, and we needed to be out of the room. He also told us how he was inconvenienced because he was on his break. He told me that there is no fan option because it\u2019s a commercial thermostat and we could either have AC or heat, not both. He clearly did not know what he was talking about. Why wasn\u2019t it fixed during the 5 pm call? Ticket entered for next day.\n\nOvernight, the thermostat shut off with a simple touch of up\/down arrow so asked for a ticket to be put in. Then, canceled because at least it was colder that night.\n\nOn our 4th and final night, same problem happened. No AC, set at 65, no cold air wouldn\u2019t go below 72. Very uncomfortable. \n\nHotel gave use a credit of one night\u2019s resort fee after telling us they\u2019d give us a night credit (not just resort fee). We left and didn\u2019t wait for the bill and assumed they\u2019d make the adjustment.\n\nNot enough security in the lobby too on lower level. I waited for pizza delivery and there was a homeless guy wreaking of weed completely stoned laying on the sofa. Thankfully, the delivery guy came fast so I didn\u2019t need to sit.\n\nWould stay here again but wary of room temperature.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

A few issues: (1) the outdoor pool was great but could be a bit warmer in the colder months (2) There is not a complete door on the shower so you have to be careful with the water (3) There were issues with the elevators and they often had problems with the digital screens working (4) You do not enter into the lobby, you enter into a small area were you get on an elevator. There should be staff person in the entrance to direct hotel guests and to ensure others are not coming into the hotel.

Maybe that is just NYC, but I expect better from a hotel chain like Sofitel. \n\nAnd the waiter at the restaurant was so rude. He barks at you for asking questions, and doesn\u2019t really answer it. The hotel menu doesn\u2019t have price. You eat anything for breakfast, and it is part of their $55 breakfast set that they don\u2019t tell you about, and $55 is no where on the menu! You find it out when you check out.\n\nAnd that is not the only thing. The taxes and fees are supposed to be included when you book through some travel sites, but this hotel charges additional fees and taxes close to $30 per night.\n\nThe decor is out dated, they don\u2019t even give you a bottle of water, maids make bed lopsided my bed was made in a way one side was about two inches higher than the other side!! Don\u2019t even know how you do that.\n\nAlso the hotel is dark. Really dark.

Highlight of my trip!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2024-03-30","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"I stayed here for two nights with my daughter for Spring Break. Was really looking forward to it based on the great reviews on TripAdvisor and it did not disappoint. I have already recommended this to friends and family and would really like to find an opportunity to stay in another Margaritaville Resort, or in this one again. \n\nPros:\n\n-Decor is great and everything is spotless. Very modern, clean and comfortable. Housekeeping services were fantastic. Super clean. Floor to ceiling windows and ceiling fans in rooms (why don\u2019t more places offer this?)  You can crack the window open if you want fresh air. \n\n-  there is security out front as you walk in. You need a key card to access the pool or any floors with rooms in the building. Once in the room there is a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d light or a \u201cplease clean my room\u201d you can put on if you want to. Rooms have two types of in-room locks.\n\n- Heated pool year round for guests only. During the off-season it\u2019s open 10AM-4PM. Between Memorial Day and Labor Day it\u2019s 8 AM to sunset. \n\n-walk to Penn station, walk to Broadway shows, subway immediately outside front door, location is fantastic. \n\n- all of the staff here, including the front desk, main lobby, in the coffee shop, gift shop, and both restaurants were excellent. Friendly and attentive, I can\u2019t say enough good things about those folks working here.  \n\n-Food and drink quality was really good and good value as well. You can order it to go and have it in your room, or have it delivered if you want as well.\n\n-Bed is super comfortable and bottled water is free. Rooms have mini fridge and coffee etc etc. \n\n-Smart TVs and you can text back and forth with the staff if you need anything. \n\nCons:\n\n-Yes the rooms are small. It\u2019s New York. The bathrooms could be more private (ours had no fan or any way to lock the door.) \n\n- Elevators are pretty slow. The building is tall and the four elevators - shared by the hotel and restaurants - have a hard time coping with lots of traffic. \n\n- the windows are supposedly soundproof. They are a lot better than most in NY but I\u2019m not sure about being completely \u201csoundproof.\u201d That being said, I slept well and the other guests were quiet.  \n\n-there is no option for in-room room service for breakfast. Nothing to pick up even until 11AM. There is a coffee shop with muffins etc but if you love having breakfast in bed, this isn\u2019t gonna happen here.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this place for folks visiting NYC for pleasure. It\u2019s so cute and fun and when you walk in from Times Square it feels like a respite. Hard to know where to stay in NYC but this is a really good option unless you want a room with a lot more space.  Book early, it does sell out!!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

At the roof top bar, there was nice view of the surrounding area. We tried to store our luggage a few days in advance before check-in, and the request was declined. When we checked in and during our stay, we didn't find the staff at the Reception particularly friendly nor helpful. We booked a deluxe quadruple room in March for Dec \/ Jan, but found the room really small and expensive. There were other alternatives but we thought a quadruple room in a relatively new hotel close to Times Square will be a good idea. The hotel and rooms were decorated like a beach resort. Our room cannot see Times Square but had good view of The Edge. As the hotel was pretty new, the beds were really comfortable. We each got our own luggage and only one suitcase can be opened at a time. There was no separate toiletry except the 3 bottles of shampoo, conditioner and soap attached to the wall of shower. The water pressure was weak, and it will stop for a few seconds in the middle of shower. There were 3 elevators but often there's a queue waiting to get up and it would take quite some time to get down in the morning. The speed of the Internet was average. The clock in the room was 15 mins early, and I can't find a way to set the time correctly, so I just unplugged it. I probably would find another hotel for my Times Square New Year eve countdown stay next time.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My wife has never been to New York before.  I just wanted her to have a great experience. This place did not disappoint. Each bar\/ restaurant has it's own experience. Great place for family and couples. The rooms are on the small side but  once you use the space in the rooms then you will be fine. We used the drawers and closet space. Then you have space on the  top shelf of the closet to put away the luggage. Then you have plenty room to move around the space. Very clean rooms and love the service of the hotel, staff are amazing.  You could just call the housekeeping to get towels or whatever you need. Highly recommend going to the Time Square location. It's literally close to everything except for a 45 minute walk to Central Park during Christmas time.   Great views especially from the 5 o'clock somewhere bar.  \nMargaritaville Resort please don't use that company again bad for business. \nSo we booked tickets to the New Year's Eve party at the 5 O'clock Somewhere Bar at $1000.00 USD each for a 21 years and over party and were so excited because we didn't want to go out on the street and wear adult diapers to see the ball drop.  Imagine our surprise when we got up to the 32nd floor and discovered children at the party that we specifically paid a lot of money not to see.  Pls don't think we don't like children, we just don't believe in drinking and partying in front of kids and when you pay that much money it is not freaking cool.  The food was okay, the bartenders were AMAZING!!!, the music was terrible and the DJ was yawning and completely not interested in the party the whole night.  It was over all very disappointing because we are Canadian and had to pay almost 3000.00 for this party that in our opinion sucked.  The best part was seeing the iconic ball drop so very well from our spot.  If we had to do it again we would have booked our stay at the Marquis for the ball drop stay and event.  Thumbs down for the over priced party that we thought would be the event of our lives.  It was truly a bucket list item...so sad!!!","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The dining options were fantastic and the waitstaff was excellent. The rooms were also very clean and equipped with a large TV. The location is ideal for tourists, as many landmarks are within walking distance.\n\nNegatives: The lobby is not located right at the entrance; you need to take an elevator to reach it. Once in the lobby, you will notice that it is quite small. Despite being advertised as a resort, it falls short of the expectations of someone who frequents resorts. The resort itself does not offer much to do apart from dining at the two restaurants. The small pool is closed during the winter. If you enjoy spending time in the lobby, you may find it lacking in seating and opportunities for people-watching or enjoying a coffee, unless you visit one of the restaurants.\n\nThe rooms were clean but on the smaller side, even for two people. It's advisable not to bring large luggage as it can hinder movement within the room. The beds, however, were comfortable and plush. The bathroom was small, and my biggest complaint was the shower. It was extremely cramped, and the open design caused water to spill onto the floor, resulting in a wet floor after showering. The hotel only provided two towels, so we had to use one as a mat to prevent slipping on the wet floor. There was also a lack of storage space for toiletries in the shower, which was inconvenient. On a positive note, the view from the room was beautiful thanks to the floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\nWhile I did like the resort, as someone who frequently stays in New York, I wouldn't choose to return to this particular hotel. Other hotels offer more spacious accommodations and a wider range of amenities to enjoy within the hotel.\n\nOverall, it is not a bad hotel by any means, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a return visit, especially considering my expectation of a resort-like experience.\n","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

With that being said, Margaritaville Times Square was a perfect fit for us.  We stayed on the 16th floor and had easy access with the elevators and never needed to wait too long.  We were greeted by security every time we left and returned.  They helped us reserve there transportation back to the Newark airport for $95.  The front desk was very helpful and I\u2019d like to say both Jhona and Kevin helped us with a few things we needed during our stay.  ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The fitness center is small and a bit outdated, but has the basic amenities. The only downside of this hotel are the elevators.

I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review but I have to with 4, especially in view of the last days of our trip. What we look for is clean,clean rooms so decor isn't of utmost importance. This resort is spotless and well-kept. The decor was not to our liking and seemed out of place in NYC. The decor is really kitschy and almost cartoon-like. But it is hard to find a hotel this clean with incredible service for this price in NYC. It is very convenient to all transportation and walking. It kind of pops up out of nowhere as you walk by. The staff was amazing and helpful, always saying hello and offering any needed assistance. My only issue was the elevator situation. There was one elevator out of service the last two days of our trip and another one (of three) was working intermittantly. This made for long, long waits even to the hotel check-in\/restaurant area on the 7th floor. I think at one point one of the employees was in the working elevator, over-riding the system so that one would work, and getting it to the floors requested.  The beds were comfortable and the TV was huge. The floor to ceiling windows made for a nice view of the street and surrounding area. There was a small cafe for coffee (though if you wanted, Paris Baguette was across the street and Angelina's and Best Bagel were a few blocks down). The shower was a bit wonky in that the water in the shower and sink just totally stopped inexplicably to start a second or two later and this happened at least 3 times. Not a big deal, just curious and wondering if it had to do with restroom use by the next door unit.  The room was well-thought out for use with plenty of storage for clothes and cubbies for the luggage. Good sized bathroom, even though I am not a fan of new-style doorless showers.  Overall an excellent experience and I would truly recommend this location for price\/cleanliness and staff. ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Margaritaville Resort Times Square is the best Times Square hotel for it's amazing location, vibe and amenities.  This hotel opened a few years ago but still looks brand new and has been well maintained and \nimmaculately clean every time we come.   The vibe is bright, fun and safe.  \n      This is one of the few hotels in Manhattan that has an outdoor pool.  It's heated year round, and front staff can confirm the hours, but it usually matches daylight or working hours.   The pool itself is small, but space in NY is at a premium so this is understandable.  You should be aware there is a daily resort fee at the hotel which covers not only the cost of your access to the pool (whether you use it or not) but also the complimentary unlimited bottled water on site, which was a huge benefit to us.  We can't haul a case of bottled water to our room, we don't want to waste precious time in NY doing errands buying water to bring back to the hotel every night, and if you buy bottled water or drinks from outside, which you can do, you'll see the price of everything in midtown is $$$$.  \n      The location near Times Square can not be beat.  You're literally 2 short blocks away from Time's Square itself, and some top level rooms at the right location have a small view of the crystal ball that drops on NYE.   There is  immediate access to multiple main subway lines just outside the hotel,  and ones near Bryant Park a 3 min walk away, so it's very fast and easy to head uptown or downtown, including to Macy's Herald Square, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, etc.   There are a few amazing, affordable iconic NY food options nearby, even though midtown has few good food options. \nCheck out the famous John's pizza around the block (lines are long, but move fast if you avoid peak dinner time, Los Tacos No.1 (standup affordable Mexican tacos) and of course, home of the original NY cheesecake, Junior's, which also has great corned beef\/pastrami reuben sandwiches and matzo ball soup.  Try their disco potato pancake - it's like nachos on a potato pancake base. \n     The best part of this hotel is the staff.  Service is always reliable, thoughtful and consistent.  This was our 3rd stay in the past 13 months, and every time check in, check out, and every other request or question has  been handled so quickly, professionally and with friendly staff.   We want to especially recognize a few people who stood out for their assistance, though the whole team has been great.   Kal Sang really helped us avoid a disaster on the last day when it seemed our car service to take us to the airport had a mixup and didn't arrive.  He contacted them immediately, explained the situation, stayed on the phone and kept asking until he was certain they were sending a car right away.   It was only 10 minutes for the new car to arrive and he stayed with us and called the driver during the whole wait,  mark to make sure they really were coming and not just saying that.  When the car arrived, he even went the extra mile of walking us to the vehicle and helping ensure our luggage was all accounted for and loaded.  We really felt taken care of.   Earlier in the week Kal Sang, along with Jhona, who was also very friendly and helpful, located a package we had delivered to the hotel a day before we arrived.   We also owe a big thank you to Mr. Sharma, the manager, who, during our second and third visit, welcomed us and helped us with our reservations.  This trip he helped us find a room on a Saturday night, as that seems to be the most popular night that sells out the fastest.   \n      \n      ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

For the $57 we got one toilet roll per day (when we ran out we had to ask for extra) one tiny bar of soap and 2 bottles of water for a family of 4 and 4 coffee pods per day. I couldn\u2019t get hot water anywhere for a cup of tea and I couldn\u2019t even buy a cup of hot tea from the landshark bar as they didn\u2019t have any left, had to go to the Paris Baguette bakery across the road for tea (Paris baguette is fab) Sheets and towels were changed every day but were often threadbare and some sheets had holes, no fancy cushions on the bed like the picture, no robes or slippers as advertised. Broken tiles on the shower wall and scuffed and chipped bathroom vanity unit. Sockets awkwardly located and the hairdryer provided had a short wire so you couldn\u2019t dry your hair in front of the mirror. Rooms are relatively quiet (but not 100% sound proof) you could still hear a hum from the street and the air con was quite noisy when it kicked in so you may want to take some ear plugs. You could also hear people talking in the corridor and closing their doors. Don\u2019t pick up the phone in the room I was on maybe 10 seconds asking for an iron and it cost $10! Location is good for a first visit as it is super central. We felt safe in the hotel but in terms of security I felt it was to easy for the public to gain access to guest floors as they used the same lift to get to the bars and could easily exit on a guest floor  if they wanted to if a guest was using the lift with their access card at the same time. NYPD often parked or stood outside of the entrance to the hotel, got to ask yourself why! A few CBD shops very close by so you could smell a lot of cannabis outside of the building. Pool was tiny and looked so much bigger on the website. The girl was falling asleep at the checkout in the Margaritaville shop, she didn't look best pleased when I disturbed her to buy a T-shirt. We were given 2x 2 for one drinks vouchers but they could only be used in the bar which the kids weren\u2019t allowed in so this was useless and not family friendly. NYC is amazing and we will definitely be back but would stay somewhere else as we felt a bit ripped off. ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Kevin, Nathan, and Michelle processed my entry efficiently, provided clarity regarding the hotel's amenities, and actively sought questions.\n\nThe room... was small. Spotlessly clean, with a comfortable bed, a desk area with a HUGE TV over it, and a small kitchen area with a fridge and coffee maker... but small. Just like every other room in Manhattan. The bathroom had a sink, a toilet, and a shower: no tub. I looked up apartments in mid-town and found several just about the same size going for thousands per month. Because, you know what? The thing here is location. Location, location, location.\n\nMargaritaville's on the very tail end of Times Square. If you're into national chain restaurants with huge neon signs, the square's off to the north. If you're looking for \"real New York,\" it's 100' south of the front door. Night one, I crossed the street to a nook I could see from my window: Empanada Mama. I thought that it was Fantastic. And the \"real New York\" around the hotel's full of places like that.\n\nAnd if you're looking to get to more of \"real\" New York, tour busses pick right at the street corner, and the hotel's on top of the subway's Times Square station. Almost anywhere in Manhattan was only 20 minutes away via the MTA.\n\nIf you're not looking to wander, the Hotel also has its own restaurant. I found it a bit loud for my taste, but if you're fine with bright lights and ever-present party music, then by all means, enjoy. Because the food was fantastic. A little on the spendy side, but fantastic.\n\nOr, if you're just looking for drinks, there are two large bars in the place. A two-level bar on the rooftop, with spectacular views of Mid-town and Times Square, and a single-level bar on the pool level. The rooftop bar's more \"velvet rope,\" (Martinis and Slinky dresses) and the pool bar's more \"relaxin' in the sand,\" (Coronas and flip flops).\n\nThe pool... it's advertised as heated, but it was definitely not when I swam in it. It was 60-ish degrees out and it had been raining on and off all day. Maybe the heater couldn't keep up with the weather. That was really the only thing about the place that didn't come off as advertised. The only thing. \n\nRoom was full of lights, the gap under the door that allowed hallway sounds into the room was easily blocked with pillows, the curtains were blackout level when the sun was a little too much coming through the wall of glass (yeah, window stretches the width of the room, from floor to ceiling. Seriously spectacular views from the room), internet access was easy and fast... There was a button on the wall that you could hit to let the housekeeping staff know whether you wanted service or not. ... I'd have to rate this near the top of my many, many hotel experiences.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

They are not related at all, just by name.  We also wanted to be right in the middle of all of the action.  We did enjoy our stay!  The beds are very comfortable!!!  The products included for the shower smell so nice!  This is a great idea as you don't have extra weight in your luggage for shampoo, conditioner and body wash - I love this idea of it being provided.\nThe room was very small, alittle claustraphobic but if you want more room you have to pay more money.  Being from Canada we paid alot for 4 nights in this small room so there was nothing else we could do but pay more $$ for more room and we didn't want to do that.  There wasn't anywhere for me to put my suitcase but on the floor when looking for something to wear.  \nWe were a couple of blocks away from a Broadway show so it was nice to be so close.  \nWe only went to the restaurant once, I agree with someone else that posted a review that the large Lady Liberty holding the margarita glass was so cool!  Service was ok, had to flag the server down for the bill but she seemed quite busy and I think she was working alone.\nThe pool.......although wonderful to have after a long day of walking everywhere, there was never anywhere to sit.  People grab a bed so early in the morning and don't move all day.  Who comes to New York to sit at a pool? LOL.  \nWe did order room service one night and it was really good!  It was hot and although it was just chicken quesadilla for me, they were stuffed with chicken so you really got your money's worth!\nI found the bartenders in the bars to be ok, not overly friendly mind you they seemed to be on their own working as well and it was busy.\nI also agree with a previous reviewer about the elevator.  Having to swipe your card to get on the elevator is a safety thing but pls mention it to people as no one knew why they couldn't choose their floor.  The elevators are really slow and there was 4 of them on our floor 17!\nAll in all we enjoyed our stay!  \n\n","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Tiffany, Will and everyone else at checking in were super welcoming, very friendly and very attentive. \n\n  The room I was booked in was super clean and very quiet. Although, it was a bit small, considering that I still had a bit more work to due on my costumes before my show, but the view and how clean it was made up for this fact. And if you are in NYC, you do not really need a big room. I loved the fact that I was given free water and a robe. I also loved that the mini fridge was empty and I could put my food in without worrying about a mini bar charge for moving items like some other hotels do. \n\n  The bathroom was very clean & awesome. It had super spa like towels and products that were in a big bottles so it was much better for the environment. The shower was a big walk in with no shower curtain to hit you while you shower, which also felt much cleaner and spa like then the usual hotel shower bath set ups, that you normally come across.\n\n  The pool service, food and drinks at the pool were also perfect, such as the pool servers were very attentive and just knew when I needed another drink or more snacks. I was traveling solo for a show I was making costumes for and it was my first solo hotel trip since pre-Covid and I felt very safe staying here as a traveling solo woman with the security and attentive staff in place. They could use more seating at the pool along with live plants, tho. \n\n  The security and bell staff were also super with giving me advice and directions and hauling cabs for me super quick. \n\n  It really was a nice tropical beach vibe, high above the noise and bustle of Times Square. I really felt like I was on a tropical resort island in a city. It was super relaxing to come home to this hotel, after a busy NYC nightlife show to a quiet and clean room. \n\n  Also the location was perfect for me to walk to the wholesale fabric stores and other points of interest.\n\n  Thanks Margaritaville Resort Times Square, I will def be back.

Landshark is fine and decently priced for hanging out by the pool-type food. There are two downsides - 1) for us personally the location in the middle of times square is a negative, but we stay to take advantage of the pool, one of the few kid-friendly outdoor hotel pools in NYC  2) the elevators - they get packed during peak times (usually around showtimes as lots of theatergoers stay there). Plan ahead and expect to have to wait to get on the elevator during those times. The rooms are tiny, but it's NYC. They are very clean however.

A dark roast, medium roast, decaf and, yuk, vanilla. I am a coffee snob and really don\u2019t like flavored coffee:)\nSuper cool electronic service\/privacy lights to alert the staff. No annoying things to hang on the handle that keep falling off and when you return you can see that service has been done because the green light requesting service is now white. No derby is a red light. \n\nThere are a ton of people pouring in and out going to the 6 restaurants\/bars in the property.

But despite that, we very much enjoyed this place and I don\u00b4t think we could have chosen a better spot. Would definitely stay again. ","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":23462501,"title":"One of the Best (if not *the* best) Staff Experiences I've Ever Had","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-07-17","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"My sister & I recently stayed at the Margaritaville Resort for 3 nights. It was such a positive, wonderful experience!!\n\nThe property was conveniently located, being situated just down the street from Times Square and numerous shops\/restaurants, including the Hard Rock Cafe and Hershey World. Plus, there was a subway stop right outside the hotel...something I failed to notice when we *first * arrived in NY, and instead, just walked from Moynihan Train Hall. Hah hah!! (I don't think my sister was amused.)\n\nI'm a sucker tor themed venues, and I thought the decor of the resort fit in nicely, without being too overwhelming. The room was a little small, but I personally found it more cozy & quaint, rather than claustrophobic. I admit, I was a little surprised that the windows had no screens on them, but they only opened just enough to have a small breeze waft through. Certainly not enough to fall out (which is always a good thing!!). City noise was not really a problem for us, as the windows seemed to block out most of the noise. The bed was soooooooooooo soft, to the point where I could have easily just stayed in all day. \n\nWhen we first walked in, the TV screen was on, displaying a welcome message with my name in it. I found that quite charming!! (I loved that little personalized touch!!)\n\nI regret that we did not get to visit all the different food\/drink spots, but with at least ::thinks for a moment:: 4 (?) options, it was quite a selection. We ended up eating dinner one night at the Margaritaville restaurant, and the food was excellent. My sister ordered the jambalaya, while I had a club sandwich. Portion size was just right, and I didn't feel like I was being short-changed. Our server was Aaron I believe, and he was polite & attentive to our needs. For 2 margaritas & 2 entrees, the bill came to about $78-$80, which I found reasonable. \n\nThe pool wasn't excessively big, but I found it just big enough that I didn't feel crowded with other people in it. One of the pool rules was that only 18 people were allowed in at a time, which I had never seen before. However!! It seemed to make sense, so I didn't have a problem with that. There was a moment when I tried to open one of the umbrellas, and didn't really know what I was doing (haha). The lifeguard on duty was kind enough to come over, and do it for me. (I'm sorry; I didn't catch his name!! If it helps, this was Sunday the 9th.)\n\nWhat I truly loved here was the customer service. The employees were all so nice and personable, and it really made me happy. Whenever we went out for the day, the employee(s) standing by the door always wished us a good day. My sister and I were also going out Sunday the 9th, and there was an employee standing at the desk on the 2nd floor, outside the restaurant. We're from MA, and I was wearing a Johnny Cupcakes (clothing\/t-shirt brand from MA) shirt. The employee noticed, and said that he had worn Johnny Cupcakes shirts ever since high school!! I thought that was so cool!! (Another instance where I failed to get the employee's name, and I regret that we didn't stay to talk with him longer.)\n\nAnd then there was Michael in the retail store on the 1st floor. (Michael, if this is not in fact your name, I sincerely apologize, but I'm pretty sure it *was* Michael!! Hah hah!!) The 3 of us - Michael, my sister, and I - wound up discussing horror movies for a good 10 minutes or so!! Another really cool moment!! He was so down to earth, and easy to talk to. On top of that, he gave us a great deal on our purchases, really just cementing the experience. \n\nAt the resort desk were Ismar, Damian, and Jhona. They made sure to explain each of the charges, and handled our transactions quickly & efficiently. Upon checkout, they even asked if we wanted to have our luggage stored until we left. All of these personal touches & connections made me feel so happy, and I really appreciated how much effort they put into making their guests feel welcome. \n\nNow, if I had to provide a *slight* drawback, it would be the elevators. There are only 4 of them, and not all of them were accessible during our trip. One of them, I believe, specifically only goes to certain floors. (I think that one was only accessible to floors #6-33.). A few times, there would be a small group of people waiting for the elevators, and if you had your luggage with you on top of that, it could get crowded. Once you got *on* the elevator, it could *still* be crowed, what with all the people that had been waiting. If all else fails though, there are fire stairs, which my sister & I used a few times. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience. Any minor frustrations I may have had with the elevators, was nothing compared to the excellent resort staff. Thank you all so much for a lovely stay. (If I incorrectly identified anyone, or misspelled their names, I sincerely apologize!!) ","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

How this could be such a well reviewed property is beyond me. \n\n#1 Few elevators mean long waits, with the crowd that assembles. And since the ice is on 7 (the most congested floor, the lobby), I was on 27. That would have meant a least a half hour journey. Never mind. \n#2 The rooms are 1\/2 size. Cute, but cramped. \n#3 The Land Shark Bar and Restaurant was seriously lacking in customer service. Finally appealed to the bar to order. A waitress was sent. To be fair, we got served. Slowly, cold food. And then had to track down our ticket at the bar, again. Mediocre food. \n#4 That much vaunted heated pool is only open 10-4. Not sure if that\u2019s about keeping the Happy Hour crowd out, but maybe putting the pool in the bar keeps it from it\u2019s intended purpose. \n#5 A $57\/day resort fee just feels like more gouging. \n\nWe checked out before noon the next day, and wheeled over to another property, with spacious rooms and speedy elevators. Margaritaville is about decor and hype. Certainly, it\u2019s not about value and service, though the staff do seem a friendly bunch. \n\nI guess it depends what you\u2019re looking for.

I wanted to stay in Manhattan since deciding  to  visit the SUMMIT Observation deck and having dinner at the Brooklyn Chop House..\n\n I went online looking for a hotel and somehow I came across of Margaritaville Times Square,  I also looked up videos on YouTube, and   loved the pictures I seen it reminded me of a cruise ship in a building , which I have not cruised since 2019, since a lot these activities was shut down, or limited. \n\n The day of my Birthday I got to the Hotel  very early so a room was not  ready , which was not a problem due to being 3 hours early before check in. The young man at the front desk clerk Troy was very polite, I killed time  walking around Times Square., Troy called left a message stating that a room was ready. When I got  back to the hotel , I was surprised with a room upgrade.\n\nI was so excited I had a suite 1602 it was the beginning to a wonderful Birthday night in Manhattan. The  Suite was amazing I had a great view of Times Square. The bathroom was spacious of course due  to it being a suite and I made sure take advantage of the space I had , the suite had 2 big TV's , the shower was great I had to figure it out to use due to water coming from the rain shower head or regular shower attachment , water was nice and hot.\n\n The bed was comfortable I fallen a sleep right away ,and probably being up early for the trip , I had lots pillows and a nice big comforter, I did have a good night sleep.  The only negative thing was I really didn't have time to explore the hotel as I would've like to due my other engagements.\n\n  The location of the hotel to subway system is perfect right down the block and Times Square main area 2 more blocks over. I would highly recommend this location anyone looking  to stay in Manhattan especially in that area , I didn't find it to be noisy from my room I actually did not hear any outside noise from my room that was a plus.\n\nI most definitely would stay here again, I would say again this year or make it a Birthday spot if I don't leave New York for that day..  I  Thank Troy and Margaritaville for making my 50th Birthday extra special.   \n\n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

In addition to the convenient location to Broadway shows, you get room service, an in-room safe, a great restaurant in the hotel, and a mini fridge. Plus, all the fun theme touches throughout the resort make the hotel seem like part of the vacation rather than just a place to sleep. The staff was super friendly and very responsive if we called them with a question. There was always someone to greet us when we came or went, asking how our day had been or if we needed help with directions or a cab. It made it truly feel like a home away from home where someone was looking out for you. As in most hotels in NYC, we would have loved more counter space and more space to move around in our room. But this place is a bargain, and we were very comfortable and happy with our comfy bed, our view of Times Square, and all this place had to offer. Wish I was back there now.

No surprise that the hotel was, again, fully booked.  Therefore,  my room was not yet ready. The check in area in the lobby was quite busy. But, no matter what was going on, the employees had a smile on their faces and greeted all of the guests in the most friendly manner. The first employees that I encountered were William and Ciera at the front desk. No matter how many questions I had for William, he kindly responded to all of them. Kevin was there to take my bags and store them for when my room would be ready. After walking around the City and enjoying some lunch, I came back to sit outside on the spacious terrace to wait for the call that my room was ready. I did not notice that my phone rang but that did not matter since Ciera came outside looking for me to let me know. I really appreciated that. She gave me my room keys and all of the information that I needed for my stay. Before I could get up from my seat to go inside and retrieve my bags, Kevin had already brought them out to me. Not only was he kind and friendly but he had a number of suggestions for me on how to make the most of my stay.\nMy room was a corner room on the 24th floor. It had a king sized bed, large and clear flat screen television and amazing City views from two sides of the room. Everything in the room was in perfect order and was spotless. I had some questions before turning in for the night. I called the front desk and was connected to Payton. She was so quick to answer my questions and was very helpful in the most genuine way.\nI also must mention that every time I entered or left the hotel property, there was at least one employee who greeted me and made me feel special.\nI would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!!

It's sort of like booking a hotel on Bourbon Street. You worry about noise and being in party central. When it also goes by the name Margaritaville, you expect Parrothead paraphenalia and over the top kitsch. What I actually got was a hotel room that while not huge, was very good sized by New York standards, was quiet and relatively well sound-insulated, clean, tastefully decorated, well-appointed, and affordable.  The hotel staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful and the restaurant food was not bad at all and not particularly overpriced considering the location.  Yes, the restaurants were kind of kitschy (but not as much as I had feared) and a bit loud. But, honestly, even there the place pleasantly exceeded my expectations. In fact, the only sour spot of the whole trip (apart from slow elevators, not uncommon in NY) is that they offer\/recommend online checkout but the way the items are listed on the folio make it impossible to reconcile them against your visit. For example, breakfast in one restaurant is listed as dinner and cocktails in another. And the staff at the front desk do not have access to the information to clear up the confusion. Bottom line, I don't think they overcharged me, I just think their bookkeeping software is a disaster. On the good side, when they couldn't reconcile the bill against my actual meals, they just waived the resort fees and I probably came out the winner although all I really wanted was to make sure I was paying only for what I actually ordered.  I hope they will fix this glitch because honestly it was the only thing that did not exceed expectations and I would think also a relatively easy fix if management will realize they have a problem.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Times Sq subway is outside it, the main coach station (Port Authority):is a block away, and Penn Railway Station is a 5 minutes walk away. You do not need a taxi or shuttle bus to get here. Public Transport is great to get here to. \n\nThe hotel itself has good points and bad points. The lobby is a bizarre setup, is on the 7th floor. So if there is no one to help you at the entrance, it is confusing.  Once in the staff are very helpful.  They are good at helping you and the hotel itself is very nice, very clean and the views are excellent if you are on the front or sides. We had 2 rooms and 911s view is of the rather scruffy rear of hotel.  If all 11 number rooms are similar, I'd recommend you avoid. I had a room ending 06 which was much better. Facilities are all very good, hotel has a swimming pool which 8s a great touch, and the restaurant is excellent as well.  Though I'd avoid the Jambalaya. It was not what I expected at all. \nThe biggest negative about the hotel are the lifts\/elevators. They are seemingly random in how quickly they get to you and anyone on the lower floors like 9,10,11, can expect not to get in them as they will be full. One of the lifts does t even go to the main entrance which bizarre.  It only goes up from floor 7! The cleaning staff also use these lifts as well with their own separate entrances and are prone to holding them in place, I overhead one member of staff telling someone on the walkie talkie not to hold the lift, as she clearly saw many of us getting frustrated at the lifts not coming. \n\nLocation wise it's great, but the place stinks of weed now because the cannabis shops are proliferating, and the amount of people with severe mental health issues is worrying and sad.

Do pay for upgrade to a corner room if they have one open. We had windows on two walls. Just amazing. The room and bathroom are new and super clean! I love how they make a NYC hotel room (that aren\u2019t known for being large) feel large. Great use of design and space. We had multiple large suitcases, as we stayed for a week. There was a great area of storage above a small closet area for my husband to put his. Anyway, small details did not go unnoticed. I also wanted to specifically recognize a couple of staff that were wonderful; Ciera W (front office manager) and Darren (head of security, I believe). We had a slight misunderstanding. I thought some items had been taken from our room, however, it turned out my husband had packed them the night before in our suitcase and forgot. Anyway, We called down to the front desk to report missing items, the staff response was amazing. They were detailed and understanding. Turns out, 5 minutes after they left, we found the items. Let me just say, I felt like a huge idiot. I apologized and of course let them know immediately that it was our mistake. They were so professional and understanding of the situation and did not make me feel stupid in anyway. Though, I did a great job of that myself. Anyway, they assured us that every person that enters our room has an associated card with only their name. They had cameras in all hallways. They would have found easily, if anyone took an item from our room and were more than willing to go through all of the footage.  We are so happy that it was our mistake. I felt terrible and made sure to leave our house keeping staff a generous tip (which, you can do electronically via Venmo , PayPal, etc). So easy. We will most definitely send friends here as well as stay here again ourselves. We loved the food and the pool, they do heat it, although I\u2019m from the south and it was still a bit too chilly outside for me to swim. We did have lunch over-looking the pool and it was wonderful. The roof top bar is well worth the view!! We went up several times and even invited a friend up with us that was in town on business. He was very impressed as well (from Europe). Great location, beautiful rooms, super friendly staff. There are multiple places to eat really close. We ate at a sushi restaurant for take out multiple times that was just across the stress. Also, Paris Baguette bakery had wonderful deserts and didn\u2019t close until around 10pm, which was a nice treat after a show. We had breakfast a Lenwich sandwich shop that is also across the street, I do recommend the sunny side up breakfast sandwich bagel! The Harry Potter show is only a couple blocks walk away.

The floor to ceiling windows offered an amazing views.  The room was very clean, decorated beautifully, with a good floor plan. There was a mini fridge, safe, and closet area for storage.  My only complaint would be the shower and lack of a door\/shower curtain, it was almost impossible to keep the bathroom floor dry. Stayed on the 27 floor, never had an issue with waiting for elevators, however, there are some funky rules on which elevators take you up to the rooftop bars from certain floors, also completely understandable since this is a hotel in times square and you don't want people walking in off the street. I did like that there were police officers outside the hotel door. Roof top bar had spectacular views and awesome drinks. The woman that was bartending (I don't know her name) made one of the best espresso martinis I've had and made my top 5 of the eastern seaboard list. She also made some other custom cocktails for me and my husband that was excellent.  We didn't really eat at the restaurants other than a quick stop for nachos on the 6th floor hotel dining spot on our way to catch the train, they were good but arrived a little cold.  The License to chill bar in lobby was also a good spot for a quick drink but I recommend the 31st floor rooftop (or 32nd when open). Pool was nice, too cold to take advantage of it but there were chairs and towels available. Entrance was thru the restaurant which I thought was odd.  Centerally located, was able to walk to area attractions and Penn Station. There are a few bagel spots on 40th around the corner from the hotel to grab a quick breakfast, as well as a coffee spot in the lobby. Loved the beachy theme in the city, took you away from the hustle and bustle of the streets. Will definitely be back next time we are in the city overnight.

Enjoyed the Landshark bar as well as the rooftop with excellent views. Great location in the theatre district and a short walk from Penn Station. The Deluxe King room was comfortable. The view appears to be the only difference from a standard room and probably not worth the extra cost. Didn\u2019t like the bathroom; a barn door is not ideal when so close to the bed, the shower half partition leads to some flooding and the water temp was usually cold or scorching hot. It appeared that only 2 of the 4 elevators were working so there was often a significant wait.

The upgrade us to the 28th floor, nice view although it was south, north would have been better. First thing the 11 year old grandson did was scared me to death by opening the window, thank god it was designed not to open enough to be unsafe. Everyone at the desk were excellent, they have a small coffee snack bar in the lobby that we used for breakfast and we have early reservations for museums  both days we were there. They gave us a couple for free drink tickets for the Landshark bar, saved us $25 or so.\n\nThey stored our bags the last day so we did not have to deal with taking them to the train station in the morning, so we were able to tour, then pick them up on the way to the train. \n\nOne night I went down to get a soda, snack bar was closed but the front desk said they could take care of it, when I only got one soda, the desk person said , just take it, it's on us!\n\nRoom was small, but usual for NYC, was clean, and the maid service was performed  without request.

Just an FYI, when a lot of folks are checking-in there can be a bit of wait for one of the elevators. That's not a negative; just a reality., so plan accordingly if you're on a time schedule.

We were able to get BOGO tickets for the Lion King! We also got BOGO tickets to the 911 Museum and the Observatory at One World Trade Center!!  We planned to visit a few places, but we never would've been able to get all three attractions in at the discounted price we paid!!  Thank you to Ciera at the Main Desk for that excellent information!\nThe rooms are cozy and comfortable and most importanly, clean!!!  The beds and pillows are amazing!  Breakfast was delicious! We surely didnt feel like we were in Times Square!!  Next time I will bring my suit to have a drink by the rooftop pool (open year round).  I could go on about how wonderful our visit with our Grandaughter (who brought us up to the rooftop bar!!!)  was!!  We will be back Margartitaville!!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The property features 234 rooms, 5 restaurant and bars, a year round outdoor heated pool, a fitness centre and a retail store. It is a hop-skip-and-a-jump from attractions the likes of Broadway, Central Park and the Empire State Building.\n\nI enjoyed my premium king suite with floor to ceiling windows and separate living area with spacious footprint. Design touches included a seaside colour palate and sound proof windows to deafen the noise of NYC. The chamber was well endowed with high-tech room appliances and the bathroom was equipped with a walk-in rain shower.\n\nThe Margaritaville Restaurant features NYC largest Tiki Bar and a 32 foot replica of The Statue of Liberty holding a Margarita instead of a torch......a bit of an attraction as well as an eatery. Joe's Merchant Coffee and Provisions provides a quick bite or coffee on the go. The other venues : LandShark Bar & Grill, License to Chill Bar and 5 o'clock Somewhere Bar are heavy on the bar scene.......to pump out all those Margarita's.\n\nSo, if you desire a getaway from the city when in the city (NYC),....... then try the............

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":23462501,"title":"Many pros but a few cons that took off a star","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-01-31","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"So I'll cut to the chase. Just came back from spending two nights at the Margaritaville Resort. I should mention that I was a solo traveler. Here is the rundown:\n\nPROS:\n\nLOCATION: Fantastic!! Really at the heart of it all but not smack in the middle of Times Square but pretty much a few feet away. I could see the NY Eve Ball from my window. Went to see two Broadway shows, The Lion King and the Phantom of the Opera. Both about a 5min walk. Also super close to the restaurants I was going to.\n\nHOTEL: Very clean upon entering hotel. Cool theme throughout. Love the Jimmy  Buffet vibe.  Front desk staff polite. Cool elevator. You use your key to use the elevator. Has a big flatscreen monitor inside of it showing video clips of beach and ocean scenes. I didn't eat in any of the restaurants but the bar makes a mean Margarita which I really enjoyed. Really cool giant Statue of Liberty in the restaurant. The rooftop bar has an amazing view of the city. There is wonderful seating outside (no fireplace or heat source outside so it was a bit cold).\n\nROOM: Ultra clean. Very small but personally I am not a chain hotel fan which have bigger rooms. Very comfortable and cozy. This was so beautifully appointed. So wonderfully decorated. Floor to ceiling windows. Flat Screen TV where you can use your own Netflix, Hulu etc account if you want. Kuerig Machine, Fridge, Safe. The bed was soooo comfortable. I could have stayed all day in that bed. Wow. Most comfortable bed I have ever slept in at a hotel. \n\nPRICE: Reasonable but be aware of the charges they impose on you. I was expecting the resort fee of $49 per day  but then they held $300 on my credit card for incidentals. When you check out the money gets credited back to your bank but they said it depends how it works with your bank (can take 3 days to 7 days).  That was a bit frustrating. When you check in you get two free drinks per day during happy hour. I was busy every day so I wasn't in the hotel during that time but I am sure it was a great perk! You also get two free water bottles in your room per day.\n\nCONS:\nSo for me it wasn't a good fit. I am in my late 50's (although I feel and act more like I am in my 40's). They made me feel my age by the way they were talking to me. The crowd that I saw staying at the hotel were mostly young people.  There was not really a doorman. There was a security guard and there was a guy at the door by the escalator going up to the restaurant but not a traditional doorman who greets you warmly when you come and when you leave.\n\nThere is no lobby to hang out in. Just a small sitting area when you entered. In fact, when I went upstairs just to sit at a table the was an empty area and the Manager asked me if I want to dine. I said that I just wanted to sit for a few minutes (I was looking something up on my phone). It felt awkward like I was not supposed to be there. But I really had no other place to hang out.\n\nSome cons about the room: The water pressure is pretty low. If you are looking for a  strong shower you are not going to get it. My shower at home is stronger than theirs. Also, there is no curtain or sliding door to close it. Its an open shower. Plus, its hard to go inside because you have to stretch in and adjust the water before going in other wise it will be cold.  The Keurig machine will only use their pods. You can not get hot water from there. It will only work if you have pods in.  Sooo if you are a tea drinker instead and you brought your own tea, you can not get hot water from it. I also brought my own instant cereal so I had to go to the restaurant just to get hot water. \n\nI tried using the casting to the TV app so I can watch the Prime Video I rented but it kept up freezing up even though it stated the app was supported.\n\nLastly, they don't really have a concierge which would be nice. I had asked the guy at the desk to help me find the right bus to the ferry terminal. He had no idea but the other front desk girl looked it up on her phone and was trying to help but to no avail. I ended up taking an Uber. \n\nAll in all, my stay was really nice. I think the room was the most redeeming quality (except for the whole Keurig thing)  but I think its more for a young party crowd than for families or people over 35.  Would recommend if bars are your thing.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":23462501,"title":"Reasonable centric hotel with a big flaw","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-01-28","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"First, let me start with the big flaw since this is a dangerous situation that management can do something about. If you look at the pictures I attached you will see how fire doors leading to the stairways are kept open all day. What's worse, those fire doors are the ones at the multiple restaurants\/kitchens that the resort has. So, you have the areas with the highest risks of fire (kitchens) not properly isolated from evacuation routes... ugh! Obviously, that violates fire codes and is illegal, but it is also very irresponsible no matter how you look at it. Please solve this ASAP.\n\nNow, we need to understand why this happens. Employees are not evil beings that just do that for no reason. There is a huge design flaw in the resort that causes this: elevators. This resort is a small hotel with 5 different floors dedicated to bars\/restaurants\/rooftops. The 4 small elevators (two of which do not serve all floors) are simply not enough for the vertical traffic of hotel guests, restaurant\/bar guests, and service. To make matters worse, those elevators are not well programmed. I won't get into the details, but you can easily be waiting for an elevator for 10 minutes while you can see them servicing higher or lower floors with no logic. In fact, management knows this and acknowledges it with a \"funny at first\" note saying that \"elevators operate on island time, be patient\". No, please solve your problem. Think a bit harder about how to manage elevators. And...\n\nSince I am very healthy, I am totally ok going up and down stairs, and I do that in many hotels. However, Margaritaville does not make that easy at all either. First off, the stairways are not well lit or have a nice vibe to it. One of the times I was using the stairs, I caught an employee literally with his pants down! Not really sure what he was doing, but I assume he was changing before or after work. In the stairs. You get the idea. And, then as mentioned, there is the open fire doors, and employees using them as service stairs since, obviously, they can't wait for elevators.\n\n----------------\n\nBesides that, the hotel is pretty reasonable. I would have given it 3.5 stars. It is very centric and located right in Times Square. Not my favorite part of Manhattan for sure, but a good place if you want to be near the \"action\", particularly in NYE's. You can even see the ball drop from outside the hotel, which is pretty unique.\n\nThe service was pretty good. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The first morning we did not have hot water in our shower (oops), but we got it fixed quickly after we reached out to room service.\n\nThe hotel is new and that is a plus. I worry that over time things are going to degrade since they don't seem built to the higher standards, but for now that should not be a big concern. We had the cold shower experience, and a room lamp fall down during our stay, which is a lot for a new hotel, but everything else was good.\n\nThe vibe is fun and weird. The island theme doesn't go very well with Times Square in the winter, but hey, that is the whole point. There is a lot of booze, and booze-loving clientele. I am fine with that, but you should be aware. Food is not great, but there are many other options around, so not a big deal.\n\nFinally, if you go for NYE's you have to be aware that the area gets REALLY crazy. The hotel management gives you a special pass, which is nothing but a printed page saying that you are a guest of the hotel. That piece of paper gets you in and out of the security area on New Year's, but it is still very crazy to do so. You have to go through long security lines and convince the policemen that your piece of paper is real (ours got completely wet from the rain and that turned out to be even harder LOL). But, the craziness of the area and the night is part of the experience, you should just be aware of what you are getting into. We paid for the resort celebration party, but had dinner elsewhere. Thanks god because the food we saw going around was very cheap quality. But, the ticket included open bar, and it was worth it. Also, the vibe was surprisingly good, with people of all ages and pretty good music.\n\nTo summarize, if you are the party-seeking, booze-loving, don't mind crazy, kind of person, this might be a good place for you as long as you are ok with long elevator wait times, and, of course, only after they fix the fire hazar situation.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

First of all-the people that work here, from the lobby staff, to the security, to the front desk, to the people in the Margaritaville Restaurant, and the housekeeping, AND the maintenance-ALL so nice!! They greet you when you go to walk in the building, they treated me and my kids like royalty the whole 4days!! First, they made sure to bring enough robes and slippers for all four of us, right away! Anytime we needed anything from housekeeping-they we\u2019re SO nice and came right away!! Our shower was cold the first night, and when I let the front desk know, they sent up someone in 4minutes, who not only fixed the hot water, but let us know, he was going to go up and raise the heat 5 more degrees after he left!-So amazing, and he did!!! The pool!!-my kids are crazy and wanted to swim even though it is January, and the lifeguard on January 1st ANd the lifeguard on the 2nd and 3rd, were very good to us!! They brought them towels without us asking, the lifeguard on Jan. 1st even told me about a good Italian restaurant, when we wanted to try NYC pizza! I am a smoker, so, I left the hotel many times to go smoke a cigarette-and every single time I left, the staff wished me a good venture and every single time I came back, even if 3minutes later, they welcomed me back! They were all nice to, and always acknowledged my kids!! The Manager at the restaurant, went above and beyond to try and feed me, when my meal wasn\u2019t the way I asked for it! The waitress took time to listen to my sons jokes!! The key lime pie was the best key lime pie I ever tasted-and key lime pie is my favorite, so I am picky!! Any staff we met was unbelievably kind! I stayed at The Manhattan in June, and , regrettably paid $500 a night-and not once the entire time, not even when I checked in, we\u2019re we welcomed, or even smiled at-and they let us stand there for 40 minutes before even helping us, when we didn\u2019t know where to go. The rooms were NOT beautiful like the ones at Margaritaville!! The windows were smaller, the view was nothing compared to this one!! They also did not have a roof top where you could see what you can see here! That reminds me!!-I went to the 7th floor, the 2nd day here, and asked if I could go out on the closed deck to try and see sunrise-they let me, and were so sweet about it!! Today, when we checked out, I told the staff I loved them haha, because I was just amazed at the experience we had, and how they treated us!!! We will be back, so many times!! We miss you already, and I look forward to it so much!!! Thank you for everything!!!!!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Location is great, lots of places to eat and sights to see nearby.  Walked to our Broadway show.  Area is very crowded during this time.  Staff was very friendly.  Restaurant was decent.  Rooms were quiet.  Elevators can get crowded.\n\nFor New Year's Eve, the police cordoned off the area to even get back to the hotel and it was a little tough to get back after exploring.  \n\nYou can see the ball drop from the top floor and from a little area in the 6th floor restaurant, maybe some of the NE corner rooms too.  They also have a pen right in front of the hotel that is dedicated for people associated with the businesses in that location and Margaritaville was the only business open during that time.  There are also general public pens in the street in front of the hotel that are fairly crowded, but you can't see the ball from the street pens unless you are in the first pen and Margaritaville customers can't get into those pens unless you go around.  The view is from the south side of the ball, so you can't see the entertainment and the crowd is not as crazy as it is north of the ball.  I only had to secure my spot about 30 minutes before the ball dropped.  For me it was a really good spot to watch the ball drop, since I couldn't handle standing for 6+ hours.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel is so cute with the beachy theme, and the turquoise\/coastal decor in the common areas and the rooms is so pretty. The hotel was all decorated for the holiday season too! Our deluxe room on Floor 23 was a nice size, and it was nice having a minifridge, bottled water, island-themed Keurig coffee, and floor-to-ceiling windows (with one window that can actually be cracked open for fresh air!). Nice-smelling shower gel, oversize towels, and rain shower in the bathroom too. We heard hardly any noise from the room. The elevators worked well during our stay, and I loved the TV monitors in them, showing beach scenes. \n\nWe got vouchers at check-in for one complimentary drink, which was just delicious. They also gave us a little box of chocolates and a small bottle of Prosecco as a complimentary gift for my mom's birthday, which was a wonderful touch. Breakfast in the 2nd floor restaurant was delicious (even if a bit pricey); shout out to Karen and Douglas on the waitstaff, who were incredibly friendly and wonderful! Kudos to one of the doormen as well (I didn't catch his name) - when he heard us mention we were going to hail a taxi, he offered to hail one for us since it was so unbelievably cold outside - he was so kind and friendly every time we saw him!

I see prices of $250-350 per night for those who book directly and at that price I would have had different (lower) expectations.\nAt any rate, it took a really long time to check in and they explained that they were trying to find us a \u201cnice\u201d room. So much of a delay that I actually turned to my husband and asked if he had secretly upgraded the booking to a nicer room and told them to keep it a surprise. (He hadn\u2019t LOL).\nThe other reviewers are correct when they say this is the smallest hotel room, even by Manhattan standards. The space is used efficiently but I would have very much liked more counter space in the bathroom. That was tiny. And there\u2019s no ironing board and iron so be aware you\u2019ll need to request that if needed. Other cons: the shower is glass paneled rather than a curtain (yay!) but they should have installed glass about 6-9\u201d longer than it is. Your bath mat will be soaking wet no matter how careful you are. Other reviews mention how slow the elevators are. Do not order your Uber until you are downstairs, and allow for 10-15 minutes at least between your room and the lobby. My last negative comment, if you\u2019re looking for a real Margaritaville experience, frozen drinks, etc. you won\u2019t find a pi\u00f1a colada or frozen margarita in the place. Bizarre for a brand that made millions selling machines that make frozen drinks.\nIronically I live in Florida but pi\u00f1a coladas are reserved for vacation because they are terrible for you! I had to go to NY to get declined for a tropical drink haha. The bartender on the lobby level was fantastic though, I wish I recalled his name because he\u2019s worth looking for. And we had a very bad experience the last evening when we wanted to take a look at one of the bars that was closed (even though it wasn\u2019t that late); we explained we just wanted to see it since we hadn\u2019t visited it during our trip but we didn\u2019t want to order anything. Even though there were still patrons in the bar they kept telling us they were closed, go to another bar in the hotel, come back tomorrow. It was really weird. I get wanting to be done with your shift but it was unnecessarily aggressive. Although I sound super negative, it was an OK hotel. We were there in December but if you\u2019re going during swimming weather, the other reviews which mention that the pool is much smaller than the pictures, are accurate. All in all the hotel was pretty clean, with a good fitness center, free bottled water in your room every day (that\u2019s so rare!!), reliable housekeeping (also getting kind of rare!), and floor to ceiling windows in room which did make it seem bigger. And we found the bed to be very comfy. It was convenient to have a bar on the rooftop too, with heaters on during colder weather, although we had to take the stairs up because the elevator was that slow. The location is convenient to several subway lines and Times Square. All in all I wouldn\u2019t stay there again but it was interesting to check it out for the weekend.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is central and the options for restaurants and bars are excellent in the property including two bars with outdoor access. The rooftop bar is very very cool, but the bartender was extremely rude and the wait was ridiculous, enough to make it not worth going. Now that said, if you want service and personality in spades go to the bar on Floor 7 and hang out with Louis! He is a delight in every sense of the word. Whether you are alone or with a group, hanging out with Louis will bring a smile to your face! Outside, plan to be greeted by about 5 of the most outgoing and sweetest staff members including Anthony & Robert. I genuinely looked forward to coming \"home\" knowing I would be greeted by enthusiastic smiles and kind words. There was a fire alarm at 2am one night, through no fault of the hotel's (a guest smoking as I understand) and the safety officer who handled the public address system did so with such professionalism. His message was prompt and calm and reassuring. All was well, and when the stay was this good, it was not actually an inconvenience. These things happen and frankly, the hotel's safety system did its job which gave me even more confidence. I am a member of another chain's loyalty program with a high status, but I will stay here and forgo those other points just to enjoy the experience any day. Having worked in hospitality I know that the staff can make or break the experience, and the team at Margaritaville Times Square definitely MAKES the experience excellent!!

We purposely chose this hotel because it has outdoor space, and we hoped to enjoy some drinks each night on the outdoor patios after our long days of sightseeing and Broadway shows. We're so glad we made the decision, even though we didn't get to take advantage of our outdoor time as much as we had hoped. Our first night, we were too pooped from a long day of sightseeing, so we chose bed instead of the bar. But we did relax on the 7th floor patio a couple of nights, enjoying wine and cheesecake after our Broadway shows. Overall, the hotel and hotel staff were great. But ... the elevators take forever! And the room -- although bright and beachy -- was very small. I guess that's common among NYC hotels, especially those near Times Square. Since we were there to see several Broadway shows, the location is vey convenient. Thankfully, you don't even hear the noise and chaos of Times Square once you're in the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel or take advantage of the pool or rooftop lounge, but I'd recommend this place if you appreciate outdoor space.

In weekend when the hotel is full - after 10 minutes wait for an elevator we used the stairs and were not the only ones.\n- Service issues. When we checked in - shampoo and soap dispensers were empty. Had to call house keeping. and it took 1.5 hours to send someone to fill it. 2nd day - coming back 5pm, room was not cleaned. Their answer that they clean checked-out rooms first. I understand that, but if you know the hotel is busy - you should get extra staff. After a whole day in Manhattan streets the last thing you want is to being asked to get out of the room to allow them to clean it. Never happened to me in any hotel in the past. \n- General attitude of the reception staff was that \"this is the how we work\". No appologies. Not showing any sign that they care. \n- While being extra quiet from the outside, the doors are slammed extremelly loud. When a neighboring room will return in the middle of the night to the room - you will wake up from their door slam. \n\nBottom line. If you're coming in an \"island mood\" - this is the hotel for you. Otherwise, especially over the weekend, there are better alternatives.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

She wasn\u2019t there when we arrived for a drink (taking four flights of stairs by the way, elevators would not take you up there even using the room card) we waited to be seated but she wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen, so my wife and daughter sat on a sofa while we went to take drinks etc. While paying for drinks this gem of unbelievable roughness marched to my wife and daughter and made them get up scolding them for not going through her to get a seat. Seriously? We left. Well done, you are a true embarrassment not only to the hotel but to your colleagues as well, clearly rolling eyes for your appalling behaviour. I attach a photo from my room, hoping she\u2019ll get the message.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

As soon as you walk through the doors on the street level and up to the lobby, you no longer feel like you are in NYC.  This is especially true when you are at the outdoor pool (which is rare in the city) with the music playing and drink service at your chair.  The property is beautiful and well maintained with alot of little details that highlight Jimmy's songs (loved the large flat screens in the elevators that play his songs and several videos of different beaches).  There are plenty of food and beverage options on property as well as a good fitness center.  \n\nHowever, what makes this resort so special is the staff.  Every single staff member we ran into was so polite, helpful and truly seemed to love being there.  Management put together an awesome team there and should really be happy at how they represent the property and brand.  After staying here, I now want to experience other Margaritaville resorts!\n\nAlthough this brand seems to cater to more of a party vibe, we didn't seem out of place with a 7 year old as we did see some other kids and they treated my daughter great.  I did happen to hear someone say the weekends get a little crazier at the property (we stayed Wednesday to Friday).  I will say if you want a spot at the pool, get there early as it cam be tough to find seating as it is a small pool deck (unless you reserve a cabana or day bed).  \n\nWhen visiting NYC, check out this resort as it is so relaxing after spending the day walking through nonstop crowds, the staff is top notch and the rates are very reasonable for the location and amenities it offers!","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Loved the gorgeous well-decorated room (we had a king suite) even if it's tight, but hey, that's NYC. the doorman (Fabio?) was fantastic and helped us with our overstuffed luggage rack both at check-in and out. The front desk was jovial and helpful. We needed a sofa bed made up and they came right away and took care of it. Bathroom was huge. In-room themed coffee was a nice touch and we appreciated the daily water.\n\nThe bad: The pool.  We booked this hotel so we could have a pool to jump into after site seeing for the day. Both days we were there, it was booked for a private event in the afternoon. My kids never got a chance to use it. These private events made the elevator unusable from 4pm onward so you're just stuck there waiting for a ride.\n\nOn our second day, we were hot, tired and hungry from a trip to Liberty and Ellis islands. We just wanted a snack in the Landshark bar and some pool time before our early dinner. We went to the Landshark at 2:30 -- closed for a private event. Fine, went to the main restaurant. $30 later, for apps, fries and a salad (which I realized after I got back to my room, they forgot), we ate and i was about to go to the pool. I only had 1 hour until it closed for the party. I get there at 3 and see all the drunk adults filling the pool ordering drink after drink. I kept signaling the 3 waiters and they all ignored me. I finally get one to come over and he says the bar is now closed at 3:30 for the day. I just wanted a dip and a cocktail, so I wanted to cry. He hooked me up with a free margarita, but it wasn't what I was dreaming about. I had to leave shortly thereafter. I realized the pool and restaurant are managed by a separate company, but don't tell your guests there a pool and bar if there really isn't. I would've chosen a different hotel.\n\nAs for the fellow guests, they make it very family-unfriendly. Every time we got in the elevator, some drunk woman (a different one) who had been day drinking wanted to talk to my kids. One was going on and on about her special \"candy.\"  It was very uncomfortable. Like I said, the pool was all leathery drunks living the song the hotel is named after. I'm glad my kids didn't want to swim that day. The hotel entrance reeks of weed as there are a few tables next to the entrance selling joints (and people smoke them there too). It's too bad because it's centrally located to Broadway and other mid-town attractions. Next time we visit, I'm choosing a better hotel. The vibe was off at this one.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":23462501,"title":"Nearly new and nicely appointed, but only 3 elevators to service this huge building","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-07-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"This hotel is nearly new, is located directly adjacent to Times Square, is nicely appointed and we enjoyed our stay here.  The room was quiet with no noise from nearby rooms or from the street out front.  There are plenty of on-site amenities from the rooftop bar and restaurant to the main Margaritaville restaurant, shops and bars.  WiFi was free and fast, rooms are equipped with Keurig coffee makers and refrigerators and the bed and linens were very warm and comfortable. The rooms are modern looking, bright and cheery with an island theme and ceiling fans.  Staff were all courteous, outgoing and helpful.  That said, there are a few critical comments:\n\n-This hotel is 32 stories tall with a few hundred guest rooms and multiple bars, restaurants and shops that are open to the public.  There are only 3 smallish elevators to service all those people accessing the entire building, and those same elevators also act as service lifts for the staff, restaurant and bar crew, cleaners, etc.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it can take upwards of 20 minutes or longer to get from the ground floor to your room (the lobby and 'front desk' are located on the 7th floor and are only accessible via those same 3 elevators as well).  The lack of elevators is definitely this hotel's biggest achilles heel and I'm guessing it's a source of constant complaints, as there's a sign at the front desk advising patrons that the elevators run on 'island time' and encouraging guests to plan ahead and allow ample time during peak usage.  How this is possible in a brand new, freshly designed building is beyond me.\n\n- Our shower was very difficult to regulate.  One day it was only cold water, the next it'd be only hot, regardless of how or where we moved the handle.  At other times the water would shut off completely for several seconds at a time then burst back on again, repeatedly.\n\n- The bathroom had no fan to remove steam from the shower, or odor when using the toilet.\n\n- Rooms are a bit small and cramped, even for just 2 people, but this NYC.\n\n- Again, because this is NYC, taxes and fees are outrageous.  The taxes, fees, resort fees and the like increased the overall cost of our 3 night stay by more than 1\/3.\n\n- We went to fill the ice bucket.  No ice machines on our floor.  We never found the ice machine during our stay.  According to another review the only one is on the 7th floor, but there was no signage in our room or near the ice bucket to indicate that.  Not worth a 30 minute elevator ride to the 7th floor \"lobby\" to get a bucket of ice.\n\n- Though we didn't hear a peep from nearby rooms or the street, several times we were awakened early by people chatting in the hallway outside our room.  Same when the cleaning staff would vacuum the hallway.\n\n  I give this hotel 4 stars for this particular trip because we got an attractive rate through one of the better hotel booking sites.  Had I paid the full-price rate that was listed on this hotel's website for that same stay, I'd have expected more and my rating would most likely have been lower.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

It's fantastic that there's a front door greeter. It's also a bit of a relief to see them considering the decline of Times Square and the people outside the door. By the way, I'm from a local borough, this was a staycation to see WWE at MSG.\n\nContrary to what others have experienced, I had zero issues with the elevator. I stayed overnight on a Monday and arrived early that day.  The pool area was nice although it closed for a bit thanks to a storm passing through. \n\nI ate at the Landshark restaurant and it was good. I had to get a to go order and was disappointed they didn't have plastic ware. Then again, I checked two CVS's in the area and they didn't either so I guess that's the distribution issue in play.\n\nThe rooftop bar is nice. The drinks are crazy expensive. The margarita I had at Landshark was reasonably priced ($12 plus tip) and was good.\n\nThe room was very nice even though it was small. I thought the decor was amazing. I had a King size bed (looked like a Queen to me though) and I didn't pay the extra $50 to stay on a high floor, but my view was still very nice.\n\nThe only gripes I had (and these are minor):\n\n- No robes - I really think they should remove this from their website when they don't have them. I work on websites and I know how easy it is to remove a line temporarily. I called on the phone and went to the front desk. There were no robes available. \n\n- Reserved beds at the pool - It's exciting to look down at the pool and see so many empty beds. But then you quickly deflate when you get down there you see a reserved sign on more than half of them. I think it should be first come first serve.\n\n- The showers are weird, as others have mentioned. There's nothing that can be done about this but why a designer would create a vertical wall that covers half the shower (leaving your pert derriere blowing in the wind -- or in the face of whomever may want to use the toilet) is just odd. It would've made more sense to have a horizontal door so that guests are covered from the shoulders down. Anyway, just remember that if you're sharing a room.\n\n- No closets. Period. There's a .... cubbyhole?  But the steamer works very well!\n\nHaving said that, I'd definitely stay here again and encourage others to do so too!","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

We arrived early the day our stay began (11am), and while our room was not yet ready, the staff easily took our bags and gave us our pool wristbands so we could head straight there! \n\nWe proceeded to spend the next 5-6 (who's counting!) hours at the pool area, which did get busy but we luckily snagged four beach chairs. The pool gets packed, especially on a holiday weekend, but there was always room to go in and hang around, but definitely not enough room to actually swim. The poolside service from the LandShark bar was prompt even with a ton of guests, and the drinks are very well priced - was honestly shocking as I expected to spend a lot more. Drinks averaged around 12-13 dollars. \n\nThe front desk staff called around 12:30pm informing us our room was ready, which was great to know even though we didn't go down for a while. The room itself was small but well suited for our group of four. Shower pressure was great and shower was spacious, the beds were super comfortable and the smart TV let us enjoy a post-pool cozy movie time.\n\nMy only \"gripe\" was that the food at the restaurant wasn't my favorite, but it was totally passable if you want to eat \"on campus\" rather than head out for dinner. I am not a big fried food\/heavy food person, but I was fine and satiated. \n\nThe rooftop bar is also really nice with great views, the drinks are definitely more expensive up there though! We didn't spend a ton of time because we were totally exhausted from all day in the sun.\n\nThe next morning we checked out but stored our bags again, so easy, and spent a good portion of the day by the pool. We didn't manage to get chairs (it was the fourth) but laid on towels on the side of the pool which was just fine. \n\nWe loved our stay and I have told all of my friends that I want to go back for another staycation, or even for a day trip to the pool. It is such a nice oasis in the middle of NYC and truly gives you the resort vibes you might be looking for, as I know we were.\n\nFinally, thanks to Clay, Abhi, Ciera, and the rest of the staff for being so great to speak to. Truly a beyond friendly and welcoming group who go above and beyond, and made us really feel \"at home\" a whole four subway stops away from home. \n\nCan't wait to come back!","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Good service and VERY comfortable beds, but overall was a disappointment. \n\nFirst, the elevators are a nightmare. They are INSANELY slow and while security exists - I\u2019m told ensure guests get to get on them first - we didn\u2019t witness this happening. We waiting over 15 minutes multiple times for an elevator, that\u2019s not acceptable for a hotel. Allegedly when the restaurant and bar are busy they shut one down to guests to help accommodate G&S needs. I get that but you really REALLY a need to come up with a better plan. \n\nSecond huge disappointment, the walls are PAPER thin. Could easily hear the entire conversations (and partying) of the guests in the room adjacent to ours AND it was not even on the wall our bed shared with them. Yes we had to contact management bc at 1:30am this is unacceptable. Sadly that didn\u2019t seem to deter them. Yes I understand staying in a hotel that\u2019s possible but it\u2019s still ridiculous that a hotel, expensive like this one, hadn\u2019t done more to ensure the quietness of their rooms. \n\nAnson - the overnight manager was a blessing. Ciena (Ciera?) at the front desk was lovely too and did waive the activities fee to accommodate the disruptions. But frankly, I expected more from such a highly ranked hotel in TA. As much as I desperately would, like to, and as much as I love JB, I can not recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Problems started about 2 hours after check-in. We called the Front Desk at 4pm to put sheets on the sofa bed (odd since most  hotels already have these on). They said they would send someone. Came back from dinner at 6:30. Still not made up. Called again. They said they would send someone up. Figured we would kill time since our young kids needed to run some energy out. Came back at 9:00 and the sofa was STILL NOT MADE UP! Called down again and they said they would be up. 10:00 we finally went down the lobby ourselves to pick up the sheets. I ended up putting the sleeping kids in my bed while I made up the couch myself... This was the first inclination that the guests are not the priority here.\n\nWhen we returned from the theatre on Saturday night (8pm), the lobby elevator line looked like the entrance to a club (people were heading up to the rooftop bar). So with two small kids in tow, the lobby smelled like weed and liquor as we waited about 15 min to just get to an elevator. I asked someone if there was a line for people who were actually staying at the hotel? They said no.\n\nOn Saturday night we were fast asleep when at 3am all the lights came on in the room blinking repeatedly. We mentioned this to the front desk in the morning and they were not surprised (strange??).\n\nWe received a late checkout perk on Sunday. When we came back from breakfast, we were set to let the kids swim at the pool. Only to find out every single amenity (Margaritaville, pool, landshark, and rooftop) was occupied by some BitCoin conference. I watched as many people filed into the hotel for this conference...most were not staying at the hotel, yet my amenities were unavailable to me after spending almost $3000 at this hotel for 2 nights. \n\nHonestly, until they decide to get their act in line as to who they serve, I would not recommend staying at this hotel.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Elevators (only 3 of them) are VERY slow. Getting from the lobby to our room or vice versa took 15 minutes a couple times. You never get an elevator quickly and they are always packed. \n2. Every restaurant and every bar was closed to guests for one night so they could cater to a private group. \n3. Rooms are very tiny even by NYC standards. No ironing boards or irons.  Showers drain slow. Cramped space.\n4. Solicitors selling tours or products allowed to linger right outside the main door waiting for you. \n5. Not very sound proof even on high floors. Loud sound from the street level and parties at their bars comes right into the room. \n6. Frustrating promos. Example: We got a \"Buy One Drink, Get One Free\" coupon at check-in. Even though they have 6 bars, the coupon is only accepted at the smallest one and you must sit outside. \n7. Not very family friendly. People making out in the pool. Heavy drinking by some. Scantily clad guests. Too many scenes or language you don't want your kids around. \n\nOverall, would I stay here again? Yes... but only if I got a price well below the Times Square standard price.

There were no rooms available when we checked online but the manager - we believe his name was Abhiand, found us a room and switched us with ease. I will admit when we first arrived, we did have to wait a lengthy period of time (30 mins) for our room to be ready but our bellhop, Anthony, stayed with us the whole time to ensure our bags were delivered to our room!

Also liked the pool area space however the pool itself is much smaller than photographs indicate so all it takes is a few rowdy kids to dampen the experience because with such tight quarters there is no where to escape their shenanigans.\n\nWe'd encourage you to visit and enjoy their outdoor spaces but staying there we found the room to be incredibly small with a bathroom that allows no privacy so for families or friends traveling together it's a real cramped setup.  The elevators were atrociously slow, just to get to the lobby you need to access the 7th floor and folks who are visiting the bars pour in as well.

We did one night at a nearby Marriott brand, but switched for the following nights.  So worth it!  It was just great here at Margaritaville in Time Square.  Drove into NYC from NC and parked at a nearby garage using SpotHero App. 7-8 minute walk to hotel.  Left the car there for the trip.  Many garage options in the area to reserve. Hotel check in is on the 7th floor. Easy access from street to elevators that have a door man or guard on hand at entrance. Arlene, Yissel and Miguel were so very helpful and friendly-at check in and with all our questions during multiple points during our stay. Room was ready earlier than check in time and they called us! Rooms so much bigger than many in NYC. New. CLEAN. Keurig! Mini fridge is a huge bonus! Bed comfy.  And noise was minimal from the outside\/sound decreasing windows...with Time Square and Broadway right there, that's impressive!  Saw the pool. Too chilly to use, but looks fun. Restaurant was perfect for the rainy morning breakfast and the one day that we skipped getting NYC bagels, but they do have some fresh bagels delivered on site at the restaurant.  Only one waitress when we went, but we were not in a rush.  She was sweet and got everything right in our order! Food was above average breakfast. Yes, elevators can take a few minutes, but we just planned for that. We were on the 27th floor and it was fine. And the Caribbean atmosphere in the elevator (and hotel of course) is funny bc you are in NYC, but definitely makes you smile! Also, Joe's pizza is just about a block away!

I like to stay midtown for the convenience of amenities and public transportation.  This time I did not rent a car because I had a carry-on bag and it is relatively easy to get from EWR to Margaritaville using public transportation. \n\nI arrive around 4pm in Friday and head to the 7th floor to check-in. I remember two employees from. August and they remember me, I am terrible with names.  Check-in is easy and I am on the way to my room on the 19th floor.  \n\nThe room is small, but super functional. I was I'm NYC for a fraternity alumni event and an after party was NOT going to happen in that room.  Conveniently there is the rooftop bar on the 31st and 32nd floor that we went to, to have a few more beverages, charged to my room.\n\nI did also eat at the Margaritaville and 6th floor restaurants.  Each meal was great, the service was exceptional in a positive way.\n\nOn Friday night i asked for additional handsoap via phone.  I called housekeeping first and received a voice-mail.  I called the front desk and received the items about 30 minutes later.\n\nOn Saturday I unexpectedly left the property, the plan was to sleep in all day before the event.  I received a text message on Saturday welcoming me to the property.  On a whim since I was out, I texted back and asked the room be made up.  I received a text back saying it would be.  FANTASTIC!  Making up the room is by request now, and my request was fulfilled.  I wish I carried cash to tip the GRA.\n\nBy trade, I am a Training Manager for a Claims Center and I have worked in various industries including hospitality in Vegas.  I teach and suggest to learners that it costs nothing to be nice and all things being equal, the experience makes or breaks a loyal guest.  Margaritaville does it right.\n\nI think I shot myself in the foot, after this review, bookings will go up and I may be out of luck in April.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Plenty of storage space, mini fridge, keureg & waters, SUPER comfy mattresses & pillows. \nOur package came with free robes, $80 toward food\/drinks in any of the restaurants\/bars in the resort and two tickets to The Edge. \nMiguel was ever ready to help with anything we needed during our 3 night stay:extra waters\/coffee pods\/hangers and he even found my gloves in the lobby!!\nThe staff sent up a sweet note with a small bottle of Chardonnay, to drinking flutes & a charcuterie tray. Very thoughtful. \nWe went to the rooftop bar twice: once to see the awesome night view & celebrate bumping into Hugh Jackman. The second time to have a quick visit with family-and photos outside by the New Years Eve ball behind us.\nLove the vibe: palm trees, flip flop\/pop top statue in the lobby, parrots galore (even embossed on the duvet covers!).

The overall beach theme is unique, with some nice city views from the restaurants on the higher floors. The rooms are typical for NYC....very small. The rainshower is nice but the shower is open to the rest of the bathroom (no door) making it a bit chilly for me. \n\nFood was decent although the restaurants are way overpriced (but that is also typical of NYC). There are four bars, but the drink menus are very limited and very expensive at two of them (about $17-$23). Your best bet is the Margaritaville Restaurant on the 2nd floor. Drinks around $12-13, more in line with prices at other Margaritaville locations. \n\nHousekeeping is upon request only. In our five day stay we only requested it once, early in the morning, and it wasn't cleaned until very late afternoon. Other times we requested towels and coffee supplies. Took three requests to get the towels, and at least that many to get the coffee. After two failed attempts via phone, we went to the lobby in person and requested it. It arrived to our room within a few minutes, but they did not bring any cups, which we had specifically asked for, rendering the rest of the items useless. \n\nCheckin and other visits to the 7th floor lobby were smooth and the staff there was very friendly and helpful.\n\nThey advertise 360 views from the restaurant\/bar on floors 31 and 32, but only one side of the 31st floor was open and all of the 32nd floor was closed, so that was a little disappointing.\n\nThere is a small outdoor pool on the 6th floor that is supposedly heated and open 365 days a year, but we didn't see anyone trying it in December. It is next to the Landshark Bar and Restaurant, so sitting and eating outside by the pool would be nice in the summer.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":23462501,"title":"Total disappointment","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-12-16","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"This hotel is located in Times Square in Manhattan, so from this point of view it is excellent. \nI paid approximately 450\u20ac per night for a double room without breakfast and stayed for 5 days. \nThis hotel is newly built, I heard that it opened recently in July 2021?\nSo let\u2019s start with positive: \n1. Superb location in Times Square in Manhattan next to everything. \n2. Brand new with excellent air conditioning, very nice view ( my room was on the 26th floor). \n3. Fantastic mattress for deep sleep. \n4. Quiet. \n5.very polite stuff. \n\nNow the minus\n\n1. The decor. It is definitely a kitsch hotel, in particular the restaurant but also the rooms have a style of an exotic resort but the final result is something terrible. \n2. The hotel is something very strange. When you enter from the street there is nothing there, just a corridor leading to the elevators. you won\u2019t understand that you are in a hotel. The reception is on the 6th floor and you go there with the elevator. \n3. The rooms although new, are extremely small. The same with the bathroom. It is practically impossible to live in this room for more than a single day. It is only for sleep. Please see my photos. For 5 days my clothes stayed in my luggage. There was not even space  to hang my jackets. Totally disappointing. If there was a money refund I would have left. \n4. The restaurant was like a cheap coffee shop. \nI took breakfast one day and asked for a cappuccino coffee. I got an Americano ! They told me that it is the only coffee they offer! Shame ! Just with the money that they charge for a single night they can buy a coffee maker and offer more choices than a poor americano in this 4 star hotel ! Lol 4 star hotel without even coffee choices. I got steak and egg for breakfast. Very poor presentation and even more poor taste. \nBefore coming to NY I stayed to Lowes hotel in Chicago where i got the same plate that was simply superb. \n5.There is problem with the elevators. They are not enough. In rush hour, when leaving on Saturday late afternoon it took me more than 10 min waiting in the reception at the 6th floor to go down to ground floor and exit from the hotel. \n\nAlso here comes another thing that I ve never met in my life. \nThe elevators are also used by the stuff all the time. People going up and down with the clients. \nIn particular one of the elevators has two doors-front and back- that is practically the stuff elevator and many many times I got in there with stuff  carrying big trolleys with bedsheets, cleaning material, I even saw an officer carrying the cashier one day\u2026 This is more than ridiculous. I am sorry to say but I am paying 450 \u20ac a day, please make me feel like a 450\u20ac client but what I got was the feeling of a 450\u20ac jackass. \nBeware, I did a mistake and chose this hotel because I read good feedbacks and high grade  given in many sites but be careful, only 200 people have given feedback so far. \nIt\u2019s not worth the money. I am really sorry to say this but I never felt like a person paying 450\u20ac a night. I needed that, that\u2019s why I chose this hotel but all my expectations went away.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

The hotel is new and is in a great location in Times Square. Our check is was great (shout out to Arlene) and our room was even ready really early at 1030am. Our room had floor to ceiling windows and a view of the New Years Ball and was clean but of course it was really small. So small that it was hard for the two of us to even move around in the room without bumping the bed corners (ouch). We had a package that included credits for drinks, tickets to the edge, a Margaritaville robe, late checkout and no resort fees.  The package was such a great deal:) My biggest complaint was the wait for the elevators- sometimes we waited 15-20 minutes.  I even used the stairs a few times.  We also did have some service issues at the Landshark bar and restaurant. We arrived to no host and someone behind the host stand who was absolutely no help and said she just takes pictures (as she was playing on her phone). Finally I walked over to the bar and was told to seat myself. We waited forever for a server and when we got service it was fair at best. Had to ask twice for water and also silverware.  The food was decent.  I will add that on our last day we ate at the main Margaritaville restaurant on the 2nd floor.  The food was awesome (I recommend the chicken egg rolls) and the service was actually outstanding. Our server Khalid was top notch. You could tell he cared about us as customers and he enjoyed his job. I was so happy to leave with a positive experience because I truly think this hotel is awesome.

A room key is required to get to the lodging floors, but not to the floors with restaurants\/bars(31\/32), lobby, or the check in desk (7). At check in, Arlene was very helpful and informative as well as a nice lady (the concierge or manager maybe) who helped us get The Edge reservations and gave suggestions on restaurants, etc). All bartenders we encountered were great and friendly, especially Cheyenne at the Margaritaville bar. One bartender told us about the Jimmy Buffet super fans that come and stay at the hotel which we had a good laugh about as we\u2019re far from fans and just liked the idea of a brand new hotel in Times Square!

V\u00f6llig \u00fcberbewertet!","lang":"de","publishedDate":"2021-12-09","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Ich habe 3 N\u00e4chte Anfang Dezember im Hotel verbracht. Das Standardzimmer war winzig, jedenfalls kleiner als auf der Website des Hotels dargestellt. Als Alleinreisende  mit wenig Gep\u00e4ck war es ertr\u00e4glich, zu zweit ist es wohl ziemlich beengt. Beim Check-In erf\u00e4hrt man, dass zus\u00e4tzlich zu den Preisen im Internet noch eine t\u00e4gliche \u201eResort Fee\u201c von ca. 50$ zu bezahlen ist. Das sei f\u00fcr die Poolnutzung (Au\u00dfenpool im Dezember?), sowie f\u00fcr Bademantel, WLAN etc.\nIm Zimmer gab es keinen Bademantel, Gratis-WLAN nur f\u00fcr ein Endger\u00e4t. Beim Waschbecken im kleinen, jedoch sehr sauberen Bad, gab es nur einen sehr sp\u00e4rlichen Wasserstrahl, sodass man sich kaum die H\u00e4nde waschen konnte. In der Dusche gab es zwar genug Wasser, dieses wechselte jedoch alle paar Sekunden seine Temperatur von br\u00fchend hei\u00df auf lauwarm. Ich habe mich diesbez\u00fcglich bei der Rezeption beschwert, es wurde umgehende Behebung des Problems zugesagt. Passiert ist bis zu meiner Abreise nichts.\nAls ich am ersten Tag um ca 17:00 Uhr m\u00fcde vom Sightseeing ins Hotel kam, fand ich ein ungemachtes Zimmer vor. Nach Anruf beim Housekeeping kam jemand und brachte zumindest frische Handt\u00fccher mit der Erkl\u00e4rung, dass halt viele Zimmer zu machen seien und man immer bis abends damit besch\u00e4ftigt sei.Immerhin bekam ich dann auf Nachfrage einen Bademantel. Hinsichtlich des Wasserproblems wurde wieder Behebung zugesagt.\nAm n\u00e4chsten Tag wollte ich wieder so um 17:00 Uhr kurz ins Hotelzimmer, um mich f\u00fcr die Oper umzuziehen. Schon vor dem Hoteleingang sah ich eine ca 50 m lange Menschenschlange, die bis ins Hotel zu den Liften reichte. Offenbar gab es in der Rooftop-Bar eine Veranstaltung. Zwei nette junge Empfangsdamen standen dieser Menschenmasse hilflos  gegen\u00fcber. Meinen Hinweis, dass ich m\u00f6glichst rasch mein Zimmer aufsuchen wolle, quittierten sie mit hilflosem L\u00e4cheln und der Aufforderung mich hinten anzustellen. Angesichts des Umstandes, dass die 3 Lifts schon bei normalem Hotelbetrieb ziemliche Wartezeiten erforderten, h\u00e4tte ich da wohl meinen Opernbesuch vergessen k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin dann - trotz b\u00f6ser Blicke der Wartenden - an der Schlange vorbei zu den Lifts gegangen, wo ich wegen deren v\u00f6llig sinnloser Programmierung noch immer einige Minuten warten musste, bis ich - trotz Covid - eng eingepfercht in den 17. Stock fahren konnte. Das Wasser tr\u00f6pfelte nach wie vor, immerhin war das Zimmer tadellos aufger\u00e4umt.\nBeim Check-Out am n\u00e4chsten Morgen hatte ich das Gl\u00fcck, bei der Rezeption die entz\u00fcckende Viviane aus Deutschland anzutreffen, die wegen meiner Beschwerden ziemlich betroffen war und sich daf\u00fcr entschuldigt hat. Sie hat mir die Resort-Fee erlassen und mich auf ein Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck eingeladen, was mich dann doch bes\u00e4nftigt hat. Vielen Dank Viviane!  Allerdings hat das Hotel insgesamt nicht meinen Erwartungen entsprochen. Die Lage ist super, das Management hat den Laden aber offensichtlich noch nicht im Griff, das Hotel wurde erst k\u00fcrzlich er\u00f6ffnet. Wer ein Zimmer mit Ablagefl\u00e4chen, Sitzm\u00f6glichkeit und Bewegungsfreiheit haben m\u00f6chte, sollte woanders wohnen.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I booked with the marvelous Viviane- per a recommendation of a close friend- and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our experience.  We were treated like royalty.  Every time we entered the lobby- the staff was all smiles and absolutely accommodating.  We were there in October \u2026. Which can be chilly \u2026. However, the heated pool was the main amenity that made our trip such a dream.  We would drag our kids around the city all day and then late afternoon- they would be done with the hustle and bustle.  But having the option of returning to our little oasis in the middle of the city to let the kids swim while we enjoyed a poolside cocktail and appetizer was absolutely priceless.  We all got what we needed- and every staff member was joyful to host us, feed us, and  assist us with every request we had.

The front desk people were fantastic and had the happiest and most friendly attitude I've ever experienced in my many trips to New York.  All the people including the people greeting you at the front door and housekeeping people you see in the hallway are smiling and glad to see you.  Special thanks to Miguel who was overly helpful as I had him store my luggage, later pulled some out and put them back in storage the day I checked out.  The hotel itself is great, brand new, very clean, and right in the middle of times square.  I booked the least expensive standard king room, was on the 11th floor, with a nice view of the pool.  The large windows in the room were soundproof, and I slept soundly and was not awakened once by sirens or garbage trucks that are usually heard in the middle of the night.  Did I say prime location, its on 7th and 40th, a 2 minute walk to the middle of times square., tons of restaurants, and the subway entrance right across the street will take you anywhere in Manhattan.  Yes rooms are small, but what is expected in the city.  The bed was very comfortable and you have everything you need including adequate plugs and lighting on both sides of the bed and on the desk, a keurig, complimentary bottled waters, clothes steamer which worked perfectly on suits, refrigerator and safe.  Bathroom had a nice rainfall shower and high quality soaps and shampoos.  There is a heated swimming pool and I saw people in it at 45 degree outside temperatures,  the views of all of NYC at the 32nd floor rooftop bar were amazing especially at night.  To top it all off they offered a grand opening Welcome to New York promotion where the standard room was less than 185\/nt plus tax (unusual for the prime location), waived the 50 dollar resort fee, gave you 80 dollars in food and drink plus more drink coupons, a free Margaritaville times square robe, plus get this, 2 free tickets to the Edge (which cost 36 pp).   So it was a no-brainer to stay here for the promotion itself, which I fear is the only time it will ever be offered since I really want to stay here again with family instead of business.  I am a seasoned international traveler and I have to admit, I was reluctant when I first heard the name Margaritaville, but was pleasantly surprised and actually want to go back.

And got 'em in ten minutes.\nThe flat-screen TV was half the size of its wall.\nThe climate control was digital, instantly responsive, and easy to use.\nThe \"rainshower\" shower head was  really like a rainshower.\nThe pool was a turquoise jewel, clean and warm on a brisk fall day.\nThe room came with two luxurious robes and bath slippers.\nThe reverse side of the keycard had a city map with hotel's location central.\nThe bathroom fixtures were high-end, fanciful designs.\nEvery employee I encountered engaged me in conversation like they REALLY CARED about me and my experience.  Wait, what? In NEW YAWK?  Yes, really. \nThe room was virtually silent--advertised soundproofing 90% effective.\nThe room was not cheap: $285, with $50 \"resort fee.\"  But by NYC standards, that's not awful.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The faucets in the bathroom were dolphin tails! One whole wall was windows. So clean! We ventured up to the rooftop bar which was great. Such a view. My only complaint about the hotel was my Margarita up there. It came in a small old fashioned glass 3\/4 filled. It was delicious but I don't think Jimmy Buffett would be happy if you served it to him! LOL! Ate that night at Margaritaville Restaurant. Great service, great drinks and food. My husband had the Jambalaya which he said was delicious. We checked out the next morning but we weren't going home until night. Yissel suggested we go to Central Park (went on a carriage ride and had a drink at The Boathouse). The porter took our overnight bags and said he would hold them until we came back. Please check out the pool level where you can sit inside or out to eat and also have a great bar there. We will be back.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We got there a bit early so we checked in and had our bags stored while we went out to do some exploring.  When we returned, our bags were already in our immaculate, cozy room with a wonderful view of many of the sites of the city.  We toured the hotel, from top floor to bottom floor and were so impressed by the well themed bars and eateries, the beautiful art on the walls and the bright paint colors.  The resort was fun and exciting yet peaceful at the same time.  The bed and pillows were the most comfortable we have ever slept on at any of the number of hotels we have visited.  It was also a pleasure to be able to sleep without other room doors slamming shut and without noises from other rooms next to us or above us.  The doors all closed in a way that they made minimal noise and it was obvious that materials were used to make sure that noises could barely be heard from one room to the next. So much thought was put into the design of everything at this resort.  This was an anniversary to remember.  Thank you Margaritaville Times Square for helping to make it happen!","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We were in the big apple for 4 days and 4 nights, to celebrate a milestone birthday. We originally made reservations at another Times Square hotel and we checked in to find a dirty, severely run down room. We kindly asked to leave and headed to Margaritaville. We were attracted to the location, the pool and the option for food late night. We were greeted immediately by Miguel the bellman. He was full of life, energetic, kind and so helpful. Yissel checked us in. She was wonderful. She was able to match the rate we found on line, upgraded our room and went out of her way to have a special treat sent to our room for our sons birthday. Throughout our stay, Mark at the front desk was beyond helpful. Always making sure everything was going well. He made great suggestions for local restaurants that we absolutely loved! This is one of the nicest resorts my family and I have ever stayed at. It's clean, in a great location, family friendly and has everything a 5 star resort has to offer, in the middle of a big city! We referred to it as an oasis on an island (Manhattan). We are so thankful for everything and the wonderful hospitably after the rough start to our trip. There will be no other place we'll want to stay when we return to New York and I would recommend Margaritaville to anyone!","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The room itself was spotless, with great linens and every amenity we could ask for--including a fridge.  The rooftop bar has a great view of the city, and the pool was a comfortable 80 degrees.\n\nThe location at the southern end of Times Square puts you in the heart of the theater district.  Times Square gets congested and a wide range of human behaviors are on display, but you can avoid much of the crowds by approaching the hotel from the east or south.   \n\nManagement has done a great job of making the experience feel like a carefree vacation.  It starts with uniformly friendly and engaged staff.  Large TVs are not blaring Fox News; they show relaxing scenes of life at the beach and on the water.

Cool vibe and decor, trying to give it a resort feeling in a city hotel. The rooms are nicely designed BUT extremely small, even to NYC standards. The is literally zero floor space. If you need space, this is for you. Bathroom tiny as well. Shower had very low pressure and self changing temp\u2026 not that great. Beds were comfortable. The main advantage of this hotel is the outdoor pool, which is a great break from the city\u2026 however in our 5 night stay the water temp of the pool was too cold to use\u2026 and it was quite hot outside. I assume that most of the year using the pool will not be relevant. They have a few restaurants and a rooftop that seemed quite popular for non hotel guests. We didn\u2019t try any of them. During our stay the MTA was doing crazy digging work every night, just in front of the hotel, the noise was horrendous\u2026 not the hotels fault, but it really was bad. The area around the hotel isn\u2019t the most family friendly and is full of very bad cases of homeless people, as in many other parts of NYC  these days. Overall the hotel itself is good, cool and with overall good service. Will this be my choice for our next visit to NYC, not sure.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":23462501,"title":"Escape from the City in the Heart of the City","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-08-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"My family and I stayed here a little under a month after opening and though there were a few \"newly opened\" hiccups, they were completely overshadowed by the beautiful resort, chill vibe, and extraordinary staff! \n\nHere's my full breakdown of our stay --\n\nArrival: We were on a very early flight and got into the city before 10:30 AM. Still, I was able to communicate with the hotel beforehand and they were kind enough to make sure we had at least one of our two rooms ready. We got dropped off right in front of the hotel and one of the two staff members at the door welcomed us and made sure we knew where to guy by walking us to the elevators and giving us instructions to find the lobby. He also had all of our bags loaded up at the door so we didn't have to take all of them up to the lobby (on the 7th floor) by ourselves and load everything up there. Very convenient\n\nThe Resort: Really stayed true to the Margaritaville feel. I remarked to multiple staff members how relaxing it was to get back to this particular resort after a day of hustle and bustle in the city, and instantly feel like you're at a faraway beach. Staff members always agreed, a lot of them even said it felt like working at a beach resort. Walking in on street level, you can either take the escalator up to the second level to access the Margaritaville restaurant, or head to the elevators to access the guest floors, Landshark Bar and Grill and pool on the 6th floor, the lobby level on the 7th floor, or one of two levels of the 5 o Clock Somewhere upper rooftop bar (floors 31 and 32). There's also a fitness center in the basement that I didn't check out. I think we tried every single bar at least once and ate at Margaritaville 3 times during our stay. The 2nd and 3rd floor restaurant has floor to ceiling windows and a giant Statue of Liberty but instead of a torch, she's holding a margarita glass with built in screens that performs an awesome light show at the top of the hour. We only got poolside drinks from the Landshark Bar and the drinks were always strong and cold! The pool was such an amazing amenity and we went there for at least a bit every single day. Even though the resort wasn't full yet, the pool area definitely was. Make sure to get there early - seating space is pretty limited (to be expected in Manhattan...). The pool itself wasn't huge but more than big enough to accommodate a full pool deck of people. There were cornhole boards set up on on end of the pool deck and while we didn't play - it was nice to see other activities available just like at other Margaritaville resorts. The lobby level consisted of the check in desk, a couple small seating areas, what appeared to be meeting rooms, Joe Merchant's coffee shop, and an indoor\/outdoor bar with some nice views, a TV displaying those nice views, a lounge area, and an outdoor fireplace. We bought a couple baked goods and some convenience store items from Joe Merchants and everything was fine but nothing to go on about. The rooftop bar levels were gorgeous and provided the best views of the whole resort. You can clearly see the NYE ball so it'd be a perfect spot to ring in the new year. These two levels were adults only after 6 PM but kids were allowed up between 5 and 6. So if you're a family of 3 like my wife, daughter, and I you'll have to either go early as a family or go check it out solo at night.\n\nThe Room: My wife, daughter, and I stayed in a King suite and we're so very glad we chose the larger room. When compared to my fathers room next door (a classic king) it was probably twice the size, if not more. The separated living area was a huge help and the corner windows from both the bedroom and the living room gave us views for days. Both the living room and the bedroom had large TV. The bedroom also had a ceiling fan which was fantastic in addition to AC. The windows were floor to ceiling in each room and a few of them even opened up slightly. There was plenty of storage in both drawers and closet space. The room included a coffee maker, safe, and mini refrigerator. It also included toiletries, bathrobes, and slippers. Our bathroom was very spacious and had double vanities and a walk in shower. The shower didn't have a curtain though and the water splashed pretty far out into the bathroom area. The living room had a sleeper sofa (we never unfolded it) and a coffee table, as well as a beautiful island style light fixture. The rooms also all had doorbells and a lighting system to show whether you wanted service or you wanted not to be disturbed. The bed was extremely comfortable and the comforter even had little parrots barely stitched in, which we thought was a cool detail. Plenty of lighting throughout the room including reading lights and plenty of charging beside the bed and around the room as well including USB ports. Finally, the bedroom also had a long desk against a window with a pop up power station which looked like a good place to get some work done (but who's getting work done at a Margaritaville...??)\n\nThe Location: In the heart of Times Square, not much else needs to be said. Perfect, central jumping off point for any day in the big city. You can even see the NYE ball from multiple levels (the best view obviously at the rooftop bar). There was construction directly outside the entrance which made it difficult to get a cab or Uber on 7th Avenue, but that shouldn't be a problem for long.\n\nThe Service: This is the reason we'll absolutely be staying at Margaritaville Resort Tomes Square again. Every single person was genuinely interested in welcoming us, checking on our stay, giving recommendations both at the resort and in the city, and doing everything they could to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying our stay.\n\nThe Food: Like I mentioned the only two places we got food were Margaritaville and Joe Merchants. The drinks at all the bars didn't skimp on the liquor and the beer was always ice cold! One morning we got a blueberry muffin and a chocolate croissant from Joe Merchants. They weren't the best we'd ever had but certainly good enough that I'd get them again. At Margaritaville, we tried (over 3 visits) the spinach and artichoke dip, volcano nachos, cheeseburger in paradise, chicken Caesar salad, fish tacos, Caribbean egg rolls, and the seafood pasta. The only dish I didn't love was the salad, as the chicken didn't have a whole lot of seasoning. Everything else was pretty good! Obviously you can easily find fantastic meals in NYC but it's nice to have the option of a good meal a short elevator ride away!\n\nOverall: Loved our stay and will absolutely be back!!","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Even the bathrooms, which I typically don\u2019t notice as long as they\u2019re clean, added to the experience.

I met a polite, young man on the elevator who told me he loves his job working in maintenance. The woman who checked us in acted so happy to see us the next day when we walked past check-in. The woman who was maybe a cleaning manager went out of her way to be friendly and engaging. There were men at the entrance - bellmen? Security? They were kind, helpful, competent.

I had no idea this place would be so magical. The second I walked off the street and into the property my whole energy changed. The music, kindness of employees and relaxed, yet high end, aesthetic made me feel instantly at peace and like I was miles away on some tropical paradise. I checked in with ease and then went up to my gorgeous room. Every detail was special (whale tail handle knobs on the sink and all soaps in the signature Margaritaville scent), the bedding was clean, crisp, and beautiful\u2026.the ambiance made for a very high end and decadent feel. Once I settled in a bit I went down to the restaurant for a margarita (Alek made the best watermelon margarita) and a bite! The nachos were epic, enough for 2 people or one very hungry person. When the clock struck midnight I went back upstairs, watched a few shows on netflix (fully set up on the TV) and had the most peaceful sleep. The room was soundproof and, with the drapes closed, I totally forgot I was in the middle of a busy city. I was only there one night but would have gladly stayed a week. I will for sure be back with friends!! Thank you to the Margaritaville Resort Times Square team for an amazing experience.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

Upon entering the resort I was greeted by friendly staff that showed me where to go to check in. The decor from just entering the building was enough to make me feel as if I were on a tropical island. The elevators were nice and clean and brought me up to the hotel lobby on the 7th floor quickly and safely, which is already a great start as many hotels in the city that were built in older buildings often have troubles with their elevators. Once arrived at the lobby, front office staff, Abishek and Mark both greeted me with warm smiles. After a quick and painless check in process I made my way to my room using my keycard to access the elevator. This feature made me feel safe and that some random person couldn\u2019t just go to any given floor of the hotel. From entering the room, I was blown away by the themed decor and amazing fragrance of the tropics. The cleanliness of the room was also top notch, which made me feel safe, especially in today\u2019s world. After getting settled I made my way up to the 5 O\u2019clock Somewhere Bar on the 32nd floor to grab a drink. I ordered a Midtown Margarita which was so delicious I had to get another. The Alright, Alright, Alright, was also a delicious drink served with some banana chips to pair for an after drink treat. The waitstaff and bartenders were very friendly and professional and the view of the city skyline was to die for. Overall, an amazing experience up there. After a few drinks I decided to venture down to the Margaritaville Restaurant where I ordered the Ahi Tuna Nachos and a Landshark Lager. The nachos were tasty and the Landshark Lager was crisp and refreshing. The Statue of Liberty statue was also very cool, and was even autographed by Jimmy Buffet himself! After a full belly of nachos and good drinks, I made my way back to my comfortable bed to end the night. Coming from someone that has worked in hotels and the tourism industry for years, Margaritaville has hit the nail on the head in every aspect. It was exactly what I expected and more from a new property in the heart of NYC.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

As a former NYC resident, when I stepped into Margaritaville I felt like I was immediately transported to a tropical oasis. It was hard to believe that the hustle and bustle of the city was just outside the walls of the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are beautifully decorated and well sized for NYC. My friend and I went to the Margaritaville Restaurant for some drinks and we were very surprised on how affordable the drinks were. We both really enjoyed our drinks. The bartenders were attentive and personable. Margaritaville offers a unique experience unlike any other in NYC. I would recommend staying here for both those visiting NYC and NYC residents who are looking for a quick escape from the city.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Margaritaville hits a home run on everything they are trying to achieve. The ambiance is vibrant and the place really gives off great energy. We completely forgot we were in the city! \n\nOur only reminder is when we looked out of our window to see the iconic skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan (curiosity of the Director of Front Office Lauren Nordstrom). \nThe hospitality was nothing short of sensational and Lauren made sure we felt like nothing short of VIPs. \n\nI highly recommend this property for an incredible get away. Other hotels in Times Square watch out, there's a new superstar in the neighborhood.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}
