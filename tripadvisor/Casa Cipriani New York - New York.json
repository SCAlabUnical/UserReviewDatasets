It\u2019s clear a ton of thought when into the design in every single space on property. \n\nBut what sets Casa Cipriani truly part from its peers and puts it squarely at the TOP of the heap of high end luxury hotels in New York is the service. It\u2019s outstanding. I was blown away. From the gentlemen at the valet stand and the bellhops when you pull up for the first time, to Sophia at the front desk guiding you through check in, to the ladies helming the club level, everyone in the spa, the entire dining team\u2026 to a person they were so friendly, accommodating, and pleasant. I can\u2019t say enough about their hospitality.\n\nI rarely feel compelled to write reviews, good or bad. But Casa Cipriani is so excellent it\u2019s deserving of all the praise it receives.

The Casa sports a dual hospitality personality, namely, a hotel & a members club where luxury reins 'summa cum laude'...why the house car is an Aston Martin. I soaked up my spacious Junior River View Suite adorned with mahogany floors, bespoke Italian furnishings, Art-Deco light fixtures, an adorable work desk and artwork on the wall. The suite was embedded with high tech appliances like electronic shades, selectable lighting and other futuristic tools. The bath was marbleized with heated floor and walk-in shower. The pinnacle room amenity, however, was the terrace affording me an exception views of  attractions like the Brooklyn Bridge.........why I could almost shake hands with the Statue of Liberty. One never has to leave the Casa with such a bevy of dining and drinking options where you will find the Club Restaurant, the Jazz Cafe, the Club Bar, the Promenade Bar and the Living Room. Aside from the abundance of bars, the Living Room is a communal experience while the Club is where dinner is served in Italian style with items like carpaccio and other pasta classics.........I tested the carpaccio..........it was great.

I work in hotels and travel half the year, so I\u2019m rather particular. I had a few nights in the city for business meetings in FiDi, and wanted to be close by, but on the water. The building itself is a work of art, the staff are amazing, and the feeling that you've arrived somewhere truly special is immediate. \n\nI checked in at 8am (knowing i was rolling the dice), and while my room wasn't ready, I was escorted upstairs to have tea and start my work day from the club floor where i got to enjoy a posh tea service overlooking the East River. A few lounges behind me, an investor was meeting with a fashion designer who had brought him an armful of new coats to try on (that\u2019s the vibe here - bit of business, bit of pleasure, all in good fun). I see why people are members here. \n\ninstead of having me come back downstairs to get my keys when my room was ready (less than an hour later), someone brought my keys to me and my luggage was waiting for me in my room. \n\nthe room is stunning. A nautical design nod embraces the views through more gorgeous windows. The bathroom is so luxe - i could live in there. electric shades are always my favorite touch in a room \u2014 the ultimate in convenience, along with slippers and a robe.  At night, i invited friends to join me at the jazz club for dinner - such an intimate and cool concept. Food was excellent. (Though a pizza for lunch ended up being my #1). we had drinks beforehand at the cozy bar on the club floor \u2014 even for a week night, it was a buzzing scene. (Dress code applies, be aware.) \n\nI had a casual breakfast at the main restaurant before heading out (reluctantly), and the house car brought me to my meeting a few blocks away.

That now leaves from next door, meaning the occasional boat horn blowing, plus there\u2019s the private heliport next door, but these never felt like a nuisance, more signs of a living city. The building itself is stunning and has been beautifully restored and decorated to resemble a grand ocean liner, with wood panelled corridors and nautical themed decor, but not overdoing it. The standard and quality of finishes is second to none.\n\nOur room was a junior suite facing the river. It had great views (but no outdoor space), a large bedroom (and a very comfortable bed), an excellent walk-in wardrobe with a bench on which to open luggage easily (Rimowa owners will know what I mean), and plenty of hangers and drawers. The bathroom was \u2018accessible\u2019 (which I believe means a wider door) and large, but only had one sink and the shower inside the bath, which wet you standing outside the first time you turned it on. There wasn\u2019t really any storage space in the bathroom for wash bags etc. The sink didn\u2019t hold water. The fittings are gold but tasteful.\n\nLighting controls were difficult to figure out. Room service was quick. The concierge was competent. Beware the dress code (no shorts after midday). The valet Marcus was excellent.\n\nComplaints: There was a mix-up with a second room booked in advance (which they didn\u2019t have so offered us an upsell when we arrived for $2.5k a night). The hotel tried to charge us $1400\/night for our room until we showed them proof we had been quoted $1200 (we booked direct). The biggest mood dampener was booking a table outside on the terrace for dinner on our last night, and being made to wait 45 minutes as \u201cwe don\u2019t guarantee tables outside\u201d, only to be finally squeezed into a table between two others, where within minutes a fellow diner complained we were too close to her. Not great when you\u2019re already weighing up whether this is to be your future NYC \u2018go to\u2019 hotel.\n\nWith extras the five night stay cost about $10.5k. I liked it, my wife less so. It has character and I\u2019m sure they will iron out issues. If you smoke, especially cigars, you\u2019ll appreciate the rooftop bar.

My view of Brooklyn was delightful; and to the far right, Lady Liberty was visible.  I found service to be outstanding, from front desk to food and beverage staff to housekeeping.  My suite was bright, cheery, flooded with natural daylight.  The bedding and bathroom exuded luxury, and the work-space is well thought-out.  I was very impressed with food and beverage quality both in the jazz club, the rooftop restaurant, and the bar.  The property does have a very clubby atmosphere and could feel \u201ccliquey\u201d to outsiders unless prepared that this is\u2026indeed\u2026a private club with year-round membership\u2026.and on a weekend evening it seems most everyone knows everyone else.  A welcome concept is the discouragement of photography throughout, hopefully fending off the Instagram crowd.  I call the property sophisticated, discreet, classy, and elegant.  The interior design is impeccable, preserving the historic quality of the building while presenting a fitting (water-side) nautical theme.  The location could give people pause, but one of my goals in staying there was to see how much I could amuse myself in the neighborhood, which did not disappoint.  Plenty to do, see, taste, and take in.  I especially enjoyed strolling over the Brooklyn Bridge to have lunch at Pedros in Dumbo, then back across the much less traveled but architecturally fascinating Manhattan Bridge which dumps you off in the heart of Chinatown.  In the area are shops, parks and even museums I would never have explored had I not stayed here; and the location is an excellent gateway for exploration of the magnificently conceived 9\/11 Memorial.  For those who can\u2019t leave the gym at home, no disappointment here\u2014it\u2019s all state-of-the art.  For a city hotel, it feels exceptionally quiet and peaceful, even when relatively full as it was the weekend of my stay.  The only noise factor arises from the comings and goings of the boats chugging back and forth to Governors Island, but I found a certain charm in the sounds and activity.  I consider this hotel for near top honors in a city where luxury hotel competition is fierce. I\u2019ve seen reviews about billing issues, none of which I experienced.  It is stylish and charming, all aided by a friendly, relaxed, and attentive staff.  I would stay here again and will recommend to friends. ","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

The service\/staff were Italian and I felt like I was in Europe.\nI would highly recommend this hotel and stay there again. It has an excellent variety of different bars\/restaurants and lounges. My favourite was the Main Club restaurant terrace. The lights on the Brooklyn Bridge at night were magical.

Staff training needed","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-01-12","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"When we first realised this is where we would like to stay, I was focused on booking.  When it got to the booking stage that\u2019s when things went slightly wrong (and a bad vibe was set). The lady I\u2019d been speaking to regarding the booking had left for the day so I got to speak to her colleague (who clearly didn\u2019t want a family staying in one of his suites over new year\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). I then go to speak to Huni? Who also gave a general negative vibe about us staying in one the most exclusive!!! Hotel \u201cwith children\u201d My children are, 14, 17 and 19 (hardly rampaging toddlers). I was given strict instructions at to what they should be wearing when arriving and that they would have to out of sight and never allowed on the 5th floor after 5pm.  Ok so we took this all on board and after a very long flight from Heathrow, arrived at hotel to be told again that if we wanted to eat in the restaurant that they would have to change.  They didn\u2019t look untidy, they had got changed in the airport loo to make themselves smarter.  We went to the fifth floor worrying that we would be smart enough.  We arrived to see the table opposite us with teenagers wearing t shirts and less than smart.  Then later a bunch of men come in with trainers on!!!!! We are English and both of these tables were not! I can draw my own conclusions regarding this.  The food!, well the pizza was amazing, but the pasta!? I\u2019ve travelled all over Italy and eaten so many amazing pasta dishes (Al dente!!) more like un cooked.  None of us ate any of the pasta dishes.  Service in the restaurant was fantastic and staff were lovely.\n\nThe visit to the bar was embarrassing and not at ok or what I would have expected!!! So this would be the night of the 30th and we decided to have a nightcap in the lovely bar (without the children 14,17 & 19 year old children). The female bar tender who physically turned her head away from us as we walked to the bar!!! She was physically unable to show how unhappy she was with being asked to prepare two drinks for us.  She said nothing!!! Not welcome, how can I help you, what would you like or even, enjoy as she served the drinks!!! Nothing, just a disgusted look on her face.  When she did serve the drinks she put them on the bar, which was soaking with booze or water from other drinks served before us.  This was the last straw.  I confronted her and said a nicer attitude would be very much what I was looking for and a clean bar!!!! She apologised in a very sarcastic manner.  I walked away from the bar.  I\u2019m hugely disappointed with this hotel.  You can\u2019t do this to customers and expect a reputation which will attract the people who can and are will to pay the prices you charge.  The room service is another saga (which I really don\u2019t have the energy for). You guys have a lot to learn, not 5 star I\u2019m afraid, your pushing 4.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There was no upgrade at check in, first disappointment which is minor and not guaranteed. The BIG issue was the erroneous charges! I was charged by AMEX at the time of booking. When I checked into the hotel they put a hold on my card for incidentals, this was fine by us. The next morning I saw my AMEX had been charged again by Casa Cipriani for the room. I called the front desk and they acknowledged the glitch and said the charge would be removed. When I checked out they again confirmed the pending charge would drop off. 3 days later the charge posted so I called the property. They claim to have no record of charging me and said it must be an AMeX issue!! The Charge from AMEX shows up as AMEX Fine Hotels, the charge from Casa Cirprini shows up under their name! The manager was rude and also said \u201cyou booked through Expedia\u201d which i guess is who AMEX uses for their bookings and treated me like I was second class. I called AMeX and they are handling but what a mess and waste of time for an ok property that is over priced! Don\u2019t stay here if using AMEX- just don\u2019t!!\nIn looking at other reviews I see this \u201cglitch\u201d happens often!

Our room had a toilet that wouldn't stop running, TV didn't work most of the stay and the room smelled at night when we returned.  They charged our credit card 4 times what the room should cost the day we checked in to the hotel. Even though it was only a hold on our credit card it was excessive, upsetting and not authorized by us. When we complained they said there was no one available to take care of the charge at the moment. We spent way too much time speaking to different employees and management for the small courtesy's the manager extended to us. The club has spectacular views and food and service were amazing. However, I would not recommend staying at the hotel until they get their act together.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

It has an appropriate nautical design with an elegant old world feel. The Fulton suite is the perfect balance of form and function. You feel like you are in a stately opulent suite of a grand luxury liner. Since the hotel is new, everything is crisp and perfect. All the latest tech is subtly integrated, so as not to distract from your fantasy voyage. But, none of this would work without the old world service to match the design. Casa Cipriani has it in spades. I don\u2019t know what kind of training program Casa Ciprani has, but their entire team, to a person, executes on a level that I have rarely experienced in my thirty years of high end luxury travel.
