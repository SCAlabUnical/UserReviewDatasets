If you're doing a noisy #2, anyone in the hall can hear you. I could hear the guy across the hall or next door having a shower. Not worth the money!!!! Oh, and the cleaning lady came and knocked on my door at 8:15 to clean the room, luckily I was actually just about to leave and not sitting on the toilet, but checkout is supposed to be 11am. WTF There's cameras everywhere in the hallways, so they must have seen me leave around 7am to go get a redeye at Starbucks, but then not seen me come back.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":3235844,"title":"Clean, inexpensive home base for exploring Manhattan","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2024-01-14","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Pod 39 was perfect for my 3-day (2-night) trip to New York. My single pod was tiny like a dorm room, probably smaller than my office at work, but all I was doing there was sleeping and showering so I didn't care about the size. It was clean and efficiently laid out. I did not smell anyone breaking the no smoking rule (and I have an extremely keen sniffer). I was on the 9th floor and I think my room faced the back. It was quiet - although note that my stay was on weeknights, not sure if it gets louder on weekends. I saw mostly young and middle aged people there - I'm in my early 50s and did not feel out of place.\n\nMy main reason for travel was to attend a concert at Madison Square Garden so I wanted accommodations within quick walking distance - knowing it would be late when the concert let out. This spot is a super quick walk from Grand Central Station - Google says 7 minutes, that sounds about right. A change in my flights ended up putting me at Penn station for arrival instead, but even that wasn't too far a walk with carry-on luggage. Lots of amenities all around and this central location was a great starting point for my daily adventures. It was helpful that they will hold your luggage for you before or after check-out (just not overnight).\n\nI can't comment on the rooftop bar, because it it's closed for the winter - I knew that in advance. I didn't spend much time in the lounge but ate my breakfast there one morning, it has a cozy vibe. When I checked in, staff gave me a 25% discount card for the Allerton Club which I think is new and maybe connects to the lounge. Might have used it after my concert but there wasn't enough time before it closed for the night.\n\nOnly a few things preventing me from giving this hotel a 5 rating. 1. The mattress was too soft for me...I prefer a very very firm mattress. 2. My nose is quite sensitive so the scent of the soap and shampoo in the room made it twitch. It wasn't overwhelming, though, and I was able to open the window for a few minutes each time I came in to let the room air out. 3. The last time I looked at the website not long before my trip, it said there's a complimentary breakfast of coffee, tea, pastries, fruit and yogurt - but only the coffee\/tea was free. I paid a reasonable price for yogurt with fruit\/granola both mornings but it would have been nice to have been notified about the change.\n\nAll in all, this hotel is great value for the cost. I would stay there again. If you're the kind of person who feels the hotel is a big part of your travel experience, this probably isn't the place for you. But I would recommend it to anyone who is most interested in exploring the city and only using a hotel as a place to sleep and get clean.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

The room could have used a few more outlets for charging of devices such as cell phones, iWatchs, laptop etc.  The bathroom could have used 1-2 shelves for hygiene\/toiletry items for which there was room to install. When we booked our room in early August the hotel website advertised a Mexican restaurant but when we arrived it was permanently closed, this was disappointing because we looked forward to some Mexican food and drinks at our hotel during our NYC stay.  We chose to stay here because at the time of booking other hotels in the same area were $100-150 more per night.

We asked three times if they could turn the volume down on the two games and keep the music or just have the volume for one game and no music or the other game's volume. \n\nThey blew us off multiple times even though they said they were addressing it. When we tried to move to the bar up front where it was a little bit quieter they kicked us out even though management told us we could go in there. When we explained the problem, they were just rude. We went back to the lounge and asked again. We were ignored so we sat in the lounge in front of the check-in desk and ate our food because we couldn't fit in our room to eat it because there was no space. \n\nWe chose not to stay any longer and booked a room at the Scherman Hotel on the west side of Midtown. It was excellent and quiet. It cost 1\/2 as much as POD 39. ","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The bathroom door is glass and only partially frosted, and the frosted glass turns into clear glass at around the 5 foot mark. In the bunk bed room you'll have to actively avoid being near the bathroom door if you want to avoid seeing the other person using the bathroom (which can be challenging given that the room is very small and when you're laying on the top bunk, you're looking directly through the clear glass into the bathroom's wall of mirror, which reflects everything happening in the bathroom). \n\nThe bathroom door doesn't latch and sometimes gradually slid open on its own, leaving the sliding door open a few inches. There's no bathroom fan so the other person can hear everything. I stayed with a friend and I got ready first while they slept in and then went downstairs to have coffee and wait in the first floor lounge area while they got ready as a way to give them privacy. There are also private toilet stalls on the bottom floor of the hotel that guests can use which is helpful.\n\nIf you want a quiet room, ask for one of the lower floor rooms, away from the elevator. On the 14th floor, I heard the music from the 17th floor rooftop bar until after 10pm. The staff were great about moving me to a lower floor for the rest of my stay and I couldn't hear the music from the 6th floor. \n\nOtherwise, the hotel was great for the price and location. We stayed in late July and the air conditioning was terrific. The room was clean and the cleaning staff were very friendly and efficient. I was able to check in early when I arrived in the morning from a red eye flight, which was amazing.

From the moment I arrived till the last second I had to leave everything was done with much enthusiasm and dedication! To all the staff thank you for a very pleasant stay. I would definitely recommend and\/or stay there again myself. The location was awesome. Just 3 minutes out of Grand Central. Great scenery, shops, restaurants just on walking distance. I had an average of 45000 steps a day on my iPhone. (Thanks Apple)\n\nIf you want to go further than walking 5-10 blocks, just take the Subway to every inch of NYC. It's accessible, fast, easy and sometimes just fun to witness. Getting back to Pod 39 is never a problem! Take the subway or just take a cab if it's late at night and you want to go faster. You choose...\n\nIt was too bad that a lot of buildings in the same street are under construction. So no sleeping in unfortunately and a lot of honking...(weekend was no problem). However, this was just a very minor, minuscule setback into what became a very epic and pleasant stay at Pod 39 and visiting NYC. \n\nMy room also had everything that you need for a city trip to NYC. Bathroom and room service facilities were on point. I slept like a baby on the bed. The only thing that I missed was a clear \"Pod 39 welcome to the room and here are our rules\" form. I think that would've solved a few of my questions instantly. But everything became clear eventually. Just pay close attention and\/or ask the staff. They'll be happy to help...\n\nPod 39 also has a rooftop terras that I didn't make any use of due to other\/prior engagements. But I've seen people come down the elevator quite happy so that must mean something. And also people who didn't even stay at Pod 39 found their way towards the rooftop terras. So I'll definitely try that out next time. \n\nAbout the staff: nothing but compliments. They were so considerate and always thinking along with you. Customer service is really one of their best virtues. From young till old, normal or in any way disabled, fit or not so fit: the staff will do their utmost best to deliver the best experience to every guest they get.

You could also walk to broadway and Times Square the grand central train station was less then 10 mins away.\nOn the very top floor it\u2019s has the most amazing views of the city and a  bar  with great music , they also have a restaurant attached to the hotel that serves breakfast if I\u2019m not mistaken and a pool and ping-pong table.\nOverall this was a great stay and can\u2019t wait to come back","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It might be adequate for 1 person but way too small for 2 people. There is really nowhere to put our stuff and we only had one backpack each. Bathroom door and shower wall is all semi-frosted glass so there\u2019s no privacy. On top of which the door couldn\u2019t fully close\u2014 think poop smells throughout the room each time someone had to go #2. Tv is tiny and doesn\u2019t swivel and when you open the window blinds it just covers half the tv. What a joke. The absolute worst thing about our stay was 3 full days of fire alarm testing that we were not made aware of before booking. Alarm testing started around 9am and went through the afternoon! Totally unacceptable! Not only could I not sleep in but I couldn\u2019t work from my hotel room. The alarms were nonstop and obnoxiously loud. I felt like I was being tortured and was forced to leave to find some peace. I had other options with even lower prices, so I would not have chosen to stay if I had known about the fire alarms beforehand. I asked the front desk about a discounted stay due to the fire alarm disturbance and not only did they say no, they weren\u2019t nice or apologetic about it. Also, the rooftop bar is closed until spring! It was a big reason for staying there. Overall, I do not recommend Pod 39. Location was mediocre, other than being close to Grand Central, location wasn\u2019t great. No food open late at night in that area.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a very early flight and we were able to drop our bags at the hotel baggage storage at 9:30am and set off on exploring the city. We returned around 1\/2pm to find out that the room was ready and we could check in. As we like to do things on a budget, we had booked a bunk pod because we got a pretty good deal on it. Upon finding out we were a couple and celebrating my 30th birthday, Frankie upgraded us free of charge to a Queen pod, which was absolutely AMAZING! I can\u2019t believe he did that for us, even now after we\u2019re back home! It was so kind. The room IS small, but if you\u2019re in NYC to explore and not lay in the hotel room it\u2019s perfect. The bed is super comfortable and there is so much storage. The bathroom is also perfect, and we even had a perfect view of the Empire State Building from ours!! They also make up your room EVERYDAY which is so hard to find in NYC. Frankie REALLY kicked our stay off with a Great start by upgrading us and giving us a restaurant suggestion that we loved (skirt steak!).

Go for the single room... & at Pod 39, you get a private bathroom in your room. Yes, it's tiny, but space is well-used, with the combo table\/shelf\/closet rack piece, the desk, and the under-bed storage (big drawer & a space to store luggage). There's plenty of room for all of my stuff... & that's saying alot! I'm not known for travelling light & this time was worse as I drove to NY. The drawer & rack held all of my clothes & more. The bed was very comfy (I really need relief at the pressure points...I'm old...ish.) I kept a cooler in my room & made much use of the ice machine (which had no trouble servicing a full hotel in the heat of summer). The front-desk people were helpful & courteous in my experience. The cleaning staff on my floor were very courteous & friendly. It's a convenient walk to Grand Central, so I easily got where I needed to go each day. \nI know I'm gushing, but it's just the best deal in town for a clean, private room\/bath in a nice hotel & location! I've also stayed at Pod 51 & loved it too. I was with my son, so we had a bunkbed room. There were shared hall baths on the floor. There were enough so that I never waited for one...& they're very clean. Your room key gets you into one & then you have full prviacy for toilet\/shower. Otherwise, you have everything you need in your room (including a sink).\nI think Pod 51 was a great option for 2 people, whereas this stay in my single at Pod 39 was great for 1 person. I agree with other reviews that the in-room baths wouldn't be so private if there are 2 of you in the room. \nLOVE the PODs!! ","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

The AC worked great! I like to keep the room cold when I sleep and I actually had to turn down the AC a bit. You would expect a small room to be stuffy, but it wasn't at all. It would have been nice to have a fan in the bathroom, but it wasn't a problem. \n\nThe room was tiny but perfect for us, a couple in our 50s. It was clean, the bed and pillows very comfortable. The towels were good and plentiful. The bathroom was equipped with plenty of shampoo, conditioner and body wash. There was a small bar of soap for handwashing at the sink. There was a hairdryer too, but we didn't use it. I did use the desk to work for a few hours, but aside from that we were only there to sleep and shower. I really appreciated the free coffee available in the lobby in the mornings. \n\nWifi was adequate for us. We only used it for basic internet browsing. Lighting was well thought out. Plenty of bright light with good, even coverage when you needed it and dimmers in both the bedroom and bathroom when you didn't want it bright. Reading sconces at the bed. \n\nI think my favorite aspect of the room was the minimal fabrics. No drapes, dust ruffles, bedcover or upholstery to collect dust and other icky stuff. Even the carpet was low-pile tiles that could easily be replaced in case of spills and stains. \n\nThe staff is busy but friendly. We had to wait a bit to check-in while they were working behind the counter, but not a crazy long time. It's easy to get impatient after you've been traveling all day. \n\nWe checked our bags on check-out day so we could spend more time in the city. No problems. \n\nThings to know: \n\nIf there are two of you, you may want to bring one extra long charging cable (if you have one) for your phone; there was an outlet on only one side of the bed. The desk area had at least one USB charging port and a regular outlet, and some other ports I didn't pay attention to. \n\nIf you are parking at the ICON garage, don't make a parking reservation on their website. The hotel discount only works for drive-up customers. They will valet park your car, so you must leave your key. They are really strict about the amount of time you leave your car there. If you are late picking it up, you have to pay for a whole additional day. You get 24 hours of parking for each hotel night you stay. If you start parking at 3:30 PM, you have until 3:30 PM on your hotel check-out day to retrieve your car.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

It's pretty much a place to drop my bag, freshen up, shower, and sleep. I was very pleased with the price and location of this hotel. The room was clean and well appointed (I still had a spot to hang up my clothes for the theatre, and there are even drawers and luggage storage under the bed if you're traveling with a suitcase, I happened to be traveling light as this was a quick trip.)\n\nThe full pod might feel cramped if you are traveling as a couple, especially since the toilet\/bathroom is a mere three feet from the bed (separated by a frosted glass sliding door). But as a solo traveler, this was everything I needed. I booked the room with a private bath, so can't speak to the shared bathroom situation firsthand. But from what I could glean, they are NOT \"communal\" baths like you'd see in a dorm. Instead, there are several on each floor, but they are for one person to use at a time. So they are shared, but still very much private. If you are traveling as a couple or group and are budget-conscious, the bunk or single pods utilizing the shared bathrooms seems like an excellent choice. \n\nI will definitely be back. The Pod offers a great option for those who need a simple, no frills room at a decent price. \n","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Do note that there is no minifridge, no kettle\/coffee machine, and no toiletries apart from soap, shampoo, conditioner and body wash. (If, like me, the airline lost your bags, you'll need to step out and buy a toothbrush and toothpaste.) There is also no stand on which to open your suitcase, but there is space under the bed to store it, as well as a drawer for your stuff. There is a small amount of storage space, as well as a small safe to store your valuables\/passport etc. I didn't use it but it will probably also fit an iPad or compact laptop. Power sockets are by the desk so a bit of a reach if you like to have your phone next to you when sleeping. Room came equipped with a small TV on the wall, I didn't make use of it though. The room is comfortable for one person, probably a little tight for two, especially if you're not a couple - the bathroom has a frosted glass partition for a wall so getting ready in the morning may be a bit of a challenge in terms of privacy. Housekeeping comes around every morning and you can choose whether you'd like them to make up your room while you're out - I chose not to since I was only there for 4 nights, though I did have them take the trash whenever they came by. If you have the choice, take a room on a higher floor for a better view and more light - I was on the 12th floor. \n\nFront Desk: very polite, helpful, efficient. There is typically a resort fee that is payable over and above the room rate+tax -  it was $22.95\/night as of July 2022. They will also take a security deposit of $30\/night (avg) at checkin which will be refunded to you on checkout. Front desk also kindly stored my bags for a few hours after checkout as I had a train out later in the day. \n\nOther facilities: there is a fitness center that I did not have the chance to use, I'm not sure if you need to pay extra to access it. There is no breakfast to speak of - coffee, tea, and granola bars are served every morning from around 7 to 10, so plan accordingly. There's a Shake Shake around the corner on 3rd, and a deli at the corner of Lexington, so you can always plan to eat there. There is also a nice dimsum place right across from the deli if that's more your speed.\n\nOverall, would recommend, though you should know exactly what you get for what you're paying.

We usually stay at Pod 51 but it was full when we booked.  Our room was pretty small; only full pod rooms were available and we like to stay in Queen, but after a day or two we became accustomed to the space.  We were on the 13th floor next to the elevator.  Thankfully, the elevator was not an issue.  We love the free walking tours that the Pod offers and took advantage of two this stay.  We had to go to the Times Square Pod to meet up for one and to Pod 51 for the other as no tours start from this hotel.  The hotel is very convenient to Grand Central Station.  There is a good breakfast place on Lexington called Bagel Express that we frequented each morning.  For dinner, we ate at Wagamama, which was good and very reasonable, on 3rd Avenue and the House of Lasagna on Lexington, a little more expensive but also quite good.  The rooftop is an excellent place to hang out.  The bar is open from 4 to 9 p.m. and attracts a lot of people in good weather.  There is also a cool neighborhood bar called the Junction on Lexington right across the street.  We had one issue in our room:  there was no body wash in the shower when we arrived.  I told the front desk and it was taken care of that day.  All in all, very happy with this place.  ","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

It's located in Murray Hill, a midtown east neighborhood that's teeming with restaurants but, most of all, is located a quick and easy walk away to Grand Central Station, where you can light out anywhere you want in Manhattan and the boroughs via the subway.\n\nThe hotel itself is great: fair prices for a clean, efficient room. The beds are terrific for a good night's sleep; the rain shower feature adds a touch of welcome luxury. It's a busy hotel, with lots of guests; the elevators are quick and efficient.\n\nThe most important aspect to bear in mind: the rooms are small. Just large enough to fit a bed, bath, wall-mounted TV, and small desk. The logic being you'll spend most of your time in the city, not in your hotel room. If you're in a family or group larger than 2, you'd need more than 1 room; 2 people max can fit a room snugly.

Good location, close to Grand Central Station. Room is like expected, small but enough, but the pipes noises\u2026.terrible. When you or your neighbors open the shower tap\u2026OMG, terrible noises. Cleaning service is not the best. Ok you can live with that but the worst thing: employees. The billing service is the worst I ever seen. I arrived in May, 6th in the evening. In the morning they charged 152\u20ac (held money)to my credit card, that\u2019s correct but on arrival they charged 906\u20ac (held money). I asked to the receptionist why. He said that I should pay a security extra charge ( will be refund at the end of the stay). I booked on Booking.com (All the taxes and extra charges were paid). Then another receptionist (Veronica) said to me I did not know what I was talking about. Excuse me?. I am 52 and I have been working in hotels for the last 25 years, may be you don\u2019t know what are you talking about miss. Then her  colleague said to me: THIS IS NY. What?. If I visit NY you can do what you want? (this is my 7th stay in NY by the way). You are mistaken man!. Well, they insisted again and again and was 10.30 pm (after 11 hours flying). Tomorrow will be a new day. Early in the morning I talked to Willi (Night Shift), a really good guy!. He said their colleagues made a mistake (obviously). \u201cHe released my money\u201d and charged the correct rate (725\u20ac held). Well, two days later I did\u2019t have money in my account. Again to the front desk asking about that. I decided to talk to the front desk manager (Brian) after talk to my bank (37\u20ac for the phone call). Correct he said. You are right. I know but what about my money? (1800\u20ac approx). Well, I will release your money (again) I will send an email to you for your bank. I will call to our bank asking for a fast release. Well how long will it take?. I don\u2019t know ?????. Tomorrow I will be leaving NY and I don\u2019t have my money and I don\u2019t know how long will it take so\u2026.If you what to have your money safe don\u2019t stay in this hotel. Oh, one more thing, they charged 759\u20ac and the correct rate was 733\u20ac. A 5 years old child could do a better work the those employees (except Willi and Brian). Hope to see my money soon. I said it to Brian. You can be New Yorkers, you can live in one of the best countries in the world but you are not better than other people. In fact, your salary is coming from us. They said they have less visitors than before the COVID. What do you expect working like  this, talking to your guests like this?.

As a grad student with a family of 4 money is ridiculously tight.  So I didn't want to spend a lot on a hotel, I just wanted to stay somewhere clean and safe since I was a female traveling alone.  I booked the hotel for 5-nights, 2 for sightseeing, and then the rest for the class.  I paid the extra for a double-bed with a private bath.  The hotel and the room were spotless.  Each and every employee that I interacted with were polite, helpful, friendly, and welcoming.  The hotel is centrally located.  Grand Central Terminal (Station) was about a block away, which was handy for buying a little bit of cheese, meat, and fruit for enjoying in my room.  There are no microwaves, refrigerators, or coffee pots.  While I would have preferred to have one of each, I was happy to not have to pay the extra for those little conviences.  The heater\/air conditioner did a spectacular job!  And it was nice to have windows on 2 of the walls.  I think the space is perfect for one person.  Maybe 2 people if they are young and tiny.  But I would not stay there with my husband as we are both middle-aged adults with a little extra on our middles.  And between our little bit of extra pudge and the extra creaks in our joints, I just don't think we'd sleep comfortably here, but it was perfect for just me.  :)  I would totally recommend and if I have the need to stay in Manhatten again, I won't hesitate to book a pod.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The bed was very comfortable and I fell asleep quickly. The location is obviously fantastic, yet the price is substantially lower than what you would pay at most chain hotels in the area. The in-hotel restaurant, Empellon al Pastor, is quite tasty and reasonable in price. My only complaint was the quality of breakfast offerings, which were just bagels and muffins (no go for those on keto) but there\u2019s a solid diner less than a block from the hotel that sufficed.

It was definitely budget friendly and I certainly felt it was value for money. \nSome people are commenting on the size of room. Personally as a solo traveller I felt it was all I needed and it was actually bigger than I anticipated! Perfect for when you are just needing somewhere to rest your head at night. My room was always kept nice and clean by the housekeeping team and I experienced no noise problems whether indoors from other rooms or from outdoors. The only noise issue was the sound of the heater which was quite loud and I did not keep on for too long as I was concerned it may be annoying others. However, the heater itself functioned so that made me happy and I had no air-con issues like I have sometimes experienced elsewhere!\nIn terms of the location of the hotel, I could not have asked for more with a CVS and chains like Starbucks, Chipotle and Pret in the immediate area (not including the food court at Grand Central). Minutes from Grand Central which opened the rest of Manhattan and the other boroughs up to you by subway. Also walking distance from major attractions such as the Public Library, Bryant Park, Times Square, Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller.\nOverall as a solo female traveller I felt very safe and secure both in the hotel and walking around the surrounding area. I did not speak to the hotel team often but when I did on checking in and out, they were always very helpful. Only slight surprise was a $30 security deposit each day which would be returned at the end of the stay but the hotel was open about that when checking in and it would certainly not stop me staying there again. So happy I chose to stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend. Modern, clean, budget friendly and with a great location.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I've been to many budget hotels in NA and this is probably the second worst one (loud hvac fan). I stayed in a single pod and it is quite small for a petite lady. If you are larger it is advisable that you upgrade to a queen pod. If you are a couple and want to have a comfortable bed to sleep in, (despite the room saying it will fit two people) book a bunk bed room instead, and maybe spend extra to skip this place. If you are sensitive to sound, look elsewhere. Forget this place!!! There is a fan in the bathroom that is incredibly loud, and you cannot turn it off because you would suffocate in such a tiny room (how does no one mention this???). It took me 2 nights to get used to the sound, and it was not a pleasant experience!!! It took me forever to sleep during the first night, and I was woken up again by the noise. I would have chosen somewhere else had I known the noise level. Cheap bedding, cheap toilet paper, I've had better at other budget hotels. The room is also *not* soundproof, despite advertised as. I have been woken up many times in the morning by people knocking, talking, and have heard people walk in and out. Depending when you shower, the water is not always warm. On Thursday I showered around 11PM, and the water was barely warm. If you are staying here, I advise you to shower early, at 8 - 9PM or else deal with poor pressure and lukewarm...even cold water. Room service and cleanliness is *very* good. My room is pristine when I return in the evening. Cleaning staff is very nice. The location is great, steps away from the metro and lots of places to eat at within a 5 minute walk. Anyway...not really a hotel experience, but more like an expensive hostel. Hope I get my deposit back haha. PS: I rather pay extra for printing and tours I never used than get charged extra. Wish there was a kettle in the room - there is always a kettle in hotels I've stayed at.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Yes the rooms are small, but this is the whole concept of the hotel, anyone who complains about the room sizes clearly didn\u2019t do any research and therefore has no grounds to moan.  I stayed in a Queen pod and the room was perfect for what I needed it for \u2013 somewhere to get my head down after a busy day of sightseeing.  There were about 6 coat hangers and 2 hooks on the wall for coats, plenty of clean towels every day and the shampoo, conditioner and shower gel provided was lovely.  My room was on the 12th floor and I never heard any noise at all.  There was a bar just off the lobby and on the roof, I didn\u2019t make it in for a drink but they looked pretty lively.  The location of the hotel was great too, a few streets away from Grand Central  and the subway line and about a 10 minute walk from Times Square.  The staff reception and at the concierge desk were also very friendly and helpful.  If I return to New York I will definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Our toilet lid was broke, however it was quickly fixed. There is one very narrow long shelf that things would fall from. The sink was small with no room to place anything. The single faucet knob offered no pressure adjustment. The shower had the same single knob and a full curtain that would flow inward and stick to your body. We suggest using your own shampoo and conditioner, as the cell-supplied were low quality. The towels were thin and there was no out-of-shower mat. We just used another towel. \n\nThe cell had one tiny shuttered window behind the beds that would offer minimum light when opened. It only added to the claustrophobic feeling. The metal shelf located and each bunk had a plug for convenient charging. I swung my hand while sleeping and everything fell to the bottom bunk. \n\nThe hotel staff were very friendly and seemed to be this places only saving grace. It is in a good location with about a five minute walk to Grand Central Station.

There was no room to keep a suitcase open, so we used the table as closet, with two piles of clothes \ud83d\ude0a. One downside was the airconditioning blowing in the face of the one that slept in the bottom bunk bed, but we solved that by sleeping the other way around (head where the feet were supposed to be). Unfortunately no room with a view, but not all rooms can be at the street side. Very quiet room though (we slept at the end of the hallway which probably helped). At ground level there is a bar, which produced one hell of a sound when we arrived, so I was afraid for all the noise, but even though we only slept at the fifth floor, we didn\u2019t hear a thing! All in all, a very very small room, adequately furnished and cleaned, but you really don\u2019t need more because you spend so little time there (some nights even less than 7 hours \ud83d\ude0a).","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

To be sure, they are small; but the room I stayed in was roomy enough for me to work, walk around and even put up a full ironing board and iron.  The rooftop bar area was also quite nice; I didn't visit it every evening because it's quite popular and I needed more quiet.  But it was lovely on a hot summer night.  The food was also pretty good.  And I found the staff to be more than a joy! They are, almost without exception, patient, professional, courteous and good humored.  And frankly, they're all supercuts; it must be a prerequisite! All in all, I'd stay here again. [If I have one teeny quibble, it's that my room didn't get cleaned every day unless I called downstairs to request it and then it was \"light cleaning\" meaning new towels and making up the bed.  I usually care much more about this kind of thing but a combination of an unsuccessful trip and otherwise stellar service make it a minor quibble].","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The bedding was comfortable and we slept well the whole time we were there. We also had a great view of the Empire State Building from our room. Having little charging areas near the bed was also helpful. We had room 1514 as a recommendation towards a good view. \n\nThe service provided by Pod was awesome! They helped us store our bags after we checked our, made sure we had transfers and everything else in between. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s definitely somewhere I would stay at again! Well done Pod!

It makes no bones about the fact the fact that it\u2019s not a luxury hotel and it really isn\u2019t. We wanted somewhere clean with a comfortable bed  to rest our heads after a busy day\u2019s sightseeing so top of the range accommodation was not required. And we got exactly what we paid for - we knew it was a budget hotel. Other than the most basic of toiletries and a hairdryer there are no extras - no tea and coffee making facilities, no iron or ironing board. One very irritating thing was that only one of the lifts was working throughout our 5 day stay in a hotel with many floors and a rooftop bar!\nThere is an ice machine on one of the upper floors, but no-one tells you about it when you check in - we only found out about because we visited the bar and asked for ice and it was the bar staff who told us. It\u2019s this lack of basic information and a general unhelpfulness that caused me to mark it down to a 3 rather than 4. So for example the night before we left we asked the concierge to arrange a taxi for us in the morning but he refused to do it because we weren\u2019t travelling to the airport - we were going by luxury coach to our next destination. He told us to hail a cab on the street, which was not easy because out side the hotel there was loads of scaffolding restricting our view, so we had to trundle two heavy suitcases up to Lexington Avenue. It felt pretty disobliging to be honest. \nIn summary, stay if you are on a limited budget and want to be in a reasonable location, but it certainly isn\u2019t grand and the staff aren\u2019t that great.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The most important thing was that it was comfortable, very clean and I felt very safe. A safe was in the room for valuables. The hotel is located close to restaurants, cafes,  and small convenience stores. The closest subway station is at Grand Central Station which is a hub for many subway lines. Being close to Grand Central, there is easy access to banks as well. The area is well lit at all hours of the night. The staff was very helpful in giving me information I needed  and at the end getting me a car to the airport. There is a restaurant on site that offers breakfast in the morning. It also has a rooftop bar. The water pressure was very good  with no lack of hot water. The other guests were of mix of business people and tourists. There is a front door man  and another man in the lobby at night for security. In the elevator there was a badge reader that you needed to press your room card against to be allowed to press the button for your floor.  When I checked out at noon, they automatically offered to store my luggage for the rest of the day until I went to the airport. The price was moderate for NYC and good value for the money.

But NYC is just pricey for food, so suck it up and just pay haha.\n\nHotel staff was ok. Not rude, but not overly friendly. I noticed their interaction with a blind guest in the lobby which was a bit disappointing - they kind of ignored her as she was just standing there. No one came in to help her from the door which they should have to guide her.\n\nThey offer digital services through phone\/computer if you connect to wifi... but we waited like 20 minutes after we requested a towel.

Higiene mais ou menos, n\u00e3o olhe nos cantos e n\u00e3o procure em baixo da cama pois vai achar. Por vezes se sa\u00edamos tarde (9h) nem cama arrumavam mesmo com aviso na porta. Janelas n\u00e3o vedam do frio que vem direto na cabe\u00e7a! rooftop permanece fechado em inverno. Restaurante de boa f\u00e9: perdemos cart\u00e3o de cr\u00e9dito e nos devolveram dia seguinte. Apesar disso, \u00f3tima localiza\u00e7\u00e3o a duas quadras da Grand Central esta\u00e7\u00e3o, com \u00f3timo Wi-Fi e pr\u00f3ximo ao Starbucks.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}
