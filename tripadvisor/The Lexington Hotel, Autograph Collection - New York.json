We stayed there for 7 days\/6 nights, from March 23rd to 29th, 2024. The welcoming was smooth even speaking in French (A BONUS) forgot the name of the gentlemen, with clear explanation of the details and destination fee, but few info were missing that was clearly explain at the bar. Great Crunch gym in the basement. In their bar\/restaurant (THE STAYTON ROOM) from the amazing smile and service of quality of Maria C., made us feel welcomed, to the smile of Valentina S. and Brandy the subsequent days and great convo with Kush who knows how to entertain guest, the staff was incredible. Notable mention to the manager Rachel for extending our late check out to meet our needs and finally to Nicole at check out, after an error on the destination fee that was missing a day discount, immediately corrected and add an extra day discount for the error. The hotel is old so you could hear a little but not much in the other rooms but a 95 years old hotel you could not ask for more, room are not big but very nice and clean. Location is perfect and on point. The only downside was the constant construction in the street starting around 10-11 pm through the night but can't blame the hotel for that. A little pricey but you feel the quality of it and what you pay to be in Manhattan. Thank you Lexington for the amazing stay.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Unfortunately no upgrades due to capacity issues. I used a corporate rate for this stay. Price was a little over $300 per night which is reasonable for this brand and location. They offer you bottled water at check in which is good because none in room. \n\nRoom was on 25 \u201celite floor\u201d was small but functional and clean. It took a while to heat up as the heating unit is next to window.  Bath was a single sink and standup shower.

There is a Starbucks on first floor with street access, this surprisingly was open at 6A.\n\nHad buffet breakfast in first floor restaurant.  There is no executive lounge at this location. Breakfast was buffet style and had standard fare, coffee was very good. Self service, no wait staff present at 730A.\n\nOnly comment would be that key access is not required for elevators, meaning anyone off street can access rooms.  There is a doorman and lobby security, but no one checking elevator access.  I inquired at front desk and got a \u201cbecause we don\u2019t offer that feature\u201d explanation.

This was my first and last stay here. Bathtub drain didn\u2019t work well and each day got a little worse. Finally at 9pm on day 3 called front desk to ask for plumber. I was told someone would be right there. But after 30 minutes, and no one showed up, I called again. I called three more times and every time got a voice message and no one returned my call. It\u2019s terrible that you can\u2019t even get a hotel operator or someone at the front desk. What if it was an emergency? Finally, someone showed up at 45 minutes and tried to fix it and said they\u2019d have to come back the next day with a machine. I didn\u2019t want anyone in my room so I just gave up and lived with it for the next few days until I left. When I checked in I was handed two bottles of water and was told I could get more bottles every day but on the third I went to the front desk and asked for more water and they said they were out. The breakfast was terrible. Inconsistent quality. Fruit but poor meager choices. There is a $35 destination fee, which could go towards the breakfast buffet which actually cost more than that and it wasn\u2019t worth it. I like to eat oatmeal for breakfast. The first day I went down there they had oatmeal the second day they did not. My room was very warm despite me putting the air conditioner on when it was 35\u00b0 outside. The only thing is hotel has going for it is its location.

I called the hotel 7 times prior to my stay, leaving messages with the staff I was directed by reservations to contact, because I wanted to arrange a fruit basket or champagne in the room as a surprise upon arrival. I clearly expressed that I was willing to pay a premium for this service. I never received a call back, and my calls were never answered. Even after checking in and informing the front desk of this, we still were never able to arrange any type of fruit basket or champagne delivered to the room (again, we were in no way asking for this for free). I was told I would receive a phone call from the department that handles those requests and that phone call was never received.\u200b I tried calling the front desk from the room multiple times and was never answered.\n\nUpon arrival at the hotel, we noticed the bathtub drain was closed and there was a clear line of film of dirt and grime around the edges and in the base of the tub. Aside from the dirt, it was obvious it hadn't been cleaned because the drain w\u200ba\u200bs plugged. We called the front desk to inform them of this situation, and our calls were never answered. We called repeatedly over the course of several hours and were never answered or responded to. We attempted to speak with the front desk, but the line was so incredibly long and moving so slowly due to only 1 or 2 front desk staff working we opted to just clean the tub ourselves.\n\nAfter an abysmal and incredibly overpriced, \u200bfrankly disgusting continental breakfast that consisted of only juice and bagels for $40 a person, we arrived back to our room to notice the door was locked. My key was not allowing me in. The door was completely shut and locked. After knocking and repeatedly trying my key, a member of the cleaning staff opened the door and said he needed 15 more minutes. We said no, we needed to get into the room, because my mom needed to take her cancer medication. We entered the room to find no cleaning supplies, clean towels, clean sheets, or any indication of cleaning whatsoever, and there was no cleaning cart anywhere to be seen, clearly indicating he was not actually cleaning the room. \nShortly after he left, we noticed my mom's cannabis vape pen for her cancer pain was gone. It had been sitting right on the nightstand, we completely searched high and low (even though she never replaces it because it is entirely necessary for her pain management), and it was nowhere to be found.\u200b We soon noticed her prescription bottles were gone as well as several small designer accessories. I have never been stolen from by hotel staff, and I am shocked that he chose to steal my moms cancer medication that is clearly labeled with a medicinal label. We knew it was the perfect crime, because we had no recourse. It's our word against his, and he would obviously deny it. However, it has never been lost or misplaced, and the\u200bre was no cleaning cart and no cleaning supplies or linens of any kind present in the room.\n\nThe thermostat and temperature control in the room did not work. No matter what we set it at, it stayed at 69 degrees. It was humid and miserable. We again tried to contact the front desk, but our calls were not answered and the lines for the desk stretched to the door. At this point, I attempted to call corporate, where after calling one number 3 times with no response, I tried another, and then finally another, and was finally answered. I opened a case regarding a portion of this feedback. She blatantly told me there was nothing she was going to be able to do besides file it away.\n\nEven without the theft, the hotel was dirty, the food was disgusting, the drinks were horribly made, the hotel front desk was incredibly understaffed, the room was uncomfortable and small and incredibly dirty. We had an absolutely horrible experience and I would absolutely never stay in this hotel, even for the location. Also, make sure to lock up EVERYTHING in the safe if you are going to let housekeeping into your room. Anything designer, any medications, money, anything of any value at all.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

First, we found it to be a consistently comfortable, value-priced place to stay for frequent business travel (for midtown meetings and Financial District meetings, given the hotel's proximity to the 4-5-6 subway that goes express to Wall Street). Over time, it became our go-to for visiting family (close family moved to NYC over the last number of years), visits for theatre weekends, etc.  It served as a host hotel for our child's wedding back in those pre-pandemic days. I really can't overstate what a well-run, quality property the Lexington is.\n\nSince re-opening after the pandemic, the Lexington has, if anything, improved on its former self.  Whereas we recognize many of the staff from pre-2020 (another good sign about a hotel), management and ownership have changed.  I would say for the better. \n\nAs a pre-war building, there are many unique characteristics about the rooms, the overall layout, and the character of the property.  Many different room types for those looking for a choice on their accommodations is quite nice.  The lounge is comfortable, the lobby is busy and the whole decor has an Art-Deco\/ Roaring 20's vibe that's unique and memorable.  The unique character is bolstered by a very capable and genuinely caring staff.  I'm not sure whether The Lexington pops up at the top of searches for places to stay in NYC that deliver both good value and a memorable experience, but take the time to seek it out on your next trip.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93526,"title":" Lexington Lament: A Thanksgiving Stay That Missed the Mark","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-11-27","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Our eagerly anticipated four-night stay at The Lexington during the Thanksgiving holiday turned out to be less than enjoyable, prompting us to reconsider the value of our loyalty to Marriott. Despite the hotel's advantageous location in a quiet area with easy access to Grand Central Station, the parade route, theaters and restaurants, several aspects of our experience left much to be desired.\nFrom the start, the lackluster greeting at check-in established a disappointing tone. Despite my lifetime platinum status, there was no acknowledgment or recognition. Regrettably, we received neither an upgraded room nor the privacy we sought, as the thin walls allowed clear audibility of conversations from the neighboring room, disrupting the intended tranquility.\nThe room itself felt cramped, the bathroom in particular resembles an Italian bathroom with minimal maneuvering space. The absence of a second bedside nightstand added to the inconvenience, and the discomfort extended to the bed, prompting a request for additional pillows. Unfortunately, the front desk's unresponsiveness led to an arduous 8-hour wait after using the Bonvoy mobile app to request the pillows which promptly arrived at 7:00 AM the next day.\nNavigating the hotel's amenities proved equally exasperating. The absence of an ice machine on the 20th floor and the inconvenient closure of the Stanton Room restaurant during happy hour were particularly bothersome. The limited menu, coupled with subpar cocktails and overpriced drinks, left a displeasing taste in our mouths.\nThe breakfast experience mirrored the overall disappointment. A hurried brunch on Saturday, where we were pressured to finish by 10:45 for a swift cleanup, felt more inconvenient than enjoyable. The wait staff's literal yelling of \"last call\" and insistence that we vacate the area added to the unpleasantness of our subpar breakfast. The $35 per day \"destination fee\" should be relabeled \u201cinsult fee\u201d which when combined with the other fees and charges for this added to my already inflated bill, especially as it forced us to endure poorly mixed and cheap beverages at Stanton Room.\nThe staff's apparent overwhelmed state, evident at the front desk and with the bellmen, further contributed to a lack of attentiveness and timely service. Attempts to check out in person were hindered by long lines, prompting an online checkout. Post-checkout, the lack of communication persisted, with over 24 hours passing without receiving a folio. Although quick to secure charges and solicit reviews, the hotel was notably sluggish in providing a detailed bill or updating the app to reflect our stay.\nParking across the street offered a more cost-effective alternative to the hotel's $80\/night charge. The only silver lining was the Starbucks coffee shop located just off the lobby, where using the mobile app provided quicker and better service than the elevators.\nIn summary, our stay at The Lexington fell short of expectations, plagued by unremarkable service, inadequate amenities, and substandard dining experiences. Despite the hotel's potential, the overall experience left us questioning the value and consideration extended to guests, even those with loyalty status.\n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

No view, but plenty of light. The bed was comfortable, the room was spotless, and the housekeeping staff working on my floor (14) were wonderful. Whenever they saw me in the hall they asked if I needed anything and were always pleasant.\n\nThe cons: 1) The $35 daily fee. I didn't get to spend a single penny of it. For what? It wasn't explained and I didn't want to wait through the check-in line (more on that below) to figure out where I could use it besides the bar. The bar\/restaurant either wasn't open during the hours I could get there or was packed to the gills. This charge felt like a slimy ripoff. Just charge me more for the room...or don't. For this reason alone, I don't think I'd stay here again and I stay in a LOT of Marriott properties. 2) I asked for an early check in. Couldn't get it. I know that sometimes happens, so that's all right, but it took me two more attempts to check in later in the day. The line was at least 20-30 people deep each time. Having to spend so much time on check-in (and then waiting to have my bags stored, then waiting to pick them up again) meant I had to shuffle plans. 3) The heating\/cooling in the room doesn't change, despite changing the thermostat\/turning it on or off. The fan is on all the time and is quite loud. It also knocked loudly at random intervals overnight.\n\nOverall: the hotel itself is fine. It's clean and in a great location. The questionable $35 daily fee and long check in lines mean I'll likely look elsewhere for a room next time I'm in NYC.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Also there isn\u2019t a fan in the bathroom. Not a big deal but it\u2019s a tiny bathroom and it gets pretty wet pretty fast even with a short shower. \n\nThey charge a couple bucks per bag if you need to store with the bell desk - which is fine - but the front desk doesn\u2019t tell anybody that - I heard from other guests in addition to myself - and it\u2019s cash only. Again, which is fine, but there is a cash machine by the front desk. When you go to see if your room is ready and they tell you no but go check your bags w the bell captain, why not just explain the cost\/cash only\/refer you to ATM? Instead you go wait in line w the bell captain, then find out you need cash, then go back to front desk for cash, then go wait in line again to check bags. \n\nMost problematic, though, was their accessibility service. I called the hotel direct to request an accessible room after originally booking online. I was told it was all set (and even got a confirmation email.) Was not put in an accessible room.  When I called guest services (I had done messages w the Bonvoy app, plus voicemail message, with no response for at least 15 hours, and then had to call the guest services line about a dozen times before someone picked up). They said there was no record of a request for accessible room (and tried to gaslight me into thinking I had called the wrong number - I had not.) Asked if they could at least give me a shower seat. They first said they didn\u2019t have such a thing. Then said they could move me to an accessible room but none of the rooms with two beds were accessible (I\u2019m w spouse and child so need two beds). I said if they had any accessible rooms with wheel in showers they almost certainly had shower seats and could I please just have one. Finally after being on hold for a lengthy amount of time they agreed to bring me one (the thing I had originally requested and was told they didn\u2019t have.). All is well, I suppose, that ends well, but in 2023 it really shouldn\u2019t be that hard for a major hotel to provide basic accessibility accommodations.

There was no in-room hot drink facilities but if this is an issue for you I believe you can request a coffee maker. The bathroom is very small with a small sized bath and overhead shower but functional. The TV has the Netflix app if you have an account to sign in.

There is a Starbucks counter next to the lobby area and side entrance to the hotel where you can get cakes, muffins, breakfast wraps etc. We also went to the luncheonette cafe nearby a couple of morning for pancakes\/waffles topped with strawberries\/blueberries.\n\nWe went to the bar area on our first evening for a soft drink, there was no table service and had to ask at the bar for 2 cokes which were around $9 each including a service charge which I think is a bit cheeky and expensive as I was given unopened cans. We did have some food in the bar another evening but it has a very limited menu mainly salads\/pizza.\n\nLocation is great and within walking distant to the Rockefeller centre, Grand Central, Central Park. Times Square etc. Also lots of restaurants around, we liked Toscana 49 and The Smith the best for our evening meal.\n\nThis hotel is cashless and we added a few items to our room but were never asked to show our room card to check we had given the correct room number and you cannot view the room account via the TV as other Marriott hotels we have been to and to my surprise no invoice was placed under the room door early in the morning on check out day. When we went to reception to check out we were told by a different receptionist to the one who checked us in that your good to go, I said we should have a few room charges to which the receptionist replied yes you have but I had to ask for these to be confirmed and printed off so we could check everything was correct before leaving the hotel and country.

First off, an annoyance:  I've never been to a hotel, which is considered more upscale, that charges a fee to hold your bags at the bell desk until room is ready.  Gentleman in front of me was in from Europe, had no American dollars, and was turned away from the bell stand who wouldn't take his bag to hold.  Totally unacceptable.  Then we checked into our room which was very small, but I expected that from what I read.  However, I have had recent knee surgery and already have experienced a fall.  I was concerned because upon entering the room and going into the bathroom, I tripped on the unusually high marble saddle that was the tallest I've seen.  Since I often have the need to get up during the night, I was afraid I would fall.  I spoke to the front desk, and asked me to speak with Assistant Manager Kelvin.  He was totally condescending and smarmy, and basically did nothing.  There were no accessible rooms available.  So I asked that because I was afraid of falling in the room, if I found another hotel, would he reimburse me the points I used.  His immediate reply was \"absolutely not'.  The reason being that I checked in at 12:30 PM and now it was 5:30 PM. I explained we arrived at 11 am, room wasn't ready, but we didn't actually take the keys for the room until 5:30.  He obviously didn't believe me, but finally reluctantly said he would 'take my word for it.'  I nicely asked if he'd be good enough to call the Residence Inn down the street to see if they had availablity for the night and he flatly refused.  So I walked over to the Residence Inn, and they were full, but the gentleman at the front desk of the hotel - a hotel I wasn't even staying at, and was kind enough to call the Courtyard where rooms were available.  The Lexington was a horrible experience with a terrible assistant manager, and lacking even the facade of trying to offer service.  The hotel is a complete disgrace.

I was turned off because I ordered a package to be delivered and paid express shipping for it to arrive the same day as us. When we arrived (3 p.m.) they said they would look into it and bring it up to the room if it had been delivered. Later on I checked my tracking and saw that it had in fact been delivered before our arrival. Nothing had been brought up to the room so I checked with the front desk again and they said the package room was closed for the day so they couldn\u2019t get it for me. Somehow the manager of the hotel doesn\u2019t have access to this room after 5 p.m.? I ended up getting it the next day after I went downstairs first thing and asked again.

I can't remember the lady's name that checked us in but she had the cutest Tom Ford glasses that I complimented her on and we discussed different types of water and how they all taste different. If she reads this I hope she remembers the conversation and knows that I am speaking about her. She was amazing, such a warm welcome to such a big city. The other employees at the front desk at night we just as amazing, Manuel and Phillippe! Kush is such an added gem to your property, I know most bartenders are very personable but he was extraordinarily amazing! We sat at the bar about 10 minutes before it closed and in that short amount of time I felt like I had a new best friend!

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":93526,"title":"Basic rooms","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-07-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Disappointed with the rooms here. I was reminded of the Scottish saying, \"Fur coat and nae knickers\", with this hotel. Yes the public areas look posh - foyer, very expensive bar to one side, mezzanine seating area, even a vending machine selling small bottles of champagne! However once you go up to the rooms the standard falls sharply. The double rooms are very basic and tiny (just enough room to walk round the bed and no more). For UK travellers to give you an idea of the level, the rooms are more basic than a Premier Inn, more on a level with a Travelodge but not as modern. \nThe rooms are in desperate need of a full refurb. They have tried to patch it up e.g. bits of wallpaper and sealant round the bath, but very old and tired. No extras at all e.g. no fridge or tea\/coffee making facilities. You can get ice but this is only available on a few floors (not ours) so good luck finding it.\nThe hotel seemed popular with people on business and flight crew. Although if on business be warned you can't really work from the room - there is a desk squeezed into the corner but there isn't enough room to sit comfortably, there is no ceiling light and outside light is blocked by other buildings so the room is very dark and dreary. It is also too noisy to work after 9am. Although I put a 'do not disturb' sign on the door the housekeeping staff were very noisy, shouting to each other along the corridor and having personal chats outside my door.\nNot sure you could call the breakfast a buffet, there is hardly anything there and it's just laid out on the bar. It is fine if you just want a coffee and bagel but no hot food (they also had some cold meat, cubes of cheese and melon). A door near the lifts opens directly into a Starbucks so you'd be as well getting breakfast there. There is access to a gym in the basement. This is a private gym but guests can sign in. \nWhen we arrived we did order a sharing platter at the bar but it was very small (and expensive) so we had to go out for food. The cocktails were disappointing too.\nThe best thing about this hotel is the location. It felt like a safe enough area and easy to walk to most places.\nIn conclusion, I would say this hotel is fine for a single person, someone on a business trip maybe. However it is too expensive for what you get (you might get a cheaper deal at a weekend as they are quieter without all the business people). In this price range you can find much better hotels in NYC.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff was wonderful, but the condition of the hotel room specifically was atrocious for the price. I paid $2,300 and had a leaking toilet and leaking shower that left the tiled bathroom floor sopping wet after every shower. Several towels and the shower curtain were dirty, but I guess it didn't matter because I needed those towels to sop up the floor after every shower. I know this is the fault of the laundry service and certainly not hotel housekeeping (they were excellent). The wallpaper was peeling and it looks like they painted the ceiling and re-grouted around the bathroom, but paint dripped on everything...all over the floor, wallpaper, even the toilet. The grout was crumbling all over the floor. Since there was so much standing water and really old carpet, the room smelled like dirty socks or the inside of a hockey bag after every shower (mostly the carpet area at the front entrance closest to the bathroom). The back of the room near the bed and radiator smelled like urine. The carpet needs to be ripped out, it was truly disgusting. The toilet had an auto flusher installed at one point (why on earth would you add this to a hotel toilet) but it had since been disabled, so you had to override it to flush each time. I don't know if all rooms are in this condition, but I do not recommend staying here for the price. Positive feedback - comfy bed and pillows, big bathroom, lots of clothes hangers, and a large desk. Location is fantastic. This hotel has potential to be wonderful, but they need to gut these rooms and do a proper renovation. ","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

But on questioning the guy at check in, it was very poorly explained and he then said its actually not necessary and we wouldn\u2019t have to pay it, but on check out a different lady told us we would have to pay it and it is not an optional. We fought back and wasted a good 20 minutes of our last day in the city and explained we were told we were already told we wouldn\u2019t have to pay it. She eventually \u2018spoke with her manager\u2019 and took the payment off. It really felt like we were being taken for idiots and you were trying to make as much money out of us. Every interaction we had with the guys at the check in desk we were left incredibly confused and irritated. It kind of felt like we as the customers were a \u2018hassle\u2019 and they had better things to do.\n\nFurthermore, at checkout we wanted to leave our bags until the evening. As we went and spoke to the \u2018bag guy\u2019, we were surprised to here it would cost 3 dollars per bag, now if you had as much luggage as us that\u2019s an extra 15 dollars on LEAVING A SUITCASE in a hotel we just spent a considerable amount with. I have never experienced this in all the years I have travelled and would never expect to be scammed in the states. I use the word scam as the VERY unprofessional guy who took our bags told us we could only pay in cash! We had to spend an extra 5 dollars getting cash out, utterly ridiculous. The issue is not the money, its the unprofessionalism and the fact you are treated like an idiot as soon as you check out. It left us with a very sour taste in our mouth and that was enough to say I will never recommend this hotel to anyone, or quite frankly visit again.\n\nIt seemed a real shame to have ended what was a great stay in this way, we actually thoroughly enjoyed the hotel room and thought it was a great size for a NY hotel and the location was utterly brilliant.

I am a Titanium Elite who\u2019s stayed in many Marriott properties worldwide, and I was looking forward to this experience.  However, for a five star (Category 6) hotel, this fell so short in many ways:\n\nFront desk service: When checking in, we were denied an upgrade and  given a 5\/F room with a view of the air conditioning unit.  The first staffer claimed there was nothing available. The room had no view, no fridge.  We tried calling guest services five times but no one answered. When we went downstairs and spoke to another staff member at the front desk, we were immediately upgraded to nicer 25\/F. The first staff member didn\u2019t even make an effort.  So disappointing. We\u2019ve been loyal members for over 20 years\n\nDestination charge: $35\/day, not waived for elites. This is not unique to Lexington, and it\u2019s sadly prevalent across NYC hotels.  Regardless, it\u2019s a shady practice just so they can advertise a lower base rate, and save on taxes.  You get a $35 F&B credit but that will get you not even two glasses of wine at the bar.\n\nRoom: The room was small but adequate.  We know this is the norm in NYC so we were prepared. However, toiletries were not restocked daily, nor was the room cleaned by housekeeping.  As guest services was completely unreachable by phone (on this and many other occasions), We had to go down and ask for toiletries and cleaning! Also no bottled water - period.  Only manual water dispensers in the lobby.  It was embarrassing for the hotel\n\nBreakfast: Very limited spread, overcooked bacon and eggs. Weren\u2019t quite sure if it was fresh. \n\nStaff at the restaurant were abrupt and inhospitable.  Yes, it\u2019s a New York thing but there still needs to be some basic level of customer service.  When breakfast ended at 10:30, we were rudely kicked out of the cafe and forced to take our half eaten meal upstairs. Never experienced this before in a Marriott property worldwide.  We\u2019re usually politely asked to move to the lobby or another area of the restaurant.  I understand that the restaurant needs to be cleaned, etc but there is a way to communicate this better, especially at a luxury hotel.\n\nThe worst part: for two days, the breakfast offered expired food.  If we had not been vigilant, we would have fed our kid yogurt  that was 7 days past its sell by date (we have photos).

Onsite market was not connected to the hotel. I couldn't even get a bottle of water as a Titanium Elite for my elderly 75 year old mother. I specifically asked for connecting rooms since I was traveling with my elderly mother. I called the day before - they said it was confirmed. Upon check in - they confirmed they were connecting. When I got upstairs they were not connecting - they were across from each other. I have no choice but to conclude that the people who work here do not know what 'connecting' means. The experience was annoying and sloppy. Quite a few have nailed it, the customer service and the attention to detail is non-existent.\n\nThe breakfast was the most sub par thing I have ever had with limited options - I have had better at TownePlace Suites. This was the first time, since being titanium, I did not feel valued. I put way too much time into calling and requesting connecting rooms, addition of elite nights and points to be done. At one point I was told I did not get points or elite nights which is completely against Marriott's own Terms and Conditions. It took well over a month for my elite night and points to be added which forced me to completely change plans for another trip I had planned.\n\nLike the Le Meridien, I would never under any circumstances spend another dollar here or at an autograph collection period.

I also cannot be Titanium Elite without spending money. No need to remind me how I booked the stay, I did it myself.

As a frequent traveler (including to NYC) and a Marriott Ambassador member, I was tremendously disappointed in how this hotel nickles and dimes its guests to the point of exhaustion.\n\nStart with the basics: The hotel is in an excellent location. Its tiny rooms are standard in NYC, and I don't fault the hotel for that. I hate the scammy $35 \"Destination Fee\" which serves only one purpose: to obscure the price of the hotel and make it difficult to compare against other hotels. This is sadly commonplace in NYC, but its so scammy that it needs to be called out. Don't fall for the marketing lingo that \"it covers (horribly overpriced) drinks and breakfast\" - you're far better suited by eating elsewhere in Manhattan.\n\nThe worst thing about the hotel is that they tried to charge me to store my bags. I\u2019ve stayed at countless hotels around the U.S. and internationally, and nobody hast *ever* charged me for this. It\u2019s a small amount, but it\u2019s cash only (it\u2019s 2022) and it\u2019s a moral outrage that a relatively upscale hotel like this one would nickel and dime guests like this. I avoided this fee by asking for a late-check out and kept the bags in my room instead of paying the fee, but it still left a horrible taste in my mouth.\n\nI know that Covid has been tremendously difficult for hotel owners. But the extend to which this supposedly luxurious hotel cheapened the experience made me certain to go elsewhere during my trip to NYC next month.

I have stayed at Marriott properties in dozens of locations on four continents.

It's in decent shape; the rooms are not totally upgraded, but fine. The staff is courteous.  \n\nNow for the negatives.  This hotel charges a nonvoluntary $35 \"destination fee\" on top of the room rate and taxes.  Here is how the website describes it when you make a reservation. \n \n\"Daily destination fee of USD 35 plus tax will be added to the room rate and includes a daily food and beverage credit of USD 35, Crunch Fitness passes, Citi Bike passes and more.\"\n\nFine print on the website also says guests will receive an additional $35 valet credit - although this is not made clear in the reservation (or anywhere else).\n\nWhen I checked in, no one ever offered or explained how to obtain Citi Bike passes or the Crunch Fitness Passes.  Nor did they provide any other information regarding the $35 fee, or how to redeem the $35 laundry or room credits.\n\nDespite offering a food and beverage credit, there is no restaurant.  The Stayton Room is a bar\/lounge that offers an extremely minimal \"bar fare\" menu at exorbitant (even for NYC) prices.  I ordered one diet coke (can) and a Chicken Quesadilla.  The price: $38!  I have included photos of both my \"order\" and my bill to illustrate how ridiculous these prices are.  \n\nFurther, I stayed for two nights in the hotel on business.  On the first night, I was unable to redeem the laundry or food and beverage credit, because I had evening plans in the city.  When I redeemed the laundry credit the next day - one shirt and one pair of pants - it cost $26!  If I had done that on my first day at the hotel, that would have cost a premium price of $39, because they were not in before 9:00 a.m.  \n\nFinally, while eating my... let's call it a snack... in the Stayton Room, I overheard a prostitute (who was clearly a regular) successfully proposition a hotel guest.  They discussed payments methods, services, and arranged to meet in his hotel room.  Yuck. \n\nSkip this place!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Front desk prior to stay and during stay were rude and unhelpful. I had originally booked the hotel only to find out two day prior that I needed to cancel my trip due to a team member having covid. The hotel staff was so rude on the call and even asked the  question of why I didn't cancel sooner. I unfortunately gave them a second chance booking a second time (another 1k+ for 3 nights) only to find that my experience was just as poor. \n\nUpon check-in, the front desk staff, Jenny, checked me in. She was not very polite asking me twice to put my credit card in the reader without telling me what she was charging and why. She just firmly told me to insert it and that she needed it. Mind you I prepaid so this was totally unacceptable. I then asked a third time and was told it was for incidentals however another 1k+ was charged to my card. I was then also charged the full amount AGAIN and was told by the manager that the system didn't know I had prepaid. Watch your credit card!\n\nIn terms of the stay, there is NO Coffee in the room or on the floor. You must take the elevator down to the common area to get this and it is not marked what is decaf or not. \n\nThe bar offers breakfast and coffee for your $35 voucher each day. If you plan to go to Starbucks within the hotel connected, know they are pretty busy (because the hotel coffee is so rare). We actually stopped to pick up a carafe and we were told they had too many orders and didn't have time for ours.\n\nCleaning was minimal. I did see the cart once and asked for a shower cap and was told to go to the front desk. The cleaning crew did bare minimum and half way replaced towels. \n\nTo shut the door of the room, I had to slam the door shut.  I totally understand why people around had to do the same.  Walls are paper thin - could hear tv constantly next door and plumbing all around. \n\nOverall - location was the only thing this hotel had going for it. Plenty others to choose from. I highly recommend it. I have no idea how this is categorized at 4 star and is under Marriot name.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Of course, I could have booked a suite. \nAfter checked-in, I went to the desk to speak with the manager and asked about the possibility of being upgraded to a suite. The front office manager said that the suite wasn't available that day but to come back the next afternoon to double check with him about the upgrade. \nOur stay was supposed to be for 11 days (business travel\/my spouse's medical visit). On our first night, upon arrival at the room, I called the desk to inform them that the safe wasn't working and requested a clock. \nThe following day, I went to the desk to inform them that we had never received the clock and that no one had come to the room to fix the safe. I saw the agent write a note about my request. We went out of the hotel for my spouse's medical visit. Later in the afternoon, when we returned to the hotel room, we noticed that the clock was never delivered even though the room was already cleaned and made-up. So, I went down to the desk to check on the status of the suite upgrade and to let them know that the clock was never delivered to our room and that we needed someone to fix the safe. \nThe front desk agent told me, \"The manager comes at 3 PM,\" and he is the only one who grants upgrades. (Important to mention that we weren't looking for a free upgrade since we knew that we had booked an executive room; we were willing to pay for the suite upgrade).\nIt is terrible that a front office agent is not empowered to make decisions about room upgrades and that everything must go to the front office manager. We \nwaited until 3 PM to again be declined an upgrade, and the message was that the suites were unavailable. \nI decided to go to the hotel website and was able to book a suite which I never clicked to finalize the reservation because I thought it was deceiving the answers I was getting at the front desk. It all seemed inconvenient for them to move us to another room. We were very frustrated about it, and now it was closed to 7 PM (our second night at the hotel), no clock, and no one had come up to fix the safe. So, I went down to the desk and told them we were checking out the following day.

We again call to the front desk and some guy comes and picks up the underwear with a piece of paper and leaves the chair.

That\u2019s when I found the underwear. \nThis was shocking and not expected especially at this level of hotel. I kept the girls from posting this on social media and called the front desk. The manager on duty had limited options as he had no available rooms for us to move. All he could do was offer for someone to change the linens. Honestly just changing the linens at this point still made me question the cleanliness of the room. The girls and I changed back into our day clothes so we could go wait downstairs. An hour later, we were able to go back to our room. We were greeted with the underwear once again when we got back to the room. \nIt was appalling to find the underwear on the chair. I called down to the manager again. Someone was sent up to grab it. The guy that came in used a piece of paper to grab the underwear and departed. Seriously if he needed a piece of paper to pick it up, why didn\u2019t it occur to him to CLEAN THE CHAIR!  Another call to the manager. At this point, I\u2019m tired and so disgusted with the hotel that we chose to just put the chair in the hallway and go to bed. I\u2019ve never had such a nasty experience as this.\nI am posting this review now because I am not satisfied with how this was handled. We have been loyal to the Marriott chain for years and we were only credited points for our inconvenience.

Toilet had an autoflush feature turned off, so you had to push a metal button to get it to work.  \n\nResort fee -- seems to be with many hotel in NYC area, but their fee came to $35 USD and taxes to $40 USD.   You get the amenities, like a gym access, wifi, breakfast or drink at the bar, or citibike use.   I used for breakfast daily.   But breakfast was not worth $40 USD.   Anyway, it is what it is.\n\nOverall with the positives and negatives, I'd give it an avg based on my stay.   But not worthy of the Autograph level that I have seen in other hotels with this designation.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

The walls are pretty thin since I can hear whenever someone leaves or comes to their room every time.  We did not eat breakfast since it costs just as much as some shops with less options. We only used our 35 resort credit once for a nightcap at the Stayton during our 4-night stay. Again pricey, when i can get the same or better at a rooftop bar.

It\u2019s not your typical hotel decor\/lobby. \n\nIn fact, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many people were there and active in the lobby. The restaurant bar was reasonably full and it was nice to see hotel\/travel coming back to life. \n\nThe person I dealt with at the front desk was awesome. Really warm welcoming and friendly. I believe her name was Marci. (I hope I got that right). We stayed in a room on the 24th floor and really enjoyed it. It was a reasonable size considering we are in the heart of New York City. Speaking of which, the location is such a gem. It\u2019s far enough from Times Square yet close enough to the action. No matter which direction you take  you\u2019ll find something to do. Everything\u2019s walkable and accessible. \n\nWe had the same room staff every day and she was awesome. Always smiling when we saw her in the hallway and made sure we had everything we needed as far as towels and face cloths. Our room always looked great when we came back.\n\nMy stand out memory was in the dining area. We went down for brunch, which by the way is a really good brunch. And we were greeted by Omega the Food & Beverage Director. He spent time talking to us to find out how we were enjoying the experience, whether we liked the food and the service, and made sure that we were enjoying our stay. He even made arrangements with us to connect with one of his managers Malik in the evening to extend the hospitality even further. And the bar staff definitely knows how to mix a good drink.\n\nAt the end of the day for me it\u2019s the little things that make an experience at the hotel awesome.

There were scrambled eggs made from a mix and some bacon. \n\nThe hotel has a mandatory $35 a night per room \"amenity\" fee. The only thing the $35 can be used for is the lounge in the lobby, which, if you don't drink, is a total waste. There are only 5 items on the menu -- pizza, guac and chips, hummus and 1 pita, a quesadilla, and a charcuterie board. They were always out of the charcuterie board and one of our party can't eat dairy, so,  last night, we used 1 coupon from each room to order 1 hummus and pita order for each room and 1 diet coke. Despite using the coupons, EACH room was charged $74+ for 1 small tub of hummus and 1 pita. Let me be clear -- this is $158 for about $6 worth of hummus and two pita rounds. \n\nWe were then told we should have used the amenity coupons for breakfast which made no sense as we explicitly had breakfast included in our rates. \n\nThe \"amenity fee\" also includes wifi, which is already free if you are a gold Bonvoy member like I am, so . . . .it's basically a ripoff. \n\nSo, now, between the food (which we should not have been charged for on either room) and double incorrect parking charges, we were overcharged by over $600. When I left, they were still unable to remove one of the incorrect bar charges for $74.oo as the \"bar manager\" was unavailable and I will now have to follow up by phone, which is always a total pain. I am not looking forward to chasing down the manager and checking my credit card bills to make sure wrong charges did not go through for the next week or so. \n\nWatch your bills carefully if you choose to stay here. This was a real mess. The location is decent and the rooms are clean, but the front desk really needs work.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

(Which was great and understandable). The manager asked for a follow up next day from us as the shift would change. Long story short, by 10pm next day our luggage haven\u2019t been moved and I called 5 times and each time was rather told, yes we will move them and last one was well we can\u2019t because you are not here for us to move it (and after explaining that we were all packed and this is what we were told, again yes we will do so). Finally my husband moved them once we got to the hotel. With the contradictory reception I was not sure we will have a new room once we get back to the hotel. The second room is way better but the picture speaks volumes of how 2nd room looks. Go figure the first room.  I won\u2019t comeback and I don\u2019t recommend it.

First impressions were great, the hotel is really beautiful from the outside and the entrance to the hotel is very grand and luxurious. The doorman was always very friendly and said hello each time we passed. \n\nThis is a really nice area to stay in. The streets are very clean and they are so long that you get a nice city view down each one. The Lexington is only a short walk to the Rockefeller, Grand Central etc. The walk to Times Square was around 20 minutes. We stayed in one of the DoubleTrees near Times Square for a night beforehand and that wasn\u2019t a great experience due to the street being quite rough and full of trash.\n\nWe were treated to a free upgrade at check in from a Standard Queen room to a Standard King room. Our room was HUGE\u2026 especially for New York standards. It was clean and well decorated. The bathroom looked modern but the shower was a bit outdated. It worked fine (if a little noisy) so this didn\u2019t bother us, plus it was always clean. There was a hairdryer, a safe and an iron and ironing board in the room. These were all nice touches. \n\nThere is a $35 resort fee per night. This fee is standard in NYC but the price varies from hotel to hotel. This fee is supposed to cover access to the Wi-Fi, free bike passes and credit towards breakfast at the hotel and the lobby bar. We didn\u2019t use any of this and my booking confirmation actually said the fee would be $25 per night. I mentioned this at checkout and the fee was discounted by $70 so we were happy with this. \n\nThe hotel lobby is beautiful. My partner and I met in New York in 2016 and we were returning to get married at City Hall. We took most of our photos in and around the hotel. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel and I would stay again!","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The check in staff was very friendly and offered us waters upon our arrival.  There were some challenges with the reservation from my end but the staff worked through them with me and remained patient even though I was probably annoying them\u2026  The wait was not even noticeable for my wife and our daughter because the lobby was clean, fun to look at & explore, plus almost all the patrons had masks on which made our family feel more comfortable.\n\nThe staff was so kind and focused on my positive experience. They were able to recognize and quell my aggravation because of the mix up which was my fault. So much so, they offered a small upgrade to a room with two beds.  This was greatly appreciated because it allowed our daughter to have her own bed and mom\/dad to share comfortably. We graciously accepted.\n\nThe room ended up being amazing! Spacious, clean, very comfortable.  You could tell the staff took pride in cleaning the room thoroughly.  Rooms like this are hard to come by when staying in this part of town on a family budget. We were very happy that we made the commitment to stay at The Lexington, Autograph Collection.  After a long day in NYC it was great to kick back and relax at such a great location.\n\nWhat happened next is really the foundation of what drove me to write this review. We were undecided on a dinner spot so we thought a call to the concierge would be helpful.  Just our luck the concierge was unavailable \u2013 but by the grace of God we got someone even better who by happenstance had stayed late that day.  The stars were aligning for us!\n\nIn fact, I now believe this person is the person who the concierges probably call when they need something.  Queen of the castle, the hostess with the mostess, Brooklyn\u2019s finest, The Lexington\u2019s Operations Manager aka Ms. Elizabeth Lopez!  Within the first 2mins of my call about restaurants, I felt like I was talking to an old friend who just got me.  It was wild and totally unexpected.  We probably talked for about 15-20 mins and eventually my wife started laughing and was like who are you talking to? I said, our family\u2019s new favorite person! \n\nElizabeth was filled with great suggestions and ideas for our family.  The information and patience Elizabeth provided totally enhance our hotel and NYC.   \n\nAbout 10mins after the call there was a knock at the door.  Elizabeth sent up a robe for my wife and 2 keepsake teddy bears for our daughter.  I must say 2 teddys was a veteran move, considering she lost the first one that night somewhere in NYC .  But of course Elizabeth already knew that would happen and was ahead of the game, hence two teddys!\n\nElizabeth, the check in staff, and the auxiliary staff should be commended privately and publicly by your organization for their professionalism and ability to assure that a new customer would become a return customer.\n\nTypically I don\u2019t provide reviews for positive experiences.  Like many other people I only speak up and fire off emails when things don\u2019t go my way. Which I admit - is completely ridiculous and unfair to businesses.  This year and moving forward I am making the effort to give credit when credit is due for exemplary customer service experiences.

It is close to Grand Central Terminal as well as the shopping on Fifth Avenue and other mid-town attractions. It is also on a quiet street away from some of the noise and crowds, which is nice. The rooms are very small (even smaller than hotel rooms I have stayed in throughout Europe) but this is not an issue if you're planning to spend most of your time exploring the city.  However, I would say the room is almost uncomfortably cramped if you plan to spend more time than just sleeping. A king-sized room is just big enough to fit the bed and two nightstands with a very narrow walk-way between the dresser and bed. There is a desk and chair but no other seating options. Due to COVID we opted to do more dinner\/take out and had to basically eat on the bed as there was no where else to eat. The hotel charges a $35 destination fee which does provide a $35 food and beverage credit in the bar for drinks or breakfast. It can also be used towards laundry or a fitness pass. Unfortunately, I would say that breakfast is incredibly overpriced, and is a very basic American style buffet that is $29 or so for adults. The food is served on the bar and certain items i.e., oatmeal was at an uncomfortable height for anyone that is petite. Several tables in the restaurant\/bar are also not large enough to comfortably accommodate plates and drinks. We decided after day 1 that the breakfast was not worth the price (as the destination fee would not cover it all for 2 people).  We did try to have drinks in the bar another night but when asked they only had two non-alcoholic options (lemonade and fruit punch) and no hot beverages. So, this was not really an option if you're with someone who is not drinking or able to drink. The hotel offers no water, coffee, or tea in the lobby for guests (nor does the bar have it) so if you want those items you have to buy it from the Starbucks next door. There is also no coffee or tea offered in the hotel rooms. I found the hotel lacking amenities I normally see in Marriott properties (including ones in NYC).\n\nThe hotel will require you to prepay $100 a night for incidentals. I have never in 8+ years (several of those as platnium elite) of frequently staying at Marriott properties encountered a prepaid incidental fee. Upon check out I expected this to be immediately refunded but it was not showing up as a credit to my credit card.  When I called the hotel, I was told it takes 3-5 business days for this to be refunded back to me, which seems excessive. When I asked for the person to put this in writing she refused, nor would she articulate to me why she couldn't since she told me the 3-5 business days was the hotel's policy\/standard practice.  By this point there should be no question as to the state we left the room in and quite frankly no reason the fee was not refunded to my card by close of business today. Instead, it seems as though I'm loaning the hotel $400 over the course of 9 days. I found the customer service-person that I spoke to about this point to be dismissive.\n\nWhile this was our second time staying at this hotel - I would say the main reason I would choose it is the price as it sometimes is cheaper than other Marriott properties.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We did not have any washcloths or a bath mat in the room. It took several requests to get that taken care of. I had to go down to the lobby at 11 pm to make a third request. They ignored the request on the Marriott app. We also did not have a coffee maker in the room. I requested it on the 11 pm lobby trip only to have them bring coffee pods instead of the coffee maker. They corrected that eventually. I am a titanium member on Marriott Bonvoy. They upgraded my room, but this was the smallest room I've ever had here. That was ok because we spent very little time there. The Lexington also charges a destination fee. They didn't tell me anything about what that fee got me upon check in.

I looked out the window and saw there was an active construction site across the street. You could easily shout to the workers if the windows opened. It may as well have been in my room. I went down to the front desk and they dismissed me saying \"Well, we don't usually get complaints on weekends anyway.\" Nothing was done to accommodate me or change my rooms. Of course, there was construction work on Saturday morning as well, which mercifully didn't start quite as early. I tried to reach out to hotel's management through the complaint link in the wifi, but of course nothing. This is what Titanium status gets you, folks! A room across from the maid closet and construction noise at 7:30 am. Also, brave of them to bring back the breakfast buffet, but maybe this is one place where you actually enforce mask compliance?

The Lexington was well located to the theaters. The only downside we ran into was the restaurant. One evening we tried to get a late snack\/light dinner at nearly 11pm and weren't able to. We were told the kitchen was closed. I then remarked it was okay and would order room service and was told there wasn't any room service. Of course we weren't happy about that because we were hungry. We managed to find something at a market across the street. If a hotel as a restaurant connected to it then room service should be offered.

There are so many amazing restaurant options in NYC, I don't expect my hotel to provide a fine dining option.  What the Lexington does offer is a great place to get a very solid breakfast if you prefer the convenience of dining in your hotel and in the evening, the same space doubles as a perfect cocktail lounge.  The nights I've been there, the bar area appears very popular and it's a very casual and inviting atmosphere.  \nI really feel very comfortable in this hotel.

The room is kind of typical NYC size, not big, clean with simple modern decor, the bathroom is also on the smaller end but functioning well except for the toilet which I found it too close to the wall and toilet paper holder was too close to body while sitting on it.

I called downstairs letting the phone ring more than 30 times at which point I had to contact the hotel through my app and my text message. They finally sent someone to give me a new room but never offered to help me move my things or to even apologize. When I went downstairs around midnight, I saw 2 guests who were waiting for someone at the front desk. This makes sense given that no one picked up my call earlier. (incidentally, one of the girls said that he did not have a shower curtain in his room!)  \n\nWhen the clerk finally showed up and I finally got to speak with him, I told him I wanted the general manager to contact me as the service was unacceptable and that it was unacceptable for calls to ring without any acknowledgment. He told me that he was with other guests. I said based on the fact that we\u2019ve been waiting for someone to show up at the desk I had some doubts as to the validity of that account but moreover I wondered why he couldn\u2019t have picked up the phone to simply say can I place you on hold or I\u2019ll be with you in a second. I still have yet to hear  from the general manager. I heard from another guess that they too had trouble reaching someone at the front desk.\n\nUnder the arrangement, they were supposed to provide dry cleaning and yet despite leaving it in my room 2802 with instructions, no one ever did that.\n\nThe hotel is in a good location but given the difficulties in trying to get anyone to attend to customer service I would not recommend staying there.

Check in was very good; the front desk person offered me a mini fridge since I'd be staying a while.  That was very nice.  Unfortunately they delivered the fridge at almost 11:00 at night when I was in bed.  I thought I had reserved  the standard room but the desk clerk told me I was in a larger room.  However, looking at the photos on the website, I think I was in a standard room.  By normal standards it was small but by NYC standards it was fine.  The bed was fairly comfortable and there was a large desk.  The bathroom was small but usable.  The toilet was an auto flush toilet but they had disabled auto flush and you had to push the button to flush it; unfortunately it was hard to reach the button and I had trouble getting it to flush all the way.  The tub is narrow and has a high side you have to step over to take a shower.  There is limited storage space in the bathroom but it's fine for one person.  The hotel decor is interesting and they've tried to give it a trendy look.  The lobby was crowded every morning with people sitting around and frequently busy in the evening with people having a drink.  My husband joined me for the later half of the stay and had breakfast one morning.  It was your typical buffet breakfast at NYC prices.  You are better off going out to one of the nearby breakfast choices with better food for a fraction of the price.  There is also a Starbucks adjacent to the lobby.  The hotel is within walking distance of Grand Central Station, the subway, and buses, so it's easy to get around.  I had to extend my stay several times and the desk staff was very accommodating about this.  They also had free bottled water at the desk that you could take at any time, as well as coffee and tea in the lobby.  My main complaint is the $25 destination fee they charge daily (you also pay tax on this fee).  The fee gets you bar credits and laundry credits, but because I was there visiting my mother and spending many hours with her, I did not get to use my bar credits or do laundry.  You have no choice (it's like a resort fee).  I did agree to the fee when I made the reservation so I can't complain too much; even with the fee the hotel was a reasonable rate, but I hate when I am charged for something I don't get anything for.  Over 9 nights the fee and tax added up to over $225.  The location of this hotel and reasonable rate make it a good choice if you need to be in this part of town and need access to public transit.   The staff was friendly and accommodating and the room was quiet even if they lobby was busy.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

I have a lot of problems with my recent stay here.  \n\nI emailed the hotel stating I was a multiple visit returning guest.  I didn't get a response, but I assumed, they would note it and upgrade me appropriately.  I arrived and was being checked into a lower floor entry level room.  When the gentleman began to tell me about the hotel I advised, I'm a returning guest and it's my regular hotel on all visits.  He then switched me to a higher floor, however the same entry level room.  I'm not sure what the point was as there was no view or anything else \"special\" to welcome a returning client.  \n\nThe hotel now asks for a $100 dollar per night charge on your credit card.  I'm not sure what this is for.  All other hotels I stay at ask for a card for incidentals but don't charge anything.  Here they actually charge per day.  You'll come home to a hefty charge on your card, that doesn't need to be there.  Yes they remove it in about a week, though I've read about the problems with this.  You shouldn't actually bill it !!!\n\nIn addition to this, they've now started to charge a resort fee.  I'm not at a resort.  Hello???  I'm charged $30 per night for wifi, a free drink and laundry.  That's appalling.  Not to mention, the wifi in the room only works if you keep using your phone.  If you stop, the wifi goes off, so good luck getting an airline alert, text or email, if your data is off.  I missed an alert about weather delays for my flight. Thanks!!!   So I'm paying for something in the resort fee that doesn't even work.  Nevermind I don't need laundry for a long weekend.  \n\nThe rooms are getting worn out and dated.  I have to say, they are not well kept anymore and there is dust where there shouldn't be.  I was disturbed that at this price point and hotel type I'm finding coats of dust on the rim of furniture, tiles, etc.  \n\nThe guests were rather noisy as well.  I'm not sure if some are getting  \"deals\" that lure in rowdy clientele??  I didn't get a deal or any other perk as a regular.\n\nMight I add, at all other hotels I stay at I don't even have to ask about anything, as they automatically upgrade me and provide other perks such as wine, champagne, vouchers for continued patronage. \n\nThe lobby seem a little bit nuts at all times.  Every time I walked through it there were hoards of people sitting all over the place, some even on the floor, for lack of seating.  I'm not sure what these people were waiting for.  There was also luggage everywhere. \n\nI felt like I was at a downmarket chain motel.  This is supposed to be an Autograph Collection Hotel!  It needs a good Reno for starters and some loyalty to repeat clientele. It's strange in reading some other reviews first timers seem to be upgraded and gifted, while regulars not at all.  Besides being a regular, I've probably sent about 100 people to the hotel to stay.  \n\nI don't think I will stay here anymore.  If they were to explain that this was a one off disaster of sorts and offer me a free week to demonstrate the kind of hotel they're supposed to be, I may consider it.  However, at this time, I'm looking for a new regular hotel.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We were given our room keys to the 27th (top) floor and on opening our room door I couldn't believe my luck. The wonderful team had upgraded our room to their suite with not one but two balconies!!! The views of the city were amazing! We had a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a lovely little welcome note on the desk. Fantastic surprise!\n\nWe stayed for a full week and were also given complementary breakfasts and coupons for daily drinks at the bar for up to $20. \n\nThe hotel is in such a great location, not too close to Times Square so there isn't too much hustle and bustle, but only a 10 minute walk to see all the bright lights. Everything is pretty close by - Rockerfeller, Grand Central Terminal and if not there are plenty of near by subways which can take you all over the big city.\n\nNew York is our favourite place in the world, and there is no other hotel we could now stay at after yet another incredible experience staying here. Don't even question staying anywhere else when you come to New York City. The Lexington has all you need - perfect location, top quality staff and cleanliness!\n\nThank you so much for your kindness during our stay and helping us celebrate our engagement in style!","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I assume there's a historical connection between jazz and Norma Jean (there is a Norma Jean suite, I'm told, where Marilyn and Joe stayed.) \n\nWe definitely did not stay in the Norma Jean suite.\n\nInstead, we stayed in a small room that was actually categorized as \"deluxe\" and it was fine by Marriott standards - very clean, very quiet and big enough for two people and our things. The cellophane-wrapped paper drinking cups in the bathroom seemed a little bit down-scale - Marriott Meets Red Roof Inn?\n\nThe wifi was strong and free, the TV was top-rate, and we were able to access Netflix through our own account. \n\nYou get hit with a $25 \"destination fee\" on top of your room rate, which is just additional profit - they give you coupons for drinks at the bar (or a $30 laundry credit) which sort of evens it out, but if you're not a drinker and you're only staying overnight, you probably don't have the ability to use the laundry service. \n\nIn any case, the staff was terrific, there was jazz music piped into the elevators (a bit too loud), and we would definitely stay there again if we could get another reasonable room rate for a Saturday night. With taxes, destination fee and room rate, we spent just under $200.\n\nIt would have been really cool if there had been a knock at the door and Marilyn's ghost was standing there... but no, it was just housekeeping.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

From the front desk who were rushed and lacked the desire to share amenity information with this Platinum Elite Member, to the incompetent Guest Services who messed up on 2 very simple asks for room supplies and were slow to respond.  Housekeeping did not re-stock my room completely after any of my 4 nights here.  Yes, I was tipping them for a lackluster service.  SMH.  The doormen made snide comments each time I deferred their offer for Taxi because I had a ride share en route.  Lastly, there is a $25 \u201camenity fee\u201d charged per night, which is a joke.  It is only a plot to get you to spend more by utilizing the Stayton or dry cleaning services that are greatly overpriced.  Free coffee, hot water, and filtered water in the lobby are nice.

My most recent visit though was next level bad. The flip lock in my room was broken, literally hanging off the doorframe by a thread and useless. Traveling alone, this was unsettling. Also, there was an unwanted visitor in the form of a very large, live roach. Meanwhile a family emergency required me to return home unexpectedly and I checked out one night early, in person at the front desk. The folio arrived and I was charged for all nights. Complained via email to both the hotel and Marriott and received the usual canned apology message back. Called the hotel to personally ask if anything could be done and was told no, that was the cancellation policy and the service issues were irrelevant. He went on to ask me to hold a moment while he checked the notes, and then informed me they had no record of me checking out. Rules are rules, things break, bugs happen but that was just too much. As mentioned I have stayed at the Lex many times and watched others complain for sport practically and receive drink chits - piles of them - upgrades, cheese plates, bottles of wine, prompt and personal calls and follow up from the manager and tens of thousands of Bonvoy points, over the most minor of complaints. Meanwhile a family crisis, an unsecure room and a live roach got me called a liar. Done with that nonsense and also immediately canceled an appointment to tour another Marriott property for a large professional meeting. Never is a long time but certainly in NYC I cannot envision any circumstance under which I\u2019d return to the Lex.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

At $350 for my one night stay, I didn\u2019t expect anything fancy but the rooms were an absolutely dump.  I can\u2019t believe this hotel is even in the Marriott system. I knew something was not right when the front desk associate did not acknowledge my elite status using the usual script. She also was dressed very casually in a loose sweater and had no name tag. She did not offer any of the usual membership amenities or tell me about the beverage credit. Then she assigned me a room. I asked if there was an upgrade and she said the hotel was sold out. The room I was assigned was a postage stamp overlooking an air shaft. It was also just really old and looked like a hostel. It was humid and hot and the ac sounded like a jet plane. I went back to the front desk and waited another 10 minutes in line. When I told the associate my room was a dump, she said she\u2019d give me a better room (apparently they were not that sold out). She assigned me a room on the elite floor which was a reasonable standard size with a tiny bathroom. The ac was fine but the bed cover was nothing more than the thinnest blanket and no extra blankets in the closet. The bathroom was really old (see photos of rust on tiles, bubbling paint and wallpaper) and the auto flush toilet didn\u2019t work so I had to find the button to flush which didn\u2019t work unless I kept it pressed down for 5 seconds. It was late so I didn\u2019t bother calling for more blankets. I just folded my covers in half to make it more warm, like I was sleeping at a shelter. On the positive, the gym was decent (with complimentary apples) and there is a Starbucks in the building for a quick breakfast. Lighting in the room was decent as well as were plug locations.

There was also no one working at the elite check in desk so we had to wait like everyone else despite our Titanium status.  On a plus side, they had a complimentary stand of coffee, hot chocolate, and wine in the lobby to keep you happy while you waited.\n\nThey also provided vouchers for drinks at the bar and breakfast in the morning. I was actually surprised that the breakfast included bacon and eggs... not just cereal and fruit (but they had that too).  Oh!  They also have live jazz perform in the lobby area at night.  Super cool.  Goes with the vibe of the hotel perfectly!  Loved that!\n\nThe rooms were nice.  I love the architecture of the hotel overall so everything was nicely maintained and cutely decorated.  I am sensitive to perfumes and scents.  There is a perfumey smell to the lobby but nothing in the room which is good.  I appreciate that!  We only had two issues with the room. (1) The radiator heat came on in the middle of the night while we were sleeping and was super loud.  It sounded like a car was breaking down in our room.  But with an older hotel that is just part of the charm.  The other was that there was no heat in the bathroom but there was a window so it was super cold in there.  The tile floor was like walking on ice and showering was rough even with lots of hot water.  The bathroom was also really small.\n\nOtherwise I loved it. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":93526,"title":"Good Stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-01-09","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"We are top tier Bonvoy members. We checked in on Saturday Dec 14 around 10:30 AM. There is a separate registration desk for \u201celite\u201d members which was convenient, but our room wasn\u2019t ready yet (it was by noon). We did receive an upgrade and since we were waiting for other family members to arrive it wasn\u2019t a hardship to sit in the second level mezzanine and take in the holiday decorations and people watch. Complementary water and coffee were available. We took the former and headed directly to the Starbucks which can be entered from the hotel. The lobby is large with plenty of seating in different configurations. The second floor has a more eclectic set up, bathrooms (you need a key card to access) and the occasional homeless person sleeping in the futuristic seating stations. That area could use some attention from Housekeeping regardless of who is using it. \n\nOur room was huge. The bathroom was enormous and such a waste of space. There was absolutely no storage in the bathroom, not even a shelf under the sink. Although Marriott has pledged to stop using small plastics for bathroom amenities, this hotel has not been updated. We had a combination tub\/shower which I detest. There was plenty of room for a separate tub and a great shower.  The shower heads were soothing and hot water was plentiful. The lighting in the bathroom is poor and how about a few more hooks for hanging those towels you would like us to reuse? \n\nThe room was large enough to accommodate a queen size bed, desk, dresser with minimal storage and a couple of chairs. If the configuration had been better thought out, this room could have easily accommodated a king bed and probably a small sofa. We had a fridge and Keurig. Nespresso would have been nice. The bed was comfy! Full size pillows are provided. The black-out shades are controlled electronically and very much necessary in some rooms as the hotel is built in a U shape and surrounded by office buildings. There are no USB ports so bring those wall chargers. There are no bathrobes which is a departure from other Autograph Collection hotels I have stayed in. There are earplugs in the nightstands. \n\nIt had been crazy warm in the Northeast that week and the hotel was hot. Our room thermostat could not be programmed below 71 degrees. Even when the weather turned cold we didn\u2019t need the heat. \n\nBreakfast was included in our stay, but we had other plans. We did get to the bar one evening.  It was packed, but we found seating. The offerings are sufficient and NY priced. We had drink vouchers, but before you get all happy about this, the vouchers can\u2019t be combined and barely pay for a glass of wine. It is not a sports bar by any means so we were following games on our phones. \n\nThis area of the city is almost completely shut down on the weekends. Even Grand Central Station doesn\u2019t feel crazy.  As we were there during Christmas, it was a nice respite from the craziness near Rock Center, Macy\u2019s and Times Square. It came alive Monday morning with the start of the work week and the noise came with it. On the other hand there are great places for lunch in and near Grand Central which aren\u2019t open on the weekends. The typical chain cafes and fast food establishments are near by on the streets and open on the weekends. \n\nThe service was fine. It wasn\u2019t spectacular. The hotel is in an older building, but the renovations are impressive. The elevators are a decent size which can\u2019t be said of all renovated hotel buildings. I have yet to find a Marriott property in NYC that I love at any price. ","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

From the moment you check in to you check out. They all are there to do what they can do make your stay great. The problem is you can\u2019t fix the issues with this place. The wallpaper is literally cracking off. The radiator makes this banding noise like you\u2019re in a horror movie. Since it does it all night you might feel like you\u2019re in one at about 3am. The engineer came to look at it. He said and I quote \u201cIt\u2019s an old building. Every room will make the same noise.\u201d He even manually turned off the radiator and brought in a portable heater. To my amusement; later in the night I could hear the same noise from the room below me. These old hotels have the same pipes connected to each other.  The next issue was the bathroom. The cold water didn\u2019t work in the sink. Then we move on to the television. Many of the channels were pixelated and the following didn\u2019t work at all. Channel 73 (MTV), 73 VH1 and 77 which is ironically labeled Hotel Information. In its hay day I am absolutely positive that the Lexington was an incredible hotel. Those hay days are far removed.

As an elite member of Marriott with far more than 1.000 nights I always appreciate the excellent service of this chain. However, the Landmark was different. Even we used the App for pre-check-in and informed the Hotel that we will arrive at 1 pm, one room was ready at 3.30 pm, the other at 6:30 pm. No room with 2 beds was available (we changed one room after 2 days), the heating system is not working properly, the windows had been very dirty and  hardly provide any noise protection++ This Hotel urgently needs a complete renovation. The breakfast buffet was ok and included, but if someone has to pay 29 $ +, it is overpriced. The price policy of this hotel is somehow questionable. You pay an upcharge to the regular room rate of about 50 US$ per room\/day and receive a 20 US voucher for the bar. Free water and coffee\/tea is available throughout the day. The staff at the reception was friendly and helpful, particularly Irina, who is the Elite Loyalty Manager. She helped us as much as possible with any complaint.

NYC is magical during the holidays and we love seeing the Rockeffeler tree, the department store windows and myriad other buildings and stores that have decorated in the holiday spirit. Having Bonvoy Ambassador status, I booked a Marriott property. We usually like to stay in Times Square, but this year we tried something different: The Lexington Hotel, an Autograph Collection property. I booked a standard king room.\n   On arrival we immediately saw that the hotel was clearly full. The lobby was bustling and the bar area was clearly packed. After waiting a few minutes we were assited by a very friendly check in clerck. When I requested a late check out on our departure date she informed that the hotel could not support the request and actually asked if we could check out at 1000am! However, when I pushed back, invoking my Ambassador status, she informed me that we had the largest suite in the hotel and they needed us to vacate early to accomodate a wedding party. We agreed.\n   It turns out that we had been upgraded to the Lady Ella Suite! This is a huge (by NYC standards) two bedroom suite. Each bedroon has its own ensuite bathroom, and there is also a living\/dining room area, plus a kitchenette. But the most amazing part was the huhe balcong that runs the length of the suite! Unfortunately it was too cold to really enjoy the outdoor space, but it was fantastic nonetheless.\n   When we checked in we had received two $20 drink vouchers, so we headed to the Stayton Room, the hotel's 1920's inspired bar. The bar was busy but we still received good service and the drink I ordered was very good. \n   We also received breakfast vouchers and so we headed own the next morning to cash them in. This was the only \"not so great\" part of the visit. Breakfast is served buffet style in the Stayton Room, and it ws a zoo. I don't know if it was just a function of it being the holidays, but it seemed that everone in the hotel had vouchers and was trying to eat breakfast at the same time. The staff did a great job of trying to get folks seated (it's first come, first served) while courteously encouraging those who were done to vacate their seats so they could set others. We were seated at a table for 4, and volunteered to share our table if need be. The staff took us up on the offer and we had the joy of making new friends, a very nice retired couple from Arizona.

I realize it is the Christmas season and it is Manhattan but I would have complained if it was a motel 6 at $79 a night. The bathroom was so tiny you could sit on the toilet and open the front door. Either way even with the fantastic staff, I will not return to this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Lovely reception area with homages to Marlyn Monroe and nice seating areas. \n\nArrived after a red eye flight and checked in very efficiently. However, we were given a 40 dollar token of drinks that was given to us. We didn't request this but feeling to tired to question the process took them. We never got around to using them due to a packed weekend in the city. We then found out the vouchers was non-refundable. I wish this had been made clearer and we essentially paid 40 dollars on nothing !! Tried to redeem at the bar only to find it was only open at specific times. I'm sorry but if you force this un-refunable hotel service then at least have it accessible at all hours. I've never heard of restrictions on a bar in a hotel. \n\nBack to some positives! The room itself was clean and comfortable to stay in. Bathroom was also very nice with complimentary soap etc. \n\nI will finish on another small critisim! The doorman was very rude to me during my stay. He opened the door for every other guest and even said hello to the other guests but never to me. \n\nOverall hotel would have gotten more favourable review of me had it not been for the hidden fees that I never got to reep the rewards from. \n\nWon't stay again based on this but otherwise very good hotel.

The location near Grand Central is great. The staff were very accommodating: from doorman to wait staff, there was excellent service. \nThe rooms were small (this is an old establishment) but neat. One has to like coziness, and not expect spaciousness. I wished there had been a coffee maker in the room, as well as a fridge - there is 24-hr Starbucks coffee in the lobby though. A nice touch was the complementary ear plugs for guests not used to NYC street noise. I felt the bed was not as \"embracing\" as at other Marriotts - not sure why not. \nThe restaurant (Stayton Room) was good for breakfast (though the eggs were cold). And it was a vibrant place at 6pm on a Monday night - crowded and noisy, jazz band, lots of people. I don't think they had sitdown food; bar food was very good. And the drinks were good, too. \nIt's in the Autograph collection - old hotels intended to recall the ambiance of when men wore jackets and ties and women, hats and gloves when traveling.

My husband is a Titanium Marriott member, so he and we obviously travel quite a bit, and all over the world.  We have stayed in NY countless times and don't expect massive sized rooms, but were disappointed in the \"upgraded\" room we received.  A deluxe king, which was no larger than any other room we have stayed in NY.  The temp in the room was never quite right, and the bedding does not include a proper comforter.  My husband called it a piece of paper, which made me laugh, and I have to agree.  Odd that a hotel in the winter does not offer more substantial bedding.  One morning I came downstairs and realized I had forgotten something in the room.  When I went back up and found my key was not working.  Thankfully I had my ID with me and went to the desk to get a new key.  The desk agent looked at my ID and asked whose name the room was in.  I stated my husband, whose last name matches mine.  She told me that he had not added me to the room.  I told her I was present at check-in and no one asked for my ID, which is understandable and quite commonly asked at many hotels.  She then asked where my husband was and could he come to the desk to confirm that I could have a key.  I told her he was working.  She said she had to get a manager.  The manage arrived, looked at my ID and the same set of questions followed.  I told him he could follow me to the room and see my bag tags and I could identify everything in the room.  He said we don't allow keys if the name is not on the room.  I replied, \"look, I am all for catching cheating husbands, but this is ridiculous.\"  Once again, I reminded him that my name matches my husband's, he is Titanium and we could go up together.  He told me that many people have the same names.  I then suggested that he and I go buy a lottery ticket together as the odds of me knowing the room # and having the same last name as the one on the reservation should ensure a lottery win for us both.  He, finally, acquiesced and gave me a key.  I am all about safety and security, but common sense needs to be taken into account as well.  ","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93526,"title":"Not Autograph Collection Material","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-11-24","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I booked two rooms for a one-night stay in NYC with my fiance and future in-laws. I have been a longtime Marriott Elite member and was also familiar with many of the hotels in NYC but had not stayed at The Lexington. I travel frequently and enjoy the Autograph Collection properties. This stay was disappointing on many different levels.\n\nThe check-in process was disorganized and embarrassing. I had completed the check-in process via the app for a 5:30 PM arrival and arrived shortly after that time. However, when I checked-in, not only did the app check-in not seem to matter at all, I was also informed that the rooms were not ready. To be clear, this was not an early check-in request and there shouldn't have been any problems anyways. On top of that, I was shocked that as a Titanium Elite member, this didn't seem to matter one way or another to the hotel staff. They didn't bother to explain or even really see the issue with their failure, as my family and I were supposed to just wait in a crowded and chaotic lobby and hope they eventually had our rooms available. \n\nTo make matters worse, when the front desk employee went to get a manager, the manager still couldn't adequately explain what had happened and why a room wasn't ready. I understand sometimes things can go wrong or mishaps occur, and an explanation and simple effort to fix it would have been more than sufficient. Instead, we got a lot of misleading nonsense that only exacerbated the situation and embarrassed me in front of my future in-laws. The primary reason we had picked that hotel was because I had told them about how well Marriott properties usually take care of their elite members. The hotel manager spoke to us like he was negotiating as a used car salesman, saying he was going to hook us up and take care of things, without mentioning any specifics, and then acted like a he hooked us up big time when he figured out a way to get us into two crappy rooms. I informed him that this was indeed what I had already PAID for and was already entitled to as a paying guest, to say nothing of a valued elite member. I came away from the experience feeling like I was getting scammed somehow by the manager. It was unbecoming and I've never experienced anything like that at a Marriott property in my life.\n\nIt is worth commenting on the state of the lobby as well. When we first walked in, it looked like it could be a cool hotel with a unique vibe. However, that was quickly replaced by what was sheer chaos in the lobby. The bar was overflowing to a degree that made the lobby feel like a scene in a crowded Grand Central station at rush hour. A solid 1\/3 of the floor space in the lobby was covered by suitcases that were stacked for some reason. Presumably the storage for the bell captain's desk was full, but this looked like a scene at an airport.\n\nThe rooms themselves were filthy, with hair and grime in the bathroom and gross stains that were highly visible throughout the room. The hotel was clearly in a state of disrepair and badly in need of being refurbished. It would be an understatement to say that it wasn't consistent with the quality of the dozens of other Autograph Collection properties that I have stayed at in the past. I have stayed at some that are older hotels, but well-maintained. This was far and away the worse one. In fact, after we got to the room and looked around, my fiance commented that we should have just stayed at the Courtyard, as that would have actually been far nicer.\n\nMy future in-laws ate breakfast (redeeming the vouchers for elite status) earlier than my fiance and I, but we both had issues that were somewhat comical for any reasonable hotel. When my fiance's parents went to eat, the breakfast buffet was out of most silverware, and there didn't appear to be any effort to remedy the situation, so they were left eating yogurt with a fork.\n\nWhen we ate breakfast, the restaurant was well beyond any reasonable capacity, and there didn't appear to be any system whatsoever for managing the seating or controlling the number of people in the restaurant. There was also no discernible system for creating something as simple as a line for the buffet, which led to chaos and confusion as guests many dozens of guests wedged their way in from all directions. About half of the offerings were out, and once again, there was no silverware. If a Marriott brand representative had seen the scene, they would have been appalled. We waited a few minutes and then just walked out rather than eat sausage with our bare hands.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The concierge was able to direct me to a florist and the Amish Market for a few items.  For another review but check out the Amish Market too.  Wally the bellman was a tremendous help the next night with a getting a pizza up to our room.  All in all the entire staff was really amazing for our special weekend and we couldn't have asked for better service.  This is all in addition to the Lexington Hotel just having the coolest vibe to it.  We intend on making the Lexington our New York home whenever we come to the city.  Irina, Jose, Wally, I apologize but don't remember the concierge name, Thank you all so much!","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Very nice and spacisou room we had on the 23rd fl which again caters for anything you require for a few nights stay. Check-in, though very busy, was friendly and professional. Room, towards the \"back\" of the building quietly located so nearly not noise at all. Housekeeping quality faded out throughout our stay: with a small tip on the first day, everything beyond perfect. On the 2nd day, forgot the tip, service meeting standard expectations. On the 3rd day, no tip intentionally, they did not replace coffee and tea pods for the Keurig and no bath mat. Used the Marriott app to ask for those items and it took, including a follow-up call, one hour to get it. Not the nicest experience if you're tired after a full day up and about and just want to go to bed. Breakfast: whilst the selection in terms of quality and quantity is ok, the venue as such is close to unacceptable. Small chairs and small tables. You sit like on a kids chair and the table is merely big enough to put two plates and two cups on it. Very chaotic as well and not enough staff to clean used tables. Whilst raising rates during the NYC marathon was not a problem for the hotel, filling up the buffet indeed was a big problem. Always, something was missing: no cups, no cuttlery, no coffee no scrambled eggs etc. I ran to the lobby to that coffee station as there, there were cups but not coffee so I came back with cups to the buffet breakfast coffee and once I arrived that coffee was also empty. Again, not rocket science especially they knew they were full at that weekend but then again, as a matter of simple decency, if you raise rates, also make sure quality of your product goes along. Very simple expectation management I take. I might return on a \"normal\" period but for busy times, this hotel is not my choice as they struggle with heavy occupancy.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The promised \"24\/7 coffee\" wasn't there when I needed it most (6:30am)...no doubt drained by all those runners.  The mattress in my \"queen deluxe\" room was much too hard...a foam topper would help.  The bathroom was tiny, but I appreciated the tub and the bath products (a label I'd never heard of call \"Pure\").  The toilet had a large sign taped all the way across the seat cover (classy) noting that the auto-flush function had been disabled to save water...ironically, the manual flush worked so poorly, I often had to flush three times.  So much for saving water...  The safe in the room didn't work, so I had to walk around the entire weekend carrying all my pricey gear.  While I didn't smell it the first night, on my second night, cigarette smoke was flowing in from the hallway (a towel under the door helped somewhat)...chronic problem in every NYC hotel I've ever stayed in (and that would be many!).

However,  this time was not  great.  We  had a suite;  although the room was pretty  good sized, the bathroom is the same tiny  NY  bathroom,   The towels were tired.   The  attempt at \"retro-cool\"  decor  just looks  old.   The  tiny tables in the bar\/breakfast  area,  while okay for someone having only  drinks are too small to comfortable  hold two  breakfast  plates  and coffee and  juice.  This means  everyone with parties of two or more were  grabbing  the tables for four.  I also  hate the low chairs in the breakfast area  that make you feel like you are eating at the children's  table.  \n\nThe worst thing, however, is the the  front  doorman is overworked.  The hotel only had one person outside to load and unload  luggage.  So after waiting for our  luggage to be taken out of the car for a while, the doorman helped us  load it on a cart, and then left it on the sidewalk while he ran off to help someone else.   My husband and I had  walked into the hotel to  check in, but when I saw our bags unattended, I ran out and stand by them  (but, hey, it's not like no one  ever has anything stolen in  NY, right?).    When the bags  finally were brought inside,  we checked in, went to our room and waited for the bags.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally, my husband went  downstairs and got them himself.  I am not blaming the doorman, but who  decided that only one  person should be on  duty between  3-4  pm, when everyone is checking in?  And  why were the other valets inside not  helping?  And not  bringing back  upstairs?  \n\nThe hotel  has a lot of extra  fees -   the destination charge and  the parking fees are very  high. \n\nWe  are  lifetime  Marriott platinum members, and current Titanium members, so we try to stay at Marriott hotels  whenever possible.  But  we will pass on this hotel in the future.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel, at some 750 rooms I think, has too small of a lobby, too small of a check in area, ad too small of a bellman area.  This results in lines everywhere and long wait times.\n\nNow, the awful.  Housekeeping.  I checked into my room late (the room was not ready and the hotel never texted me like they said they would when it became ready).  As a result, I checked into the room at about 4:30 pm, changed clothes, went to a pre-show dinner, and then attended a performance at Carnegie Hall until about 11 p.m.  I came back to the hotel, had a couple glasses of wine in the hotel bar until 12:30 a.m. and then proceeded to my room.  Pulling back the sheets, they were *obviously* slept in (wrinkled where you could see a human rear end had rested in them) and had black fuzz and lint all over them (top and bottom sheets).  I called the desk, asked for the manager, and got a relatively snarky man on the phone who tried to basically claim the housekeepers were union and there is no way they could have not changed the sheets.  He eventually sent a guy up to change the sheets.\n\nI left the next day to go out and later returned to the room to find it had been serviced.  Except the housekeeper took whatever towels I had used (including the bath mat) and didn't replace them.  Ditto the cups to drink out of.\n\nI want to like this hotel as I like the art deco appearance and its location at 48 and Lex.  But, operationally, this hotel doesn't have the staff for its size.  To let people check in to rooms that are not fully cleaned is a fatal flaw for a hotel and a sign that staff are cutting corners to deal with the heavy loads of people.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

But not everyone wants to go downstairs immediately after waking up. \n\n-Paper-thin walls.

Check-in was fine as the girl that checked me in was friendly and she informed me the proper steps.  I wish I could give this place a 1 but since she was friendly, I gave this another point.   We only stayed here for 2 nights and trust me it was plenty enough.   One strange thing about our room is this is the 1st hotel we stayed in that offers no mini fridge\/bar?  Second,  they don't offer any complimentary water at all?  If they were trying to be environmentally friendly on getting rid of plastic bottles,  please inform this to us when we check in.   But they couldn't be as I was given 2 bottles of water right at check-in.  They did a shoddy job of renovating as understand it is a historical building and they did major upgrades to lift up the hotel to attract guests.  The towel rack was lopsided,  bathroom had musky smell as no fan to keep the air circulation going.  This could definitely bring up mold later.  There was a clunky noise from 7PM up to 11PM for both nights.  I wasn't sure if it was to do with old pipes but it was definitely loud.

I have to say the Lexington is by far the worst.  With so many great choices in NYC, I would suggest you try and avoid staying at this property.\n\nWe arrived on Wednesday, October 16, 2019, which was a very rainy night.  It took us over 45 minutes in the pouring rain to get a taxi (Ubers were booked and just as tough), so we arrived cold, wet and tired, so happy to be finally checking in.  At first there was no one to help us with our luggage, but finally someone came out and grabbed our bag, and told us it would be delivered to the front desk.  We got in line to check in.  It was 8:30, and there was quite a line.  When we got to the attendant, he demanded, without looking at us, for ID and credit card.  When I gave them to him, I told him that it was a special occasion, and that I had requested an upgrade if one was available (I have several Marriott suite upgrade coupons, and with Platinum status, it is often offered).  I know this is based on availability.  Again, with no eye contact, he chuckled, and said \u201cwe are fully booked, that is not happening.\u201d  He then handed us a key, and shouted, \u201cnext in line\u201d. We stood there not quite sure what just happened.  Funny though, there was no one else left in line, so not sure what the urgency was.  By far, the worst check in ever.\n\nSo now we waited for our bag.  We noticed there were carts with bags being transported, but none had our bag.  We could not fine the porter who took our bag.  We started to panic.  I went out front though the foyer, and there, sitting in a corner, unattended, all by itself, was our bag.  I put the money back in my pocket that I had planned to use as a tip, grabbed my bag, and we went upstairs.\n\nThe room was ridiculously small, part of the old design of the way hotels used to be.  The bathroom was even smaller.  There was no minibar.  The towels in the bathroom were stacked on the floor.  Yes, on the floor!  The same floor that gets mopped every day with whatever else ends up on a bathroom floor.  I\u2019m attaching a picture.  Not what one would expect.\n\nNext, I needed to press a shirt for dinner.  We pulled out the iron and ironing board.  The iron leaked.  I\u2019m very familiar with hotel irons, and we tried several tricks, but bottom line, the iron was broken, and now had leaked water all over my shirt.  Ugh, just a bad day.\n\nThe next morning we went down for breakfast after waking up to noise from the room next door. The walls are quite thin, and you can hear much of what is happening with your neighbours.  The host at breakfast told us to sit anywhere.  It was 7:15 in the morning.  There were several empty tables, but none were cleaned off.  The host just watched us as we looked for a table that was \u201cnot too bad\u201d.  We went and got some napkins to wipe it down (picture attached).  Then I went up to the buffet.  The plate I took was dirty!  Honestly, you can\u2019t make this stuff up.  I took a picture of that (I did not start out taking pictures, but once we realized how bad this was becoming, we wanted pictures to prove it.  I\u2019m sorry I forgot to get a picture of the iron).  So dirty table, dirty plates, what else could go wrong.  The bacon tray was 90% empty, and burnt (yep, picture).  Through all of this, the check in, the luggage, the filthy breakfast experience, not once did any employee seem to care.  Everyone seems \u201cbusy\u201d but not taking care of things.  The training in this property was unlike any other Marriott I\u2019ve ever seen.  Even though breakfast was included, we chose not to go on the second day.\n\nFinally, I had the pleasure of spending $600+ a night for this experience.  At $600, I start to expect a certain level of professionalism, cleanliness, and service.  We got none of the above.\n\nI hope they eventually get their act together.  The location is great, and there is an AMAZING restaurant right out the front door on the right called Sea Fire Grill.  I will leave them their own review.  It was outstanding.\n\nI hope my fellow travellers find this review helpful.  Thanks for reading.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel is a grand old building that I believe was renovated a few years ago.  We got upgraded for free from a standard queen to a standard king and were lucky with that as the king bed was huge and very comfortable.\n\nThe room itself was a reasonable size but the bathroom was pretty small but I appreciate this is the Big Apple where that is pretty standard! \n\nAlso, if it\u2019s not advertised in your booking, please be aware that the hotel charges a $25 per night \u2018resort fee\u2019.  This isn\u2019t too bad to be fair as it includes the following complimentary items - WiFi, 24 hour tea and coffee, bottled water, gym, laundry credit and $20 beverage voucher for the bar.  So if you take advantage of all of those then you\u2019ll probably get more then $25 per day in value.  Also be aware that the hotel put a hold on your payment card on check-in of $100 per night so I\u2019d recommend using a credit card with plenty of available credit.\n\nThe hotel also has a Starbucks in it at one side which also gives a shortcut to Lexington Avenue.  \n\nThe location of the hotel on 48th and Lexington, is also a very convenient location as within a maximum of a 20 minute walk you have Times Square, Broadway, shopping on 5th Avenue, the Rockefeller Centre, Central Park and Grand Central Station (to name but a few!).\n\nWe therefore enjoyed our stay and would definitely consider it again on our next trip to NYC!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Naturally, we gave over a credit card for them to take down. However, they did not tell us that a hold would be put on the card, and didn\u2019t even tell us the amount. We left and around 45 minutes later received a notification that the hotel was attempting to charge a significant sum to our card. Had we been advised of the hotel policy regarding the amount that would be taken for deposit, we wouldn\u2019t have found this an issue. But every other hotel I have stayed in has advised of their hold\/deposit policies at check in. When we went back to the check in desk we asked why we weren\u2019t told at check in, and we were simply told (very grumpily might I add) that it is \u2018hotel policy\u2019. So it\u2019s hotel policy to not inform your guests of additional charges you\u2019ll be making to their card that are in addition to the actual rate of the room? Great policy!\n\nSecondly, it is $3 per item to store your luggage in their luggage room. Weird.\n\nThirdly, we were charged over $150 extra than our booking confirmation (which did say \u2018total\u2019 inclusive of tax). This is due to a host of other taxes that you aren\u2019t made aware of when booking.\n\nFourthly, we were on the top floor (floor 28). You might think that this would have been great, however this is effectively a roof conversion with a single tiny window for the room and no view of the city at all.\n\nIn terms of good things, it was good that you could get bottled water at the front desk and there was also a tea and coffee station in the lobby.

People left as they had meetings to get to and flights to catch - yet they had paid a hefty price in advance for their breakfast. Very disappointed.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":93526,"title":"Not our best experience at the Lexington, buyt the Moet champagne vending machine was a pleasant surprise","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-10-09","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We've stayed at the Lexington before.  We stayed two nights at the Lexington Hotel earlier this week.  The results were mixed. \n \nThere are positives.  The hotel\u2019s location is excellent.  It\u2019s at Lex and 48th, a few short blocks from either Grand Central Station or the 53rd Street stop on the \u201cE\u201d subway line.  It\u2019s an Autograph Hotel, meaning \u201cone of a kind\u201d.  It\u2019s in great condition.  The d\u00e9cor has a Jazz Age feel.  The price is reasonable compared to other hotels in the area.  There\u2019s a parking garage across the street.  The staff is welcoming. \n \nThere are negatives.  The hotel charges a daily $25.00 \u2018resort fee.\u201d  One of the ways this is redeemable is with a daily $20.00 drink voucher for the bar.  Curiously, the fee is also subject to state and city hotel taxes.  Monday through Thursday they have a managers reception for members of the Marriott Bonvoy program.  They have a section of the bar segmented for these guests.  So far, so good.  There are complimentary glasses of red and white wine.  No cocktail napkins.  No bar nuts or popcorn.  No munchies like you find in the Executive Lounge at other Marriotts. \n \nOther observations: \n \nWe were upgraded to a larger room with a king sized bed.  It didn\u2019t seem large, but it had the basics you expect, including those incredibly comfortable Marriott beds. \nThe rooms have no coffee makers, although I did see free coffee available in the lobby in the morning.  (That\u2019s a good thing.)  There are no robes in the rooms.   \n \nThe breakfast buffet was included, which I assume is a Bonvoy perk.  The buffer is $29.00 otherwise.  It had an extensive selection. \n \nThere\u2019s one more unexpected positive:  There\u2019s a Moet and Chandon champagne vending machine in the lobby!  How cool is that!  It\u2019s $25.00 for a quarter bottle (split).  You get a coin from the bar that operates the machine.  The $ 25.00 is net, including tax and gratuity.  For Moet champagne in a midtown Manhattan hotel, that\u2019s a pretty good deal.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

NY was busy of course but the Lexington is fairly close to Times square etc. so not too much of a problem walking anywhere.  We just got the impression this was more a business type of hotel that did not particularly cater for people on vacation.  BA crew stay there so I guess it can't be that bad can it.  The room we had was basically pokey and uninviting with little facilities.  You don't expect huge fridges etc in city rooms though I suppose do you ?  Shame but wouldn't go back again.

My floor also reeked of cigar smoke which meant someone had to have been smoking on the floor. I understand there's not much the hotel can do about that, but ugh it just added to my frustrated stay. There was no luggage stand in the room or closet and no place for my bag to sit other than on my King bed which is not ideal. \nI used the gym in the morning and all the treadmills were being used except one.

On a recent trip to New York, I was pretty disappointed with my experience.\n\nI reached the hotel around 745 am after a long overnight flight from San Francisco. On checking in with the hotel, I was told that rooms were currently not available but I was 3rd in line for a room being available and I would be informed as soon as 1 one was ready. I kept checking in with the reception every hour with no luck. At the same time, several dozen guests had checked out. I understand that it takes time to prepare the rooms and left the hotel for a bit. Upon coming back at 12:30, I went back again to the reception, to ask if a room was ready. The reception staff told me that none was available, while at the same time I saw a new guest walk up and get a room at the same time. At this point I was furious. Upon expressing my displeasure with what just happened, magically a room just appeared and I was given one within minutes.\n\nFast forward, the room itself was fairly big by New York standards, so no complaints there (hence the 3 stars). The amenities and the room layout was good too. The house keeping not so much. After the first day, I came back and while my bed was made, the rest of the room was messy - exactly the way I had left it. The floor wasn't vacuumed properly either. Maybe this is a misaligned expectation, but in my experience staying at a premium property should come with better house keeping.\n\nFinally one recommendation to the hotel. There are no water stations in the hotel, and apparently tap water is not the safest in New York. As such, everyone relies on bottles of water. This creates a lot of unnecessary plastic waste. Given Marriott's pledge to remove single use plastic in all it's hotels, I would love to see this property install a water station next to the ice machine so people could refill their plastic bottles if they so desired.\n\nAnyway, on the positive side it's a good location. This hotel is fine if you don't have expectation of decent service, but given this counts under the 'Autograph collection, and goes at over $300 a night or 60,000 points per night (I believe this is category 6), I was quite disappointed in my experience.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

I chose it because it was close to Radio City Music Hall and a short walk over to Broadway where we had booked several theater tickets.  It was clean, had an old school charm but with updated fresh twists.  It was stylish and well thought out.  The room was small, but that is normal for NY.  But the layout and furnishings made it feel larger.  And, it was so QUIET.  I was amazed that the hotel was really busy, but you didn't hear much from the hallways and totally shocked that street noise was almost non-existent.  I definitely will book here again.  The staff was great.  I arrived too early for check-in, but they checked my bag, had comfortable areas to wait and I received a text when my room was ready.  Also had daily check-ins from the staff to see how my stay was going and if they could be of any assistance.  I found this to be a really nice touch (this too was by text message) and other people I met staying here mentioned this too as a pleasant surprise.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

I called the manager the next day and asked to be transferred to another room but they couldn\u2019t do anything because they were fully booked. He only offered ear plugs when I said I was going out to buy them. What kind of hotel can\u2019t even do that for a guest? Also, the $3 fee to leave your suitcase with the bellman is unheard of. This is the first hotel I know of that asks guests to pay for this service. It is just all right. I\u2019ve stayed in much better hotels in NYC, with nicer and bigger rooms, for a similar price.

We were unfortunately unable to check in early, (at 1:30pm) and had to wait for a room. We were also unable to attain an upgrade, so they asked if we wanted first available or a high floor, and we asked for a high floor... at 4:30pm, we had to follow up with the staff and were given a room on the 5th floor.\n\nThe location of the hotel was great! Easy to walk to many different places, subway just down the corner... it really was pretty convenient. Also! A Starbucks IN the building--amazing! Mobile order though, because it's crazy busy 24\/7.\n\nThe hotel was clean, and the rooms were well appointed.\n\nThe bar was our favorite part--super cool art deco vibe! We sat and had a glass of champagne every night, but they were \"out\" of most of the menu items when we ordered food.\n\nWe had 2 queen beds... I'm 5'4, my friend is 5'5, and both of our feet actually hung off the ends of the beds. (LOL) They were oddly small, and our tall husbands would have been irate.\n\nWe hardly slept because of how loud it was in the room. We could hear traffic, people talking, almost everything from the street--alllll night long. I mean, this city never sleeps! ;) When we asked the front desk about it, the woman recommended we close the window.... lol Obviously, the windows were not open. So, if you stay here INSIST on a higher floor if you want to sleep. \n\nThe breakfast was a joke. We would have been pissed if we'd paid for it... it was a pretty basic continental breakfast, and the quality was poor. Since it's not an actual restaurant, you'd think they'd at least bring in some NY-style bagels or something a little more interesting that aligns with the Autograph Collection Brand.\n\nAll in all, I don't think I'd stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}
