The lobby bar is popular, hip, crowded and really loud in the evening.\n\nThe bed was amazingly comfortable, but if you prefer firmer pillows, you may want to bring your own.  Nice big screen TV, new SMEG refrigerator, yet tired bathrooms and only a couple of cubbies to store clothes, no drawers.  It's NYC so there's always lots of noise outside, but it was wasn't particularly intrusive in the room.\n\nDue to an unfortunate room malfunction, we were quickly upgraded to a more spacious room.  The staff managed the issue reasonably well, but the promised complimentary bottle of wine never materialized.  \n\nThe hotel also charges a chunky $35 daily Destination Fee which covers free WiFi, access to the gym etc.  The WiFi was adequate for e-mail\/browsing but streaming was hit-or-miss. The compact gym has some excellent equipment, including a rowing machine, but the aircon wasn't working, so since it's located in the basement with no windows, it was essentially unusable for a decent workout, although the sign suggested keeping the gym door open to let some air in until it was fixed......\n\nBut it's a fantastic central location making walking or CitiBike great options to see the city, the point of our visit.  The amazing Hotwire deal helped paper over the the cracks in our stay - at full price, we would have been dismayed.","travelDate":"2024-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Maybe we where unlucky and by reading the comments, looks like we where but still, we didn't have hot water for the showers in the morning.  Also, we where on the 5th floor facing West and the poor quality of the window was such that we could hear people speak on the street so imagine the garbage\/delivery\/fire truck during the night... I got up in the middle of the night to check if my kids left open the window but it was closed.

From the moment I stepped into the foyer I was impressed by the very intentional industrial chic design. The lobby evokes feelings of old New York, and it's very easy to sit down with a cocktail or a coffee and forget about the rest of the world around you. \n\nBeing in New York, I wasn't expecting much in terms of space, but to say I was in shock was an understatement. I was astonished at how much space we had in the room, in addition to a gorgeous bay window overlooking Broadway. It really felt like we were in our own apartment, and definitely contributed to an amazing ambiance for the entire weekend. \n\nI got to the hotel very early due to my train, and the staff at the front desk was more than happy to store my belongings until my room was ready. This made it so easy for me to take a quick stroll down to The Strand bookstore (the best bookstore in Manhattan IMO), while I waited for the other ladies to arrive. As long as you have a good pair of shoes, there are SO many places you can walk to from this hotel. The Empire State Building, Herald Square (Macy's), and Times Square are less than 10 minutes away. In the other direction, you have Madison Square Park, the Flatiron Building, and Union Square, not to mention a ton of great bookstores, vintage boutiques, restaurants, cafes, and bars to stop at along the way. This location is true Midtown, making it easy to have a full day without even needing the subway. It's also very easy to hail a cab in this area if your itinerary calls for one.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York. Not only are the prices INCREDIBLE for the experience, but the staff, ambiance, and overall vibe are unlike anything I've ever had in the city. Usually, I prepare for my expectations to not be met, but at Ace Hotel, my expectations were beyond exceeded. Thank you so much for an unforgettable weekend!!!","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Purtroppo per\u00f2 a luglio mi sono ritrovata a soggiornare all'Ace Hotel di NY! Non ho mai fatto cattive recensioni per una questione di principio e rispetto del lavoro altrui, ma devo fare un'eccezione per mettere in guardia altri ignari turisti che volessero alloggiare l\u00ec! Avete letto la Divina Commedia? Vi ricordate il canto nel quale  Dante descrive la zona della Giudecca? Ecco lo potremmo tranquillamente adattare alla hall del nostro albergo. Un freddo glaciale che persino un pinguino si sarebbe messo il cappotto! Cos\u00ec oltre al freddo che ti annebbiava i sensi l'illuminazione era degna di un film dell'horror che rendeva l'ambiente spettacolarmente tetro e sinistro per fare un paragone, molto meno illustre, ma sempre chiarificatore, sembrava di essere sul set di  \"Nosferatu\" edizione 1922. \nLe camere? Piccole, con una forzata ambientazione anni 60\/70 molto vintage,  poco comode e molto radical chic! Quindi se scegli lo stesso l'Ace hotel e non ti prendi una polmonite per  freddo non ti fratturi qualcosa cadendo per il buio e se riesci a dormire in una tana potrai visitare NY che rimane pur sempre un citt\u00e0 unica!","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

In many places that would come with a level of protentiosness, not here, not at all.  The team on the desk were super friendly and welcoming (as were all the staff as we discovered), got us checked in quick and up to our room.\nThe room itself was clean, spacious and quirky. I loved the record player and guitar particularly! A well stocked mini bar with plenty of room available to put in your own drinks (a full size SMEG actually!), great TV you could link and stream from your own device with uncomplicated ease. The view from the room was an unobstructed picture frame of the top of The Empire State Building, beutifully lit up on an evening.\nWith a bar that had a good selection of drinks; cocktails, beer and wines that were obviously  carefully chosen and a coffee bar for the morning after we'd enjoyed as many as we dare. I genuinly have nothing negative to say, as a collective experience, it was the best hotel I ever stayed in, and I don't say that lightly.\nThanks to everyone who works at The ACE who made the stay so special, we'll see you again soon.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

A good location close to all sightseeing points, near to metro or bus station, connection to JFK airport. Yes, they have them all. But you want to feel like a rockstar in NY. Check the loft room :) guitars, vinyl player and records, a mix of new and vintage style furniture and a extremely confortable bed king size; all things in the right place and amazing view to Empire State Building, 5th avenue and Time Square. The muse is there, you just need to play the music. And if you get hungry just reserve a table to Koloman Restaurant, it\u2019s downstairs with entrance from the lobby and food really rocks. If you\u2019re not hungry, just try the bar covered by the US vintage flag and try any drinks, the atmosphere  will keep you busy few hours or up to midnight.

Especially around the holidays, it is absolutely swarmed with people, and that can be anxiety inducing after two years of being told to avoid crowds. \n\nFriends, if you are like me, I offer you this respite: the Ace Hotel. \n\nMy husband and I always choose this hotel when we are in the city. The people who work at this establishment are warm, kind, and welcoming. We interacted with the front desk, the bag check, the lobby bar in the evening, and the lobby bar in the morning - every person was genuinely nice. \n\nThe amenities are *cool,* but they are also luxurious. Immediately upon entering the lobby, you\u2019ll get the feeling that this is where you were always meant to be in the City. Oh! And there are some stunning views of the Empire State Building. \n\nAlso, we\u2019ve stayed a handful of times, but ever since our first stay, we are always met with a lovely \u201cwelcome back\u201d message in our room.  \n\nI love it here. I\u2019d travel to the city just to stay here.\n\nThe only thing that I\u2019d change is that there are no vegan options to eat at the Lobby Bar in the morning or any other time of day. We had plenty of quick options on DoorDash, but for a spot that does everything else so right - this was a surprise to us. \n\nTL;DR: You will feel a warm welcome as soon as you step inside this beautiful, cool, and luxurious hotel. If you\u2019re vegan, you\u2019ll have to order out if you want a late night snack, but that\u2019s no reason to deprive yourself of an amazing stay from start to finish.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

All and all, I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness and efficiency from everyone who worked at Ace. \n\nI checked in early in the AM with Freddy who was working at the time, fully expecting to just drop off my luggage but the room was ready. I went into the room but it all felt a bit too dark for me as it had limited natural light. I debated whether to be \"that customer\" who complains but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask. So I went back to the front desk to see if I could switch out the room. Freddy made it work though he said that it won't be ready until the normal check in time which was 3pm. He advised for me to grab my things and leave it in the luggage room in the meantime so I could be free to roam and come back later. \n\nWhen I got back to the front desk with my luggage, Kimani was there instead. Without missing a beat, he knew exactly what the ask & plan was, and confirmed that I should be all set for the new room later that afternoon. While this may seem like a small thing, it really makes a difference to me. I didn't have to explain the situation again, or feel bad about asking, or worry about potentially not having a new room. Throughout my 4-days stay, I mostly saw Kimani whenever I had ad hoc questions and he was always quick to help me out. \n\nI did speak to Marcus (I think that was his name) at the front desk one night to comment on how hot my room was.

The hotel is extremely run down, the rooms are shabby and very poorly appointed. They should be charging half the rate they do for the quality of the room. I booked a Queen room and it came with a Full size bed. I attempted to address quality concerns with the manager prior to checking out and was told I didn't bring up the matter soon enough in my stay. I was given a paltry credit of $100 (which was about 5% of the cost of my stay), and offered a discount on a future stay.

Have stayed at other Ace Hotels before and this one leaves a lot to be desired. Issues:\n\n1. No breakfast! \u201cChef didn\u2019t show up\u201d. On a Sunday, hard to find good breakfast options nearby.\nEDIT: Day 2, STILL NO CHEF so no breakfast. What the hec, Ace? You didn\u2019t learn the first time he was a no-show? Even waitress said \u201cyeah he\u2019s a bit lax\u201d.\n2. Dimmable lights in room all flicker. Wrong bulbs in them.\n3. Safe didn\u2019t work on arrival. Needed security to come change batteries. This stuff should be checked on each new arrival so guests aren\u2019t left waiting half an hour when they need to head out.\n4. No complimentary coffee, tea or water. This is not a cheap hotel, I expect at least the same amenities as I get at other hotels.\n5. There isn\u2019t even an option to pay for coffee in the room, only for herbal tea bags.\n6. Shower and sink drain poorly - quite gross to be standing in a rising pool of water in the shower or waiting for sink to drain as you shave\/brush teeth.\n7. Record player but no vinyls? Who travels with their vinyls? A set of vinyls in each room would be amazing.\n8. The cables for various things like TV or desk lamp are just hanging mid-air or half-coiled. No attention to detail in presentation of them. You can look chic and vintage without looking messy and disheveled.\n\nI\u2019m enjoying New York and was thinking of adding a third night on but it likely won\u2019t be at this hotel.\n\nEDIT: On check out, no queue, gentleman just says good bye, no \u201chow was your stay?\u201d Management appear to have given up at this hotel.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The elevators are painfully slow; the hallways upstairs are as hot as a sauna and then the room ... \n\n- despite setting the A\/C as low as it could go it was never even cool in the room\n- The bed was fine but the headboard is some form of pillow that does not stay in place so you cant lean against it and the bottom fitted sheets did not stay on the mattress so was constantly having to recover the exposed yellow-stained mattress\n- the decor is minimalist which is the Ace's vibes but it was very bare and depressing here and the carpets felt like they havent been cleaned in years\n- the bathroom is tiny, fine, but the bathroom was scuffed up like an old rental and to sit on the toilet I had to have one foot in the shower. Water pressure was weak and the tub was tiny with a curtain that you kept stepping on and water splashing everywhere.\n\nAt least the Wi-Fi worked enough to stream and close to subways, Black Seed and Milk Bar. But also...no bodegas or pharmacies within a 2 block radius so have to walk a bit far to stock up on water or snacks.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Kind of centrally located, easy to head uptown, downtown, to the east or west side. Rooms give you enough room to breath, unlike aforementioned Soho boutique hotels. Comfortable bathrooms.

From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were met with warm and friendly service, a rarity I've found at some of Manhattan's more premium boutique hotels. This is one of the main reasons this stay was so memorable to me. \nAnticipating leaving our luggage with front desk when we arrived, we were accommodated with an early check-in (we arrived around 1 PM) which allowed us a lovely space of time to decompress and freshen up after our travel. \nWe did not engage with the staff that often during the duration of our stay as we were quite out and about, but all of our interactions were pleasing. From a location perspective, I absolutely loved having Stumptown Coffee Roasters attached to the lobby, and open early (we for some reason couldn't sleep past 7AM). I'm also a huge fan of Milk Bar, which is also attached to the hotel on the corner of Broadway and 29th. \nThe lobby is incredibly chic and loved the old-fashioned photo booth. We didn't have a chance to try the food or drink but the menu looked lovely. \nOur room was spacious and clean upon arrival, and the housekeeping service kept the premises in great shape throughout our stay.\nWe will definitely be back to the Ace, most notably for the warm service but also for the chic locale and atmosphere.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

When you arrive you are greeted by the most delightful front desk staff & instantly you feel like an old friend returning to visit! Just thinking about my experiences so far gives me chills, as I recently started doing work travel again I was a bit nervous to go alone. But when I got to the Ace I felt secure, safe & \"at home\". The rooms are all unique and feature local art which truly is part of the fun when you open the door. I've stayed twice within the past few months and assure you I will be returning for every business trip if I can. The rooms were spotless & I consider myself on the side of overly critical. Saying that I was truly impressed with how impeccable the rooms were. The lobby is a whole VIBE, where you can relax in the morning with coffee or a cocktail to top off the day! The beds are beyond comfy, love the robes provided & the pillows are made for a princess. I would know, I even bought them for my home! The bathroom showers feel like a waterfall & love that beautiful shampoo, conditioner & body wash is provided. Makes packing a bit lighter & love that it's sourced from Japan!! Special shoutout to David for always making sure I feel right at home. Thank you so much to everyone at the Ace, I can't express how grateful I am to have found such a great place to rest after the chaos of the city! It's great to know I always have a place to call home in NYC!! Cheers!!","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This use to be the warranty of a nice stay. \n\nIn NYC, August 2019, room 1217 was disappointed after an amazing stay at  ACE in LA. Last December, sister\u2019s houses in LA in Palm Spring was heavenly. Therefore we gave an other chance to Big Apple 29th Street with an upgrade to a larger room. \n\nIn 2019, Room 1217 was a disappointment. The room was clumsy in a form of a Z but the view on Empire State was just amazing. \nThis was a medium size room. The proximity with the elevator was an nuisance. It smelled dust around the bed. \nIn 2022, Room 919 was proposed. Despite the size of the room, there might be a king of fenshui iatus that make the room quite inconfortable even though  it is large with a couch. \nOpening  bathroom\u2019s door, that a shock.  Toilettes, bath and sink fits in 2 SQM max. Some toilettes are bigger than this.\nIt is claustrophobic. \nGetting to the reception I explained that I would prefer a bigger bathroom. \nAfter 40 minutes and 5 to 6 diff\u00e9rents people (with a white air guy who disappeared after telling me he would check with his boss). They propose an option. Every single time I had to get back to the desk. This would have been wise to come and get me in the lobby.\n\nThey proposed a room and I asked to see it. It \u201cpissed\u201d them off. Finally someone show it to me. The 1017. The same awkward room as the 1217 with amazing view. At least the bathroom was small but from an acceptable size. \n\nSeal siles are black. I was intrigued the day before leaving. So I used a tissue to check them at the level of my shoulder. This was properly disgusting. I mention it to the desk showing pictures. I recall the downgrade for which they propose a discount of $80 ($40 for two night). We spend the all day out and come back  to pick up our luggage before going to the airport. The same white hair guy was behind the desk. Without saying a word he call someone with his talkie walkie. No one offers to find a taxi for us. We walked under the rain and find one after at least 30 minutes. \nAll in all this is not cool at all and such venues should no longer be mentioned into LVMH Guide. \nThis was our 25th birthday and you expect everything to be perfect and cool. Such a disappointments.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Thinking it was just the wind, I went back to sleep. The next day, we happened to look at the tray next to the TV that serves as the minibar, and were shocked to find the candy bars shredded open as if viciously clawed at, and realized that it was clearly done by a rat (see attached photo).\n\nI went down to the front desk immediately and reported the issue, and before I showed the photo, they apologized profusely and offered to move us to a suite at no added cost (nice gesture, but we realized this means that we're not the first victims). They also offered a free night in the suite in the future (again, a nice gesture, but why would we come back to a rat-infested hotel?). They were initially unwilling to do more than waive the daily resort fees and the one-night stay in the suite. After more haggling and back-and-forth, we gave up and left the next day. \n\nFew days later, the manager did refund the entire stay with a note inviting us back. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be staying there again.

The property is perfectly situated for easy subway (28th St\/Herald Square)\/taxi\/walking access and is close to great dining, shopping and entertainment options.  Stumptown Coffee is located in the lobby level, as is a great little bar.  \n\nAs a former work road warrior, the true test of a hotel stay is the comfort and quality of the sleep and shower, and Ace does not disappoint.  The bed was SUPER comfy and the pillows perfection, and we were shocked by how quiet the property was.  Granted, we were on the 9th floor and fully expecting the gentle lull of honking horns and general street noise, but were very pleasantly surprised at how late (!) we were able to sleep.  Our bathroom, and specifically the shower, was HUGE and had perfect water pressure.  \n\nBut the best part of the stay was the staff.  Every single person who works here is super friendly, helpful and laid back.  And it was so nice that the hotel was well-staffed!  Our stay happened to coincide with a freakishly warm early spring day, and we were unable to get the a\/c in our room to work.

The staff at front desk and in the lounge are all lovely. The lobby lounge is almost always hopping and is a great place to work, chill or get a cocktail. The room, while a little tight, makes good use of space and was quite comfortable and super clean. My only quibble was how tight the washroom was, especially the shower, It's small, shower curtains all around that cling to you when wet. And hot water wasn't super plentiful. So if you're really into your showers and need to have lots of counter space in the bathroom, the Ace is not the place for you.

Not great for early risers.\n\nLastly, I got charged a hefty fee for a bunch of mini bar items we did not consume. They will refund - but I could have dealt without the hassle of a call post check out.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

You have to step through the tub to get to the toilet that's right up against the wall so you're smooshed when you sit.  Wall tiles on the floor so super slippery.  Bath fixtures are off centered and awkward so if you shower the curtain sticks to you because of where the water falls (you have to stand against the edge) also getting water all over the already slippery floor.\n\nThey don't give you much toilet paper and don't refill the tissues so bring your own.\n\nHot water died for an extremely long time.\n\nWhy so dark?

All amenities existed as promised online.\n\nI have two major issues with the hotel: 1) the hotel feels tired despite being fairly new. I think the developers did not adapt much internally beyond furnishings when they acquired the building. This can be marketed as \"sticking with the heritage of the building,\" but realistically means that nothing has been upgraded in the building -- this is especially noticeable in bathrooms, which feel that they have the same tile and mirrors as pre-acquisition. Hallways are dark and moody--but not in a chic way. 2) the hotel is formerly a residential hotel, with some of the original tenants still occupying their units (legal requirement of '70s\/'80s New York city code); for me, this meant originally being assigned a room opposite an older gentleman who was hard of hearing and had his TV blaring at all hours so that the entire landing could hear it. He also had a sign on his door addressed to food delivery services, which led to my concerns about non-guests\/non-residents being allowed into residential parts of the building. To the front desk's merit, the team was gracious about moving me to a different floor once I raised the issue; however, I was shocked that this could even be allowed to occur in the first place. Surely there must be a legal recourse for the hotel beyond just allowing rent-controlled, multi-decade tenants to act as they please vis-a-vis other visitors. I've never seen an arrangement like this and was unhappy to learn of it only upon arrival in my room.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel was strict about looking at vaccination certificates so they were doing everything that they could but was still a busy space filled with people drinking and therefore not wearing masks. The only reason I gave four instead of five stars was because it would have been good to have been able to make coffee in the room (stumptown is in the building but no room service due to covid) and also because the rooms are so dark. I know this is the hotel aesthetic (black walls and a carpets old school bulbs) but it really is dark: even in a corner room with lots of windows.

We also had another wonderful time with Pedro the next evening. We met Juan and Julio, the doormen who are warm and funny and aware of everything you need, even before you do! Freddie at reception is that person you wish could be around you daily. He is sweet, helpful and he too anticipates needs ; he is eager to make sure you're having a good time.

Oh, one incredible bartender\/server I'd met last month, Meghan, recognized me at the bar and welcomed us back and it was lovely to see (she apparently is now at the Ace Brooklyn).  In addition to my other fascinations in NoMad, the Ace has cemented my decision that our next move will be to this area.

Hotel was very clean.   \n\nOur bathroom sink was clogged when we arrived.  We called and they sent someone up right away to fix it- great service. Loved the big refrigerator in the room and the mini bar beverage and snack choices.  Also loved the Rudy's barbershop products in the bath.     \n\nRoom- Our room layout was a little quirky.  The toilet and bathroom sink were crowded in one corner.  It was hard to stand at the sink without hitting the toilet.  The bathtub\/shower was also oddly placed.  It was very narrow and hard to take a shower without constantly hitting the shower curtain (which was a circle surrounding the tub) Our mattress seemed old and caved in a bit.  We had to place towels over the bathroom doors at night as the sunlight still came in through the shades in the morning.  \n\nFood- \nLoved the Stumptown coffee shop that it attached to the hotel.  Very tasty coffee and great service. Also loved the Black Seed Bagel shop. So convenient to not have to leave the hotel for food.   Staff in the morning at the coffee bar was great.  They brought us water even though we already purchased food from Stumptown. \n\nI would definitely return again but would like to stay in a different room.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our stay was the last week of May so the weather was warm and a bit humid. We were walking around the city and returned to the hotel hoping for some cool air. Our room was warm so we called downstairs to ask why our AC was not working and the concierge was very friendly but told us the hotel was on a two pipe system and we would not be able to adjust in our room. He said the best thing to do would be turn the air off completely. We tried this and ended up sweating most of the night.

The room is like someone's downtown studio apartment, not a hotel room.   This is reflected in ways both good (great decor, record player in the room, super comfortable bed with nice wool blanket) and somewhat annoying (no place to put toiletries near the sink; showerhead is directly overhead; why does the TV face the bathroom door instead of any actual seating surface?!?).   But you're not staying at the Ace to drift off to Law & Order reruns with a half-empty glass of minibar chardonnay on the nightstand.  Truth be told, as I got used to the room's idiosyncracies, I started to enjoy them.  And most importantly, the service was excellent.  \n\nA word on the lobby: it has more millenials hunched over laptops than you can shake a stick at.  The lobby bar, coffee shops, and restaurants connected to the hotel are good, but the vibe might be too hectic for some people.

And this is the point, there are plenty so to do well and get the repeat visitor they have to be good.  To be honest, I stayed at the Ace because it is a block from where my friends live.\nThe lobby and bar area are cool - I arrived late in the evening and the music was going strongly and there was a good buzz.  \nThe rooms are the wrong side of shabby-chic.  It could be brilliant, but they need a few more creature comforts rather than trading on spartan.  The pillows on the bed were very good, and the shower strong albeit small.  There are lots of details that individually are good, but they don't add up well.  the gym is good because people are ether too cool to use it, or not up early in the morning when I used it.  Again, its the detail - one of the treadmills was out of order and the bike did not work with the programme settings etc.  For what you pay these things should be fixed over-night.\nI also was not happy with the $29.00 per day \"destination\" charge.  This is a stealth tax by any other name.  For your $29.00 you get free internet (er...that's not free), a 10% discount in the bars etc (er...so you have to spend over $290.00 to make the 10% discount worth it).  I did not have the charge explained to me on check in but was rather abruptly told it was detailed in the confirmation e mail of the booking.  (er..who reads them?). So, I'll make it easy for you - add $29.00 to your day rate, and then the tax and then the New York tax etc etc.  Ace need to drop this charge, it is not a resort where these things are more common.  So, of this style of hotel there are certainly better, and not too far from the Ace Hotel","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The room was very spacious, but there was a lot of wasted space. The hotel was formerly apartments, so it would have been a studio apt. There was ample space to put more storage. The bathroom had a strange layout and no storage. I had to stand in he middle of the tub sideways in order to be under the shower head. The bed was comfortable and the housekeeping was prompt. Now, on to the lighting. The room was very dark. There were a few lamps which really didn\u2019t cast much light. It was very hard to put makeup on. Now for the lobby. There was a hipster vibe with darkness and people just sitting and staring at their computer screens. I don\u2019t know what they do, but it must be the cooler Starbucks crowd who come for the stumptown coffee (there\u2019s one in the lobby).  Our room rate included a destination fee which entitles you to certain discounts at he lobby bar and certain meals in the restaurant. You have to charge it to your room. Not once, but twice at the bar we had to point this out to our server despite the fact that we gave them our room number and it was on the bill. I have a feeling this happens often. I wonder how many people bother questioning it, but for a $29 destination fee I was questioning it. The bar service was extremely spotty and indifferent. Old fashioned was tasty though. There was live opera on one of the nights in the bar area which was awesome. It was a strange mix of beautiful singing mixed with glasses clinking and cocktail shakers shaking. A cool hotel but I think I\u2019ll stay elsewhere next time. ","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Aircon panel partially unattached, staining to the ceiling, old carpet, ripped sheets, the musk of mildew throughout. \n\nIf they switched the effort that has gone in to the \"vibe\" and put it in to maintenance and some upgrades it could be very nice and a cool place to stay, but at this time it just feels rather run down and expensive for what you get.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We spent 5 nights during New York World Pride. We booked this hotel based on friends who loved this hotel in the past. The operative word here is past. \n\nThe glory days of the Ace Hotel New York are in the past. For the price we paid, we expected a first rate experience. It was not. It was possibly the worst hotel experience I've had in a long time. \n\nI went to visit the hotel two weeks in advance of our arrival. I wanted to see what our room would look like. I waited a full 45 minutes for a sales person to show me a room. A sales person never presented themselves despite asking reception three different times. btw: very haughty staff. \n\nUpon our arrival we discover that our room is woefully out of date. \n* USB ports? Nope. \n* Old TV that you could not mirror with devices. The TV didn't work for two days. And the channels meh. No premium cable channels. \n* Electrical outlets that didn't work, were too loose to keep plugged in and non-existent.    One side of the bed had none. \n* Musty corridors and carpets\n* Tattered furnishings.\n* No desk or work space\n* Tiny bathroom \n* Old sheets and towels\n* Haughty, unhelpful and rigid reception desk staff. \n* A room with barely any electrical lights. \n* A beautiful '50's style fridge loaded with alcohol. When I asked reception to have the booze removed they informed me I would be charged $75 US. This sent me over the edge. Were staff aware that former owner Alex Calderwood, 47, was found dead in the Ace hotel in east London hotel surrounded by alcohol and a makeshift crack-cocaine pipe??\n\nFortunately, a manager that was brought in from out of town came to the rescue and did the best she could do manage our issues. If it had not been Pride week with all major hotels books weeks ahead, I would have insisted they allow us to cancel our reservation. \n\nThe Ace Hotel was once famous for their fabulous parties. The parties during our stay were a big bust. \n\nAlex Calderwood ran a brand renowned for its style and affordability.

I know its an old building, but both rooms I stayed in were the same. AC units in need of a good clean.\n- Cockroaches spotted on 3 evenings. One thing to note was that when I left for work on a morning there were room service trays left outside that had been there overnight, which could be attracting the bugs. \n- Loud (old) pipe system.

Not a problem for me as I was working and getting up early, but would have been annoying if on vacation\nI've stayed at many of the Ace hotels in the past, and would stay at them again, but I would give the NYC one a miss.

Christina worked with me for months and really left no stone unturned. Check in was a breeze, everyone was so friendly and helpful... every single staff member we encountered during our 2 night stay went above and beyond in every way possible. When we entered our spacious and well appointed large king room on the 11th floor, we were instantly amazed by the view of the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING directly outside the window next to our bed. We enjoyed the fact that the lobby was always alive with friendly people and so much to look at and experience.

The only drawback was the bathroom. There\u2019s zero counter space and the shower head is awkwardly positioned so that you almost fall out of the shower trying to rinse (unless you want the spray beating directly down on your head).

The bar is great, always full of a really interesting cross-section of NY life.  Everyone is kind and has a sense of humor.  This has been our go-to hotel in NY for years.    \n\nOur recent visit, though, was marred by a very un-Ace-like interaction at the bar.  My daughter and her friend (16 and 15, both guests at the hotel) went down to the bar on Friday night to order mocktails.  (My underage kids have done this a number of times at the Ace bar.)  The bartender was dismissive and said he didn't do mocktails.  Then they asked if he could make the most standard and simple mocktail, the Shirley Temple.  The bartender said that he couldn't make one \"because they didn't have grenedine.\"  Really?  Honestly?  He offered no other options and they left the bar frustrated and embarrassed.\n\nMy kids have always been shown kindness and respect at the Ace, so I was disappointed to hear about their experience.

Stayed for work and couldn\u2019t believe the most epic lobby I\u2019ve ever seen.  Tons of cool spaces to work and hang out, awesome decor, a bar for drinks, connected to a restaurant and coffee shop.  You kind of don\u2019t even need to leave the place during your stay.  I booked a queen room and was delighted to get upgraded to a loft sweet.  I screamed when I walked into the room.  It felt like I had my own enormous NYC apartment: huge work table, record player with records, SMEG fridge.  This place was well designed with lots of character.  Loved the bathroom products and the claw foot tub.  I only had 2 negatives: the mattress felt a little thin and I didn\u2019t love the pillows, and construction.... there\u2019s a lot of it directly across the street.  I had a few too many drinks at dinner followed by drinks with my coworker at the amazing lobby bar, so I could have done without the 7AM sharp construction noise.  But 12pm checkout gave me plenty of time to clean up, fuel up and pack before heading to meetings.  They did have a key card and WiFi issue while I was there, but the staff handled both things seamlessly (literally dropped guests off at their floor and then ran up and down stairs to meet us to let us in our rooms, LOL.  Issue was resolved and we got keys a few hours later).  Considering how bumping the lobby was at 12AM, it was nice to not hear a peep in the room itself.  Stayed on the 9th floor and never heard a single neighbor.  Definitely the coolest hotel I\u2019ve been to in NYC.

I picked a medium room, and it was a terrific size. I could write in my room without feeling claustrophobic, and I loved the shower as well.

My room has a guitar (meh, who cares), a 33 1\/3 turntable + a batch of old records, (again, I don't care). What I DO care about is a place to plug in my computer - and in a double room, 2 computers, 2 ipads, 2 phones and in my case, a couple of plugs for camera batteries. Oh - and the tea pot is a nice touch, but where to plug it in??? One bed has a square outlet with one plug and that is the only accessible outlet in the room....for a place with a sense of the hip and groovy, this is a mystery.\n\nThe ACE in LA has a strip of plugs on the desk, makes it really easy. I called the front desk tonight here in LA to see if they would send up an electrical strip as I have already unplugged the record player and TV, but have not heard back from them.I'm discouraged from staying here again, considering other options, but still have a sense of affection for this place. \n\nWhile there IS a safe to lock up my laptop, there is not a place to plug it in.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

For my pre-operative prep night, she gave me a room with a great view of the Empire State Building and of the turn-of-the-century building across the street with the beautiful stone facade.\n\nWhen I returned to the hotel after surgery, Claire, knowing I was going to be largely room-bound for about a week, chose another room on the same side of the hotel, even higher up, and thus with an even more spectacular view of the Empire State Building. She said if I were going to have to stay cooped up in my room recovering for that many days, I shouldn't have to stare at a view of three brick walls.\n\nAs for the amenities, Claire selected a room with one of your largest refrigerators because she knew I could not leave the hotel daily to pick up restaurant & deli food or make repeated trips to the front desk for deliveries, but would need primarily to rely on groceries. The large table made an excellent desk for my computer as well as for dining. The bed was very comfortable, although too close to walls on both sides for a post-op patient such as myself to get in and out easily or painlessly. The aforementioned refrigerator-freezer was wonderful, as was available shelf space and the tea kettle, but the lack of a coffee set with relevant supplies or even a small microwave oven was quite disappointing. The bathroom was large and comfortable for a shower-only room, the guest supplies provided were great and well-thought-out (also, the black hand soap was a particular novelty to me), and I loved the half-flush & full-flush buttons on the toilet. The room was spacious and accommodated my visitors very easily.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this location to anyone, and particularly commend the service. As I was a Medicaid patient (by definition poor), I warned everyone with apologies that I wanted but could not tip anyone for their service, and received the response they do what they do to please the customers not to receive great tips.\n\nWere I in charge of arranging my accommodations, I might come here every time I am in the city, but a government contractor books my lodging for each separate trip, and seems randomly to book me at a different hotel each time, for reasons only it knows, even changing the transportation companies it utilizes each time. I have been booked for a post-op follow-up trip this week--the third trip in a row the contractor, rather than myself, has arranged, and it booked yet a third hotel, and third taxi companies both locally and when I am in the city.\n\nBut again, with few complaints and many commendations, I would gladly stay there again, recommend you to others, and considering the medical circumstances under which I had to be there, enjoyed my stay very much!","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

I was fortunate to stay in room 911 which was a corner studio suite with a fantastic view. The room featured a king bed, a dining\/work table, and a large couch against the window that provided a great space to read and relax. I would highly recommend this room to anyone who has a couple days in the city and is looking for a great guest experience. Christina Delli Santi at the front desk really made me feel welcome upon arrival and made sure I had everything I needed. The atmosphere of all the Ace hotels is incredible and the Ace NYC was no different. Located on 29th and Broadway, the location is very convenient to get to Times Square\/Central Park as well as the Lower East Side. The Breslin restaurant is one of a kind and should be considered for breakfast, lunch, and dinner as it offers immaculate food options - definitely have to try the Buttermilk Pancake for breakfast! Thanks to everyone at the Ace NYC for an amazing experience and I look forward to coming back!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"NONE"}

The rooms feel less like a hotel and more like you\u2019re staying in a well-decorated, hip apartment in a fun part of town (nomad is a great location) and the downstairs lobby bar is peerless. As in... it doesn\u2019t even feel right calling it a hotel lobby bar (which I don\u2019t think of as being a particularly cool category of thing...) - most patrons during the day are young ny professionals, laptops out, cup of stumptown coffee in hand. In the early evening, those coffees + laptops trade out for cocktails (notably good here) and bites, and the crowd stays consistently young.

First Impressions stick, and after a long flight [from anywhere to get to NYNY let's face it] a Free Drink woulda been nice.. Water, Fresh Juice, Sapphire Martini, whichever.. I think it would have just made the Destination Reaching more Reward than Relief..\n\n2) Booking of Booths in Breslin. Saturday morning, we headed down for Brekker at 8am only to be told that the Booth I had enthusiastically walked up to was reserved for Non Hotel Guests.. The only question that came to mind then was \"What is that about?\".. I had paid my Money, I had made my way down early enough to guarantee a Table [aka Booth] and still someone who hadn't laid down the Moolah for the Room was getting the Jump on me.. Not Happy Jan*..\n\n3) Room Refreshments. Again, and this might be beating the Drum from point number 1 in this Review, but as the saying goes \"a Freebie every now and then makes even the Glummest of Travellers smile\"; actually I'm not sure that's a saying at all, but it should be, because it's true. There definitely isn't a saying \"a free Water or Fresh Juice costs a fortune\" because that isn't true. I know you have a SMEG Fridge in [presumably each] Room, but it's really doing nothing other than safeguarding Forbidden Fruit, and yes at $9 a Pop, Water is a Forbidden Fruit. I'm not asking for the whole of the top shelf of the SMEG to be Free, that would be silly, but at least one of the Drinks with a \"Hey, have me for Free\" sticker\/label would be nice, especially after a Long Flight \/ Cab Ride \/ Brooklyn Bridge Pedestrian Battle..\n\nI think that was about it, not Big Complaints I think you'll agree, and certainly not any that can't be considered or even just fixed straight away.. We loved our Trip to NYNY, it was our First and will not be our Last, and I think I can say on behalf of my Girlfriend too that we will mostly likely stay with you again, because everything else was pretty bloody good. ;)","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff is very attentive; I had mentioned in my booking that it was our anniversary and it was lovely to find a bottle of red wine welcoming us in our room with a handwritten message as well. We stayed in the medium room which was great for the length of our stay (6 days). A personal thank you to the lovely lady that assisted us at the check-in (I didn't ask your name, but thank you again for your very kind welcome). The vinyl player is a nice touch in the room; it gives a nice homy and cosy feeling. The fridge and the snack area in the room are very well assorted, if you are in a lazy mood, you have everything you need, including room service from the bar and restaurant downstairs. The location is excellent, rooms are clean, and the bed is very comfortable. Ah! And the morning coffee from the Stumptown coffee roasters downstairs is a must have in the morning, I am very critical about coffee, and this is very good. A bit of queue (moving fast) but it is 100% worth it. \nThe only downside of the hotel is that the lobby is generally very crowded the entire day as the Ace is very well known as a nice coworking space. It is not easy to find space to have a drink and relax at the end of the day if you don't want to go back to your room immediately. Apart from this small detail, I would book this hotel again in the future.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As an extrovert I loved having it be a gathering place - with a coffee shop, a lobby bar with great cocktails, and a busy delicious bar\/restaurant also attached. (I used them all and enjoyed every bit!) Still felt safe going up to my room due to the elevator's requirement that you scan your key before hitting any floor.\n\nThe hotel has several levels of pricing where the rooms are pretty well described. Traveling alone I didn't need a very large space but still chose 2 steps up from the smallest. My room was completely big enough, with a great bed, great pillows, and enough room. The bathroom was also fine, the shower was FANTASTIC with water pressure pouring so much hot water on me I felt guilty! Decor was weirdly attractive given it looked very much like a guy's college dorm room - Pendleton wool plaid blanket on the bed, wood crates to hold my clothes, desk lamp straight out of Target's college selection. Maybe I have really great memories of college < ; Also - given the business and house music playing in the lobby I expected disruptive noise. NONE. Great soundproofing in my room.\n\nOnly reason this hotel isn't rated as a 5 is that there's a little quality issue on some of the aspects of the room - for example the pole for the desk lamp is not solid.

When I booked and checked in with the extremely friendly and helpful staff, I new I was in for a treat with my stay!  My room had a very cool mural on the wall, with the eclectic, interior decor very fitting of this city\u2019s magnetic, invigorating pulse!  My room was set up where the impressive desk space and bed were organized neatly and efficiently, I have to find the furniture this hotel uses for my home office; wow that desk was useful and inspiring when I needed to take quick notes without feeling cramped!!  Make no mistake, when you stay at The Ace, this hotel will keep that magical New York pulse with you during your stay!  Unlike the thin walls in the room I stayed in at Hotel Pennsylvania, it was nice to be in a room where you couldn\u2019t hear the guests next door.  If you want to chill at the Hotel during the day or evening you can relax in the lobby with nightly music and DJ keeping the crowd as lively as the New York nightlife outside! You\u2019ll find comfortable seating in the lobby with a nice table space if you want to work with your laptop (be warned, it does get crowded), and you can order their famous Stumptown coffee while you\u2019re working!  Speaking of which, the Stumptown blends at the cafe next door rocked my world!  Call Room Service and splurge on a pot with a heated scone if you need a cup to get your morning started; you won\u2019t be disappointed!!!  Never felt this type of vibe or electricity when I stayed at The New Yorker or Hotel Pennsylvania, then again I only wanted to be closer to the train station.  The Ace is still very accessible from NY Penn Station if you choose to walk; get your bearings and head in the direction of 29th & Broadway!!  A classy looking building that feels like a time capsule on the outside when you see the name \u201cAce Hotel\u201d in lights, and just as classy, artsy and with a very eclectic feel the moment you walk in!  The service and friendliness of the staff helped to keep me in sync with the Manhattan vibe, enjoying my stay while mucking about town for a mini-Birthday vacation!  Still plenty of Manhattan points of interest nearby, including \u201cThe Eataly\u201d near Madison Park and the Empire State Building if you have spontaneity for a midnight view of the city\u2019s skyline!  At checkout the staff were kind enough to hold my baggage so I could explore the city and extend my visit before heading home later that evening.  The excellent care given to the building and rooms, the kind, friendly and engaging hotel staff, and most of all the feeling like I stepped off of The Doctor\u2019s TARDIS walking into this hotel as if I were transported to the 1940\u2019s or 1950\u2019s.  The Ace feels like a genuine part of New York\u2019s iconic architectural history!  I\u2019m coming back to The Ace for more visits when I want to get a film festival fix, muck about town or just feeling like my favorite Timelord and travel back in time!  The staff were extremely courteous, including the front desk, housekeeping, room service and the awesome gentleman who retrieved my baggage held for me while I spent more time in the city after checkout!!!  The staff, room and quality of service are everything to me when I\u2019m traveling, The Ace is nothing short of those expectations and I can\u2019t wait to book my room again!!","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"NONE"}

There is so much care and character in every room - from the art that differs in every room down to the vinyl selection in the rooms with record players.  Each room I have stayed in has been unique and thoughtful, with playful messages, the most comfortable robes, and the best hand soap I have ever used in a hotel.  The hotel lobby bar is always hopping, so you don't even really have to leave the hotel to have a great time, the coffee at Stumptown is to die for, and the room service is fast, affordable and delicious (best hummus I have ever had).\n\nAll of the above is great, but what really keeps me coming back is a front desk attendant named Kimani.

He is fun, attentive and accommodating, and it comes so naturally you know that this is more than just a job to him - he actually cares about your stay and wants you to have a great experience.  Before my first visit to the Ace, my regular hotel was the Marmara Park Avenue.  After I discovered the Ace and met Kimani, I have never gone back. \n\nIn addition to Kimani, I have only had great experiences with the rest of the Ace staff - from the doormen, front desk, security, bartenders - they have all been fantastic.  I highly recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Having said all that, it's hard for me to come back to the hotel and it mostly comes down to whether I'm willing to tolerate some of its deficiency as \"hip\" (I don't think I am).. things such as instances of rust in water, black carpet making it harder to spot\/clean , super slow elevator, lobby that's full basically all the time except very early or very late.

But would have been nice to have at least been offered some local tips on food and drink, an intro to the bar and what\u2019s in the hotel. \n\nRoom service was quick but overpriced for the quality (had club sandwich).

It was fine for me as I am a heavy sleeper but I was woken each morning earlier than I wanted by garbage trucks, people yelling, taxis beeping. But I guess that\u2019s New York... if you want a more relaxing, deluxe experience, get a bigger room and ask for a room NOT right above the bar on West 29th St. Or a higher floor (I was only on the 4th). \n\nOverall, a really good experience.

When I got home I was telling someone about the experience. They had been there 2 weeks prior and reported the same thing! The Ace certainly has a \u201ctoo cool\u201d vibe to it, which is awesome, but I also need to sleep comfortably! It\u2019s a shame really, lots of potential for this place. They should take a page out of the Bowery Hotel which I think does a good job of balancing the two. ","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

After researching it online compared to some of its competitors around the area, we choose ACE due to its hipster vibes and cozy decor. \n\nWe weren\u2019t disappointed just yet. The lobby was cool, the fact that they had a coffee shop attached was a nice feature and the restaurant is open until 2am with room service available until then as well. But then we were hit with a big disappointment when it came to our rooms. \n\nWe had a double bed room that seemed to have it all: Two cozy looking beds, a stocked retro fridge and even a Martin guitar. But you know what it didn\u2019t have? A\/C!!!! Granted we stayed on a fall day that happened to be warm. When we got into the room, it was extremely warm. We tried opening the windows but the breeze was non existent. We thought the room would cool down after a few hours but nothing changed. We tried turning the thermostat on only to find it blowing hot air. When we called the front desk they said \u201csince the building is old. Once it hits a certain temperature outside we keep the heat on and don\u2019t turn on the ACs anymore.\u201d I have NEVER heard of this. This is a HOTEL not a apartment building. Your guests have different comfort temperatures that you should be able to provide for them when they\u2019re staying in your rooms. I like to sleep cold, and they couldn\u2019t do anything about it besides offing me a FAN. \n\nI was shocked and utterly disappointed. It made my whole experience do a 180. I slept terrible and wouldn\u2019t stay here again. \n\nSome other things to note:\n\nThe lighting in the rooms are horrible. \nThe bathrooms are VERY small \nThe pillows are really soft and don\u2019t offer any support. \nThe restaurant attached is very pricy.\nThe lobby is PACKED all the time since people like to just hang here even if they\u2019re not guests. \n\nMy opinion is to stay someplace else that can accommodate your sleeping needs. Next time we won\u2019t make the mistake of staying at a hotel we never herd of. ","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I come to lower Manhattan often for work and usually stay at the far better Walker Hotel, but on this trip it was fully booked. Unfortunately, the Ace does not remotely stand up to the Walker, which is the far better place to stay. Next time!\nMy arrival at Ace was fine. The check in guy was very pleasant and recommended a good restaurant nearby for dinner. So far, so good. \nWhen I got to my room, it was uncomfortably stuffy and very warm. So I turned down the thermostat. Nothing happened. So I didn't unpack, in case I needed to move rooms. After an hour, I called the front desk and another guy told me - \"we either have heat or air conditioning on, and right now it's heat. Turn off the system, open the window, and if you need it we can send you a fan.\" Unbelievable that for $400\/night you cannot control the temperature in your room. I had a restless time on an unusually warm October night.\nThis morning, I had an early meeting, and decided to grab breakfast in Breslin's restaurant at 7.15 am. While the food was very good - poached eggs on lentils - the waitress told me there was no coffee. They hadn't brewed any yet. What restaurant opens for breakfast and doesn't have coffee ready? And, although I enjoyed the dish, the waitress also didn't tell me my eggs came with bread. So I ordered toast, which was not only unnecessary, but cost an additional $5. \nHonestly, I've stayed at budget hotels in out of the way places that were better equipped to deal with - and more pleasant to - their customers. And I've stayed at boutique hotels like the Walker and Soho Grand, and they're vastly superior. \nI strongly recommend you to steer away from the Ace.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We liked the feel of the place, the location, etc. That first time we booked a medium room which we liked but by most standards is really small. But they did seem to make the most of the space. This time we booked a large room. We got Attic 11, which is on the very top floor, above floor 12. Huge room - so far so good. But... very, very dark! The windows look out on a wall a few feet away, so no natural light. But virtually no artificial light either. There is a ceiling light in the entranceway, one bedside lamp (sorry, person who sleeps on the left side, no light for you) and a small lamp on the desk. The problem is that none of those 3 lights come close to illuminating the huge leather sofa in one part of the room. Lovely place to sit but you can't read there. I guess hipsters only read on electronic devices so don't need a lamp? Plus a variety of annoyances like a small sink the tilts away from the wall so that anything you put on top of it slides off and down in the sink, no soap at the sink, so you have to grab the body wash bottle from the floor of the shower to wash your hands, electronics unplugged so you have to figure out how to reconfigure everything. Simple things that could easily have been fixed. My suggestion is that someone in charge spend a night in that room and see how everything works.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were tired and hungry after travelling all day so we went straight out to dinner but when we returned, the damp and mustiness was much worse. We requested a room change from the front desk and to their credit they came up immediately with new room keys. Our second room though wasn't what we had requested (was on a lower floor with no bath tub and had a sink within touching distance of the bed which was quite odd) so we politely asked if it was possible to change again, which the front desk gladly accommodated. Third time was a charm as our new room was much better!\n\nThere were a few more hiccups in store - our safe broke with our belongings inside, which security had to come and fix (again, to their credit, a very nice man from security arrived immediately and was very friendly and fixed it without issue). And on the first night or two, the neighbouring guests in the room next door were having a party and there were people talking really loudly in the hallway and coming and going all night so we didn't get much sleep. But this wasn't really the hotel's fault and i'm sure if we had complained, they would have dealt with the issue. I suppose it comes with the territory of being a cool hotel in central NY with a young, fun clientele.\n\nFollowing a bumpy start to our stay, the rest of our stay went by without any hiccups and we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Ace. Location wise, i don't think it can be beaten. We didn't take the subway once as we walked everywhere (including to Brooklyn, but that was a ridiculously long walk and not sure i'd recommend it!)\n\nThe room was spotless and the bed was incredibly comfy that even with the noise disturbance i was able to get back to sleep ok. The staff were friendly but not sugary (which i liked!) and it made such a refreshing change to stay somewhere unique and non-corporatey.\n\nIn terms of improvements, it would be good to have a few more personal touches, e.g. during check in to ask guests how far they'd travelled, if they'd been to the city before, needed a map or directions from the hotel to certain tourist spots, needed help with any restaurant reservations etc. It always amazes me how many hotels get this wrong and don't bother interacting at all with guests, it's such an easy thing to do and really sets hotels apart and gives a positive first impression. For example, my husband had requested some restaurant recommendations via email before our stay but got no response which was a bit of a shame. And it was my 30th birthday but this was the first hotel i've stayed in during a special occasion that didn't wish me a happy birthday or post a little birthday note through the door at some stage. \n\nAnyway, minor grievances in what was on the whole a very enjoyable stay. Will we return soon? Most likely!","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I appreciated the fact that I wasn't charged for breakfast because a simple request took so long to arrive that my breakfast was soon rendered tepid. \n\nWould I stay here again, probably not simply because there wasn't enough to draw me back but I'm sure there are others who are repeat customers.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

They know that you are tired after along flight, all you want is to take a shower and relax and they take advantage of you. Not nice! On the check out date we specifically asked for a late check out and after a few emails back and fourth we received an email confirming that we can stay until 2 pm on both room despite that a guy came to one of our rooms and asked that we vacate the room immediately.

I\u2019ve stayed in hostels that are much nicer than this. I can't figure out how this hotel gets away with charging the prices they do, which are on par with legit nice hotels in the area. The value proposition is terrible, unless you really enjoy staying in a dump. I\u2019ve stayed in a number of very cool boutique hotels that delivered an incredible experience (the original Redbury in Hollywood, the Surfjack in Waikiki, the NY Public, the NY Standard). This hotel is like a bad frat house that needs to be condemned. \n\nThe overall vibe. Too cool for school. If you\u2019re older than 30, you\u2019ll feel geriatric. The lobby is crowded all the time, with no place for actual guests to sit. The front desk was almost friendly, but very disinterested. \n\nThe room. It\u2019s hideous. The only thing on the walls is a large graphic that says \u201cRELAX\u201d. The lone window has a cheap roller-shade that\u2019s cheaper than the window covering in my college dorm. Your options for light are a bright ceiling light or a broken task light above the desk that will no longer hold the position that you try to aim it in, as it keeps falling back down. The bathroom \u2013 wow, it\u2019s worse than what I\u2019d expect to find in prison. Dirty looking tile and a horrible small shower surrounded on 3 sides by shower curtains that are too small to actually enclose the shower, hence you inevitably get water all over the tiny space. Horrible \u2013 I couldn\u2019t wait to get out of this room.\n\nThe noise. I very clearly heard EVERYTHING in the rooms around me. The woman next door was talking on the phone, and I clearly heard the entire conversation, and that\u2019s just the PG stuff\u2026.\n\nI\u2019m still in shock that people are willing to pay as much as they do for the serious abuse that this hotel offers.

Short term on the weekends, regional until I can push the walls out, and these past 13-weeks within range of the Capital of the World\u2014I know how you see yourself NYC, no false modesty in your house. I wanted a night in town, central to adventures after dark, but still within range of the shops and restos up-, mid- and downtown. The Ace did not disappoint. \n\nI\u2019d never stayed at an Ace, but its status for stylishness precedes it and, feeling randy, I went all in. To be clear, my adventures take all forms and I\u2019m as likely to use the tent I keep in my car as I am to grab a last minute airbnb or a new friend to rest my head as the body commands and the mind obeys. The Ace, set as the staging area for my night in the big city, was a level up to the gentle pretentions of your friend in finance who moonlights as a creative from his loft in Williamsburg. \n\nBy day, the part of Midtown in which the Ace finds itself is exemplary of the tarnished brass of new New York: Gotham neighborhoods in transition from sooty film noir to shiny juice bars, hip restaurants and boutique shops that, shuttered and streetlit by night, reveal a glimpse of the timeless metropolis of 20th century film and literature. From the Ace, you can and should walk everywhere, day and night\u2014just not at rush hour.\n\nArriving at the hotel, vaguely designer understated city clothes on display, I walked into a space that felt as equally composed for business professional events as singles conventions, with floor tiles that could have served in a Roman bath. The room was no less impressive: spacious (by actual, non-New York standards), comfortable, with a vintage fridge and an aesthetically pleasing if functionally anomolous turntable (fidi friend in wburg). The staff, when I was present in the hotel to interact with them, were friendly, helpful and, in some cases, engaging to look at. \n\nOverall, and very much owing to the Ace, a very productive night in the city.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

Whenever possible, we stay at an Ace Hotel. We love the young vibe and the bustling lobbies filled with interesting people (and old fashioned photo booths!), and there's always good food nearby. \n\nThe NY Ace is one of our favorites! We've stayed there twice, and are going back again this weekend. Staff there is super friendly and attentive, and the rooms are very comfortable and well-equipped (their little packets of cashews are SO good!), and clean. The bed especially is deliciously comfy, which we so appreciate (and our backs thank us for). We also appreciate that some rooms include a sofa that turns into another comfortable bed (big enough for our 6'4\" son).\n\nThe hotel is in a busy part of the city (the view of the Empire State Building from our window was gorgeous), so there is some noise. But the windows and shutters do a great job of blocking it out. \n\nPlus, the city bustling means there are loads of great restaurants, bars, and shops nearby. The Ace's restaurant\u2014the Breslin\u2014is insanely good (and busy, so make sure to make a reservation)! We ate there several times during our stay, and loved every meal. One night, we had such a fun experience trying the most amazing gin drinks from one of the best bartenders we've met on our journeys. \n\nThere's also a Stumptown in the lobby, if like us, good coffee is important to you. Plus, there's an adorable little gift shop next door with all sorts of fun and unusual gifts (that's where we usually pick something up for our kids back home).\n\nThe lobby is almost always busy and bustling, filled with travelers from all over the world. And there's often something cool happening there that involves music. We never know what we'll find there when we come down from our room, but it's always upbeat and interesting. The hotel is also dog friendly, which we appreciate!\n\nIf having a comfortable bed and well-equipped room is important to you, you want tasty food and drinks nearby, and you enjoy being around creative and interesting people in a great part part of the city, the Midtown Ace is a perfect choice!","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1201072,"title":"A great night!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-02-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"We just had a night on the town in NYC from the suburbs, but it was a unique hotel experience.  The Ace is a hang-out for lots of young folks; the lobby is full of people on their laptops working, a popular bar next to it, and one of the best coffee places in the city is connected to it.  I've met people here for coffee or drinks even without spending the night.  For a hotel patron it means there's a lot going on just on site.\n\nThe decor of the halls and the rooms is also very hip, industrial, artistic, upscale punk.  Lots of fun.  In one corner of our room were painted the words Because I Love You in artsy graffiti style with dripping dried paint.  Amenities were inside industrial or retro type containers.  There's interesting stuff along with the mini bar, like turntables to play.  These optional amenities are fun but quite expensive, but hey it's a Manhattan hotel.\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and helpful, with quick answers and help with anything. I even got an email praising my comment card and engaging me in a nice chat.  The place is run with the same social openness as is evident in the atmosphere of the lobby\/bar etc.\n\nThe Ace is part of an interesting change to the neighborhood.  Penn Station\/Madison Sq Garden is not far away, and Little Korea is a few blocks north.  South is Madison Sq Park and the Flatiron district.  This strip of Broadway between all of them has many new restaurants and hotels.  Retail is still mainly from the Middle Eastern\/African marketplace, lots of incense and perfume and discount clothes places.  But Rizzoli Bookstore, a beautiful new store replacing the old one in Soho is a harbinger of new businesses there.  John Dory is a great raw bar seafood place.  We went to Pergola for great Mediterranean, nit realizing until we sat down that it doubled as a hookah bar!\n\nSo Ace and its neighbors may be too hip for its own good, may seem to only cater to millennials, but as an older Jersey commuter I can say we had a great time, were well taken care of, and could walk up to a Broadway show or jump back on a train at Penn Station for convenience.  I'd recommend the Ace for any local, as well as the many different nationalities who were enjoying there stay there.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}
{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1201072,"title":"Updated: New York Trip Experience Somewhat Saved","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-02-05","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Updated: A quick e-mail and phone response from the management team at the Ace has enhanced my rating of the hotel and that has been reflected in this review.\n\nTheir team was very kind in their response and it seemed like they genuinely wanted to improve and rectify the bad experience.  Hoping the next time I stay that I can give a better review of my experience.\n\nHere's my original review:\n\nWhen our marketing team told us that we would be staying at the Ace for the annual NRF Big Show, I was really excited. I\u2019ve heard many great things about these properties throughout the world and I was excited for the opportunity to stay there. \n\nOur company was also hosting multiple events (happy hours and catered lunches) throughout the hotel and bringing a team of 5+ people that would be staying at the hotel. \n\nUpon arriving early on a Sunday afternoon we were able to leave our bags, but weren\u2019t able to check in early. Their team was super helpful and got all of our bags together for when we returned from a day around the city. \n\nCheck in was really easy and they moved our team through quickly. \n\nUpon getting to my room I was blown away by the size of the room (Medium Room) and what came with it. Large bed, large table, large couch, full size fridge, guitar, turntable. I was really excited. \n\nThen the disappointment started. Once I got settled, I noticed a terrible old smoke smell. Like when your parent quits smoking, but the house still wreaks of old cigarettes. I assumed this came from being on the 2nd floor right above the entrance, but others in our group had similar smells. Not a huge deal. I can get over the smell. I travel a lot for work and know not every room can be perfect. \n\nSurprised by the amenity, I went to play a Father John Misty album on the turntable only to find that the needle was missing. When I went to ask the front desk about it, they said it happens a lot and they just replace the needle. When I asked them to do that, they said they had no needles. Okay, again I can get over it. I normally don\u2019t have a turntable in my rooms. \n\nThrough all of this, and with our events, the staff had been very nice and seemingly accommodating. The environment was very cool throughout the days and nights and really fun to be around, so I could deal with a few disappointments. \n\nThe disappointments continued to come up, though. The breakfast in the higher priced restaurant (we expected this, that wasn\u2019t the issue) was not as advertised. A simple green juice came out flat and unmixed, the oatmeal on the menu wasn\u2019t available (oats and water!), and the refill on my coffee never came after the first pot didn\u2019t have enough coffee for a quarter pour. Again, very nice staff, but couldn\u2019t provide the service requested. \n\nThe last and biggest disappointment was a standard amenity that any hotel should be able to fulfill. The shower was freezing and semi clogged to boot. Every day. No matter the time. Once, I can get. In the morning when lots of people are trying to get hot water, okay. At 4 PM after a long cold day of tours around the city? Not acceptable.\n\nMultiple people from our group had similar issues. Not everyone, so I knew it wasn\u2019t just a whole hotel issue. When it was brought up to the staff, again it was in a very polite manner, they said it was pretty cold outside and there wasn\u2019t anything they could do. That\u2019s weird, because I\u2019ve stayed in other hotels in cold climates and had plenty of hot water. \n\n4 days of cold showers. The other things would be fine, but when added on top of this, I can\u2019t recommend this hotel and won\u2019t stay here again. That\u2019s a standard amenity that you should be able to find at any property in the city. \n\nAgain, this hotel is cool. We get it. We were treated as if we were privileged to stay there (for $350+ a night) at times and our complaints were treated that way. \n\nCome here for a drink or a coffee for sure, but no need to stay here. Sorry Ace. I really wanted to like you.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel is not suitable for all, but is great for me, active and diy traveler.\n\nLocation:\nQuite nice. Subway station(N\/Q\/R\/M) is a min away. Penn station, another subway station(4\/6), Empire State Building are in walking distance too. Roughly 1h to Newark airport, 1.5h to JFK airport by train. There are glocery store\/deli\/bar around the hotel though. Less people on the street in night time, I felt safe though.\n\nReception:\nQuick, hlepful and super friendly. Ask them whatever you need, they will help. But only a few person on duty, it might take a time when you need to talk at peak time.\n\nRoom:\nMedium room is large enough for one. Lovely huge bed and radio. Well furnished but not new. View is limited from the 1009. Free wifi is fast. 7 packs of purified water in the fridge for free(!) No noise from outside and downstair, but I unluckily heard a guest yelling my opposite room.\n\nBathroom:\nSmall shower booth, a coil a round annoying shower curtain. I think it must be replaced to glass or plastic or whatever better. No tub, no toothbrash in the room 1009, prepare at yourself.\n\nOther:\nI guess the key what guest like\/dislike the hotel is the lobby. Many hotel guests and neighbours staying there and having their own time. It is not like traditional hotel, more like living room of your home. Observatory deck on 86th floor of Empire State Building, just 7min walk away, is open for 8am-2am. Good for early birds and night owls.\n\n","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

I'm also a fan of the Breslin restaurant. The whole vibe of this place is eclectic\/trendy\/cool, if a bit overly hipster. I finally decided to stay at the hotel on my last 2-night visit, and it was like ... wait ... what? \n\nSo here's how it goes:\n\n1. You arrive and everyone is helpful and friendly and cool. Got upgraded to a king room, which I think is the second best room they offer. So far so good!\n2. You walk through the hotel halls, noting the funny signs on the walls and elevators, and you're amused, and you're like, this is pretty clever, I'm into this place!\n3. You open the door to your room and the first thing you feel is happiness because the room is so damn big (again, this is the king room), and you also see a full-size Smeg fridge and that's so cute and unexpected, and there's this really cute little drawing on one of the walls that looks like a ladder going into a hole, and you're pretty delighted.\n4. You turn on ALL of the lights and the room is still dark AF ... you actually spend a few minutes wandering around wondering if you missed a light because there is no way it's actually that dark.\n5. You kind of take it all in, and despite the fact that the Smeg is PACKED with every beverage imaginable, and there are Ramen noodles and beef jerky and other unexpected stuff in the minibar, you're realizing it actually looks like you somehow wound up in the shabby-bordering-on-kind-a-dump hotel of a broke college student.\n6. It's SO dumpy (in \"a purposefully stark but still this is dumpy\" way) that you consider calling the front desk and making sure you didn't somehow wind up in an oversized janitor's closet.\n7. You sleep really well despite the constant noise outside, so that's good. The bed is actually really comfy and the darkness is finally working in your favor ...\n8. ... but then you wake up and get really confused because why are you in a college kid's dumpy apartment?!?!\n9. You go to shower and even though the bathroom is kind of cute (though small), there's a shower curtain (which, GROSS) and the water pressure is nearly nonexistent.\n10. You have trouble doing your makeup because, even in the full light of day, the ROOM IS DARK AS A POLAR BEAR DEN which I imagine is SUPER SUPER DARK.\n10. You sleep really well again that night because COMFY BED & DARKNESS.\n11. You check out and the staff is friendly and you're like huh maybe that wasn't so bad but then you're like yeah but I'm never staying here again.\n12. Resolve to continue frequenting lobby & restaurant while leaving rooms for hipsters that appreciate this sort of thing.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

First the positives, location tops and having a busy bar scene, albeit the folks crowding the lobby and setting up their work\/study prevented us as hotel guests from just hanging out.  The spots are first come first served, and these folks aren't hotel guests.  The room, supposedly an upgrade in 909, was the smallest room for a NYC hotel I have ever endured.  The bathroom is quite cozy with obstacles involved.  While the old fashion turntable and vinyl records are a nice touch, they are totally impractical.  But perhaps that's the hype and charm.

I've never seen this place un-busy: just always buzzin' like a little cool beehive, even when the lights are low and the DJ starts spinning.\n\nMenswear Touches: the rooms follow a general theme of gray and signature navy plaid blankets with wrought-iron hardware and black-and-white. I mean, this is the fashion district.I dig the little soap on a rope.\n\nZZZ's: I don't sleep much but when I do I need to crash so I can work early, and I highly covet a quiet room and a comfy bed. It might be the combination of the previous two bullet points that make me sleep so well here, like climbing into a little cave and hibernating, but man do I sleep like aces.\n\nEats & Drinks: The Breslin Bar restaurant is excellent and hearty food, and a great boisterous place for people watching (make sure you get a reso). Similarly Stumptown Coffee will not disappoint and I've been meaning to get a stoneware coffee mug for several visits now!\n\nTwinning: be careful that the first room booking option for the ACE HOTEL often involves a room with bunk beds. This has happened to two of my friends who booked a room here and didn't realize they'd booked bunks! It always pays to read, but some people really also like bunk beds. Just saying.\n\nWifi Woes: My first stay, I actually had a total WIFI meltdown and couldn't connect at all in my room despite best efforts by the front concierge and their tech team via phone...for like 1.5 hours; I needed to file a story. It was honestly horrible. I ended up setting a mini office in the lobby. While people around me dated and flirted and drank yummy cocktails, I balanced file folders on my knees. I was told that next time, they'd give me an upgrade. They honored that upon my following visit (see spacious suite picture). My room was so huge, I just didn't even know what to do with myself, but their efforts to right a wrong--and remember--was duly noted and appreciated.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The hotel is in a great location of 29 west and broadway near fifth and sixth avenue . most of the guests are aged 20-40 techies who spend oodles of their day in the reception bar area permanently glued to iPads and laptops. Two blocks down coming out turning left there is a great little typical deli dinner where you can buy cheap essentials like water but has buffet style get what you want nearly 24\/7 and really good cooks who attract locals workmen tourists etc who can order whatever they want freshly cooked which is great as the hotel has a pricey oyster bar so too elite for my personal taste or budget. My king size bed room on 8th floor was quiet on the whole but floors lower down were not so lucky as I had a colleague in a lower down floor. The decor is great if like me your an Art Deco fan it's literally like something from some like it hot with Munroe . The bed is super comfy a great bathroom with Deco charm brass a bath and good shower with some nice touches shower foam etc that hip. It has an ironing board and hairdryer so what's not good.  The things that would make me think seriously about returning are firstly light the rooms are dark and looks out onto another overlooked building so there is constant darkness and despite an overhead light and two bed lights the type of bulbs and complete lack of any natural light makes reading or seeing anything almost impossible so you need to leave the building to do your make up or see most things . The telephone is a nightmare and the handset did not work at all complicated does not begin to cover it . The booklet in the room did not contain the address or telephone number on it which is plain useless \nI was there to organise a big event so for me it was a nightmare I had trouble for anyone to reach me on the guest list I couldn't see what I was wearing or looked like and I couldn't read much without going outside every five minutes I try to always look at the positive of things and while the room had a guitar yes a guitar as I pointed out to reception I'd had much rather have a working means to communicate with the outside world than play a tune quirky but not useful unless I was a girl guide or wanted to form a band ! The hotel should get some decent simple phones without a million buttons and shortcuts that don't work. Darkness adds to jet lag as you spend days in total darkness only good if you have permanent hang overs or connected online 24\/7 such a shame that some basic travellers needs are not met . So if your partying or a techie great but if your a business or tourist then they need to do more to make guests comfortable decent lighting a phone that  works. A glass of house wine is 9 dollars in the bar as a guide. The hotel receptionists are a mixed bag a few were extremely helpful and other not so with some attitude thrown in for good measure . My son is a web designer and would love this place however my other son an event organiser would struggle to do what he needed to . I hope this helps you decide if it's for you.

Again, a dark space, which is just all industrial style, but not comfortable as one would expect in a 4* hotel. \nOn the plus side, it is a fantastic location with 2 of NYC's top restaurants onsite.\nSave your money, and pay for a grown-up hotel, unless you fancy a glorified hostel.

I needed a hotel for a trip for a job interview and I thought I would give the Ace Hotel a shot. I fell in love with the room as soon as I walked in. The mini room was the perfect size for me and it was a cozy room with everything I needed or wanted. The radio was already tuned to the classical music station and I loved that the hotel room TV already had my name on the screen to welcome me. The soaps in the bathroom were wonderful and the bed made me not want to leave the room, an incredible feat since I always can't wait to wander the city. What really made me happy was when I had pulled up a blanket to keep me warm and comfortable at night I came back to find the housekeeping staff made the bed with the blanket pulled up at pillow level instead of at the foot of the bed. The staff is top notch and my mini room, which is one of their more basic rooms, had a great view of the Empire State Building. This is hands down the best hotel I've stayed at and I hope to stay at Ace Hotels elsewhere.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I know it's bigger than most NY apartments so one can't even make that comparison. Insanely spacious, with cool furniture and a huge comfy bed - it was more than I could have asked for. I loved the huge round sofa under the curved shuttered windows - perfect for lounging on while watching tv and enjoying the Ace's room service. And the bathroom was killer - claw foot bath tub with all the amenities. I stayed at another very hip hotel the night before and it didn't have a fraction of thoughtful amenities that the Ace had. Also, my room offered a full sized Smeg refrigerator, which would have been amazing if I were staying longer. The hotel staff also left a kind, handwritten note on the dining room table when I arrived, and gifted me with handmade caramels and bottled water. The whole experience was a total treat.

They're effectively floor-length sweatshirts.\n\u30fbThe in-room minibar was extremely well-stocked with high-end eats and beverages.\n\nAnd now, the not-so-good:\n\u30fbThe rooms are DAAAAARK. Like, \"can't read my own handwriting\" dark. If you're young, this is probably no big deal. You might even find it romantic. But for those of us firmly in middle age, we need reading light! I contacted housekeeping, and they managed to scare up a spare canister lamp for us, which my husband angled to reflect off of a wall and provide somewhat adequate illumination. \n\u30fbThe water pressure--at least in our room--was comically weak. When you're staying at a cut-rate hostel, this is to be expected. But when you're paying almost $500 a night? Yeah, that's not awesome. \n\u30fbThe windows are either single-pane or super-cheap double-pane. In any case, they provide virtually no noise insulation. Even though our room was on the \"quiet side\" of the hotel, I tossed and turned fitfully every night of my stay as the sounds of NYC fought past the extra-strength earplugs that I vainly shoved into my ear canals.\n\u30fbNo body lotion provided. Again, for almost $500 a night, a hotel can spring for a few ounces of moisturizer, don't you think? \n\u30fbIf you want anything delivered via housekeeping, there's a $5 service charge...on top of whatever you might tip them.\n\u30fbAs others have said, the lobby is a moshpit. Even at 7:45am, it was hopping with hipsters; and at 11pm, it was just short of a rave. I understand that this Ace Hotel is trying to create a \"community space,\" but it was a strange sensation to return to my hotel after a day of work and not feel like I was entering an oasis, but rather, a trendy nightclub.\n\nIn summary, I am clearly not this hotel's target demographic. But frankly, even hipsters like a quiet place to sleep and a nice dollop of skin moisturizer after they shower.

The lobby is overrun by people who aren't staying there which is sort of annoying. The location can't be beat. Subway is right there, easy walking to Flatiron\/Union Square, Penn Station a quick walk too.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The bedrooms are really quirky. The last time my husband stayed here he had a guitar in his room. This time we have a pencil sharpener. The rooms are really comfortable with a king size bed and a funky bathroom. You get given bathrobes and there is a tray full of yummy scrummy American snacks and nibbles with a mini bar underneath jampacked with sodas and alcoholic drinks. The doors are magnetic and you have a magnet for the door to let the housekeeping staff know whether you want your room cleaned or not with a 'not now' on one side and 'now' on the other. We had a beer and a gin and tonic at the bar on our first night which was delicious. Our bedroom has the most amazing view of the Empire State building.\n\nDefinitely worth staying here.

The Ace has a chill, hipster vibe which plays out from the always busy lobby area to the room decor.

Read my review carefully to see if this hotel would fit your style and needs:\n\nWe stayed at the Ace Hotel previously for one night only, in one of their smaller rooms, so it was a treat for our babymoon to stay in a room with a king bed and a bit more space. This hotel is perfect for yuppies and hipsters (I think I'm a combo of the two), but it's also a great deal for anyone who wants to stay in the heart of the city and plans to spend time in multiple neighborhoods.\n\nThe hotel itself is a bit of a \"scene\"--during the day, the comfy lounge is full of patrons on their laptops. Many of these people have either gotten coffee at Stumptown, which opens into the hotel, or they've gotten food at the bar in the lobby. If you would find it annoying to not easily find a place to plop down in your lobby, then you may not like this hotel. However, if you like people watching, and you're fine with taking yourself to your own room to relax, this is no problem. Plus, the perk is that you have Stumptown Coffee on the premises, which is some of the best coffee available in the country. No, seriously. It's from Portland originally, and it's one of the reasons my husband and I will probably always stay at the Ace Hotel. If you're the type who would rather find a hotel with free Keurig cups in your room, this is not the place for you. But if amazing coffee for a couple bucks doesn't break your bank, then stop by Stumptown. My husband drinks his coffee black, and I prefer a latte, but I would honestly drink anything when the quality is this good. They also have some pastries, which are great if you're trying to grab a quick bite for breakfast or an afternoon pick-me-up.\n\nThe scene continues at night, when the lobby turns into a happening bar. Again--if this is annoying to you, skip it. If you want to be seen while you have that nighttime cocktail, you can do it just steps from your room. There is also live music or DJs frequently.\n\nThe restaurant on premises, The Breslin Bar & Dining Room, offers breakfast and brunch on the weekends. It's great to have an option before 10am on the weekends if you're like us and want to put food in your belly and start your day before noon. The food is good, with lighter options (like oatmeal) to heavy, like a full English breakfast.\n\nThe room itself: the rooms are a modern design, and despite normally having traditional\/classic taste, I love the aesthetic of the Ace. The beds are very comfortable (most important), and the housekeeping staff was very accommodating bringing me extra pillows for my pregnancy needs. I love that they have shampoo and conditioner in the shower (not for me, but for my husband, who always forgets to pack his own toiletries). Our shower was one of my only complaints. The heat was not consistent, and I imagine this has to do with many people showering around the same time. It wasn't that it every ran out of hot water--just varied in how hot it was over the course of my shower (and not just decreasingly hot as one might expect). If you're looking for a spa-like experience in your room, this is not the hotel for you. Other amenities: a radio, record player with a few oddball records, some books and magazines, medium-size fridge (we brought some of our own water and snacks), and comfy (but not plush) robes.\n\nAs for the location, you are very close to NOMAD and Eataly (great for lunch) and all the shopping in that district, and only a mile from the theatres, with an easy (if congested) walk up Broadway (no need for Google Maps!). We like walking and walked as far as Chelsea one night, but you can obviously take public transportation or taxi\/Uber as well. Other gems nearby that a first-time tourist may overlook: The Morgan Library and Museum and The NYC Public Library (you know, the one with the lions). There are also many other boutique hotels in the area, and they all have their own restaurants on premises, which are a great option if you want to grab dinner \"close to home\" before heading to a show or out on the town.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The Ace was perfect for us. Rooms are pretty basic and lighting a bit dim but they are pretty cool too with record players, big tv's, Smeg fridge full of beers. A desk, loads of hanging space and decent shower and bath tub make the rooms just fine. Like a very posh back packers. \n\nWhere The Ace scores high is everything else. \n\nThe location on 29th is perfect. Half an hours walk (30 blocks) north through Times Sq or up 5th Av and your in Central Park. The same south and your in Soho, Greenwich Village or near to Wall Street. 15 minutes west and your at Chelsea Market and Meatpacking District and 15 minutes east and your in East Village. \n\nRight on your doorstep are loads of great bars, restaurants, diners and hotels (e.g. nomad hotel, Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe, ABC Kitchen and Cucina and Eataly - all amazing places).  Also, pretty handy are the East River Ferries up on 35th. For $4 you can hop on a 20 minute (amazing view) ferry to Williamsburg where you'll find the best bars, restaurants and cool hotels all within walking distance. \n\nRight in the hotel are some pretty cool places too. Starting with the lobby bar - DJ's and great relaxed vibe into the small hours. The Breslin (same guys as The Spotted Pig in Greenwich Village - I think) is a really buzzy, fun bar and restaurant. Book - its worth it. \n\nStump town have a little strip of a coffee shop at the front serving smiles and great coffee. Next door is Rudy's barber shop - again v. hipster if you like $30 hair snips.  Finally, there's a good seafood joint here too. I didn't try it but it looks fun. Lots of oysters on display. \n\nThere's ok meeting facilities in the basement (the AV and audio guys were great) - facilities are a bit cranky but fine. There's also a very compact gym in the basement too. \n\nOverall a great hotel and good value for money. I would definitely recommend. I stayed for 2 nights earlier at The Nomad (around the corner) where the rooms, corridors, restaurant and bars are definitely swankier but it's at least twice the price and whilst cool it's probably not quite so much fun as The Ace.

The Ace is one of the most refined, mesmerizing, and modern hotels in the city, and their exceptional service and attentive staff are nothing short of extraordinary. \n\nI stayed at the Ace over the course of three weekends in February and March this year. Needless to say, for so many reasons, I kept coming back. The hypnotizing atmosphere and alluring charm of the Ace swept me right off my feet from the moment I first walked in, and from there, only magic ensued. \n\nThe lobby alone is one of my favorite places to be in New York. Whether you want to relax, work on your laptop, read the paper, have a glass of wine, or mingle with locals and other travelers, the Ace is consistently filled with the most interesting people, who much like myself, don't want to leave. You can really only experience it for yourself to comprehend the atmosphere of this beautiful space. The romantic glow of the lobby will most definitely cast a spell on you, but the entire hotel will simply bewitch you. \n\nThe rooms have a luxurious, modern rustic character which make you feel right at home, except somehow even better. The Ace makes it a priority to attention to detail - each room is completely satiated with exactly what you need to feel comfortable, but delightfully fulfilled with even more than you expected. I had the pleasure of staying in their Mini Room and Medium Room's, and my experience in each one made it extremely hard to check out. From the most comfortable (and huge) fresh beds and linens, to the rain shower heads, soft robes, guitars, record players, and brimming mini bars in between, not only was it hard to check out but it was also hard to leave the rooms all together!\n\nAs for the staff, my goodness. I have never met so many amazing, accommodating, and generous people all in one building, let alone all working for the same hotel! My birthday passed over one of the weekends while I was there, and I was completely delighted and surprised by how generous the Ace team were to totally surprise me with an incredible complementary room upgrade, and to also wish me a very happy birthday with a bottle of red and card waiting for me upon arrival. I was touched, humbled, and perfectly blissful. I could have never wished for a better surprise or more beautiful gift. What's more, is many of the staff took it upon themselves to actually learn and remember my name. House keeping also left my room completely fresh, clean and immaculate every single day. There is no other place in New York that could make me feel like such royalty, or steal my heart the same way that the Ace did.\n\nThis hotel is something special, and truly ethereal in the heart of New York City. I will most definitely be back again, and can't wait to visit the other Ace locations too. Thank you so much to everyone who made my stays as sublime as they were, and for making me feel so completely wanted and welcomed. \n\nUntil next time!!","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

May 2016 and February 2017.\n\nI have to say, I am not a fan. I gave it a try the second time with a so-so experience the first time around. However, both stays have been pretty underwhelming and the service is not really very professional.\n\n1. Location is OK. Midtown is a decent part of Manhattan. Not the coolest part of town. It's a bit touristy. I stayed here because it is close to where the conferences were that I attended for work. However, the location is decent.\n\n2. Rooms are Overrated. The rooms are unique, but that's about it. The lighting is really dismal and depressing. The black carpet, black doors, black shades kind of need some light if you ask me! I have three lights in the entire room that barely light up anything. The decor is very much like a dude, college dorm room. \n\n3. Service. This is my main issue. Some people who work here are nice to your face, but I always get the feeling that they are annoyed when they actually have to help you. It's as if they feel that you should be thanking them for allowing you to stay at their \"cool\" hotel. It's as if, they feel that they are entitled to have a job where no one ever complains or expects them to actually follow through on anything. It's as if, they just want you to only give positive reinforcement on what a \"cool\" and \"unique\" place The Ace is, yet when there is a complaint or something different or special needed from a customer, they have no idea how to handle it.  It feels very one size fits all mode of service and they don't seem to know how to relate to anyone who is different from them.\n\nHere is some advice to The Ace, serve your customers with respect and don't treat them as if they are \"outsiders\", \"complainers\", \"stupid\" or \"unreasonable\" when they just expect the same level of service you'd get at any other respectable hotel who cares about serving customers. Don't expect all of your customers to be young, hip, cool people who are like you (or more accurately how you perceive yourself to be, because the way you act ain't cool).\n\nPeople who give you their money expect you to treat them as a guest, not someone you merely put up with because you need their money to stay in business.\n\nIf you can't run a hotel with a true customer service attitude (not perfection mind you), then why are you in the service industry?","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room felt like a New York City loft with hipster feel. It even had a guitar in the room. It was fun to stay in. There was no coffee or coffee machine in the room but there was tea for sale and an electric kettle to boil water in. A great coffee shop was located in the lobby with coffee for sale. The lobby was an active exciting place. Crowded with people working on their phones and computers during the day and the place turned into a nightclub every night. (So if you want quiet, low key lobbies, this is not the place for you. I cannot see my 78 year old parents here) The Ace also had a nice bar. Plenty of places to eat near by and just 2 to 3 blocks from the Empire State Building on 5th Ave. it's a safe area to walk. \nNow for the downside. The street noise was very loud in the room. I had trouble sleeping. I suggest you bring earplugs if the sound of sirens and honking cars bother you. ","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Not many choices in\/near\/around the Convention Center for hotels. First time visiting the Ace this year, have to say it was a very fun, cool hotel. From the main open lobby with plush leather couches to The Breslin bar and Stumptown Coffee onsite, it's actually a lobby you want to spend time in. I had a few work meetings in the lobby before and after the convention and it was a convenient and comfortable place to meet.\n\nFor my room, they only had available the smallest option, which I was worried about size-wise. But the decor is really cool(old-school pencil sharpener on the desk, funky radio and other kitchy items, bar well stocked with premium products) and it felt very comfortable, so it wasn't a big deal. The only downside was there isn't a closet, just some hangers on a bar on the wall, which was odd. The bathroom was quite large for New York, I really liked the shower with a window to let out steam. The amenities were very clean as well.\n\nOverall I would stay here again, only other downside besides no closet is the area surrounding the hotel is a little shady, so be careful walking around. We had a homeless guy following us asking for money, we ignored him and walked past, he then yelled \"If someone doesn't give me money Im gonna start robbing people.\" But that's more New York in certain areas than the hotel itself:).","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

(I hadn't). He apparently called in to the Ace front desk a few days before my arrival to put his credit card on file and was assured that my entire room bill would be charged to his card (which would have been a very nice surprise).

If I was someone giving the same gift, I would have been livid.\n\nAlso, for whatever reason my credit card was pre-auth'd three times so my credit card limit was down by $3,500.\n\nOne more thing: They charge $7 USD for a pack of small M&Ms in the room.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Being a Londoner I am familiar with their location in Shoreditch so had a fairly good idea of what to expect. \nWe initially checked into our Small room however asked if we could be relocated to another as the one they gave us was directly opposite the lifts and wanted to negate any disturbances that evening - they moved us immediately which was really appreciated. \nAll the rooms have a similar feel with unique touches; ours featured an acoustic guitar, record player and murals on the walls. The rooms were quite big in comparison to the other hotels we stayed in - only negative is that there was not a lot of natural sunlight or lighting options so the rooms were fairly dark.\nThe cafe downstairs was great for an early \"jet lag\" coffee and the gym was also pretty well equipped. \nWe also ate at the Breslin - the food and service were outstanding and memorable.\nOnly two things to note that bothered me during our stay:\n1) Upon checkout we asked to leave luggage for a few hours at the hotel. We ended up staying with the luggage in eye shot for 30 minutes as they did not immediately move it to a secure lock-up, instead it lay wide open in reception by the main doors at the mercy of all visitors coming in and out of the hotel that morning.\n2) We used the photo booth in reception on our last morning to have a memento of our stay. The photos came out semi-developed so reception team promised to re-fund me the money paid. It was only around $5 however I am yet to see this re-funded on my card (some two weeks later).","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I agree with some of the other comments about the lobby\/bar - the large groups of laptop users take up most of the space and it is hard if you want to sit and have a drink. The hotel d\u00e9cor is really modern - from the lobby to the corridors to the rooms.
