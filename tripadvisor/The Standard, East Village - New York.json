I travel to NYC for work a few times a year and this hotel was on par with most that I have stayed at. I was a little bummed that I didn't get a high room as I had called to request the day before. But I think that since they let me check in early, it totally made up for it. The weather was very blustery and it was downpouring - so I definitely didn't want to walk around for a few hours before check in. I didn't press the matter since I was soaked and cold. But, just an aside, not all rooms have the spectacular floor to ceiling windows with panoramic view as described. My 4th floor room had a sizable window that overlooked the back alley and fire escapes. It was, however, very quiet. I suppose I would choose comfort over aesthetics.\n\nThe room was fairly comfortable. I did have to stop by a department store and pick up a $10 pillow, but I do that at many hotels. The bed was a little lumpy, but fine. The shower was fine, though it lacked a shelf to put your toiletries. They provide their own toiletry line. But if you have facewash or a razor, etc., there is nowhere to put it other than the floor inside the shower. The mini fridge was packed to the gills with mini bar fare, but I was able to squeeze in my own drinks to keep them cool.\n\nI didn't try the caf\u00e9 or bar - there is food, coffee, convenience\/department\/grocery stores within a few blocks. The subway is really close too.\n\nThe staff that I interacted with were pleasant and professional. The door man or concierge would greet me on every coming and going. \n\nSo all in all, it was a fine stay for someone who was only there for a few days and had been to NYC many many times.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

However, I must say that it was Anahis who truly made this stay one of the best for me. Let me share the story:\n\nThis trip was a last-minute weekend girls' getaway to celebrate my birthday. Unfortunately, one of my friends had her flight canceled, and her absence cast a shadow over our early morning mood when we arrived. We got to the hotel super early, and that's when Anahis stepped in. She kindly showed us a place where we could freshen up and change, considering our room wouldn't be ready for a while.\n\nAfter about an hour, to our surprise, we were informed that our room was ready ahead of schedule. Upon entering, we found a delightful surprise\u2014a bottle of champagne and a fruit tray, all to celebrate my birthday and wish us a great time despite missing one friend from our group. Anahis didn't stop there; she recommended a fantastic restaurant and the club attached to The Standard. She even managed to secure a reservation for us, which we thought would be impossible.\n\nThroughout our stay, every member of the staff treated us like old friends. The hotel itself was stunning, and its location was perfect for all the local places we wanted to explore. Despite the absence of our friend, Anahis went above and beyond to ensure that our 72-hour trip became a cherished memory I'll always carry with me.\n\nI'm truly grateful for The Standard East Village, Anahis, and their entire staff for making this experience so special. I wholeheartedly recommend staying here\u2014it's an unforgettable experience.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t stay here again. Apart from the person that checked me in initially, every other front desk staff member was rude, impatient and condescending (excluding housekeeping and porters as they were always friendly when you ran into them). \n\nThe room stank, of mould and something else I wasn\u2019t able to identify. There was a stain on the carpet by the bed, that could only be described as the bodily fluids of a previous guest. Given there is a 450USD incidental hold placed on your card at the start, you'd think that the guest that left this stain would have been charged for a carpet steam or similar to have this removed. The air con was malfunctioning and every time I turned it off, it came back on and it was very loud which made it tricky to sleep. \n\nI did ask for coffee in the room on check in, to then be sent a clunky coffee drip that wasn\u2019t clean and impractical to use and was told if I wanted milk to buy a coffee from the bar. No tea available either. For a supposed 5* hotel, I would expect tea \/ coffee in the room as a basic amenity. I'm fortunate to be very well traveled and this is the first time I've ever stayed in a hotel that didn't provide this. It was also removed from my room after the first night, so I guess you have to ask for it daily. Given most visitors to New York don\u2019t spend that much time in their room, a more practical option would also be better rather than attempting to be trendy.\n\nThere was a robe but no slippers, and given how filthy the carpet was, they would have been welcomed as I spent the entire time in my shoes not wanting to touch the floor. \nThe sheets and towels were very clean to be fair. But the room in principle was grotty and I didn\u2019t want to touch any surface. \n\nThe lights were very dim and only went to a certain brightness, along with all of the hallways, lifts and communal areas being very dark\u2026most likely hiding the grottiness of the hotel. If you are partially sighted, I wouldn't recommend this hotel as I have a few friends and family members who are, who would have really struggled with the lack of light. \n\nMy door was also left open one day when I got back for the day, which I could see from the end of the hall, and when I mentioned it to the person on the desk, her response was \u2018I\u2019ll tell housekeeping to be more careful\u2019 and she carried on with what she was doing. No apology, no asking if all of my belongings were still there\u2026and I\u2019d even said it in a friendly manner, as I deliberately didn\u2019t want to sound difficult despite how shaken I was. As a solo female traveler, this made me very on edge and felt very unsafe for the remainder of my stay. Particularly as later that night there was a lot of commotion in the hallway with someone screaming and other unsettling noises in the early hours of the morning. \n\nThere was a wedding on one of the days I stayed and there wasn\u2019t a lift dedicated for hotel guests and one for events, instead it was a free for all and I had to queue over 20 minutes to get a lift to my room (16th floor or I\u2019d have taken the stairs). Quite frustrating as I was on a time crunch to get ready for the evening for a show. \n\nWhen I checked out, the person on reception simply took my card and said goodbye. Didn\u2019t ask how my trip was, didn\u2019t smile, didn\u2019t explain about the hold on my card and she just walked back into the office. The comments on other reviews about staff not being on the desk is also true, many of the times I would pass through there was nobody there. I've stayed in a few hotels in New York and this is the first time I've received such appalling service, every other experience I've had has been true 5*. I paid circa 500USD a night, which for what I received, was abysmal. \n\nI personally wish I read the reviews here before booking. This isn\u2019t a 5* hotel by any stretch, it\u2019s a 3 at a push. All of the reviews I\u2019ve since read are very believable based on my experience. Overpriced, terrible service and filthy. \n","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

Checked in very late on Monday night (2am) and the room was fine (3rd floor).  Went straight to bed but the street noise was extremely loud and was woken up multiple times.  I thought it was just NY and the low floor, but I didn't realize until the next morning that a high transom window was open. I couldn't reach it even standing on the desk (!) so left a note for housekeeping to close the next morning. There was a huge long desk to work at but could not find any outlets anywhere without crawling under the desk. TV is basic and doesn't offer apps like Netflix\/HBO\/Amazon.  There's a minibar but no in-room coffee or tea. Overall the room was fine - but not great.\n\nBut the kicker was the second night, my colleague and I came back from dinner at 10pm and there was no option to get a nightcap. The bar looked super fun and there were probably 30 people there but we had just missed last call and no exception for hotel guests. I have since looked at the website and it does show that there are no options for food or drinks after 10pm on Mon-Tues. I guess that's fair and I could have done my homework but I was surprised that a hip hotel like The Standard would not have more options for guests, especially in NYC and in this neighborhood which was definitely hopping on a Tuesday night. Both the server in the bar and the front desk staff were completely indifferent and were not helpful in suggesting a nearby option. \n\nOh and then when we returned an hour later after finding our own nightcap nearby, we ran into a couple by the elevator who recognized us from our earlier attempt to get a drink and they let us know that the bartender kept serving them after we left. so maybe they just didn't want to serve a couple of middle-aged ladies after 10pm.\n\nI just felt underwhelmed by the whole experience.  It's a luxury-priced hotel but the service and amenities doesn't match. No gym or fitness center (but apparently you can use a nearby Crunch), no coffee in the lobby or rooms (I see from another review that apparently you can request a machine?), wifi was spotty but they will sell you a \"premium\" option for $19.95.  Just overall not worth the price in a city with such a huge range of hotel options.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I wish I\u2019d read the other poor reviews, as I was in for a shock.\n\nI asked when booking for a quiet room away from the elevator. When I arrived at the front desk and checked in, the lady on the front desk disappeared for a few mins and came back with a big grin telling me she\u2019d found me a special room. \n\nOnly when I got up to the sixth floor did I find out it was exactly opposite the elevator. And when I got in the room, I realised how paper thin the walls are at this hotel, and that not only could I hear it every time to doors to the elevator opened, but I could also hear conversations of the people in the adjoining room and the footsteps and furniture scrapping in the room above. The very noisy air con mentioned in other reviews sounds like it\u2019s in serious need of a service. At least it distracts from the continuous noise of the elevator and doors to the other rooms slamming. \n\nUnfortunately there was little sympathy from the front desk team when I went down to chat to them. I offered to upgrade and pay the difference, but they said the only other rooms  available were in that same room opposite the elevator on higher floors. A guy from the office came out, shrugged and said the hotel isn\u2019t for everyone. So I booked into the Ludlow instead, which is different class in terms of soundproofing, size of room and decor and the service level of the team. It\u2019s not that more expensive, so I wish I\u2019d booked there initially instead.\n\nTrying to see if I could get my money back for that first night\u2019s stay I didn\u2019t use, it then took three days for someone from The Standard to finally call me back, having called once a day to try and get hold of a manager to chat to (one wasn\u2019t at the hotel when I had checked in initially on a Monday afternoon). When Kimberly finally called back she at least acknowledged they should have mentioned the noise issues when I booked, but said they didn\u2019t think a refund was appropriate. Kimberly said I could come in and speak to their Guest Experience Manager, but sadly when I did later that afternoon it turned out to be Matt, the person I\u2019d spoken to on the first day. His refrain is the hotel isn\u2019t for everyone and there\u2019s nothing they can do about the penalty for late cancellation, even where the room isn\u2019t fit for purpose. When I asked whether there was anyone else I could speak to who would have more discretion to find a reasonable outcome, he threatened to call security and I promptly left. \n\nWhilst there\u2019s not much they can do about the soundproofing at this stage and they\u2019re unlikely to upgrade their air con, a shame their service level is so poor and adversarial. That seems to be a running theme in other of the reviews. Not sure if it\u2019s poor training or an attitude higher up at the hotel, Looking through their responses to other posts, I see the customer is rarely right if the feedback isn\u2019t positive. \n\nHope they read some of these reviews with an open mind and see how they can improve their customer service and be more upfront about their soundproofing issues.

However, it was not the same. I had gotten emails that the room had been refreshed & was excited to see them. Unfortunately, my room was not  or did not seem refreshed! It was a small dark room on the 3rd floor overlooking what looked like trash & old used kitchen equipment. The door to the room was hard to get in & out of the room, clearly a messed up lock.\nI had asked for a high room upon check-in but they could not offer me one as all the rooms had been booked for other guests. I assume it was  because I found the cheaper rate on Expedia & did not book thru the hotel directly which I usually do. Front desk clerks were not nearly as friendly as before so that's part of it too. Good help is hard to find I guess. I did not use the Crunch gym day pass either which is part of the extra fee you get charged. Their guest experience guy sends you emails & checks in with you in advance of your stay...which makes you feel very welcomed unfortunately he is not at the front desk!\nThey did offer free bottles of water & that was a bonus since it was SO hot in NYC.

We have a baby so we wanted to sleep in and enjoy it. Well the air conditioner broke in the middle of the night and the room got so hot we woke up at 6am. I called the front desk and asked for help. They told me there were no other rooms (doubtful) the manager also wasn't sorry at all and had no solutions. She also said the air conditioner might just be off. She sent the engineer who confirmed the fan was broken and the unit needed to be taken out. When I called back the front desk told me the engineer said it should cool down soon, but I told her no the engineer said the fan was broken and the person at the front desk admitted he did say that. I could no longer get a hold of the manager. They told me they would refund me the $30 facility fee. To me it was a waste of a night at a hotel. It was almost 80 degrees in our room in July. The room in general was not maintained. There was only one robe, which had makeup stains on it. The pillow case had tears and holes in it. We found someone's birth control on the floor so I'm assuming the room wasn't cleaned that well either. Then when we went to pick up our bags after they held them there was a long line. They couldn't find one woman's bag who was trying to get to the airport. It was clear this place was poorly managed. For the price, I won't go back to the Standard.

From the moment I stepped into the lobby, very late on a Thursday evening to the second I left two days later, every detail was superbly attended to. I was greeted with warm, friendly greetings and beautiful smiles, offered a bottle of water - perfect for the steamy hot summer evening, and asked (with genuine sincerity) if there was anything I needed. \n\nThe kindness with which I was greeted at the front desk was extended to every single person who walked into the hotel. Guests had questions and needs of varying sorts, and every request was met with a response of, \"Of course! I am happy to do that for you.\" \n\nAnahis and Jashia were two women in particular who I saw several times as I waited for my family members on the days of my stay. One morning in particular, I saw both of these incredible women waltz through a period of time that would have flustered me, yet they cheerfully helped two overwhelmed guests who were wrestling with a tower of luggage, assisted a couple in securing a cab, lead two weary women to a comfortable and quiet place to rest, and helped a caller on the phone decide on the best room to book based upon availability, bed options, price, and room location within the hotel. All of these events happened within the span of fifteen minutes. Neither of these woman broke a sweat. Both of these women had broad, joyful smiles at all times - the kind that brightened the entire lobby. I have only written about a fifteen-minute moment of my stay. I was there for two days. Every interaction I had with members of The Standard staff was equally remarkable. In every space of the hotel - the lobby, the restaurant, the bar, the hallways, was noteworthy. Need I say the service was superb?\n\nBreakfast at the restaurant (outside, sheltered from the street) was spectacular. Eggs Benedict with the most delicious breakfast potatoes anyone? My family members each ordered different egg dishes and were equally impressed. Service again was stellar. The chairs were not terribly comfortable, but I find that sitting on outdoor chairs on a hot summer day in shorts is rarely a comfortable experience. However, I will gladly sit on the chairs again to recreate the otherwise incredible dining experience.\n\nEven if my future trips to New York don't take me to the East Village, I will plan to stay at The Standard, East Village in hopes of seeing Anahis and Jashia again. They and  the other employees made a positive and enduring impression on me.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

This was especially jarring considering how much care they seemed to put in establishing a capital-L Look in the public spaces (a slightly more punk take on turn-of-the-20th chic). I could've bumped this to 5 circles if they'd just added some art on the walls, or something to give the room a little more personality. If there's someone on staff reading this, please bring the same kind of character apparent in the public spaces into the rooms. \n\nNow the good news: everything else was great! A+ location, within walking distance to at least 4 subway stations, and dozens of great little bars and restaurants. I might come back to use it as a home base just to explore the neighborhood. The restaurant was much better than I expected from a hotel, especially the sourdough waffle w\/apple butter during brunch.

It feels tired and unloved; there doesn\u2019t appear to be any desire to create a magical or memorable experience, with little regard for customers. For example, checking in was interrupted by the receptionist answering the phone during the process (really rude, I think) and you\u2019re left to fend for yourself.\n\nThe room - for around \u00a3400 per night - isn\u2019t worth the money at all. For two tall adults you feel on top of each other, with a small amount of room around the bed to manoeuvre. The storage is laughable - three clothes hangers, and no shelving. So I just kept everything in an open suitcase on the floor.\n\nThe window (17th floor) was cracked, so during the night I was woken by a dripping noise, which was water coming through. I had to go to the bathroom to fetch towels to lay down along the window ledge. I reported it, but no word of an apology.\n\nThe decor is a bit worn out, the door doesn\u2019t really feel secure (there\u2019s a noticeable gap) and staff regularly use the guest elevators, meaning you stop at several floors as you\u2019re trying to get in and out.\n\nCheck out was bad; no friendly conversation.

The mini bar was stocked with the most creative and unique items that I have ever seen....you're going to have to see for yourself...I don't want to ruin the surprise :-) \n\nMy reservation included 2 bottle of water per day, but the front desk was happy to give me water to take to my room when ever I requested.  \n\nDue to this pandemic, I think they were definitely understaffed, but everyone who was there was so happy to assist me with anything I needed.  Ramon (in charge of security and often seen at the front entryway) was always happy to greet me and hail me a cab (even during the rainstorms!).  He goes above and beyond to provide quality service to his guests.  It's nice to see someone who takes his job so seriously.  You can tell that he is grateful for his position and it is so nice to see the respect he has for his job.\n\nTaylor was also an exceptional employee.  She works in the restaurants\/bar.  When I met her late in the evening at the bar, she was a bit overwhelmed and (on her own accord),  she went out of her way to apologize for the service she felt she was not providing to me.   When I saw her the next day in The Garden we recognized each other and had a lovely conversation about her NYC life.  She was very personable...so refreshing, especially to find someone like this in NYC! ;-)\n\nNatacia is the last person I want to mention.

I had a few concerns about my reservation and she quickly made sure that everything was taken care of before my arrival to make sure I had a 'stress-free' visit.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend The Standard East Village for any NYC stay.  It is so close to the subway you can get to any NYC neighborhood in a pinch, or if you prefer, Ramon will hail you a cab ;-)  I loved my morning walks and loved reading about the local establishments that they recommended for coffee and shopping (this was given to me in my welcome email I received prior to arrival- another touch I don't think other hotels offer). \n\nFor those wondering about COVID safety... the rooms were exceptionally clean!

It's also useful to bear in mind that the hotel and bar downstairs attract a party-forward crowd, so you should expect to encounter that type of element whenever you're leaving and arriving at the hotel. Room service was unavailable, and housekeeping is operating with a bare-bones staff, so it's challenging to receive a room cleaning. This is, to a certain degree, understandable, as hotels begin staffing up post-COVID, but it's disappointing that the existing staff did not seek to offer any remediation.

The larger room with a better view had empty shampoo, conditioner and body wash bottles which I found out after I had already gotten into the shower. At dinner, the restaurant staff ignored me as I sat in the restaurant for about 30 minutes before being attended to.

In some areas it felt and looked a bit incomplete - cables lying around, the heating vent was noisy, there were no slippers and just one robe... it somehow just didn\u2019t have a perfect feel to it the way the room on the west side had.

The room was small, but with an amazing view. Staff was courteous and helpful. \nOverall we had a very good experience, with the notable exception that there was an extremely loud party in the rooms above us that stretched well past 2 am. I went up there to check it out to make sure that it wasn't just a moderate party and that it was just thin walls that were to blame. It seems that someone had booked several adjacent rooms for afterhours partying, and that many people were squeezed into the tiny rooms, with drinking games and whatnot. The noise could clearly be heard throughout the  hall.  I called a couple of times to complain, and the desk was very polite and told me that they would send up security right away. Unfortunately, the noise would die down somewhat, but then start right up again. I barely slept that night. \nIt's too bad because we really like the hotel and location, and we had a nice dinner at the cafe's outdoor dining setup.  I would also advice against getting room service for breakfast; as another review mentioned we got a slice and half of toast and a to-go cup of cold coffee with no milk.  Better to go down to the cafe or grab a coffee around the corner.  \nAs for the partying, it may have been a one-off, or maybe people are booking rooms to get around the early closing hours at bars.

I had a last minute change of plans and booked a 1 night stay in a corner king room. \n\nLooking through the countless images of the rooms and suites on tripadvisor, you'll see large regular and corner rooms with near floor to ceiling windows unlike the corner room I was assigned to. The windows were pretty high, beginning around my chest and going to the ceiling. There were a couple push open windows and was curious to see if that helped regular the room temperature better. Big mistake. The windows are so heavy, they are nearly  impossible to close and create a forceful draft that rattles the front and bathroom door unrelentlessly.\n\nThe desk and bedside lamps are unintuitive to turn on and I found myself going downstairs to ask the desk staff how to use them (the front desk can be difficult to reach over the phone, before and during your stay, and had the most success in communication if i go to them).\n\nOutlets are few and far between and I only found 1 that wasn't used, under the bed. The bathroom has a strange, poignant and off-putting scent to it. The scent of the Hotel's branded Davines hair\/skincare products have a unique smell to them as well but is irrelevant to that of the bathroom. The bathtub is awkwardly set higher then the floor and found it to be quite dangerous in getting out of the shower, even at my height, 6'2. Also there was not a steamer or iron located in the room.\n\nWhen I made the reservation I booked the \"standard time\" rate which they advertise it as a rate that lets you choose your check-in and check-out times. After making the reservation, the fine print states that it applies to reservations made with at least 7 days notice. I did book my reservation the morning of my check-in but this was one of the rates that I was able to select, booking from the hotel directly.\n\nEven after feeling underwhelmed and slightly disappointed with my first stay at a Standard Hotel, the have a delightfully different point of view of what a hotel can be. I love the tenement entrance, the fluorescent lights in the elevator, the hand drawn map on the room cards, the lobby decor and. more.","travelDate":"2020-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Firstly, the person that came out to help us with unload our Range Rover which was stuffed to the max with our luggage and baby stuff happened to be the Front Office Director, Frank Hermann, who saw that we needed space and gave us a courtesy upgrade to the largest swankiest room in the hotel on one of the top floors with an exhilarating view of manhattan from the Freedom Tower to the Empire State Building.  Seems like, during Covid-19, the hotel kept their top staff and managers to provide an even better than standard service and attention to detail, an all-star team if you will.  And boy, did we test them.  Having a baby means we need help.  They bought brand new humidifiers for us because our baby was sensitive, they whipped out of these amazing face masks that were so high quality they performed as if they were custom fit.  They helped us with fresh towels and room cleanings multiple times a day with the most cheerful demeanor that I thought i was in some kind of Hollywood movie and we were the royal family of Siam.  One night there was a party on the rooftop of a neighboring hotel which was a little loud, not so much but enough to keep our baby from sleeping at 7:30 pm and Daniel Alvarez, the night manager called the NYPD to make them stop.  Pretty cool.  Lisa at the front desk during the mornings was super sweet and with the most cheerful smile gave me one of their fancy face masks in super chic black whenever i absentmindedly would leave my room without one.  Special requests?  No problem.  I have to have sprouted organic steel-cut oats every morning and the hotel chef prepared them for me precisely per my cooking instructions every morning at no charge.  Oh, and then there're are our two dogs, Chanel and Ponzu.  They need lots of attention and service.  The staff were so understanding and accommodating because i know how hard it is to clean up after them since at home, I'm the maid, and the manny and the general on call slave to my wife and kid.   Not at the Standard, East Village.  I didn't have to lift a finger.  Now that's a 5-star hotel vacation.  One more note.  There was this super sweet Tibetan Houseman who came by with fresh towels on demand, emptied mini-fridge whenever we needed even more space for our baby food and fresh fruit for us all.

I mean, let's be real, it's the middle of the night, and I don't expect anyone to be friendly, but they were genuinely helpful and got me checked in and on my way to my room in no time at all. \n\nOn my way to my room I was able to observe that the hotel was indeed very clean. When I stepped into my room, it smelled clean, there was hand sanitizer available for me to use, and I had noticed some small differences in the bathroom amenities from my stays at hotels prior to COVID. The bed was amazing, and the full open views of Manhattan from my 15th floor room were the perfect touch as I fell asleep. Everything was perfect. \n\nIn the morning, I enjoyed a very nice meal at the cafe attached to the hotel. Again, friendly staff and amazing food! The espresso was perfect and if you do stay here, please please try the fresh orange juice! \n\nOverall I couldn't be happier with my stay at The Standard, and I will most definitely be staying there again in the coming weeks and months on long work nights - and I will absolutely be recommending my friends and family stay there as well if they want a pleasant, safe and comfortable experience during this weird COVID era. \n\nIf you are having doubts about staying in a hotel right now, do yourself a favor and book a room at The Standard. You won't be disappointed. \n\nThank you to all the friendly staff that made my experience a breeze!","travelDate":"2020-08","tripType":"NONE"}

After a chance encounter with Frannk while popping in for a quick cocktail the week prior, I learned about the hotel reopening and the availability to have access to the gorgeous wraparound penthouse, which is usually rented out for private parties.  He gave me his card and let me know they could make it special while still safe. After thinking about all the fun memories I\u2019ve had at other Standard locations I decided to book it! From the moment I arrived to when I left everything was easy and seamless. Every member of the staff, from the front desk to the person delivering the numerous ice buckets I requested was friendly, accommodating and professional. The personal touches like the \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d messages on the mirrors to the delicious champagne waiting for me in the room really elevated my experience.  I had so much fun I even extended my stay another night, which was also almost too easy to do! I felt safe and truly cared for by everyone there. The view from the rooms are a reason to stay here, but it\u2019s really the staff that made all the difference.

Upon my search, I came across The Standard Hotel that has one location on the West side of Manhattan and the East Village location. From the pictures online I could see that the views were awesome with floor to ceiling windows. I went with the Studio King option which was more than reasonably priced.  Booking the reservation was easy online through their site and I made a note that my girlfriend wanted the skyline view and a tub. A couple of days later a representative reached out to me that they received the request and what time we would be arriving. \n\nUpon arrival, check-in was very smooth and the staff was super friendly. We were surprised with a bottle of champagne waiting for us in the room to start to celebrate her birthday. Both of my requests were met in a high room floor (almost the top) and a giant tub. The best part was that every part of the room had floor to ceiling windows that showed New York City. In the bathroom, another floor to ceiling window was present so as you take a bath or a shower you are able to have the beautiful view which was my girlfriend's favorite part. We were able to watch the sunset over champagne and the sunrise over coffee.\n\nDuring my stay, I didn't have one complaint, everything was seamless from start to finish and this hotel checked all of the boxes for me and exceeded expectation. Bargain of a price, friendly staff, staff that wants to make your stay special, a beautiful view, beautiful room, comfortable bed, and prompt service. \n\nMy experience with them will make me not even look or recommend for another hotel in New York City. I will definitely be staying here in the future and would like to try out their Highline location as well. \n\nThank you again The Standard","travelDate":"2020-07","tripType":"NONE"}

We came back to the hotel to have a coffee at the cafe and were surprised by the disinterested service level. As we were seated by the bar we also heard the chatting between the staff members and I guess you had a change in staffing policies and maybe management?

The bartender who looked after us was great which spiked a bit more confidence in the F&B team. \nAfter lunch we were checked in to the room and the room was spacious and ok, albeit a bit dated, would have appreciated plugs on both sides next to the bed however! \nWhere the hotel really falls short however is the roomservice. We used it 3 times during our 3 night stay and every time it was the same disinterested and almost rude person taking the orders over the phone and the person that actually delivered the room service made you feel like you had interupted her from something way more important and the entire concept of room service was an inconvenience to her.

I kind of dig places like the Marlton and The WSH, but my wife likes a hotel, well a little more modern and less dark. So we tried the Hyatt then the  settled on the Standard when visiting the East Village area. Thought I\u2019d pass along my thoughts on the Standard.\n\nIn the past (over the last 3-4 years) we have stayed at the Standard as our go to when visiting. We have probably been there around 5 or 6 times usually for 2-3 weekend nights each visit. We normally stay in a corner room and request a high floor. Our 1st time was great and our 2nd time was equal to the first. \n\nSo we kept coming back. The room and staff were good and the hotel\u2019s attempt at a cool hip vibe worked. Those times the staff seemed customer and service oriented.\n\nHowever, after those first few times staying there the quality of out visits deteriorated. Our room floor requests were ignored, the valet\/bell person was nowhere to be found, the rooms felt tired (especially the bathroom).\n\nOn one visit, the room we were given had a lovely view of a wall. I complained but the front desk said there was nothing they could do the hotel was full. I informed the front desk staff that my floor and room request was sent  2 months ago via email. I was told that I should not have emailed but should have called the front desk. Making it seem that it was my fault. Yes it was my mistake  thinking  the hotel would read an email sent by a repeat guest. My bad.\n\nI usually vote with my feet when things start to go south and would often suggested  to my wife that we stay somewhere else,  but she, like me , tended to overlook these slights and opt for the hotels location over satisfaction , so we continued to stay there.\n\nUntil our last visit that is, around October\/November2019. The issues I highlighted above remain: location of room barely meeting request, no one to help get bags out of car, a tired room (is it too hard to have outlets next to bed). And an indifferent staff. One thing I use to like was that  Crunch across the street  was included in the room rate. Now they charge a \u201c$25 resort fee\u201d.   \n\nWhat made us decide this place was done\u2026was during our last stay we were checking out,  I gave my key to have the valet to get the car. He stated it would be about a half hour which was normal and expected. So we went to the caf\u00e9\/ bar to order coffee and a quick breakfast.\n\nIt was early Sunday morning so not busy or crowded. We sat for a while and  someone finally waited on us and we ordered.  We sat for a longer while\u2026. No coffee yet\u2026she came back without coffee but asked for our food order\u2026so I ordered some eggs\u2026.waited\u2026no coffee\u2026waited\u2026no coffee or food. You know what did come, yup, our car.\n\nThe valet got our car faster than they could get our coffee!!!!\n\nWe just left since our car was there . I went to the front desk to get my key,related  what just happened. The manager, I assume, said what happened shouldn\u2019t have. Yeah, no kidding. We left and drove a block or two for breakfast  at Veselka.\n\nThey poured our coffee as we sat down, amazing!!!\n\nSo we won\u2019t be staying  at the Standard next week.\n\n I\u2019ve made reservations at another hotel nearby, The Bowery- I wish I did this for prior visits, but inertia is hard to overcome sometimes. This hotel  emailed me within and 1\/2 hour of my reservation being made asking when we would get there and answered a question I asked in the reservation. \n\nMy daughter will graduate in May, but we will still have the pleasure of visiting her and the east village area for a few more years to come.\n\nIf next week works out we I\u2019ll book a couple of rooms in May for 3 days in May for the graduation.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

This hotel is really close to the Tenement Museum, which we highly recommend (you have to book tour tickets ahead of time), the Merchant's House Museum, the Metrograph movie theater and a ton of other East Village and Lower East Side sites and restaurants like Veselka, Frank's (Italian) and Yonah Schimmel Knish.

The front desk clerk gave me the wrong directions to the elevator. \n\nThe room itself was very small which is to be expected for a hotel room in NYC but the design was so poor it was baffling.  There was only one bedside table on one side of the bed that is about 6\" x 6\" barely large enough to hold a kindle and some reading glasses.  The tiny bedside table did not have a reading light, nor were there sconces or any other sort of light in the bedroom other than a harsh fluorescent light coming from the headboard that shined onto the ceiling.  The lamp on the desk did not work and did not even have a switch that I could locate.  The power outlet near the bed did not work.  There was not closet, only a small wardrobe with 4 hangers that were difficult to access and impossible to hang a full length coat in.  The shower door did not close when the bath mat was set out on the floor so when you opened the door, the mat just crumpled up against the toilet.  Such poor design all around I cannot even cover it all. \n\nThe coffee the next morning came within ten minutes but a small pot was $16, without gratuity.  \n\nI would rather stay at a Marriott or similar where I know they will have a reading lamp and a shower that I can get in and out of with a bath mat intact on the floor. \nExtreme disappointment.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The location is perfect for visiting NY as many restaurants and shopping are within walking distance. The room (1109) was wonderful as it had two queen beds,  a 360-degree view of the city, a beautiful bathroom with a soaking tub and a shower.  The room was very quiet, not even sound from the street below could be heard easily. We had plenty of space for our clothes in the closet and a minibar with all sorts of creative treats for late-night snacking.   We were visiting NYU and the University is a short walk from the hotel, which made the hotel feel like a home away from home.  We had two beautiful breakfasts and a festive cocktail hour at the Cafe.  The wait staff and bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and wine.  The food was delicious, we had Mexican omelet and french toast, with a cappuccino and matcha latte and everything, was over the top delicious.  Every member of the hotel staff was extremely friendly, helpful and efficient.  We were helped with speedy room service for a late-night dinner, an exceptional front door staff that flagged us cabs to see broadway shows or head to meet friends.  The front desk staff printed our tickets for us and they were waiting when we came off the elevator.  Upon check-in, the front desk staff also helped us to upgrade our room because they felt it would be a better space for us as we prepared for our visit to NYU.   Everything was done with care and each guest was treated as if they were extra special.  A BIG THANK YOU to Adrienne at the front desk who spent extra time talking with our son about HER experiences at NYU,   All around our visit to NY was enhanced by our choice to stay at the STANDARD and we will be back again and again.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The design of the hotel is gorgeous (tip: the staircase to the sub lobby restrooms is very 'instagrammable'), the food & beverage outlets are superb, and the staff is always around to greet you with a smile. \nMy room itself (a corner king, maybe?) was beautifully configured. Yes, a tad small, compared to the suites at an all-inclusive resort in Cancun (THIS IS NY PEOPLE, we don't have space!) but like I said, smart and cozy design. \nHousekeeping was fantastic. Quick and friendly!\nI must say my stay was absolutely made thanks to the front office team. Someone caught wind that it was my birthday, and without requesting a thing I was upgraded and given a lovely birthday amenity. Sometimes, it's just that little extra touch that really makes a hotel home. A very special shoutout to David Burgos, the overnight manager.

The hotel charges USD600 per night, which I consider fairly expensive, therefore raising expectations. The first impression was good, hotel looks nice, new and with an obvious effort to look modern. I went to the room and my first disappointment, a very small room and also very small storage space. The closet was not so small, but half of it was used with a minibar. During the night, I had to plug out the minibar due to the excessive noise it was making. I was also bothered by the number of things they offer you to buy, in an obvious upsell strategy, being one of them the robe. For that piece, a note in the bathroom tells you that if they find the robe missing, it means that you have decided to purchase it, and you will be charged something around $100. The interesting part is that the cleaning service disappeared with the robe on my second night and I had to discuss with the reception about that, since I did not want to be overly charged for a standard hotel robe. I also sent a few packages to the hotel and it took a while for the hotel staff to find them and deliver properly. The Wi-Fi is extremely slow, but you can easily upgrade paying extra $20. I was trying to download something and the estimated time in the hotel was 3 hours. In a public Wi-Fi I manage in 5 minutes. One night I went to the bar for a drink. The attendant did not have a clue about what they have in the bar and prices. Also, the music was so loud that I have decided to finish my drink in my room. Last, when returning for the last night, my key was not working. Talking to the reception, they made a mistake and finish my stay one day earlier. It took me some time to convince them that they made a mistake and therefore they should not charge any extra to my bill. The hotel looks nice, they make an effort to look modern, but the service is very poor and their effort to upsell is annoying. I still prefer old style hotels with good service.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

No coffee machines, no minimal amenities.\n\nThere is hardly any recognition for people who come back multiple times, other than a card from Maggie, the 'experience' manager. You still get the same matchbox room.\n\nThe building has not been very well kept. It shows in the rooms. My bathroom window would not close, resulting in a lot of noise. The A\/C unit sounded like a jackhammer, every few minutes. Corner are broken a frayed. There is only so much paint one can apply to hide the defect.\n\nThe biggest issue every time I stayed, and this time was no different, was the lack of elevators. One is permanently broken. One used for service, and one is supposed to serve guests over 21 floors, but is also used all the time, unapologetically, by service people. As a result, I waited every day, several times, up to 20 minutes to get up or down. Unacceptable at a $500 a night hotel providing so little for the money..\n\nThe only thing going for this property was the location, but I see there are now other hotels and some nice AirBNB locations.

This has been by far one of my favorite experiences. In all honesty the quality of the staff alone is very similar to my experiences at the St. Regis and in some regards even better. They make you feel at home and pampered at the same time. Before we even arrived I had received emails letting me know they would make sure my baby had a crib and was taken care of without me even asking. They promptly return emails and answer any questions you might have which in my experience is not always the case with modern hotels.\nUpon arrival we were exhausted and disheveled and they quickly put us in a room to rest well before our check in time. The room was spotless (that never happens anymore) and perfectly cool after coming in from the summer heat.\nThe beds are super comfortable and I found the size of the room to be perfect even with a toddler pouncing around. \nWhen they delivered the crib I was amazed to receive a pretty nice one. Usually you just get a sad pack n play but this was well thought out and very cozy for our little one.\nOne of the things that made us really love this hotel is that no one ever said no when we asked for something. Every person took a moment to see if they could find a solution for our needs and every time they did. We are so impressed and equally thankful. \nThe hotel itself is very well appointed. It\u2019s beautiful and clean. It\u2019s in a perfect location for everything you could need or want. Close to the subway and close to some of the best cultural \u201cmust see and do\u201d of nyc. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t have a chance to eat dinner there but breakfast was delicious! Room service is exactly what you need. It has a handful of very enticing items and a great wine list that\u2019s also well priced for a hotel. Not like most hotels that have a sad pizza for $20 and like two mediocre wine options.\nAt night it seemed to get very busy and lively and although it was pretty loud once we got into our room we couldn\u2019t hear any of it. It was absolutely perfect.\nI had previously lived in nyc for a long time so I know a lot of the hotels there. I can say without a doubt I will never stay anywhere else when visiting. Don\u2019t waste your time looking at other hotels. You get what you pay for and here you get a little bit more.\nThank you Standard east village for making my trip wonderful and for taking such great care when it came to my baby.

Lot's of local vibes and eateries around. Fairly easy to get up or downtown on the subway. The 'R' line is great. Don't forget just how big Manhattan is. Uber's are actually super expensive and take forever. Walking or subway is preferable.\n\nThe room at the hotel was nice, clean, modern, small. The bed was super comfortable. The best thing about it was definitely the view uptown - what more can you ask for when staying in NY other than a rocking view.\n\nPlace would be well served by things such as a 24\/7 snack bar and a more chilled vibe downstairs at reception area.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

We are in our late 50s, visiting our son who lives in the East Village. This hotel was perfect in every way.  We enjoyed every bar and restaurant at the hotel and entertained his friends (in their 20s) there and they loved it.  The bars\/restaurants at the hotel were so great that it made it hard to leave to go elsewhere for food\/drinks. The service was outstanding in every way.  Our room was delightful, with an incredible view of the city.  The food was great and our son and his friends loved the cocktails. So glad we stayed here; we'll stay in The Standard again (in other locations, too).  My husband is very picky and he loved The Standard. We both loved everything about it, and, again, our son and his friends loved it, too.  I'm sure they'll return for meals and drinks. Everyone who worked at The Standard was lovely - they seemed to enjoy working there and they provided outstanding customer care.  The decor was fabulous.  The hotel even has a room (\"The Perch\") for visitors to use when they need to get some work done; it was really nice. We hated to leave....!","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

They also thought it was an excellent  and cool hotel.The staff is warm, friendly and very professional. They care about their guests' hotel experiences. The front desk staff, the doormen and valet, the servers in Narcissa, and the more casual bar restaurant, all knock themselves out for their guests. The lobby and restaurants are in an old NYC building, and both the staff and the small size of the older building, provide the sense of being in a five star boutique hotel. In fact the lovely older building is conjoined with a beautiful modern glass skyscraper, and yet one always has this sense of a large ratio of staff per guest. The decor of the hotel is cool. The rooms are always clean and look brand new. The linens are so fine. Room service is fast. We enjoyed all of the meals there. The service is very attentive. The rooms are quiet.

We were asked to confirm we had laundry done (which we never did). We told them no (since we were there for 1.5 days) and they said nothing would be charged to my card and they'd email a folio. I find out 2 weeks later they charged me $72 and didn't send me a folio as promised. I called the front desk and was initially met with resistance about removing the charge. Then, I waited for the folio I never got with the worker on the phone since I wanted proof of them actually refunding me this time. It took ~9 minutes to arrive.

I was booked at another hotel. Around 1:00 am the fire alarm goes off. I open my door and smell the smoke, run down 9 flights of stairs filled with smoke. We are outside with fire engines, the hotel evacuates. we are all shaken up.  I ask that they put me at another of their properties.  I arrive at Standard East Village at 1:44 am, at the desk Kevin, aware of the situation, had prepared a room \"I'm going to spoil you and make sure you can sleep well\" he had gone the extra mile of having grooming supplies ready for me.  I only had my coat nightgown and wallet.  The next morning Franck, also aware of the situation (clearly the communication is efficient in this hotel)  helps me find a room at the SEV for the rest of my NYC stay.  \"we're booked, but we are going to push through and make it happen\"  He found me the perfect room for the rest of my business trip. Paige the head of guest services arrives and hands me her card \"please let me know if there is anything you need, we are here to take care of you.\"  I was able to move to the new room ASAP.  then left for my meetings. Coming back from my work Martin, welcomed me back.  He had noticed that I was French and so engaged in my native tongue. It was nice after a long day to be welcomed back with so much warmth.  I got to the room and Paige and Franck had left a kind note and welcome gift for me to relax.  Throughout the stay whether it was Ana the manager of the cafe, Alex who makes amazing coffee, Eleonora who explained their bread program, and Ivan who serves at the cafe.  the entire staff is deeply welcoming.  the consistent message is you are safe, you belong, we are here. every single person had the same message of warmth, kindness, support, resourcefulness.  this is exemplary behavior in hospitality.They regularly checked in to make sure that all was going well.  I cannot thank them enough.  After a night of fright at the start of a massive work week, the way this team made sure all my needs were met allowed me to focus on my work.   I stayed in 2 different rooms, they were both incredibly clean, aesthetically pleasing, the linens were lush, the bathtub fantastic etc... The place is quiet so you sleep very well. Please also check out their restaurant Narcissa they had a blue crab salad and smoked japanese eggplant that were pure heaven.

Naughty confession...","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-02-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This was our second stay at one of The Standard hotels in New York.  We had stayed earlier at The Standard, Highline, and wanted to try the other side of lower Manhattan for a change.  We could not have been happier.  The Standard, East Village, is smaller, more intimate, and yet offers features that make it stand apart from any other hotel we've been at in New York.  \nWe booked a Downtown Suite, Room 2008, and were blown away by the views of the World Trade Center looking south, and the Empire State Building looking north.  The huge windows made the room feel bright and inviting, even on an overcast winter day.  While there are items mentioned in other reviews, such as the missing coffee machine, we found it best to use the staff's more than welcoming advice to move around and explore the area, as well as the hotel.  It started with great communication ahead of our visit.  Special thanks to Will for picking the perfect room for us.  We checked in at different times and Will had taken care of everything, including a nice welcome tray with snacks.  \nFor dinner, we went to the Narcissa, had excellent red snapper and shared a fluffy delicious mille feuille.  Combined with a bottle of wine and coffee, the price was very reasonable for an up-scale restaurant.  Evening drinks in the Cafe Standard were creative and delicious.  We had several cocktails and none of them disappointed. We returned for Breakfast and sat outside in the heated patio area.  French toast as well as the White Egg were fabulous.\nWe do have to make a confession. Being on the 20th floor, we knew that we were just one level below the Penthouse level, where frequently parties were hosted.  Our room was completely quiet, no street noise, no noise from above.  Out of curiosity, we took the elevator to the 21st floor and were stunned to find a complete range of designer clothes displayed as part of New York Fasion Week.  Professional lighting was installed and being avid photographers ourselves, we couldn't help but sneak up again and take pictures, many of them not appropriate to be shown as part of a Tripadvisor review.  We had our own little Fashio Week.  Thanks!, and hope it won't be held against us.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is nicely positioned between midtown and downtown, allowing easy access to both midtown on the east side and a lively after work scene, being south by Soho and East Village. With my office being on 3rd in midtown, it was a quick ride up in the morning, without having to deal with the stresses of crosstown traffic. And the hotel itself was great. Service, from the time you walked in to the time you walked out, was perfect. Always there for you and a much more boutique approach to customer service. I was most impressed by that, as the High Line is much larger and so you do not get the boutique feel. Also, the food options were top notch. You have got to try Narcissa, their in-house restaurant, if you are there. But make a reservation because it is a hot spot.

Service was adequate, atmosphere no better than that of an upscale airport diner, seats that were closer to the ground than the table. There were three of us. Wine was vintage 2016 and 2017. Every entree was terrible.. My short rib steak had no meat on it AT ALL. Total fat and gristle. Seriously, NO MEAT. And this was after I had asked if it was similar to short ribs. Inedible. I sent it back for chicken which was okay but you don\u2019t have to be Einstein to make chicken, although I asked for the sauces on the side which was a good idea because they were totally inappropriate. My wife ordered Branzino which was hidden underneath some indescribable sweet sauce that killed the the taste of the fish. My daughter had red snapper which was drenched in a bath of curry and tasted like... well...curry. Price with tip \u2014$280. Narcissa is an example of what happens when a chef tries to outdo other trendy chefs and does not care if his \u201ccreations\u201d were meant to be eaten.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was night so didn\u2019t get the full effect of my corner room on the 9th floor but my first thought was oh this (standard) room is really small and lucky I am staying here on my own. Also mini bar takes up half the wardrobe so really depends then on priorities. Would definitely book a larger room next time if required.  Black out curtains tick and very quiet apart from a touch too loud air con which I needed help with (after a long flight) to turn off.\nAlso still haven\u2019t worked out how to turn on my desk lamp.\nFantastically comfortable bed with those feather mattress topper things. Bliss.  \nGood, spacious shower and lovely products although I have given up on the black soap.  Am wondering if I can be seen at night from street level with the light on.  Can I??\nHere for 8 days and now it is day 6 on Saturday morning.  Light streaming in and fully bonded with my room. Haven\u2019t fallen out with anyone either.  It would be difficult as the staff are so naturally friendly, except in the the cafe where I had breakfast on my first morning (can be daunting for some people) and the staff on that particular morning were a little cool for my liking.  However, I have been back since and met with other staff and that was a one-off.\nThe chai latte was disappointing too.  Truly the only tiny negative experiences!\nA highlight?  The chicken poppers in the bar with a perfectly chilled glass of Mo\u00ebt. \nThere is a huge gym just across the street which I understand guests can use (don\u2019t know about fees etc...)\nThe design is functional\/retro with some interesting artwork in the lobby and a garden and outdoor seating for people watching. Then there is the cafe and a top notch restaurant using produce from their own kitchen garden.\nThe hotel is perfectly located within walking distance of  everything in the East Village\/Soho and Greenwich Village and the area feels perfectly safe to walk around alone day or night.\nVery happy and would highly recommend.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"NONE"}

They are not world (or even domestic) travelers by any stretch of the imagination. So a week in New York is a very big deal. Just like you, I used the reviews to decide where to stay. The Standard East Village was an easy pick but that is just the beginning of the story. I called ahead and asked for the concierge desk to let them know that some travel newbies were on their way and to please help them whenever they could. Luckily for me, I got connected with Paige, the Guest Experience Manager. She was so gracious, kind and understanding - there is just not enough space to describe it on this review. She took their names, what the like to eat, where they were going and so on and so on. She welcomed them to the hotel, introduced them to the staff and really put them from a nervous state to totally at ease. All throughout the trip, she checked in with them (and me) to make sure all was well. They went to see the Statue of Liberty, Top of the Rocks, The Empire State Building etc... After seeing all of those world renowned attractions - the real star of the show was Paige. When they returned Paige was as much a part of the story of the trip than anything else. This was truly the best customer service experience, including all - not just travel or hotels - that I have experienced and I was not even there with them. If you like to be at the best place when you travel, then The Standard East Village is your place. \n\nThere was one more thing... while the group was leaving, the youngest member left her wallet and iPhone in an uber. Out of 80,000 uber drivers in NYC - Paige managed to track it down and get it for us. She is the real deal. ","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

One of the reasons we chose The Standard, East Village, was because it was within walking distance of our friends' apartment, but to our delight, it was also within walking distance of so many interesting shops and restaurants!  Originally from NYC, I was able to easily \"walk down memory lane\" and visit some old haunts.  It's close enough to a few subways, too, but you can also catch a cab right out front because it's on a main avenue.\n\nBut speaking of restaurants, we have to give a shout out to the Standard Cafe, a must-stop on most days for their cappuccino.  The bartenders double as baristas, and they do it right.  And definitely try the cafe's Flatbread, a nice ~10\" square covered in arugula pesto and a salad of arugula, thinly sliced zucchini and squash, dressed in a bright citrus vinaigrette.\n\nOn our first day, we had arrived early and were prepared to store our luggage until our room was ready, but to our surprise, our room was ready AND upgraded.  It was on a higher floor with a great corner view.  The room was very clean and well appointed, although the carpets showed some wear and staining, but that's bound to happen with a lot of foot traffic.\n\nThe staff was always friendly and helpful -- actually reaching out to us with their contact info -- which will encourage us to stay at The Standard the next time we come back to NYC.  If you're looking for a hotel with a hip vibe, that's close enough to walk to most things in lower Manhattan, then look no further.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The queen and double rooms are tiny and not worth the money, so you must go with the King suites, which are much more expensive. Very comfortable beds and nice bathrooms. Great views from upper levels. Must get rooms from 12th. floor and up to avoid noise. There is no concierge or desk service to speak of. The place has lousy, half assed concierge service with practically no response to requests. The bar scene is lively and eclectic, with a good vibe, and the location is great. Expensive to valet your car. All and all, too expensive for the service and value. The tv didn\u2019t work in our room and the refrigerator was broken, but the room was clean.

Long waits for service at the front desk, but staff were generally chirpy and attentive.\n\nThe king room was tiny, and devoid of any character. Having just come from the funky Made Hotel in Koreatown, The Standard East Village felt like a Holiday Inn, without the character. No art, funky fixtures, tea\/coffee\/iron in room. The only addition was a cushion in the shape of a mouth. Bar fridge and heater\/air-conditioner were extremely noisy for a new building. At least the room had openable windows.\n\nBathroom was spacious and clean, but shower can't hold water and always flooded the bathroom. The soap provided was black in colour. I'm sure it was funky, but the drips stained the basin, and any white clothing that was splashed. Not very clever.\n\nLastly, The very comfortable bed had an additional mattress pad\/topper. This had a huge lump on one side when we checked in that my wife literally had to sleep around. It took two mentions to the front desk to have this rectified, and then house keeping removed the extra layer and didn't provide us with another.\n\nThis is not a whiny review; while there was certainly nothing terrible about The Standard, you can definitely do better for the money.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room decor is relaxing and modern, and designed to be functional for the small space. I requested a high floor, and the hotel staff was on top of it, giving me a room with a great view, above the street level noise. On the other hand, I requested an early check in after arriving on a red eye, and I wasn't able to get into a room until 2PM. Not a huge deal, but assuming standard checkout is at noon, it felt a bit odd that a room couldn't be ready earlier. Also worth noting, the hotel doesn't have a large lobby or lounge area that a guest could kill time in or relax in easily which was a bit problematic. There is an attached (hipster) restaurant, but not the kind of space to take out a laptop and sip a coffee for a few hours.\n\nThe room itself had a very comfortable bed and pillows and was relatively quiet - the corner windows made it feel much bigger than it was, and gave great light. A few complimentary fashion magazines made for nice reading and a nice treat for the plane ride home. The room's blackout curtains also helped at night to get a good night's sleep! The bathroom was large, with a full bathtub, but the toiletries were a bit subpar for a \"hip\" hotel (bottles attached to the wall, tiny hand soap that was dyed black making the sink look dirty whenever you used it, etc). And, the weirdest thing was - it was hard to figure out how to use the different light switches in the room - it took me two days to figure out how to properly turn the light on in the shower! I never figured out how to turn on the bathroom fan, if there was one. Also, oddly - the main room's window was open when I arrived, and it was so high out of reach that I had to call housekeeping \/ maintenance to close it - with a ladder... Odd.\n\nThe staff though, was always friendly - and as expected at a chic NYC hotel - hip and stylish. They were more than happy to help with bags, holding them before and after check in, as well as offering additional amenities and arranging for an extra bathrobe when asked.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in the city, but it could work on some of the finishing touches to help make it feel a bit more like home.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Stayed there for one night in January and, again, for two nights in late February.  Such a warm welcome which continued throughout both my visits.  Front desk staff was always ready to answer any questions and provide whatever service I needed.  Loved my rooms, the Standard King, for both visits.   Floor to ceiling windows provide great light and fabulous city views.  Had rooms both on the 12th and 18th floor.  I would suggest requesting a higher floor, such as I had, for the great views!  Beds are dreamy!   Toiletries are some of the best, if not the best, I have had at any hotel. Towels are generous in size and soft.  \n\nThe gym rat I am, I asked if the hotel had any discounts, etc.. with the Crunch gym across the street from the hotel.  They had complimentary passes!  So twice I was able to visit the well-equipped gym and burn off those extra calories one tends to consume in NY dining!  The complimentary gym passes is a big plus for me!  \n\nGreat location just a block or so from Astor Street subway station (the 6 line) and within walking distance to great restaurants on 2nd Ave and also on Bowery.  Easy walk to SOHO and NYU.  Speaking of restaurants, one must eat at The Mermaid Inn on 2nd street just a short 5 minute walk from The Standard.\n\nThe Standard has become my new \"go to\" hotel in NYC.   While I am a loyal rewards member for a major hotel chain (thus my previous hotel in mid-town), The Standard's service, location and quality of rooms and amenities will bring me back for future stays.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

I am chocked by the service from the hotel staff. I was excited about finally staying at the standard and I liked my room when I checked in. However, my room had a door into my neighbours room with absolutely no sound proof. So when he came home drunk at 1 am in the morning and talked on the phone it was like he was in my room and I could hear the entire conversation. \n\nThe first night I was so tired from travelling and I ended up going back to sleep. The second night I woke up again at the same time to the same guys conversation on the phone. After 15 min I decided to go down to reception. They told me I couldn't get another room and that they would send up security. I get back up to my room and he is still talking. The reception call ME and tells me the guard is on our floor but he can't hear anything. I couldn't believe it as it was SO loud outside my room and even worse inside the room. Reception ended up calling him. The guy lowered his voice but keep talking on the phone. The sound proof between the rooms are so bad that you can't event watch tv without hearing it. \n\nI got like 2 hours sleep that night because I was so upset and jetlagged. I go down to reception again and tell them if I can't get a new room I want to check out. So they tell me they can get me a new room and that they'll move my bags during the day. \n\nI get back at 7 pm and ask for my new room. The manger tells me THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED IT because they're at capacity and wonder who I spoke to. This is has been the worst stay ever and I am exhausted from not sleeping properly. I don't understand what I am paying for.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

She emailed me back right away with all the information I needed and was so helpful in choosing a bottle of champagne to surprise the birthday girl with. She offered to hand write a note and look out for a complimentary upgrade which we got!!! She also set out complimentary snacks in our room & checked in with me throughout our stay to make sure everything was good. Paige is amazing & did everything in her power and more to make it a perfect experience!!! When my Mom arrived the bell boys and the front desk greeted her and wished her a happy birthday and were so welcoming.

What a wonderful 3 nights and 4 days I had in this hotel - from the moment I walked into the front doors and was greeted by an enthusiastic front desk team, to the time I left the entire hotel experience was wonderful.  I have to admit I may be a bit overwhelmed simply because the panoramic very from my suite on the 20th floor (room 2008) was breathtaking.  However, NYC has many hotels with \"views\", but what made this hotel wonderful is the substance behind the scenes and atmosphere.  The hotel is located in the \"East Village\" - a quirky, hip neighborhood that has transitioned over the years into a mixture of wonderful residential streets mixed in with all kinds of businesses and even some new corporate entities like IBM making a splash down the street with the new innovative marketing operations related to \"Watson\" - attracting an intelligence quotient supported by NYC that makes this neighborhood very special indeed.  Back to the hotel - the room (bed!) was extremely comfortable - and I will never take another shower again without feeling neglected - the bathroom floor is heated and the in-shower steam system makes the shower over the top - while any exhibitionist will be in heaven because the shower and bath itself is surrounded in glass - so you shower literally overlooking the city.  I was afraid to ask (and didn't) - and only assumed the windowed are tinted or positioned from the outside such that I was no \"mooning\" anyone during my stay!  LOL.  Seriously, the room is great, bed extremely comfortable and extremely quiet (someone told me the windows are sound proofed - not sure if that is accurate but it was an extremely quiet room).  I ordered room service and had breakfast\/lunch in the restaurant, and the food is also delicious, along with excellent service.  So, stay here without hesitation.  Bear in mind this is not the Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula, or Four Seasons type luxury, but for those who want a more casual and trendy experience, combined with many of the nice aspects of 5-star properties, The Standard East Village is the perfect solution.  I can't wait to come back again.  Thanks to the staff and everyone for making my stay so special.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Overall, it was very disappointing.   I'll start with the positives first .. of which there were a few ...\n* Location is great -- not many hotels service East Village, and the Standard is within walking distance of Astor Place, and only a 15 minute walk from Greenwich Village\n* Front desk and housekeeping staff were very nice and friendly.\n* The rooms do have floor-to-ceiling windows, which are pretty cool.  \nUnfortunately, these good factors do not make up for ...\n* The guest rooms have an overwhelming cheap deodorizer smell - by design!.  It smells like what they use in rental cars when trying to remove cigarette smoke odors.  When I mentioned it to the front desk at checkout, they told me that this \"scent\" is intentionally pumped into each room.  Unbelievable -- it really is an unpleasant smell.\n* The smoking area is literally right outside the main front doors ... so it is impossible to enter the hotel without walking through a cloud of smoke.\n* Despite the amazing floor-to-ceiling windows, the desk in my room was tucked in a small dark alcove next to the door -- virtually the only place in the room where it is impossible to see any windows!\n* When I tried to call the front desk to ask about getting an iron\/ironing board.  I couldn't find anything in the room which listed the front desk number.  There's literally no way to contact the front desk from your room.\n* Restaurant is way over prices -- more than $20 for a continental breakfast.  Better to walk up the block to Ray's pizza for fresh NY bagels.\n* The real kicker came when I saw my credit card bill.  After checkout, they charged me an extra $40.  When I called to inquire, I was referred to \"accounting\" where it literally took 6 calls to get someone on the line.  She told me that I was charged for a bottle of Smirnoff Vodka -- which was completely ridiculous.  When I told her that I didn't purchase any vodka, she was surprised and told me that she had to check with the front office and that I should call back in a few hours to see if they were willing to reverse the charges.  I asked her to call me instead, and of course, she never did.  \nI can see from the reviews that some people love this place.  I won't be going back.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My stay last week reminded me why I am always on the verge of leaving a review. My primary reason for staying at this hotel is the location, next to NYU.

If I remember correctly, one of the front desk managers said there are a total of 5 downtown studios in this hotel. The other 3 are located on floors 19 and above.\n\nAlthough we emailed a request for a high floor the morning of arrival (and notified them that we were checking in at 9pm), we were placed in room 408. Requested a high floor, again, and moved the second night of our stay. For the money you might pay for this category of room...i'd rethink the decision if you cannot be guaranteed a high floor. It made a HUGE difference. I was disappointed in check in, but they did take the opportunity to grant a request to a higher floor the next day. If you end up on the lower floor it is NOT worth the higher price. I'd consider a corner king as I believe there's a better chance you could get a higher floor, plus you'd pay a substantially lower price.\n\nWe ended up in room 1908 facing downtown and the west village. Beautiful views. Spacious room and nice set up. Complimentary wifi which worked well. Feather bed and comfortable sheets. Appreciated the full size bath gel\/shampoo\/conditioner combo as well as the heated bathroom floor.\n\nNote: You must request an iron and ironing board as there was not one in the room.\n\nBar: After checking in, we had a few cocktails at the Cafe Standard next to the lobby. It was definitely busy and high energy. Had two appetizers and then called it a night. \n\nThe Garden: Outdoor space on the side of the hotel that's simply beautiful in the Spring. Lots of flowers and decor made the space feel like it was not in the city. We enjoyed the spicy margaritas topped with red wine before going out to dinner one evening. Cocktails run: $14 ea\n\nGym: Daily passes are available at the front desk to access Crunch gym across the street. \n\nLocation: Really enjoyed the location of the hotel. There's a CVS\/Duane Reade a short 5 min walk from the hotel. Starbucks is 3 short blocks away, however, you MUST try the Coffee Project NY which is around the corner from the hotel.\n\nUber\/Lyft from LaGuardia: As of April 4, 2017, if you need to catch an Uber from LaGuardia you must first ride the bus to a remote lot where the city has funneled all the Lyft\/Uber cars to pick up guests. This temporary act was designed to decrease congestion at the airport. However, when heading back to LaGuardia for your departing flight, Uber\/Lyft drivers can drop you off directly at the gate. Expect an additional 20-30 minutes on travel time.\n\nEnjoy!","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"NONE"}

We had booked a corner King room via the travel agent in Sydney but on arrival they put us in a low room on the sixth floor 604 facing east which had an ordinary view back to the river. No, we couldn\u2019t see the ACTUAL river. \n\nBut it was better than staring onto a brick wall which is what they first put us into the last time we stayed here in 2012. Really!\n\nAfter I complained, they moved us the next day to the 12th floor to Rm 1204. Same river aspect but it was better as we were higher up with more of a panorama. Still hardly a good start. \n\nThe room was tiny taken up with the bed. Plus it had windows on two sides. At night one drew the sheer plus blackout curtain which ran on a track around the room to give you a blackout effect. \n\nThere was the usual TV, safe in the wardrobe, mini-bar, desk with light (which I could never figure out where the switch was to turn this on), a stand for one suitcase, hooks to hang up your coats in winter. \n\nThe bathroom was small but ok. It had weird thick silver curtains around the bath to prevent water splashing over the whole room during a shower. \n\nWhat really got us was the change to the exterior in the five years since we\u2019d last stayed. In 2012, one entered the hotel underneath a long glass overhead entry roof and into a minimalist foyer with a reception desk. To one side, was a quiet refreshment room that opened onto a relaxing internal courtyard garden where one could eat breakfast in summer. \n\nAll that is now gone. There is a restaurant Narcissa in its place and one enters the Standard from an old traditional door with metal panelling and stained-glass windows. Yes it\u2019s comfy but totally unrelated to the sparse look on the outside and the minimalist rooms. Sigh. The Standard was a cool funky place to stay in the old days. Now it was the same as any other hotel in NY. Last time for me.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

This was solved when the very friendly service person opened the top window to let out the moisture. I believe it was caused by the washroom. Once this was fixed, the stay was very pleasant.\n\nMy only concern was the first person i had at front desk was condescending and lied to my face about room availability when I asked for an upgrade. I find it disappointing to have to lie about availability when I'm clearly able to see space online or when i call reservations. Once caught in the lie, she was forced to honor the request.

The best thing about the Standard was the staff; checked in by wonderfully efficient manager on duty. Had dinner at their restaurant (reviewed separately) and again, our server was very sweet and attentive - really charming. Ordered room service breakfast and the gentleman who delivered it was magnificent - steamed the milk for our coffee, brought up our drinks before our actual breakfast because he was afraid it was taking too long ( it wasn't), and then brought a second round of drinks with our food. The most gentle and caring man - he gets 6 stars! I did not catch his name, but he is tall with amazing dreadlocks and stunning leather jewelry. He not only deserves a promotion, but he should be training staff in superior customer service - seriously!\n\nHere's what kept this from being a 5 star experience: no coffee or tea maker in the room, silver shower curtain a bit tacky but mostly just not functional, sheets were not tucked into the bed, and bed frame that caught my shins more than once.\n\nThe huge Windows and lovely soft but heavy curtains were great!

It's part of my \"thing\". So when I needed a quick stay in NYC, The Standard LES was suggested to me by a girlfriend who works at the DTLA location. I only stayed 1 night, but in that 1 night stay I was not only room upgraded by a very helpful front desk girl (Colleen, if I remember correctly), and received lightning fast room service by a bellhop named Aidan. Aidan even pointed out buildings' names from my breath taking view of the city so I could describe my room to my friends. \nI'd really like to point out that the friendly staff of The Standard LES never failed at any point of my stay to make me feel like family and part of the party; and the \"1 night stand\" app The Standard offers saved me a ton of money!! I didn't know it even existed until Paige, yet another helpful woman at The Standard, gave me the tip. I booked a room for the night all from my phone and ended up being upgraded mere moments after I checked in. \nThen there's the room. It had just snowed all night\/day and so the view was flawless and shining like diamonds! As Aidan pointed out to me, I had almost every iconic building\/bridge right in front of me. Spacious seating area with giant windows and completely functional windows and central air. I'm huge on spacious bathrooms as well and when I saw the bathroom I was just floored!! Again, giant windows and a large spa-like bathtub and shower with designer soaps. Also, the bed-- designed by the devil himself so you never want to leave the room ever again-- the softest most luxurious bed on the planet!!  You could order some wine and food service and camp out in there all night if you wanted to! (guess what I did). \nSpeaking of food service, I ordered the \"Andy Warhol\" which is a deliciously grilled cheddar cheese with a side of tomato soup that is still making me drool.

Great atmosphere in the bar, friendly service and a great experience. \n\nThis trip was completely opposite. The Corner King suggests a more comfortable space but its design is cramped & lacking. Two suitcases for travelling means there's almost no space, even before shopping. The alcove desk is impractical and only served as a space for bags with a half sized wardrobe to hang only a few items. \n\nThe bathroom was really poor. Metallic shower curtains hiding the tiles that needed to be re-grouted & bleached clean was shocking. Poor ventilation showed, with many areas covered in black mould which was pretty awful. Under the shower\/bath there were some missing grout and more evidence of discolouration. \n\nBuilding management need a far better level of service attention than housekeeping. The room 1902 should be shut & renovated. After two requests to upgrade a trio of sullen front of house staff first declined saying 'no'. It was only after emailing the office that I got a message from Bryan Devlin saying they could move me to room 308 at a $100 a night increased levy. The room was better & bigger, only to find the under floor heating in the bathroom was off which meant a night of freezing temperatures if you wanted to use it. The service team the next day said there's a fault and spent some time fixing it up. \n\nMaybe my expectations are too high having stayed in some impressive hotels, EV Standard was extremely unimpressive. \n\nEach room should be checked appropriately for customer stays, a better process to identify maintenance needs, checking bathroom products are actually full & full record of room renovation history. No follow-up from the Director suggests arrogance & a lack of authenticity to customer service. \n\nThe cafe\/bar was another odd experience, empty except for a few tables. I'm sure there's a scaled back team but I felt higher levels of service should be expected at The Standard. \n\nIt was an awkward\/ horrible hotel experience & the only person who saved the day was Michaela who was exceptionally helpful. Had she not been there on day three I would have checked out. \n\nMy advice would be check the room before  you sign-in & have a backup. When I think of other better hotels in NYC like Wythe & Nomad, I'd struggle ever to go back to Standard EV. ","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My phone showed that I was always connected to their server, but more often than not, I still did not have a functioning internet connection. Eventually I gave up and switched back to roaming and voila, things worked a treat.  \n\nI guess if you decide to stay here, aim for higher floors at the front of the hotel, not its back.

The customer service was amazing (we ended up being extremely high maintenance guests). Starting with my multiple phone calls in advance of our stay to work out if the room we had booked was large enough to fit a crib, eventually upgrading to a larger room and then requesting that another family member's room be directly next door so that our baby monitor would work for the babysitter. We arrived before check in on Friday and Shanna helped us to get into our room ASAP as our daughter needed to nap. Our daughter promptly threw up in the freshly cleaned room. I called the front desk, and they had housekeeping up to clean the room within minutes. The next morning, I asked to have our room made up sooner than later as we were out early and would need to come back for a midday nap. Bryan called one of the maids to come in early and had our room done before we even finished breakfast.  We lost at least 5 keys and Paige remade keys for us multiple times. On Saturday evening we left for dinner and realized we had forgotten to leave a key to our room with the babysitter, who was in the room next door with the baby monitor. I called the front desk to explain the situation, and they brought up a key to her within minutes. Everyone at the front desk and the bellmen were completely enchanted with our daughter and bent over backwards to help us; it was completely unexpected and so appreciated. The rooms are definitely small (as to be expected in NYC), however we will absolutely be staying at the Standard the next time we're in town, as the customer service can't be beat.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Second shout out to Monique for helping us out with some reservations around town, above and beyond and completely unexpected!\n\nRoom service, not an exhaustive selection but every meal we tried was on point. Prompt and hot, with excellent service from Dakota, thanks buddy! The Ribeye was to die for, along with the Fried Chicken! Standard hotel pricing.

I was originally going to give this 4 stars but then I remembered the beginning of the trip and changed my mind. \n\nWe were headed over to the East Village from Times Square (boyfriend suggested seeing what was showing at the TKTS booth but we bailed after deciding we didn't want to see a show). I called the Standard to see if they would let us check in early. They said it wouldn't be a problem, they even had a room ready (well it had been cleaned- just not inspected yet. Bonus points that the rooms have to pass inspection before they are assigned!)\n\nMy GPS was not aware that they closed down the main street and surrounding areas for a marathon and they wouldn't be open until 1:30. We called the Standard and Kelsey was quickly trying to find out the fastest way for us to get to the hotel and also suggest we park at the valet and walk over. I totally appreciate the fact that she went out of her way to get us sorted out.\n\nWe ended up grabbing lunch, we were getting frustrated and just needed to get some food (him) \/ libations (me) to calm down. By the time we were done with brunch the street was open and we were able to get to the hotel no problem. She even had our original room on the 16th floor still available!\n\nThe rest of our stay was wonderful and right on par with the Standard brand. We love the Standard in Miami and often grab a drink at the West Village location on the roof so we are familiar with what they are about. The service was wonderful, the location was wonderful and we had such a great time.\n\nNarcissa was excellent. Wonderful food selection and top notch service. They even remembered it was my birthday!\n\nMy only complaint is the Cafe in the morning. The food selection is good (as long as there is oatmeal I'm happy) but I'm one of those \"Diet Coke in the AM\" freaks that need their fix first thing.

Not that I think someone outside of this group would feel unwelcome but it certainly is not your business hotel of years past.\n\nSome of the extra amenities that I enjoyed included the extra large towels that must have been 4-5' long, large windows with great black-out curtains and the red button above the bed that turned the white light to red. I suppose this could have been a romantic touch but I would use it as a way to cut down on blue lights which we hear are harmful before sleeping these days.\n\nSome negatives included few power outlets (or most were askwardly located) and no USB outlets which I would expect from a modern hotel, especially since there was no alarm clock, there was a large scratch on our TV, the carpet had not seen a good deep clean in a very long time and there was bizarrely only one sheet on the bed which either served as a fitted sheet or a flat sheet - we weren't sure.\n\nDefinitely a great hotel on the boutique side which should be enjoyable and comfortable for most visitors.

The hotel is incredibly hipster, with fashionable young people walking in and out at all hours. I don't quite match that crowd, but I still felt welcome. My queen room was on a corner on an upper floor. The views were absolutely incredible. From one window, I could see the Empire State Building, Chrysler building, and other beautiful Manhattan buildings. From another, I had views across to Brooklyn, including the bridges. The bed was very comfortable, with a cozy duvet and a delightfully smooshy mattress topper. The location was convenient to several Subway lines and a wide variety of bars, restaurants, and sights in the area. The bathroom products were nice, and I particularly liked the ginger body wash.\n\nThe only reason I give this hotel four stars rather than five is some slightly odd design choices. Specifically, the shower had two half curtains running along it and a lip of only perhaps one inch to keep water from the rest of the bathroom. Given the shallow lip, it would have been easier to have a full shower curtain running the span of the shower. I was in constant worry of the position of the curtain overlap during my showers. The other odd design was the television, which was thrown in a corner in front of a window. You don't want to sacrifice the gorgeous views for a television, but I was tripping over it to get to my side of the bed, and it had significant glare from the large windows whenever I did turn it on. I don't have a solution for this. Perhaps the solution is televisions on demand? I was far more interested in the view than the tv, except for when major news was happening.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

After all, I'm an overweight middle-aged woman who was traveling to New York with friends and family to celebrate our 60th birthdays, and everyone knows how young and cool and hip the Standard brand is. But one of the other birthday girls on our trip had stayed there before and told us we'd love it. And she was right.\n\nSo let's start with the thing all Standard hotels are known for: the innovative and whimsical design touches. The East Village property is in a converted apartment building, with a small narrow lobby that seems bigger because it opens up to a garden patio on one side and the casual dining Cafe on the other - which not only has a lovely patio, but even the interior is designed to bring the outdoors in with a forest of plants hanging from the ceiling. The Cafe bar was hopping with beautiful people when we arrived, but we were made to feel welcome. The food and service were both great.\n\nThe rooms are small - the queen bed takes up most of it! But that bed is comfortable and the folks who put the room together did a good job of getting all the other expected amenities into it without forcing the guests to bump into stuff. The bathroom was a lot larger than one would expect and made good use of its space. Comfortable bed, excellent shower, well-stocked mini-bar. Pretty much everything you can ask for in a city hotel.\n\nOne of the other couples has a kid attending NYC, so the location was perfect for visiting her apartment (a good thing because our own college student daughter stayed with her friend there - we knew our room would be too small for her to stay with us).  It was a short walk to many of the attractions we wanted to visit on this trip - and no big deal to hail a cab or get on the subway for the ones that weren't as close by. \n\nFinally, some nice words for the staff - all of whom went out of their way to make us comfortable. We forgot to request a late check-out on our last day, which was an issue when our last bit of sightseeing went over. However, Paige at the front desk took care of us and arranged for the bell staff to remove and hold our bags for us so we could enjoy our last day in New York City.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

If that's you're cup of tea then you'll like this property. I normally avoid those hotels but this time I needed one within easy walking distance of NYU's Stern School, leaving me with few options. \n\nOverall I enjoyed my stay. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but reasonably fresh, tidy and quiet. In-room lighting is problematic, and some traditional amenities like clothes irons aren't provided. The bar is pretty good. However, the cost is very high for what you get, even by NYC standards - hence I award them only three stars.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My husband was a bit disappointed as he'd requested a certain type of room and they allocated the opposite to what he had asked for. The room itself was very nice, lovely views, comfy bed and a great bathroom. We found the staff not exactly rude but not really providing the friendly service you expect from a hotel of this standard. The location of the hotel is great, we loved exploring east village and found lots of great spots for breakfast and drinks in the evening. We took advantage of the free cycle hire one day and rode the bikes all the way over to Brooklyn. It was a great touch to have the bikes for hire and we'd recommend others to take advantage of it (though they only have limited bikes so you have to check them out early).

The room had great floor to ceiling views of the lower east side, the hotel restaurant and bar were delicious and the staff was extraordinary friendy and helpful. They even found me a replacement tie and tied it for me when I discovered I lost it. The bathroom was fantastic with the most dreamy tub in all of NYC. The only downside about this place is the Valet parking. Beware! My car was ticketed for being in the loading zone of the hotel as it was waiting on the valet parker, I was not made aware of the ticket until I checked out. Also the lot that the car was parked in, broke into my car. Apparently the loading zone is now a fire zone in nyc so all cars parked there will be ticketed. It took a few calls and a few weeks worth of due diligence, but the hotel eventually took care of the ticket, after it doubled of course. IF you are not driving (valet is 45 a day), then i totally recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The first room we were given was right in front of a noisy elevator and had an incredibly stained carpet, hairs in the bathroom, and a putrid sour smell like someone had puked in the room. We asked to be moved to another room and were told that the hotel was fully booked. We asked to be moved to the Standard on the west side and were told that it was also fully booked.\n\nLater, we were shown another room that was smaller and similarly dirty (hairs in the bathroom again and a very stained rug). At this point we just asked for our money back and said we would go to a different hotel. The manager was very rude, said that they have a strict cancellation policy and was generally very unaccommodating. The Standard's cancellation policy was totally irrelevant at this point: we had checked in, we were delivered incredibly substandard rooms and we were asking to walk away from the situation. \n\nIf this story had ended there, it would be bad enough. However, we moved to the second room only to discover that the heat was not working. It was literally one of the coldest days in the history of NYC and the room was frigid. It took multiple calls to the front desk to get someone to come take a look at our heat. When it became clear that our heat could not be fixed we were offered a space heater. We said that the space heater was unacceptable, and we were eventually moved to a new room (that somehow magically appeared, despite earlier assertions that the hotel was fully booked...). \n\nThe next morning, we went to have breakfast at the Caf\u00e9. The heat was apparently out in the Caf\u00e9 as well because it was incredibly cold and the servers were wearing blankets and handing out blankets to the customers. \n\nI've saved the best part for last, though. We were told that we would be contacted by one of the more senior managers on the Monday after our stay to discuss what happened. It's now Wednesday and we have yet to be contacted by anyone from the Standard. They clearly couldn't care less about their customers. \n\nThe quality of the rooms, service and amenities is absolutely abysmal. It would be fine if this hotel were a Best Western, but for the same price (or less) of the Standard East Village one could stay at the Ritz down town (if that's your thing) or the Ace (if that's your thing) or myriad other quality hotels in the city. The front desk workers and the managers are cold, unaccommodating and generally incompetent.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}
