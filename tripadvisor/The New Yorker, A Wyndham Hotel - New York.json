First impressions were excellent, a wonderful location and a really impressive reception\/lobby area.\n\nUnfortunately that is where the money seems to have stopped. We had a room on the 20th Floor (2042) and when the lift doors opened you could sense a change in quality, carpet was looking tired, along with the doors, walls and paint work.\n\nOur room was really small, despite it being for my 30th birthday there wasn't any \"wiggle room\" in making the stay memorable.\n\nThe room is dated and dusty. Unfortunately the only interactions we had with reception feel on deaf years. The safe to our room wasn't working (needed a new battery, nothing exciting), we called reception and were told that the maintenance man was with someone else but would then come over, as we had just arrived and in a bid to fight off the jet lag we told reception we were going out, they asked was it okay for him to enter the room and fix it when we weren't there to which we agreed. Came back 6 hours later and still not fixed. The money and passports remained in our locked case all weekend. We also called after we noticed a \"thumping\" noise from the ceiling, this didn't stop, bang, bang, bang, Reception didn't send anyone and this continued over the 3 nights we were there. This was really disheartening after walking over 35 miles in the city we were looking forward to a restful night. This brings me on to the another point... The windows! There is no sound proofing, we were 20 floors up and the beeping and sirens went on throughout the night.\n\nOverall a real tired hotel that I imagine was once really spectacular. Bathroom extractor didn't work, full of dust, faucet leaked when being used and run all down the back of the wall...\n\nWas also told upon checking that a \"hold\" would be placed on my card for $150, no problem. When I looked at my statement in the airport on the way home they had actually taken over \u00a3661 ($800) off of my card, not a hold an actual transaction. This was brought to their attention and a refund was issued and has now been credited to my account (after 4 days, which I am grateful for). But something for you to watch out for.\n\nUpon checkout there is also an additional fee of $5 per bag to keep in their luggage room. That was a shock to me also, I've never had to pay a hotel I've stayed at to keep my bag in their luggage room!\n\nOverall I wouldn't stay again, regardless of cost.","travelDate":"2024-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

What a place I chose to stay!!\n\nFirstly the train to Penn Station from Philadelphia is so so easy. One stop in Newark then onto NYC. I primarily chose the New Yorker because of it's location and that is clear when you get into Penn Station. The hotel is literally 5 or so mins from the station. I only had one cabin case and a backpack but for those with more bags this is definitely a factor. When you get upstairs on street level .. just wow. MSG right in front of you and you just have to take a moment to soak it all in. Once I did that onto the hotel!\n\nI noticed there were plenty of coffee shops, stores, souvenir shops etc close by which was ideal. Wasn't suprising but it was definitely good to have those options close by. The hotel is signed clearly from the outside. The interior is grand! nice lighting, chandelier. Nice lobby area with plenty of seating. I made my way to the check in desk and was greeted by a lovely gentleman. Really personable, asked me questions about my stay. Based on my answers he was quick to offer more information and useful tips which were greatly appreciated. I was attempting to check in early and was more than happy when a room was offered to me. (It is $25 to guarantee an early check in) but I wanted to shower and chill before attending an event that evening. Everything about my stay was detailed clearly and I made my way to the room. There are attendants stood by the elevators. You need to show your room key before using the elevator. A little touch I really like from a security point of view.\n\nThe elevators are easy to use. Certain lifts go to certain floor levels but these are illustrated well. I was up on the 26th floor. I was so excited getting to the room as the receptionist said it was a great view. The corridors look dated however this isn't a knock from me. I liked it. Gave that authentic feel. The directions to the room are good and clear. Again, really important as I have been in some hotels and it's like a maze!.\n\nGot to the room and wow! Firstly .. nice size room. Plenty of room for me as a solo traveller. Chair, desk, nice size TV, safe which was easy to set but the first thing that takes the eye is the view. I was in 2655 and wow. So cool! The shower worked great. I did have a nightmare trying to get the temperature right as there were a few taps lol but I didn't feel strongly enough about it to say to reception. It was just fine. What would have made the room super amazing for me would have been maybe a bottle of water or tea\/coffee. On the 2nd day I saw there was a Starbucks in the lobby area so I understand why you wouldn't find tea\/coffee facilities in the room.\n\nIt's New York. Everything is pretty easy to get to via the subway so location is just amazing. Really close to Times Square too which is where I spent a good bit of time. \n\nThere was a bit of a queue on check out. This was my own fault as I waited until 10.45am and there was a group leaving their bags before me but it moved along quickly and I was able to leave my bags for a bit before an evening flight and enjoy a bit more of the city. ($5 per bag if you wish to leave them for a bit which is more than reasonable to me).\n\nAll in all a really enjoyable stay! I will definitely consider staying here again when I'm in NYC again. Been twice now and just love it. My first time I stayed a bit further out of the city but this is a great place to stay. Despite it's location there was no disruption when it came to sleeping and everyone I spoke to was lovely. Thank you to everyone for making my stay a great one!","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

But I'd have to say that the front desk check in experience was where the New Yorker really stepped up and delivered.  \"Samira\" was simply wonderful. There are not enough words to express how much she made a difference in our stay, right from the start.  What a way to be welcomed back to NYC! Honestly, she was perhaps the most qualified, professional, courteous, amiable and helpful person I've ever encountered when visiting NYC. Samira went out of her way to make us feel welcome, offered helpful suggestions when asked, instinctively offered a late check out option, and really made the entire check in a fantastic and memorable experience.  Such a  beautiful and genuine person- she truly is a gem!  I will also say that the rest of the on site staff were all quite kind, and greeted us warmly as we came and went throughout our stay.  And I can't forget to mention 'Shine', who patiently guided me through the reservation process a few weeks back. Great sense of humor and very helpful!\n\nRooms:\nBoth rooms were on the 38th floor, with one overlooking 8th Street, and the other at the back of the building, with views of the river and countless skyscrapers.  Both came with a spacious balcony, which offered a breathtaking view of that famous NYC skyline, Madison Square Garden, The Empire State building and more.  The rooms were clean, well lit and with a perfect layout featuring two baths, a separate bedroom, dining table for 6, small fridge, open seating area, and a large patio.  \n\nParking\nWe used Spot Hero to book a parking spot right around the corner on 33rd.  (next to the Olivia).  This enabled us to get in and out of New York in record time, and probably saved a nice chunk of change in the process.  I'd highly recommend doing this whenever you're looking for a place to park in the city.  \n\nOther:\nIf you are staying in Mid-Town, it's going to be more expensive than elsewhere.  But despite the costs (and yes, those pesky 'resort fees' or whatever they're calling them do apply here), you will get your money's worth at the New Yorker.   The location can't be beat, and the Staff are just fantastic. \n\nDownside: Not much to complain about here.  I will say that their 'price match' process leaves much to be desired, and when trying to get some clarity from their  customer care person online, I felt like I was being given the run around.  Next time, I don't think I'll bother.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The room was a queen and made good use of every inch of space in the room.  it included bed, desk, night stands and a small but ample bathroom.

We walked to the queue for reception but we didn't have to wait long to wait as a very pleasant member of staff pulled us to the desk at the side and checked us in. We had room 2263 on 22nd floor. As we left check in we were accosted by time share staff who even when told we weren't interested kept insisting on you get  xyz for free if you come. Really who has travelled that far to go sit in a time share presentation!? \n\nEventually we got to the elevators and we were directed to the right hand side ones which serve floors 20 - 40. Once the doors opened on the 22nd floor we were quite shocked by the state of the corridors, clearly downstairs had been maintained but everywhere else not so much! We got to our room and we once again were shocked by the room, it was the smallest room we've ever had in New York with very little room for our luggage. I understand that the hotel is old and art deco but it really needs some tlc (the carpets look particularly scruffy) and the bathroom had mismatched tiles on the floor where some had previously been replaced and peeling\/chipped paint where the wall tiles had been painted over. The shower wasn't great but it did work, the taps were very stiff as they're pretty old and the actual shower head couldn't be moved. We did manage to get hot water but some days it took 15 minutes for it to come through. The bed was very comfortable and the housekeeping staff were always about cleaning. However, in saying that there was rubbish under the bench opposite the elevator the day we arrived and it stayed there for 2 days before it was cleaned and removed to the point I actually took a photo of it. \n\nAfter a week we had gotten used to the hotel and it had grown on us to a point we did say we would potentially return again next year. However, we have since changed our minds and I will explain why. We checked out on 27th February at 12 which we had no issues doing but upon trying to use the restroom one member of staff questioned if my husband was a guest so he explained and he spoke to someone else who gave my husband a card to access the restroom but when I went he questioned me and told me to go downstairs in the tick tock diner. It clearly states on the door into the diner that toilets are for paying diner customers only which I wasn't, I then noticed that he gave a pass to another lady who had also checked out to use the hotel restrooms so why wasn't I able to use them? My husband went and asked at guest relations and the lady there said I needed to get the pass off the man who had told me no so she then said to use the other restaurant's toilet which I reluctantly did. I'm sorry but this is ridiculous, I have paid to stay at the hotel and just wanted to use the restroom before leaving for the airport.\n\nThe location is excellent, lots of restaurants etc nearby and the subway is easily accessible.

I certainly won't return here until the Wyndham's lease of the hotel ends, which I heard is soon.\n\nFirstly, there is no coffee pot in the room and if you want one the hotel will charge you $25 a day for the coffee pot.  I suspect they took the coffee pots out of each hotel room as part of the agreement of Starbucks to rent space in the lobby. The Starbucks has very little to offer and I went across the street to the other Starbucks to get the Peppermint Mochas we wanted and they were indeed cheaper than $25. Looking at the website it now will cost you $50 a night to rent a coffee maker!!!!!!!!!!!! (and a one time $30 fee to rent a frig).\n\nNext problem is the upsell when you go to check in and it's before the 4pm check in time.  Clearly, they have many rooms available, and a good hotel will just check you in early, but to make even more money on top of the high prices they tell you your room type is not ready, but you can be upgrade for $40 more a night and get a room right away.  I listened to this same spiel be given to other checking in throughout our stay.\n\nWe said no thank you and went to check our bags. Bag check here costs $5 for each bag\/backpack.  They also charge a resort fee (over $30 a night) but the bag check is not included in the resort fee it is separate. They charge you another $5 a bag when you check out and need to stow bags until leaving.  \n\nWyndham has also set up two time share desks. One desk has employees hawking free this and that and then I'm sure they hit you with it's free if you listen to our 10 hour time share spiel, but I simply said no thank you when they tried to get our attention as we were going up to our room.\n\nThere is not much room to sit in the small lobby that must accommodate the 1,000 guests. Wyndam has a second desk and two chairs in the lobby for their time share nonsense.  When sitting in the lobby I saw an employee ask two guest to move from those two chairs because they were only for time share talks.  There wasn't even an employee sitting at that desk!  Those guests were then forced to stand in the lobby waiting for the rest of their party.\n\nWe did appreciate the security and housekeeping staff all were friendly and helpful.\n\nThe room was small but adequate.\nHowever, there was only the smallest of glass shelves above the very tiny sink in which you could place a toothbrush and toothpaste and not much else.\n\nI would recommend not staying at the Wyndham.  So disappointed in all the fess the Wyndham is charging here it has really turned me off the hotel brand entirely!!!","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

For a suite the shower room was tiny, but let's face it - you don't go to NYC to sit in the hotel room. The housekeeping staff were lovely, the room was very clean, you do get asked to show your room key every time you enter the lift area, but I quite like that security measure, the onsite Starbucks was great, the Italian restaurant has a nice bar.

Overall, it was just okay, but definitely had some bumps along the way.\n\nLet's start with check-in. The reception vibe? It felt like they were just going through the motions, no real warmth or info about the place. The elevator situation was an experience. Every time we got in, it was like we were being grilled by the lobby staff - with comments such as \"We only need to see one room card...\" and \"the odd nod\" Not exactly the friendliest bunch.\n\nBut it wasn't all bad news. Big shoutout to the housekeeping staff, they were super friendly and always welcoming for a chat. The rooms where immaculate and fitted with the Art Deco vibes, also loved our city view.\n\nThe gym wasn't in use, despite paying the full service tax every day...\nSo yeah, The New Yorker Wyndham has some good stuff going on, great value, but they've got a lot to learn about hospitality too.

Great location and easy access from the airport on the air train to Jamaica station then a train to Penn station which is opposite the hotel.

Shocking when you\u2019re a guest at the hotel. I witnessed someone tie theirs with an luggage elastic band and they got away with paying \u20ac5.

The room is small but we had a comfy bed and our shower was powerful and hot. The lift area and corridors are a little dark and dingy but not the end of the world as you do just pass through. \nWould we stay again?

It was also only \u00a3110 a night in January which compared to most other hotels in the city was a bargain. \nStaff on check in were very friendly and the hotel areas were very clean. Our room, 2207, was a standard queen room with a view down to the Hudson. It was an ok size and basic but had a comfy bed and a hot powerful shower which was basically all we needed for our short 3 night stay. \nThere was quite a few coat hangers for clothes and many drawers. There were lots of plugs in the room as well as USB slots. There was a small safe and an iron and ironing board in the cupboard. \nThere were plenty of towels in the bathroom with shampoo, soap and shower gel. The bathroom was small with no shelf so no space to put your toothbrush etc. The shower curtain worked but my husband is tall so water escaped around the curtain which caused the bathroom floor to be soaking wet after a shower. There was a good hairdryer in the bathroom which could be plugged in anywhere. \nThe Tok Tok diner on site was extremely useful being 24\/7 and was excellent for any meal.\nThe location of the hotel is excellent and easy to get to many places on foot in 20 minutes and it is right by the subway and the train station so easy to get around the whole city and out to other States. \nThe reason for the 3 stars is that being an iconic hotel in NYC, I expected more. The rooms were quite dated and needed refreshing; although I imagine they would then charge more per night. The lack of shelving in the bathroom wasn't great. A lot of cold came in the windows so we had to have the heating on quite high to counteract it. Being charged $5 per bag no matter what the size to store luggage was a rip off, although I can't remember if other hotels we have stayed at in NYC did the same. \nIf you are looking at visiting NYC for your first time, I would find somewhere else, but for a short break it was ok.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is no visible marking of H or C so was unsure when hot water took several minutes to get hot.  The Towels are nothing special and the bath towels very small.\n\nIn terms of general space there is a closet and a 3 drawer chest, one side of the bed has a bedside table although as only on one side of the bed it is home to a lamp,telephone and alarm clock.\n\nThe overall bed comfort was average, fairly springy and every slight movement the headboard banged against the wall so felt sorry for those in the adjacent room.\n\nThere was no particular view from this room, although this didn't worry me as I was on business however if on vacation would have been disappointed.\n\nThe cleaning standards unfortunately were poor the bin had not been emptied and had a black bag of Ice in it and there were sweets under the bedside table and the carpet very dusty, with dust and dirt in other areas of the room.\n\nSleep quality was poor due to the noise, whilst  in a major city you expect external noise but the disturbance was from inside, at 3 AM over a period of 30 minutes there was loud crashing about outside my room, on looking a member of staff was transporting cages of equipment. I politely asked if he could be a bit quieter and rather than apologise he said \" I'm just doing my job what do you want me to do ? Carry it?\" I noticed he had Ear pods in so said perhaps he couldn't hear how loud he was as listening to the ear pods. Generally very Rude so I then called a manager and thankfully didn't hear any more.\n\nAt 8am onwards there was lots of noise in the hall, but being so close to the elevator as and also the door virtually being next to the bed.\n\nSignificant noise was from housekeeping and staff, thankfully I carry a \"Do not Disturb sign\" as lots of door knocking around following by apologies. I Did not have a hotel one in my room so why I was pleased I had my own.\n\nOverall amenities were poor 3 ultra small (30ml)  shampoo\/conditioner\/lotion and 2 small soaps. No shower gel. ( I rely on these as don't check bags anymore)\nThere were good amounts of power outlets unusual in older hotels, but no coffee machine in the room ( some work colleagues had one so it's again luck )\n\nOverall I would not recommend this hotel to family or friends.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The rooms tiny, the shower just spat water at you and was like warm at best. \nCheck in staff I dealt with was a lovely guy (didn\u2019t catch his name unfortunately) however we did have to pre authorise a card for a deposit which was not aware of and they would not accept cash.  security staff we came across again all friendly enough. \nBe very wary of the young lady on the desk opposite the check in, we were totally duped into 'free passes' if we gave up 2 hours to go and view another of their hotels I quote 'they just want to show you around there\u2019s a lovely rooftop bar etc rtc' what this actually is is trying to seek you a timeshare and viewing one of their apartment blocks, there was no free champagne as promised, the free passes had lots of ts&cs attached to them that we were not told about and we ended up being stuck there for 2.5 hours! Completely underhand sales tactics when you\u2019re a hotel guest on holiday. \nMy other issue is at check out. Woke up tia receipt of $97 dollars for facilities and tax. There were no facilities that we used!\nI paid this reluctantly on another card and was promised the pre authorised amount would be returned to my debit card within 3\/5 business days.  Ow I have spent hours being passed from pillar to post trying to find out where my money is as it\u2019s still being held, spent \u00a330 in phone calls to the hotel who told me it has been released not now could take a lot longer as overseas ( shouldn\u2019t make a difference at all!) my bank have since told me that they have NOT been instructed by Wyndham to release my money despite the front desk clerk this morning telling me they have. Seems they like to hold onto this to earn interest for the 30 days! \nNo email address seems to work to contact them and now cant afford to keep calling the hotel to be left on hold for 10 minutes. \nMy 5 th time to New York and most definitely my last.

Dreadful, never been in a hotel like this before!\n\nThe downside, although a comfortable room, sadly the decor, both in the room & generally, is looking very down at heel and in need of, at least, a coat of paint. The Art Deco, must have looked wonderful when new, but it probably hasn't seen a paintbrush since. The room window, although sealed, let a gale force draught through which was cold enough to keep milk from spoiling on the window sill.\n\nBut be AWARE the moment you book in you are charged a 'facility fee' for each night per person, we paid $300 for 6 days and we were told this will be refunded 7-10 days after our visit.

They said this was for Wi-Fi,international calls,the gym and conference centre. As we didn\u2019t ask for or use any of these facilities we asked to see the manager. We were promised that the manager would see us at 9.00am the next day. When we went to see the manager we were told he was very busy with an important meeting. We asked 4 times in all to meet the manager but we are still waiting.\nIf this hotel wants more money for the rooms it should be on the room rate,not dropped on you when you get there. It\u2019s seems to me that the management agree with me and that\u2019s why they would not discuss this with me because they are too embarrassed to defend there policy.\nWe also booked bed and breakfast, Breakfast was one cup of coffee,one bagel and one small glass of juice.

We knew we were gonna get charged this, so no worries at all. Once we got to the hotel we were surprised to see how dirty the corridors were. In the room you could find an outdated loud bathroom, extremely old television, bad view, and walls as thin as paper. Very hard to sleep throughout the first night because you can literally hear everything. On the second day, I got up and had a shower and found that there\u2019s no shower head and the water just shoots at you hard and fast, very annoying and something they could easily fix. The toilet also makes extensive noise when you flush it, I woke up and needed to use the bathroom and I probably woke up a lot of people with how loud the toilet is. Now it\u2019s the morning of our second day, and we were just charged $530. We haven\u2019t been given a reason on why we were charged this money, they are telling me it has been reversed back into my dads account but it\u2019s not. Even if it is, it\u2019s gonna take a week for it to go back, now we only have $150 left for our holiday, we have two days left, and unfortunately we will most likely be spending the rest of it in this hotel. \n\nAwful experience, terrible hotel, unhelpful staff.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The best description of this place is Ugliness.   You arrive and the Lounge is beautiful, especially the chandelier, go to the lift and the nightmare begins: the lifts are noisy which you will hear all night from your room and the corridors are dark, dirty and dated; my wife almost cried because we had just come from the Ritz in New Orleans and the Riggs in Wash. DC.  The people who clean the rooms are noisy.  I booked a room based on the photo on their website (see photos) instead they gave us one that had no similarity (2188) just behind the lift.  The noise was terrible; when I asked, the manager said that they can use any photo they want.  I am sure that here in Europe it would be totally illegal to misrepresent and sell a room under false pretence.  I complained to the kind assistant who gave me room 4008 but I had to pay an extra $100.  A suite, the manager said,  obviously he has never been to a good hotel.  The whole hotel is dirty brown and dark.  By the way, they use the same photos regardless of room type.\n\nWhat makes me angry is that management (according to them) know every single room in the hotel so why give horrid and noisy rooms to guests knowing very well that they will not sleep because of the noise and that their stay will be ruined.  Those rooms next to lifts should not be rented.  But these people don't care at all and the reason is that although it is a cheap lower class hotel, they are fully booked because of their location, otherwise they would not have any guests.\n\nJose the porter is the only good thing about this hotel.  By the way, I complained to the CEO of the Wyndham hotels and they kindly asked the hotel to deal with my complaint.  They refunded $50 plus taxes after complaining.  However, NEVER AGAIN.  I should have listened to the Virgin Atlantic crew who told me about the horrid rooms.  I have contacted booking.com to inform them of the misrepresentation and misleading information.\n\nStay at this place if you have no money, don't care about cleanliness, or small rooms and above all, you are deaf. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":122005,"title":"Great location, traditional hotel.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Just spent a 4 night stay in the New Yorker hotel, Fifth Avenue, New York as part of a three centre tour of Washington, Niagara Falls and New York.\n\nFirstly, the hotel commands an excellent location, close to the Empire State building, Times Square, Broadway, the Hudson River piers, the Rockefeller building, Grand Central and Penn Street railway stations. That's a major plus point for this hotel.\n\nIt's an old hotel with a decorative grand entrance and certainly has the decor of days gone by (in a good way).\n\nWe were on an organised, three centre tour with New York being the final stop so we decided to book a couple of extra days in NY as the basic tour only gave us 1 1\/2 days, not long enough in this iconic city for us to do all we wanted.\n\nOur room was small and some of the fittings were a bit dated but it was clean, comfortable and as quiet as you could probably get in the heart of this city.\n\nThe room housekeepers visited daily and did a good job cleaning ,tidying and replenishing towels, soaps and shampoos.\n\nThere are no tea\/coffee facilities in the rooms, no fridge, no microwave but rooms do have a safe. Our shower\/bathroom was functional with good pressure, plenty of hot water and simple controls.\n\nFood and drink facilities within the hotel consist of the Tick Tock diner, an Italian restaurant, both adjacent to the hotel lobby plus \"Butcher and Banker\", a coffee, tea and breakfast stall (croissants, pastries, cakes) in the lobby which is your best bet if you want a quick breakfast and drink. We didn't get to try the Italian restaurant but did use Tick Tock a few times. It's an all American diner, a bit reminiscent of Al's in Happy Days and the food is typical diner fayre. It was hot, tasty, served very quickly and the prices are very reasonable when compared to dining in the 1,000's of places you can go in the city. The staff in Tick Tock were very pleasant and, all in all, the Tick Tock gets a tick from me.\n\nThe two guys serving at \"Butcher and Banker\" breakfast coffee stall, which looks like a portable street stall but is permanently situated in the hotel lobby, were very polite and chirpy, likewise the housekeeping staff, who were most helpful.\n\nRegarding meals, if you didn't want to use the hotel, then every other retail unit along every street and avenue will be some sort of food outlet. It is, in general, all \"fast\" food but the city has such a divergence of food genres that you just have to try it. The street vendors all add to this to give you even more choice. There are also several Irish style pubs close to the hotel which serve solid \"pub grub\" food as part of the menu.\n\nHaving never stayed in New York City before I cannot compare the New Yorker to others but I would imagine that it stands up against similar priced accommodation which, being in New York, will be expensive.\n\nNow for the things to watch out for.\n\nGeneral.\n\n#1.\n\nFood in New York is, in general, expensive, particular when you add the local taxes and the mandatory tips on. We were advised to budget for 30% more than the menu price to cater for taxes and tips and that soon inflates the overall cost.\n\n#2.\n\nIt's difficult to eat healthy. I suggest you put the diet and cholesterol levels to one side during your stay and just enjoy the NY experience.\n\n#3.\n\nIt's easy to navigate your way around; all the roads North\/South are \"Avenues\" and all the roads East\/West are streets and, in general, they are all sequentially numbered. It's difficult to get lost.\n\n#4.\n\nJust as an aside, for anyone visiting the USA or Canada for the first time, unlike the UK, the supermarkets are not generally licenced (possibly only for beers) so if you want wine or spirits then you have to find a liquor store (they are plentiful in most towns and cities).\n\nSpecific to the New Yorker hotel \n\n#1.\n\nYou will need to factor in the \"resort tax\" or \"facilities tax\" that is added on to the room rates. This is not unique to the New Yorker as most city hotels apply it, it's just something to budget for. Our taxes were pre paid but, if they weren't, the rate would be about $29 (plus tax) per room per night.\n\nIn summary.\n\n In summary, the New Yorker hotel is good for a stay in the city and we were looked after well by good service staff. The location is ideal for New York visitors, in the middle of Manhattan and is a good base for most of the New York attractions. The adjacent Tick Tock diner serves good, all American, food at as good a price as you will get, save, possibly for the street food and the housekeeping staff are very proficient and helpful. Some of the room fittings are a bit tired but I doubt you will get any better in similar priced hotels in this city.\nAll in all, it was fine for our lovely New York city stay.\n","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Food was good and we could get a  drink to take back to the room at night as there are  no tea and coffee making facilities. There's also a Starbucks kiosk open in the mornings for drinks and breakfast pastries which was great when we had an early start. \n \nI wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again and would recommend it to others.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was the last leg of a 3 city vacation. I picked the New Yorker because of its proximity to the train that we were using to get into town. \n\nWhen we got out at Moynihan Train Hall, we walked out onto 8th Ave and immediately saw the sign for the hotel. We walked right to the hotel, used the revolving door and got in line to check in, right around 4pm.\n\nThe gentleman behind the counter was very nice and even upgraded our room to one with a view! \n\nWe took the clearly marked elevators to the 32nd floor and our room was just off the elevator. \n\nThe VIEW! It was amazing! We could see the Empire State Building and the Chrysler building from our beds. \n\nI say beds, plural, because our upgrade switched my husband and I from a queen to 2 fulls, lol. That was a little disappointing, but the view by far made up for it. \n\nI had already read reviews that the rooms are small and dated, which didn't detour me. Yes, the rooms are smaller and the bathrooms have older fixtures, but everything worked well. Our shower had the best water pressure of the who trip! \n\nThe room did not come with a fridge, which was fine, so we took advantage of the ice machine one floor up. We had plenty of room for 2 people to have our suitcases out, the closet was a good size and came with an electronic safe that was easy to use, the room had an iron and board as well. We received plenty of towels. \n\nOn the 32nd floor, we had no issues with street noise and the noise from the hall was minimal. \n\nThe hotel was flexible on late check out and has a space for us to pt our bags if we need to before catching the flight home (for a fee), so it was nice to have that amenity. Any questions we had about navigation or services were handled professionally by a kind staff. Everyone there was very nice. \n\nThe hotel is walking distance from so many things: Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Plaza, Macy's, Broadway, and more. Madison Square Garden is right out the front door and Penn Station the the next block over. You are as centrally located as it gets!\n\nWe LOVED our stay at the New Yorker and will absolutely stay there again. ","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our flight with spirit airlines was cancelled early in the morning due to weather and when I called the hotel to notify of our late arrival, Neida M., from reservation department was extremely helpful.  Neida helped us by making sure our rooms were reserved and our upgrade respected.  To our surprise, the 2 rooms we got were suites; one of the rooms with 2 double beds on private room had 2 bathrooms, refrigerator and microwave with sofa and working desk. It also had a balcony! The other room was also a 2 double bed with private door, sofa, refrigerator, microwave and a big nice dining table for 6. The second room had more space since there was no balcony or 2nd bathroom but was definitely our best choice since the view through 4 big windows on the 22nd floor was awesome and well worth not having an extra bathroom or balcony. Our check in was very easy and fast. Front desk personnel were extremely polite and friendly. Housekeeping was very friendly and helpful as well. We only utilized the starbucks cafe on site and the staff was also very friendly.  The hotel is conveniently located near many local attractions\/sites. We had no big issues utilizing the subway. My husband and kids figured it out using their phones. We only used uber and lift and to our surprise, it was not that expensive.  We visited central park, central grand station, china town, little italy, the brooklyn bridge, St. Patricks cathedral, times square, broadway show and several other places all in 3 days!  It was tiring but well worth it. On our last day, we left our luggage at the hotel to take advantage of the afternoon and tour a little bit more before our fight at 10:00 pm.  The hotel has a bag holder area and for $5 per bag, they keep your luggage until you are ready to leave.  Their big lobby area is very comfortable to wait for your ride. We will gladly go back to the New Yorker again.  We love Wyndham hotels and have only good experiences with them.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Also want an early checkin $25 dollars even if the room is ready. Want to hold onto your bags $5 dollars each. In fact if there is way to add to the charge they will. And this was also my experience of NY. The room was ok, very very small but manageable.  What really let it down was the art deco shower to go with the decoration. It would not harm to upgrade the shower to something out of the 21st century rather than the pathetic one on offer. \n\nThe main gripe however was the lack of effort from pretty much every member of staff, a smile, a good morning or similar goes a long way.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We stay because of convenience but this is probably the last.  You never know what you're going to get when you stay here. Three weeks ago I was offered an upgrade for $40 extra a night to a gorgeous suite with two bathrooms and a balcony but this time I didn't even get what I booked. The hotel itself is old art deco but corners were cut when trying to  keep it intact such as tile repair and the like. I booked two queen rooms with fridges (was here on business) but were given a queen and a room with two double beds (one without a fridge.)  The TV didn't work in one room and we had to call three times and wait 1 1\/2 hours and nobody arrived.  The entire stay it sounded like someone was moving furniture on the floors above us. LITERALLY the entire time - it must have been something with pipes or structure of the building. We had to keep the TV on all night (after they fixed it) to try and drown out that noise. I will add that a stay we had a few years back the full length mirror fell off the wall and landed on top of my sister-in-law - a very HEAVY framed wall mirror, it knocked her over and thankfully the bed was there because she fell to the bed and it rested on top of her. \n We were offered a complimentary night stay the next time we booked but no matter how I tried to contact someone to reserve that free room, nobody would return my calls or emails. We made a note to look up other hotels in the area as we were walking around as for the price paid for this stay, we were certainly overcharged.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The view of the Empire State Building is breathtaking. We also requested\/got a fridge in the room. For the price, the New Yorker is the absolute best place to stay. There are a few annoyances, and things to look out for when booking: we were put in an ADA room; while it was nice to have a \"big\" room, it left me feeling a bit \"dirty\" that should a disabled person need the room, it would be occupied by able bodied people. There were 2 of us (not a couple) and this room could sleep up to 4, but there is only one dresser with 3 drawers. And, being an ADA room, the closet has been altered to be accessible which takes space away for hanging clothing (safe, extra bedding, robes, suitcase stand). The room needs a MUCH larger dresser and\/or closet. Finally, the room being a corner room and the size it was, there were 4 windows, which is great:1 at the front looking at the Empire State, and then on the long wall, there were 3 -- 1 behind each bed, and 1 beside the desk tucked in the corner. There was ONE lamp, and it was zip tied to the desk -- which, again, was in the corner of the room, away from the 2 beds. There were also 2 light switches -- one for a pot light over the desk, and the other one at the door to the room which lit up about 3 or 4 pot lights over the closet, beds, and chair\/seating area (and of course the bathroom light). There was no lamp on the bedside table between the two beds. So picture it -- you're in bed at the end of a long day of walking, you're done your bedtime routine, you want to watch TV, read a book, scroll your phone, etc, and your options are: pitch black, full overhead florescent\/LED lights in your eyeballs from the ceiling, or, the desk lamp, 8 ft away, tucked in the corner, on the opposite side of the room from the bathroom and single-window to the Empire state building. The NYorker NEEDS to put a lamp on the bedside table at the very least -- for a room with so many windows, it's DARK. I ended up cutting the zip tie and moving the desk lamp to the bedside table so we could turn the light off when it was time for bed. Someone designing the room should stay IN the room to figure out its functionality; ESPECIALLY as an ADA room -- if we had problems as abled bodied people, imagine someone in a wheelchair!","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"NONE"}

There was a huge line when we arrived, and we ultimately waited over an hour to check in. The wait itself was annoying, but I was more annoyed by the staff's complete indifference to addressing it. There are six check-in stations, but they only had three of them open, while there were clearly other staff members mulling around with nothing to do. We also ran into the general manager while we were in line, and I asked if there was anything more they could do to speed things up; he just shrugged and mumbled something about \"union rules\" before walking off without even an apology. As it turned out, the delay was partly because their credit card system was down, so every guest (even those who had already paid in advance) had to manually write out their credit card info and then wait for the staff to leisurely make a copy in the back room. Having people complete these forms while they were waiting in line would've saved a ton of time.\n\nStrange but true: Taking a hot shower will set off the fire alarm in your room. I took a shower in the morning, and the alarm began while I was towelling off, so I figured I needed to get dressed quickly and leave the building -- but then we noticed that the alarm was only coming from our room (and our 'neighbors' were understandably confused and annoyed by the loud noise early in the morning). So we called the front desk and they sent someone up to quiet the alarm; he explained that this happens all the time and that we should keep the bathroom door closed when taking a shower. Not sure why they don't try to fix this, or at least put up a sign...\n\nAs others have said, the rooms are a bit dated -- and although we booked a queen room, it was definitely just a double\/full bed. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nThe location is excellent: Very close to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building, and much more. The price was also good: About $175 total for a Sunday night during the summer. Our room was also decently spacious compared to other hotels we've used in Midtown.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nIt was exactly \"fine.\" For the location and price, you could do much worse -- but if I saw another hotel at a similar price, I'd take my chances elsewhere.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Busses of tour groups were checking in here every day. We didn't realize it but this is a very unsafe part of Midtown South. There were MANY homeless people in the blocks around this hotel. I've been to NYC multiple times and we were all over NY including Brooklyn and Harlem and we felt the most unsafe in the blocks around this hotel with people begging for money or just harassing people walking by!  Even the Mcdonald's and Starbucks across the street seemed to be struggling with homeless and intoxicated people harassing people! While the lobby was lovely it was very crowded most of the time and not big enough for a hotel with this many rooms. The room itself was old and needed updating. It was hot and is VERY VERY small with less than adequate air conditioning. There was no room for your suitcase to open anywhere but your bed. The only redeeming thing about the room was the view from 36 stories up. Unfortunately, the window was so dirty we couldn't even take a picture of the view. There was an extra charge if you wanted a refrigerator and an extra charge for a coffee maker- though I'm not sure where you would put either one. Extra charge of $5.00 per bag to keep the suitcases after checkout. Coffee in the hotel was $6.00.  Giving this two stars only because the people who worked here were lovely and did a great job including the front desk who was accommodating and super nice about early check-in, and the elevator gentlemen who always checked our room cards which we appreciated for safety.

I booked using wyndham points. Surprisingly a few days prior to my stay i received an offer via the app for the possibility of a paid upgrade. I made a few selections. Even though, it says that you wont find out until check in if you got the upgrade, the app showed me the new room category about 48 hours before check in. When i checked in, i was asked if i still wanted the upgrade, which i said yes. It cost about $60 a night for the upgrade to a family terrace room which normally goes for $500-600 night. The upgrade was worth it. \n\nThe hotel is in a good location, 10 minute walk to tines square, 3 minutes to madison square garden and penn station. There is a cvs, mcdonalds and starbucks across the street. There is also an imax movie theatre across the street. \n\nThe hotel lobby is nice and clean. There is a diner and a steakhouse which i did not try out. You have to show your room key to get to the elevators. \n\nThe room- the family terrace room was nice and big for new york standards. Had two queen beds in one room which were comfortable. Had a tv in that room as well. There is a separate living room with a sofa, a dinner table, and a mini fridge. This also has the door access to the terrace. Awesome view of new york there on the 26th floor. The terrace itself is very large, you can probably have 20 people on there. But there is only one small round metal table and 4 chairs on the terrace, the rest is empty space. The hotel can definitely do way better on the terrace. To be honest, they can do better with the living room space, a kitchenette area would be perfect. The room was clean and the furnishings were in good condition. Housekeeping was good. \n\nBathroom- this is where the age of the room shows. The shower water temperature does fluctuate a bit. The handles to the shower are old school but clean. The sink is very small and the bathroom itself is small and no counter space. I dont know why almost every hotel does has renovations done always seem to neglect the doors and hinges and vents. Instead of replacing them they simply paint over them. This hotel was no exception to this, sorry but you can tell some items have 10 coats of paint and why paint over rusty door hinges. Little things like this can make a room look nice or old. \n\nOverall, i would stay again if in new york again. Clean rooms, upgrade is worth it and good location. Just a few minor upgrades can make things even better. \n\nThere is a luggage storage service which costs $5 per bag. This should be complimentary.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I took a shower one night and my fire alarm started going off which, understandably, made me anxious. It was past 9:00 pm and someone starts banging on my door saying they are Security and they need to come into my room. I was staying in this room alone and as a young woman who wasn't even wearing anything, I asked if I could get a minute, but this person kept banging on my door telling me to open it so I had no choice but to open the door to this strange man banging on it before I could even get dressed or anything. He ended up telling me that the fire alarm sometimes goes off from shower steam and this happens pretty much once a day. However, if this is such a common occurrence why not 1) warn people when they check in and 2) not scare me to death by acting like the hotel is burning down!! This is not ok!!\n\nFurthermore, I have been emailing the hotel for about two weeks now due to unclear and almost fraudulent billing. I stayed in this hotel to attend a conference, and for some reason, I was charged WAY more than all of my coworkers who attended with me. Even though I have the proof of my coworkers' receipts, the hotel staff keep telling me that it is not a mistake and that they will not refund me the money. The greed of this hotel management disgusts me! There are so many other hotels in New York. Save your money and mental health and DON'T choose this one.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This is a horrible hotel with the rudest staff I have ever encountered.

We arrived at 10am. we were told that our room wasn\u2019t available until after 1:00 at the latest 3:00. Understandable, as most hotels have late check outs for guests. So we checked our bags with the bell station and wandered around the city. We came back at 3:00 and were told our room was still not available. So again, we left to explore the city some more. We came back at 4:30 and we were told by a extremely rude employee named Jean that our room was not available and that she could put us a room that was available and comparable to the one we booked which was supposed to be a \u201cfamily terrace suite\u201d which I was told that \u201c the family terrace suite\u201d that I had book was one of the hotels best with a spacious living room area and a private terrace with a view of the river. I told Jean as long as the room she was going to put us in was comparable to the one I paid for or better than that was fine. I said, I\u2019m sorry for being picky about it but my daughter is having surgery in the morning and I want her to be comfortable since we will be stuck in the room for the next 8 days. I said, it\u2019s been a very long day and we just want to get in our room and relax. She responded very rudely with, \u201c yeah, everybody has something going on in their life. \u201c Ya everybody has something going on. My daughter was scheduled to have surgery following her battle with leukemia which required specialized surgery by a doctor in New York. We finally got to our room and it was not even close to what I was promised when booking this room. However, after an exhausting day we were willing to make it work. Then there was a knock at the door. It was security telling us we had to vacate the room and leave the hotel! When asked why, we were told by the manager named Mike, that an employee heard my daughter say to me while we were retrieving our luggage that the receptionist was really rude and bitchy and that is why we had to vacate. We were patient and non confrontational. There was no argument or any type of confrontation with anyone. Just someone over hearing a comment made from one person to another. Long story short, we were left trying to find another hotel that would accommodate us at 6:00 pm!

This stay was a little disappointing as  there was hair in the shower and an old bar of soap in the soap dish, which looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while and we had no \"Do not disturb\" sign  Other than that, we had a great stay.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Reba was amazing!! The location is excellent. It\u2019s literally within walking distance across from the hotel. It\u2019s convenient to Times Square and many attractions which is why we chose it. The hotel is an older hotel but when I booked, I booked a renovated room with a view. The view was great , the room was very small. I had tried to get a handicapped room but none were available the first night. The toilet was extremely low to the ground and my sis and I needed a higher one because of knee replacements. They did accommodate us the next day. It was an actual small suite with two double beds, an extra living room with couch and TV  and a handicapped restroom. We also had a patio with an even better view at the same cost. It was worth having to change rooms for. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. We were on the 7th floor so it wasn\u2019t too bad of an elevator ride. I had heard the elevators were slow but they weren\u2019t too bad at all. Free Wi-Fi for two in each room if needed. We did not have a car so I can\u2019t comment on parking. It is near a couple of subway stations. The hotel has the TikTok diner that is open 24\/7 . The food was good, they have all types and it was our go to unless we went out to restaurants. They did have a very nice restaurant that had a dress code. We didn\u2019t go to that one, we were too busy. The staff was very friendly. It was expensive but not as much as some. This is New York City and it\u2019s in the middle of everything. The location is the best thing about it. It\u2019s so convenient . I would stay again. We actually got a good nights sleep. The noise was not as bad as I thought it would be from the sounds of the city. We flew into Newark which was about a 45 minute taxi ride to the hotel. It\u2019s about the same distance from the hotel as is LaGuardia. The taxi rides to and from both airports was at least $100. I\u2019m not sure about JFK airport.

But for the price, one can do much better. We had originally booked at a Hyatt in the same part of town for the same price, which offered more amenities (breakfast, mini-fridge and microwave). We changed to the New Yorker Hotel because we wanted to extend our stay in Manhattan, and the Hyatt had no additional availability. \nOur first morning at the New Yorker (after arriving late by train the night before) the alarm in our room went off at 6 am. We hadn't touched the clock, so this was obviously set by a previous guest. We told the front desk that housekeeping should be sure to clear any alarm settings between guests. They apologized and said they would refund us some money, however they didn't deliver. \nJust about any hotel in America would provide coffee in the morning - either an in-room coffee maker or free coffee in the lobby. Not The New Yorker. \nMy husband and I asked independently, ahead of time, if the hotel would hold our luggage for a few hours after we checked out. We were both told yes, but neither of us were told that there was a charge - $5 per item!

Additionally there was stellar security, great housekeeping and lovely front desk staff (with the exception of one person).

I pressed further and she stated that the card had been rejected, to which I said 'My card is here, I can pay right now'. No-- not good enough, go call Booking.com to figure it out. I was not offered any assistance, I felt not an ounce of sympathy toward my situation or stress (which was due to having just travelled for 40 hours and my bags being left in Hong Kong). I too work in the customer service industry and I have bad days just like anyone else, but I would never ever be so callous with someone whom I have just given bad news to.\n\nHaving just arrived in the states, I have no cell service yet, so I am madly texting back home to have someone help me figure things out and I find that my room had only been cancelled a mere 23 minutes ago! I was literally in a car from the airport at that time, how could it be?!  So I approach the front desk again and this time I am served by the wonderful Miguel. He apologizes profusely, explains politely that I would need to book and pay at today's rate only if there was one available. I said, 'surely my room is already set up because it was only cancelled 23 minutes ago, can I not take that one at the original rate?'. He was unsure and said he would go speak to the manager. A time passes, maybe 5 or 10 minutes? Miguel returns and is able to restore my booking for a small additional cost.

The room was pretty small and basic but it\u2019s all we really needed given it was just a place to sleep at night. The only downside was that the duvet was insanely thin and the TV was quite blurry. \n\nCheck in was quick, they took my debit card and immediately took $300 ($100 for the facility fee which they keep and $200 for the security deposit which I\u2019m waiting to get back) which was a bit jarring but it is what it is - what i felt wasn\u2019t fair is that despite paying this facility fee it costed $30 PER DAY to use the coffee machine in the room which was just a basic machine with some plain coffee pods. It was also another $30 I think per day to have a mini fridge in your room, which I thought was odd as most places you have complimentary coffee\/tea and usually a mini fridge with a mini bar which costs. \n\nAnyways after checking in we we called over by a girl at the adjacent desk who started giving us a presentation about their new hotel that\u2019s opening across town, and asked us for a $40 deposit for a ticket to tour the new hotel the following day in return for a gift card and the $40 back, (we had just had a horrendus 12 hour travel day and all we wanted was to get to our room and finally lie down) so we asked if we could book it later on as we were exhausted and really just wanted to get to our room and settle in but she persisted on booking us in for this tour and explaining about their resorts all over the country and their perks etc - I get it\u2019s her job to recruit people but read the room guys, we just wanted to get to our room and drop our bags!\n\nSo we got to our room $300 (nearly $340) lighter and yeah it was okay, I did hope for a a view not of a brick wall but I imagine that would\u2019ve been an extra cost also. \n\nCheck out was easy, $5 per bag if you want to leave it in the lobby if your check out is much earlier than your flight and you\u2019ve got time to to kill in the city. \n\nBecause of the extra costs I probably wouldn\u2019t stay there again, as the costs you end up spending might as well be spent to stay at a better hotel.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Very conveniently located near the train station and has subway access just outside. I also enjoyed looking through the mini museum they have on the basement level. There is a lot of rich history at this hotel and I hope they continue to preserve it in their renovations. \nYes, the rooms are small, but that is to be expected staying in the heart of NYC.  My room had a Keurig and a mini fridge.  I saw some reviews saying they didn\u2019t have that. The room was kind of perpetually damp. I think that has more to do with the weather while we staying. The paint around the bathroom windows was peeling due to the lack of ventilation in the bathroom. I suggest cracking the window open while bathing to help prevent this. (Yes, you can open the windows a little in this historic hotel) The bathtub was solid, cast iron. I believe it may be original and re glazed, along with the tiles on the wall. The bathroom was about half the size of the room. What we sacrificed in space we gained in a view though. We had a lovely view of the Empire State Building from our bed. \nRoom service is available here, granted it\u2019s not brought on a cart or on China. It is brought in bags in to go containers. It was prompt and friendly. My only complaint is they should use better quality plastic ware for the cutlery. \nOverall, we had a very nice stay at The New Yorker, and would recommend it for anyone that wants to stay in the center of the city with easy access to everything.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Everything about it is right e.g. location - midtown and near so many places such as Macy's, Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, Times Square and is less than a block from subway stops.\nThe New Yorker is affordable with a variety of good size rooms and suites for most budgets - the room prices are very competitive and the value for the money is excellent. It is a part of the Wyndham group and you can use points plus cash, all points or at the very least collect points during your stay. Full disclosure I have a Wyndham card and pretty much stay at their branded hotels.\nWe found the accommodations super clean, well appointed with a comfortable bed, quality linens, towels and toiletries. The powerful shower had a safety bar which as a senior is important to me. The mini refrigerator, and room safe are features I like. \nWithout exception the staff are first rate from check-in receptionists, housekeeping and suited security in the lobby who btw are always there checking access to elevators 24\/7. Speaking of elevators they are segmented by flights of floor e.g. there are express elevators dedicated to floors 20 through 40. \nThe Tic Tock diner just off the lobby never closes and is there regardless of when you are hungry. We liked the Tic Tock and did not try the other two restaurants also located just off the lobby.\nThe entire hotel is well maintained and we noticed nothing that needed painting, repair or replacement. \nWe did not have a car and can not comment on parking. The Wi-fi which is included in the price was always available and did not drop off even once.\nOver the course of our eight day stay we saw numerous groups staying there so it seems popular with conventioneers too. Even with the many guests we found the accommodations to be exceptionally quiet.\nI would recommend, without hesitation, the New Yorker for any business or tourist traveller such as singles, couples, families or groups looking for a quality, affordable stay in New York City.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Mainly thanks to the amazing staff that work here. You can really tell the staff love their jobs and love to help people. Mohammad on reception was absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately on our first night we were in a room with a noisy group of youngsters next to us who kept us up all night and we could hear everything (including the toilet flushing, them talking, their alarm etc.) so we went to reception and asked to be moved and met the wonderful Mohammad who couldn't do enough for us. He let us view multiple rooms to ensure we were happy with our final choice and ultimately ended up upgrading us which was such a wonderful gesture. It really enhanced our stay and we felt he was really understanding of the frustration of being woken up all night so he really went above and beyond. We aren't complainers and hate complaining therefore we felt so relieved he was so amazing and understanding with what we were saying. That is genuinely the kind of customer service every hotel needs as he was just amazing throughout and I cannot thank him enough! It really enhanced our stay here as we slept amazingly for the rest of our week. \n\nThe beds are super comfy although the duvets are thin so we did have to sleep with the heating on to keep us warm. \n\nThe rooms are a decent enough size, we enjoyed the built in wardrobes which we could store one of our big suitcases in. Rooms come with a hairdryer which works well and iron + ironing board. \n\nWe ate breakfast in the Tick Tock restaurant in the hotel most mornings and built a rapport with a wonderful waiter called Cosmas. He is from Greece initially and truly the most wonderful human. He remembered our drinks order by our second visit and his customer service is just so on point. We had such a laugh with him and again, he just went above and beyond every time without fail.\n\nWe were genuinely so sad to be leaving New York and the hotel which doesn't happen often! We are regular travellers but this hotel will always hold a special place in my heart and I would definitely stay again!\n\nThe location is amazing! Ideal for going to Madison square garden too as it is literally across the road!\n\nThe metro is opposite the hotel (34 st) + Penn station so it is so easy to travel further afield. Times Square is a 10 minute walk and Central Park or the water front with the sea, air & space museum & circle line tours are 30 min walk. So everything literally within walking distance if you enjoy walking and if not, just jump on the metro which again is so easy to navigate!\n\nUpon leaving the hotel, we were then met with a guy who was organising taxis to the airport. I cannot remember his name which is frustrating but it was on Sunday 19th Feb. He asked us if we needed a taxi to the airport which we said no we had an uber booked and he asked what price the uber quoted which was $91 and he said he can sort a taxi for us for $80 fixed rate. So we agreed and again he was amazing. \n\nOverall, if you have read this much then you must be interested in this hotel haha and I would genuinely recommend staying here and would stay here again. \n\nThank you New Yorker, it's been a pleasure!\n\n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was cramped,paint was peeling off the walls and bath, sheet was stained, headboard was peeling,cracked main lampshade and the catpet is just horrific. Bath plug looked like it was from when the building was first built and the actual bath fixture let the water drain out. The chest of drawers had a handle snapped off and the top drawer would keep opening. \n- Not very helpful on front desk (they couldn't care less!) Checked in and was given the wrong room number.. then had to lug all my bags down from the 27th floor back to the reception to sort. \n- Facilities fees- charged an extra $22 per night plus 2xtaxes for the \"facilities\". These include having a phone in your room(!), a conference centre and use of a fitness centre. Nothing of any use to the majority of people. Spoke to the manager when I received my final bill of $126 for these facilities and she told me it was basically \"tough luck\" ( I hadn't been aware of the extra payments when I booked!)\n- No fridge, no kettle\/coffee maker... fortunately I took my own travel kettle, but had to chill my milk by filling up the sink with cold water. \n-Building work outside- the hotel must have been aware of this, but didn't make me aware. \nCleanliness- towels on arrival were stained. I spoke to the cleaner the next morning (I was on my own so could use other towels and it was quite late by the time I had arrived) she gave me clean towels. Unfortunately I was then again left stained towels a couple of days later. The rails in the bathroom were dirty and I made the mistake of looking behind the mirror in the bathroom! \ud83e\udd22\n\nCheck out hotels that don't charge facilities when you check out (or if they do, they use this money for improvements) this is a very cheeky way of advertising a cheaper room rate and then making money back and hotels are being pulled up on this.\n\nThe hotel needs a lot of renovation, a lot of love and some new management to make it wonderful.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

Also, the lifts were a nightmare when we stayed, often having to wait 15\/20 minutes at a time is ridiculous. Out of 5 lifts, we are sure we only saw 3 actually working.

As I walked to the elevators, I was aggressively stopped by the \u201celevator guards\u201d demanding to see my key.  While I understand this sort of \u201ccheck\u201d may be necessary in a big city, the approach was a little severe and I\u2019m not sure my 65 year old mother and I are the type of clientele they are trying to keep out. Especially since we just walked away from the check-in desk\u2026 \nOnce we made it by the \u201csecret service,\u201d we hopped on the elevator and I already knew it wasn\u2019t going to be good. The hotel is old. Very old. While the elevators may be up to code, they are definitely old as well. When the doors opened to our floor we saw the outdated blue carpet that I suspect hasn\u2019t been changed since the 70s. We walked to our room and as soon as I opened the door, I gagged at the smell. The best I can describe it as is severely musty. The smell was so over powering. The bathroom was no bigger than a closet. The toilet was like an airplane toilet and you actually have to put the seat cover down in order to flush the toilet. The sink was rusty and when you turned it on, the water pressure was so high, it splashed everywhere. The shower looked like it was updated at least in the last decade. As for the beds\u2026 double beds, not queens. There were hairs on every single one of the pillows on my bed. I don\u2019t know if they hadn\u2019t washed the pillow cases or if the hair belonged to the maids,  but either way- not clean. We actually had to go to cvs to get room deodorizer to get rid of the smell. \nWith all of the good reviews, I can only assume that the hotel has updated some rooms, but not the one I stayed in. If you consider staying here, I would confirm if the room you\u2019re staying  in has been recently renovated.  If not, better bring febreeze and a black light.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Getting anywhere in Manhattan is easy from here. JFK\/ EWR are easy to reach from Penn Station too. \n\nThere's 3 restaurants in the hotel- Tick Tock is an iconic NY Diner open long hours with a big menu although the food and service are average at best, Trattoria Bianca is a decent Italian with a nice bar and Butcher & Banker a fantastic upscale steak house in the basement. \n\nDownstairs, you'll find a very good fitness centre, a 24hr business centre and a little archive documenting the hotel's history. Be sure to visit this as it is really interesting. I believe you can book a tour of the hotel with a guide to take you to some of the \"off limits\" places too which I'm sure would be fascinating. \n\nAs for the more important stuff- service, well its okay. Its impersonal being a large hotel and not particularly friendly but they do the job. There are staff waiting by the elevators to check you have a room key before you pass who are particularly unpleasant and unwelcoming. Housekeeping are the exception to the rule- the staff I met on the 26th floor were all lovely. That said, there was a distinct smell of weed in the corridors on my floor which was quite unpleasant.\n\nThe rooms- small. You don't expect large in NYC or any big city where space is at a premium but these are very small. The decor is quite dated but everything in my room worked fine. Towels and toiletries were plentiful and replenished daily. \n\nWiFi- works well in the rooms but the lobby network often wasn't working.\n\nAs with many New York hotels there is a facility fee- being British, I hate this concept! Just whack the room price up by a few dollars and don't charge a facility fee....I'll never understand I'm afraid! There is also a charge for bag storage after check out- even less of a fan of this!\n\nThe room price is reasonable for NYC so no complaints there. All things combined, it's fine- no thrills, good location, decent price. I won't rush to return as there are so many other places to stay in New York, but if someone booked me in here in future, I wouldn't complain. ","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Our trip was to celebrate my 40th and my fianc\u00e9 and I getting Married whilst in New York. I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to explain as much and request an upgrade if possible. We arrived at 14:00 and the kind reception team confirmed we had been granted an upgrade but the rooms wouldn't be ready until later in the day. We dumped our luggage, $5 per bay and went off to explore. We returned to the hotel at 17:00 to find one of the rooms was ready and the second wouldn't be ready until 22:00 (03:00 UK time). Obviously we was very tired at this point after a full day travelling. We headed out again to return at 20:00 on the off chance the second room would be ready. It wasn't but the amazing reception team offered us a further upgrade to a suite on the top floor which was ready. We were so grateful. The room, bed and view were all amazing. As per other reviews some parts of the hotel could do with a lick of paint but does that really matter when you are only using it to sleep, shower and prep for full days out in a great city. \nWe used the gym, the bar and the Tiktok diner. Found them all to be great with no issues. \nWould 100% return to this hotel when next in the city. Amazing location with train station and subway 2 minute walk away. All the attractions one would hope to see are easily accessible from this hotel. \nThanks go out to all the staff at the New Yorker for helping to make our trip as special as it was.

We were put on the 36th floor with a great view along 34th street towards the edge and Hudson yards. Room was clean and came with a fridge and coffee machine. Room wasn\u2019t tiny as I\u2019ve seen some people mention, plenty of room for our cases to sit alongside the wall or to store at the bottom of the walk in closet. Room also had a hairdryer, ironing board and iron. \n\nShower was great and the bed was very comfy. Walls are a bit thin so you can hear people moving about especially in the morning but probably to do with the age of the hotel. Nothing that disturbed my sleep at all.\n\n Despite only being four floors from the top of the hotel I don\u2019t think we ever waited more than a minute for an elevator to go down, and the same going up from the lobby. My original booking with travel republic waived facility fees too so did not get stung for those. A safety deposit was taken for my card for the duration of our stay but is to be refunded.\n\nall in all a great stay. I would recommend the hotel to others and will book again when I go back to NYC.

The elevators on the right serve floors 20 to 40 and are so busy. whereas floors up to 20 use elevators on the left which seemed to hardly be used. The rooms were old and dated and did not seem to reflect the glossy look on the website. Also the ever present security present in the lobby requiring guests to flash their room cards to reach the elevators was disconcerting but once we walked about outside the hotel we realised this was probably necessary. There were many people sleeping in doorways and we had not encountered this before and must be something prevalant in this area of the city. Staff were nice but not more than expected and we don't feel the hotel added to our holiday if anything it was a disappointment after a 3 year wait.

The lobby area was gorgeous and very nice, but the upstairs hallways smelled strongly of cigarette smoke and was outdated.

It wasn't super dirty or anything, but definitely could've been cleaner, especially for the price. The TV was older and I had issues with it being so grainy at some points (not the whole time?) that I couldn't read the guide. The diner was nice. Facility fees (none of which I used -- it's basically the office and gym plus Wifi) for my 3 night stay ended up surpassing $100, which was a lot for an already expensive stay at not-the-nicest hotel. Again, the location and view were amazing -- but for this price, you could find a much nicer hotel in an area a little further out and probably have a better stay. All in all, I don't regret staying here (especially because the location was so fabulous) but it definitely is not worth what they're charging and in the future, I'll probably book earlier in advance with another hotel.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

The condition of the room itself was o.k. but not great. I understand they are trying to maintain the look and feel of the iconic Art Deco style. There is limited closet space, and dresser space. The room was about a 125 sq. feet which is what they list on their website. The bathroom was very small with very little space. They painted over the bathroom tile with standard flat wall paint and it was peeling. The shower had older dated shower plumbing and it was very difficult to adjust the water temperature. There is no mini fridge, nor a microwave. The common areas on floor 21 were a little dated. The lighting in the elevator area needed dusting. I don't even want to know how many insect carcasses there were in those overhead lights. The ice machines are some of the guest floors. Housekeeping pointed to floor 19 and of course, it was out of ice. The hallways needed painting. The locks for the doors are dated and still use key cards. Be prepared to show your key card when you access the guest floors.\n\nThey do have a few full service restaurant options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In addition, because this is NYC, you have tons of options outside the hotel and for delivery.

Walking into the lobby is reminiscent of returning to the heydays of 20s and 30s New York and it is easy to imagine resplendent ladies and gentlemen attending dances in the ballroom. Rooms are very comfortable if a little tired at the edges, but clean, very comfortable beds and good working order and everything you need for a short stay.

An old style art deco hotel in a run down area in the city. Reception was brusque and jot too welcoming, eventually our booking was found and  we got room key. Clearly there is a need for a lot of security due to surrounding area inhabited by a disturbingly large amount of homelessness. Room was small (as expected in NY) and needs updating.

The hotel location was very good (just outside Penn Station) and it was very art deco in appearance. 2 adults and a 16 year old so we booked a double double room, it was very small and we struggled to accommodate our clothing and suitcases etc. The room had art deco type lights which were very dim so all lights were on when we were in the room. The window overlooked another bedroom and absolutely no view. The whole place seemed tired, they had painted the bathroom, evidence of this was paint all over the chrome towel rail which came off onto the towels. We got up one day and found that there was no water at all in the room, yes it was resolved, but three of us with no shower in NY heat, not good! The corridors were dismal and the lifts so slow we used the service lift most of the time. The front desk staff were very good as were the housekeeping department but the Concierge\/Security were a little offhand and jobsworth! The icing on the cake was we left our luggage in the luggage storage room for 3 hours and was charged 5 Dollars per bag (ie 10 Dollars for a suitcase and a carry on bag) 30 dollars in total....... rip off.

Rooms, beds, bathrooms, etc..\n2) it will take forever to get an elevator up to your or down to your Room. It actually might be faster walking. Factor at least 10 -15 minutes one way into your travel time\n3) housekeeping - I had a family suite with 4 people. There were two bath towels in the room. I called down at 3:30 pm for more.

This room comes with 2 double beds and a sleeper sofa. We get to the room at 3:30pm. I pull out the sofa to make the bed and have some downtime before a concert. The bed is totally broken- boards are split down the middle. I call down and was told \u201cengineering\u201d would come up and resolve the issue. 30 minutes later I call back down. They seem shocked that no one has come up- they\u2019ll send someone up right away. Of course no one comes up. We go down at 4:30 (an hour later). I speak to someone at the front- of course they\u2019ll take care of it they say. I come back to the room and hour and a half later. Someone has clearly entered the room and looked at the bed but it\u2019s still broken. I go back down and speak to them- they are all aware of the issue, it\u2019s top priority and will be resolved when we get back from the concert. Shocker- we get back at 11:15 and the bed is still in the room and broken. I call down and lose my temper at the front desk- 20 minutes later they send a very lovely lady up with a roll away bed to resolve the issue bc the queen sleeper sofa isn\u2019t working.

Die vielen Sehensw\u00fcrdigkeiten sind zu Fu\u00df zu erreichen. Die Metro befindet sich vor dem Hotel. Das New Yorker Hotel ist ein historisches Hotel, gebaut im Jahr 1930. Im Untergeschoss befindet sich ein kleines Museum. Der Concierge kontrolliert die Karten vor dem Eingang zu den Liften, so dass kein Fremder ins Hotel gehen darf. Die Lobby ist sehr imposant im Art D\u00e9co Style eingerichtet mit einem wundersch\u00f6nen Kronleuchter. Das Hotel hat ein besonderer Charme.\nDas Zimmer ist sehr klein, aber sauber und irgendwie doch gem\u00fctlich. Es gibt auch viele Ablagem\u00f6glichkeiten und ein kleiner Abstellraum, wo man die Sachen verstauen kann. Es gibt ein Safe. Das Bad ist klein, aber man hat alles was man braucht, nur der Wasserdruck in Dusche war irgendwie komisch und das Wasserhahn in der Badewanne war schwer zu regulieren.\nLeider gibt es keine Kaffeemaschine auf dem Zimmer und auch kein K\u00fchlschrank. Es gibt kein Ausblick aus den Standard Zimmern. Der Ausblick geht direkt auf die gegen\u00fcberliegende Wand und darum ist es auch sehr dunkel im Zimmer. Wir hatten leider so ein Zimmer ohne Ausblick. Darum empfehle ich lieber mehr Geld investieren und ein Zimmer mit Ausblick buchen.

Rooms are small - at least mine was, and they told me that they upgraded me from an even smaller room.  The upkeep and maid service is good, however.  Wyndham management means its got the shampoo, conditioner, handcream, soaps, decent cable TV, safe and wi-fi.  No frills like minibars or anything like that, no guidebook to the hotel or city or anything.  Decent place if you really intend to spend most of your time out of the room and hotel.

Room service is provided by the Tick Tock Diner & it\u2019s open 24\/7. Most of the rooms are updated yet still feature the unique Art Deco decor which was so popular when the hotel was built.

Staff were very friendly and attentive. The events manager was such a pleasant man and super nice. Hotel food was delicious and plenty of it! Great central location, about a 10 minute walk to Empire State, Times Square and the edge. Stayed in the suite room on the 40th floor and the views of Manhattan were incredible. Felt like I was in a palace! Rooms were very clean and immaculate. Security at the hotel is very good, they make sure you have your room card as soon as you enter the elevators to go up. The only disadvantage I would say is that you have to wait a long time for the elevators as it stops on almost every floor.

It\u2019s convenient to airports, railroads, subways and buses, and is affordable compared to many others in Midtown.  It has an Art Deco look that\u2019s much nicer than the modern steel-and-glass cookie-cutter newer places.  What makes The New Yorker special, however, is its staff.  In my most recent stay I arrived much earlier than the check-in time on a hot day.  My room wasn\u2019t ready - but Mohammed at the front desk worked extra-hard to find one that was so I could relax out of the heat and hubbub.  When I told him how delighted I was, he said: \u201cIf you\u2019re happy, we\u2019re happy.\u201d  That\u2019s the essence of great customer service.

We arrived at the hotel around 1pm knowing that check in time wasnt until 4. We just wanted somewhere to put our shopping bags (full of clothes we had to buy since we were missing our luggage). Mohammed offered to check us in early which literally made our day because we needed to rest a bit. It was like the only part of our trip that went well, so it made a big difference. People complain about the smallness of the rooms but I thought it was cute and it gave it a little New York twist. We visted the Tick Tock diner next door for dinner and ended up staying until midnight drinking wine :) All we had to do after that was walk up to our room and go to sleep!

Of all my years of travel, the rudest experience was at Wyndham properties. We were supposed to stay at another Wyndham property that was overbooked. My Mother-in-law booked with points and all the reviews were correct we came in at 11:30 at night. No rooms even though she confirmed with them that day we had rooms. Then we went to their sister property which they said we had for two nights. not true only one. We ended up having to pay. The managers were all rude every one of them. They treated us like dirt. Had to argue to get our rooms, and keep our rooms. I am telling you to save your points, pay money and go to a Hilton or Marriot. Don't waste your time or money with any Wyndham property in  New York. The negative reviews did prepare me and they were all correct. The rooms in the New Yorker are ok. But they need some help and the door did not meet the floor and there was so much, light coming in from the hallway under the door I could get up in the night and not worry about needing a light to see the bathroom. All I can say is spend an extra $100 a night to get a better room and better service it is worth it in New York.  Read my other reviews you will know I am not critical but this was one of the worst travel experiences I have ever had. Buyer beware!!!!","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}
