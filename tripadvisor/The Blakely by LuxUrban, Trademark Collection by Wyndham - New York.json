There was loud construction the first night on the street, but that\u2019s out of their hands. The bath products are minimal, so if you want more than a tiny bar of soap and tube of generic shampoo, bring your own bath products. You can ask for a hair dryer, one is not in the room automatically. Staff mostly nice, upon check in one lady (who seemed like a manager) was short on words and not friendly. However, the lady who appeared to be a general staff member was very friendly. All staff thereafter were very friendly. Housekeeping came early, we requested no service the first day, but the second they cleaned up. Towels, sheets were all clean. Furniture was worn, shows its age, but nothing broken or offensive. I\u2019m a smells person, and found nothing offensively odorous. Mini fridge, freezer, microwave were helpful for left overs! Did not ask about gym, enjoyed runs in the park (safe and easy access).

After reading the negative reviews, I was concerned but went ahead with the reservation because of the great location and reasonable price.  I'm so glad I did because it turned out to be a great stay.\n\nFirst of all, the location was perfect, close to theaters and shopping, which was the main focus of the trip.  The area had all kinds of eating choices from takeout to mid -price restaurants to grocery stores.  We never had to walk more than two blocks to find just what we wanted.    \n\nAs for the room, we booked a King 1-bedroom suite and it exceeded expectations.  Yes, some of the furniture was dated but it was clean and so spacious, with a separate sitting room with couch and television so you could relax in the room without having to sit on the beds like the typical smaller NYC hotel room. The microwave and fridge plus some flatware and dishes made it easy to store and reheat leftovers.  This was another nice change from more modern pricier hotels that load up the fridge with minibar items that can't be removed without incurring a charge, thereby making the fridge unavailable for your own use. I only had minimal interaction with the front desk staff but everyone was friendly and accommodating and made me feel welcome.  Another nice change from more expensive hotels.\n\nI rarely leave reviews but wanted to post this one because it was so much better than I expected, based on reviews I read earlier.  Since a lot of the negative ones deal with not getting refunded for cancelled stays and I didn't have to cancel, I can't speak to that aspect.  But if you keep your reservation, I hope you have as great an experience at this hotel as we did.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

While lesser known than some of the big chain hotels, this hotel looked to fit our needs.\nUpon arriving and sharing our reason for our trip (our daughter was in the Macy\u2019s Day Parade), the hotel manager Vicki was called, and she explained the sister hotel, the Herald, overlooks 6th Ave. She was generous in suggesting a number of various options, all of which meant more work for her and the staff. \nOne option was to relocate to that hotel for no additional cost. We ended up switching for 2 nights and remaining for 2. Their staff was completely accommodating. It was very impressive how hard they worked to suite our personal situation.\n\nThis hotel:\nWhile older in style, it holds a classic look and feel with spacious rooms and great location. It\u2019s a good fit for the price, and I\u2019ve already mentioned the staff.\nAll amenities were adequate.  \n\nIf we return, we will heavily consider the LuxUrban chain again.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Hotel prices were at 600 a night already in Midtown. I wanted to speak to the manager but the receptionist said the manager does not take calls. And they basically left us with no place to sleep that night. Luckily booking.com offered an alternate accommodation at the Courtyard but was in Downtown and was 500USD a night. We gratefully accepted it knowing that the hotel would be penalized a total of 3000USD and would have to pay for our alternative accommodation. Happy to have stayed with the Courtyard by Marriott than this dreadful place!\nTip! Do not book this hotel direct, book through a booking channel like booking.com or expedia. If they overbook you, you can demand from the booking channel to penalized the hotel and they have to give you an alternative hotel with greater or equal value.

We had four comfortable nights at the Blakely in a 2 queen room (rare in this part of Manhattan).  Beds were comfortable, room was clean, staff was friendly, and location cannot be better steps to Central Park, Times Square, and every metro line you may need.  We made good use of the microwave\/fridge.  It was surprisingly quiet given the key location (since it's off a side street) and very safe.  I think the 4 star rating may be a stretch given the 'faded' luxury but if you set your expectations right you should be pleased with your stay.  Note that we did pay in advance to get our rate but everything was smooth and the hotel seems trustworthy.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel does not have a phone center, so there is absolutely no way to call anyone. This is unsafe for any person staying at the hotel. Not knowing this, because their website promises someone will be available to speak on the phone 24\/7, I  tried to call hotel over and over again, with no response. I was then informed that there is no call center whatsoever for this hotel . This is completely unacceptable and unsafe for people staying there. I could not, and still cannot, get anyone on the phone. \n\nI was sent an email saying that I had to provide the hotel with pictures of my state identification card, and a lot of other personal information. I was very uncomfortable with that, but after calling multiple times, and not getting a hold of anyone, I filled it out. The authorization was actually declined, meaning that the hotel had no authorization to charge the credit card, but \n (via a short email) the hotel told me that they are still going to charge the credit card. At this point, I had a very bad feeling about this hotel and asked them to cancel the reservation (that I made just an hour beforehand). They responded (by email, because there is no phone), that they are charging the card (despite not being authorized to do so), and there is nothing I can do about it. Their website broadcasts \"FREE CANCELLATIONS\" up to 72 hours before the stay, and it also promises that the customer can reach someone on the phone 24\/7. Both of these are blatant lies and are misleading. I spoke with my bank, and they are removing the charges, and were shocked by how unprofessional this hotel was acting. Frankly, they thought it was a scary situation as well and did not think I would be safe staying there.\n\nThis hotel's practices violate so many basic consumer protection\/false advertising laws. I will be submitting complaints to NYC consumer protection agencies and the BBB, among others. \n\nI have never seen a hotel (or any type of company for that matter) operate this way. It truly has to be some kind of scam.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

But for everything else, I hardly recommend another Hotel!\nRoom service is not worth the name, all they did while we stayed (6 nights) was trading the towels 3 times and make the bed...\nThe sheets are dirty, it's loud and there is just a too small curtain to keep the light out... The bath is pretty dirty, the television doesn't work at all ( I called the reception 3 times, and it is always the cable and a technician is working on it).\nThe main entrance is shared with the rooftop bar that doesn't belong to the Hotel (but definitely looks like while booking) and so you have strangers standing next to the entrance all the time and you, while a guest and trying to get to your room, are asked for a reservation all the time... Not that bad I know, but with all the other facts, a combination of a hotel that I would definitely not book again.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}
