After a lengthy airport commute, it's great to be able to grab water and snacks as well as to do so throughout the day.  I love that the selection is always refreshed and that newspapers were available. The manager at the front desk was brusque and the doorpeople did not always mind the door.  In addition, the hotel would not consider nor would they provide any further discount or comps for my travel to my travel agent.  The carpet and most of the furniture in the room were beyond worn and in need of an update.  It is well located in terms of central park, Moma and the theatre district.

In this case, the answer is yes.\n\nOn the plus side, the service is friendly, and\u2014and this is a big thing\u2014our room was quite large by New York standards. It didn\u2019t have ceiling lights, but they almost made up for it with lots of small desk lamps. The street noise is average for New York hotels: noticeable, but not terrible.\n\nOn the minus side:\nThe furniture and carpet seem like they are several decades old. The sofa was built before people figured out how to make a sofa that is actually comfortable to sit in.\nThe heating system works, but it is too binary. When on, it pumps out huge amounts of hot air, so you get rapid shifts in temperature.\nThe bathroom is small and has no horizontal surfaces to put things on except the back of the toilet.\nThe breakfast is, as advertised, \u201ccontinental,\u201d meaning muffins, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, and granola bars. In a four-star hotel, I would prefer to pay for a good breakfast.\n\nAll of this would usually add up to three stars, but there\u2019s one more problem. The hotel only has one small elevator, which means the wait times can be very long. You need to leave an extra 5-10 minutes if you are going anywhere. I gave up and started using the stairs.\n\nI think the reason this whole chain gets such spectacular ratings is that the staff are extremely friendly and they send you an email later begging for a review. (On the other hand, the Hotel Giraffe is significantly better.)","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

A friend often stays here with her husband and recommended it to me.\nI love the location. I often visit NYC when there are art exhibits I want to visit. For example,  MOMA and The Metropolitan Art Museum. I enjoy walking to both.\nI also enjoy the morning coffee and delicious breads, yogurt..etc\nAnd the afternoon snacks\n(I remember a time before COVID where were cued get cheese and crackers as part of the afternoon snack. I miss that.\n\nMy first issue occurred when I got my room key. I had arrived early afternoon and my room was not ready so I walked a couple of blocks to MOMA\nThe man at reception took my mobile number and said he would call when the room was ready. He thought in 90 minutes. I never received a call. That is not my issue . Although Why say you will do something without being asked by the guest and then not follow through??\n\nWhen I arrived back at the hotel, a different person was at the desk to hand me my room key. Instead of writing the number on the card holder and showing it to me, he said the number out loud\nI am a single woman and I try to careful when I travel. I know for sure saying room a number out loud is a GIANT NO NO! For safety of the guest.\nWomen, especially single travelers need to feel safe whenever they travel, in fact, all travelers do\nI almost said something and almost requested a different room.\nBut, I turned around and I was alone in the reception area, except for a couple of employees\nSo I did not say a thing and took my key\nHowever, I kept thinking about it.\nI returned to the front desk later that day and shared my concern with the desk person. This was not the person who handed me my key\nI thought I was clear in my concern. The desk person offered no apology, never said anything.\nJust listened\nI may be incorrect, but I do not think he understood my concern\nI finally said, this important for all desk staff to know. Saying a room number out loud is a safety issue. I asked him to share my concerns with management\nI did not ask to speak to a manager. That was a mistake on my part,\n\nNow the room itself.\nThe bed was fine.\nThe cushions on the couch and the side chair have seen better days. The couch cushions were very uncomfortable due to a lack of firmness. I enjoy reading on the couch, but that was impossible\nAll someone needs to do is replace the cushion so you do not sink when sitting down.\n\nHousekeeping does a good job. But, I think someone needs to check out the room to sit on the couch and then provide cushions that are comfortable. Check the shades and if one shade is tattered on the side, replace it\n\nThis hotel is charming, but my room needed to be better maintained. Presentation and comfort are important, especially when you hope your guest will return again\n\nI will return to visit NYC and maybe this hotel\nOr maybe not","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

Not only is it extremely well located it is extremely charming.  There is a proper door man for one thing, and a group of engaged and helpful people at check-in in who were extremely personable and addressed my every concern.  The Club Room is well appointed and I am currently sitting there drinking a free Diet Coke, using the fast Wi-Fi, and listening to classical music on the radio as I write this.  My room is quite large for New York standards and had robes and slippers, free water, and a good sized bathroom.  I was almost deterred by comments that the hotel needed updating but I disagree.  The hotel is old school but it fits the setting.  If I stay in Chesterfield, Missouri, a brand new Residence Inn with furniture straight from IKEA is fine but in New York City one wants to feel a little bit of history, a tiny bit of faded glamor.  That said, everything was in perfect repair and if you buy handsome brass fixtures to start you can be pardoned for not replacing them when they simply continue to work beautifully.  I had lunch at the iconic Monkey Bar which was fantastic and so full of ambience I almost wept.  My air conditioning worked a treat\u2014I like it shatteringly cold and it did not disappoint, but it was easily adjusted up to normal people temps.

I liked having a separate entry area with closet and desk and direct access to the bathroom, good if one person needs to get dressed early\/come in late. Plus I love the location - near MOMA, shops on Madison and  5th and easy access to walk to Broadway. That being said, there are definitely areas needing improvement. The rooms need renovation\/updating - the decor is tired, the blinds frayed and the upholstery had small rips and tears in it. The bathroom is modern but there is absolutely no space for toiletries and is too small and cramped. I liked the snack area on the 2nd floor - nice place to relax, great to grab something small.  However, calling what they serve first thing breakfast is maybe an overstatement - coffee is excellent but after that just packaged snack bars, hard boiled eggs, plain yogurt (no flavoured ones) and so-so pastries. Several people came in asking where to order the hot food and there isn't any.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

Jazzmyn, at the front desk, was unfazed.  She had our keys waiting for us as we flew to our 5th-floor room, dressed, and made a mad dash for a cab (NB: Subway would have been faster). Were almost on time; see my rave review of Vestry for more. Throughout our stay Jazzmyn and her front-desk team made us welcome and happy.  Our small room had a kind of bumpy bed and the window opened on the air shaft -- but it was very quiet, and it was an easy walk down the stairs to the extremely comfortable library on the 2nd floor, where bottled water, fruit, espresso, and chips are abundantly available. Also many copies of the NY Times, not to mention actual books. And although we did not use it, there is a DVD library and players in each room.  Also, a small refrigerator is provided at no charge.  I generally prefer a higher floor, but loved the convenience of using the stairs.  Oh, and another thing: We'd originally booked our room prior to the pandemic on a nonrefundable basis.  Had to cancel, and the hotel gave us a credit that was accepted graciously for this stay.  Thanks to all this, but especially to the unfazable Jazzmyn, we definitely will book the Elysee for our next NYC trip.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Nice sized room.\nThe BAD: The room while very clean it could use a renovation and freshing up.  The 18\" tv was underwhelming.  Four LED room bulbs could not light up the room at night. No vanity in the bathroom.   Included in room rate  soft drinks\/coffee  and snacks in the lounge.  Unfortunately the only snacks were very green banana's potato chips and 370 calorie energy bars.

Our room with two double beds was very spacious.  Two small quibbles:  The step up to the bathroom is quite a hazard and it is easy to trip on it.  The plugs in the wall were quite loose and sometimes made recharging our phones, etc. an iffy proposition.  I can't vouch for the quality of the breakfast or the quality of the hospitality lounge as owing to COVID the former wasn't available and the latter offered minimal food and dfrink.

We went to NYC to explore the city, see some shows, visit museums, and just experience life in this vibrant city.  The Hotel Elysee was a perfect home base.  The midtown location is convenient to so much.  We were able to walk to most places, and those that we couldn't were just a quick (and easy) subway ride away.  Breakfast at the hotel was a great way to start each day.  We weren't always back in the evenings on time for the wine reception, but when we were, it was a welcome treat.\n     We booked the King Grand Suite so that we could spread out a little.  It was really an astonishing amount of room for a hotel in NYC.  With two teenagers, we have passed the point of being able to squish everyone into a room with two beds.  This suite allowed everyone to have room (one child slept on the pullout sofa, the other made a nest on the floor with sofa cushions, sheets, and a blanket - it actually worked great).  We had considered just getting two rooms for our family, but after a lot of looking, this was, by far, the most economical way to stay in the heart of it all - without sacrificing quality.  The hotel is great and the service is top notch.  \n     There is a little wear and tear starting to show, which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.  It was nothing major, and it honestly didn't bother us in the slightest.  The positives far outweigh the negatives here.

I had a suite facing the courtyard. Big rooms. Quiet. Dated furniture (especially the TV stands, designed for a big old TV set) which takes a lot of space. Bathroom connected to the bedroom with no separate access from the living room. Bathroom amenities for one person instead of two. Setting the proper water temperature was not easy. The suit had a glass-covered terrace, with untransparent glass. An extra room, though. The breakfast was typical French, continental, but with lots of food. Fantastic location (shops, restaurants, museums, transport). Polite and well-trained staff. Two times less expensive than any other place of that quality.

To see the same faces year after year is somewhat comforting and gives an indication that the staff are cared for as much as the guests. To walk into the lounge for breakfast and not only to be remembered but also the type of milk that you have on your cereal is a good indication of the service that prevails throughout the hotel.I know it\u2019s a separate entity but having the Monkey Bar and Monkey Bar Restaurant next door just adds to the whole enjoyment of this Hotel and I look forward to returning in the not too distant future","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It is in a great location-you cannot do better! Everything was excellent-the room was in good condition and updated considering the age of the hotel.The room was clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast and afternoon wine and appetizers were a real plus! The only negative was the noise from the street-we were on the 7th floor and every morning between 4:30 and 5:00 AM were woken up by trash pick-up and many large trucks making deliveries to the various buildings. We could have stayed in the back side of the hotel but the rooms face another building and they  are very dark. I believe that the problem could be solved by replacing the windows on the street side with double pane glass. I noticed that when were were downstairs in the breakfast library, it was very quiet even though it was facing the street. It did have double pane windows. Aside from this problem, we very much enjoyed our stay and would absolutely recommend the hotel.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon arriving an hour passed check-in time, we found our room not ready. They had forgotten to make it \"feather-free\" even though I reminded them numerous times. When we went up to the room the housekeeping person was finishing up the room and had not only left the feather pillows in the room but sprayed the room with a room refresher that caused me to have a horrible reaction. I needed to move to the hallway and my daughter called the front desk to ask for another room. They moved us quickly to the next room on a lower floor and we found the room filled with feather pillows and a feather pillow top on the mattress. We decided to give the housekeeping time to fix the room and went to dinner, pleading with them NOT to spray the room. Once we returned, the room was okay and I was able to exist in the space. So rough beginning but we were okay after that. Without the mattress cover, the mattress was hard but manageable.

So much to do and see. I am also a huge theater  lover. \n\nSide note - 10 years ago the plan was NYC for my fiftieth . I had never been before  and was so excited to go...unfortunately breast cancer had other plans for me . My surgery was booked for August so no 50 celebrations for me ....my husband took me a week before surgery to get my mind off of what was to come. Needless to say that trip was a blur of fear and tears. Every year after that for about 5 years I took my daughter with me and we celebrated with shopping and Broadway. My husband not a fan of the Theater or shopping . \n\nMy dream was to see Hamilton but back when it opened you needed a second mortgage to see it . My husband also arranged this as a part of my birthday surprise, but I digress onto Hotel Elysee !\n \nWe arrived mid afternoon. Upon arrival first impression a step back in time . Room is ready - I ask if it is a room not facing the street -it is so asked to be changed to a room with less street noise (not my first time here) . \n\nWe open the door and uggh nope. OK typical big city room small but I've been here before and the smallest room I have ever seen in NYC. A quick call down stairs and we are moved to a suite $50 more a night. We do enjoy a smaller hotel boutique style . I found hotel Elysee very dated tired  probably last refurbished in the 80s would be my guess.\n\nRoom \/Suite\n\nVERY spacious living area- furniture has seen better days   ,large bedroom,-hard bed ,  hallway to large bathroom - so biggest  room I have stayed at in NYC ! \n\nMy daughter and I have stayed at The Kimpton properties in years past The MUSE and 70 Park Ave ( which is now the Iberostar) the reason I mention this is the Wine hour they provide  to compared to hotel Elysee.  Elysee wins big here it is more than 1 hour and the wines much nicer than at the Kimpton. The cheese plates and other items  beat out the Kimpton properties as well. It has the same premise meet other guests if you so wish. It is held in a large private room on the second floor,  not the hotel lobby where The Kimptons host their wine hour and  seating is limited...Elysee offers red ,white, and prosecco .  Breakfast is served here as well enjoyed this before setting off for the day. Nothing beats a NYC bagel IMO.\n\nWe had some cocktails at the famous Monkey bar and the late night pianist was wonderful again felt like I stepped back in time .\n\nThe staff wonderful -  but no one asked if it was a special occasion ...it was\n\nWould I stay here again probably not too many choices in NYC.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Not pleasant at all & no accommodations were offered... no apologies... a complimentary drink at the bar perhaps? - no. The location is good- short walk to E, 6, 4 & 5. The shower was hot- no unexpected fluctuating water temperatures & good water pressure. WiFi was spotty. Monkey Bar was crowded, but good atmosphere & good drinks.

These things happen and normally we would understand, however we feel we were misled about the situation.  On checking in we were informed the \u201cThe main lift not available today due to maintenance\u201d.  Clearly the lift had been out of order days before we arrived and from responses to other reviews from the management, it was known the lift was going to be out of order for some time.  Each day when we asked when the lift was going to be working, we were given vague responses.  The reason for our daily inquires was because a large part of going to\/from our rooms was either long waits for the service lift or walking up\/down seven floors. If we had an honest response that a part was being manufactured, we would have been more tolerant with the situation.  At times we had to squeeze into the service lift along domestic staff and clear plastic bags of rubbish and bedding from rooms, it was either that or an extended wait for the lift to return.  The lift and domestic staff were excellent and steadfast in adversity and a credit to the hotel. \n\nThe rooms were a good size and very clean, however d\u00e9cor was drab and needs to be brought up to date.  The Air conditioning in the room was efficient but extremely noisy, for that reason we turned it off before sleeping and therefore we had less than comfortable nights due to the heat.  On three of the nights the guests in the room next door had showers after midnight which of course they are entitled to do, however the noise from the water flowing through the pipes woke us up as it was really noisy and we didn\u2019t sleep until the shower was turned off.  \n\nThe lounge on floor two was disappointing, it was too small for the number of guests, we only sat together at half of our six breakfasts as there were no tables for four available.  The continental breakfast was ok but not great.  If you drink wine or fizz the evening drinks included in the resort fee of $25 was great and enjoyed by my wife, I do not drink wine\/fizz and therefore asked for a beer knowing that I would have to pay as this wasn\u2019t included, however I was informed I would have to go to the Monkey Bar to collect myself.  Due to the lift issue this was not a relaxing experience and considering I had to go myself is not great customer service. \n\nOn three of our six days the Monkey bar and restaurant was closed due to the holiday.  We were not informed of this at check-in and it was not displayed on the hotel website.  I discovered this on night two after we went to the lounge, my wife had a glass of fizz and I went to the Monkey bar to get a beer to join her.  Obviously disappointed I went to reception who directed me to the local shop!  In my opinion this is unacceptable for a hotel that boasts a bar and restaurant onsite, especially as it provides room service which was also unavailable for the three days.\n\nWi-fi in our room was excellent, however in our teenagers\u2019 room it kept failing resulting in lots of complaining as anyone with teenagers would understand.  In the lounge it was good in some areas and poor in others.\n\nOn a positive note the location of the hotel is great and within walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, theatre district and lots of shops and restaurants.  \n\nFinally, when we checked out, we were not asked how our stay was! I cannot think of another hotel we have visited that has failed to ask that question.\n\nI am sorry we do not recommend this hotel and won\u2019t stay there again.  I would like to make it clear that the adverse comments about the lift and bar\/restaurant would not have been made if the management had ensured the staff had informed us of the situation at check-in.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Overall, it has been a good stay, but I think it is dishonest of them to wait until after you've checked in to disclose that the elevator is not working. The elevator has been broken for about 3 weeks now and isn't expected to be fixed for another couple of weeks, so obviously they are well aware of the problem. But when you check in they tell you all about breakfast and other relevant issues, but wait until you are walking away from the front desk to go to your room before they say, \"oh by the way the elevator isn't working so you'll have to use the service elevator.\" The service  elevator is very small and hot and there is often quite a wait to use it because the staff needs it as well as the guests. And it is accessed through the back stairwell, so on the 13th floor we need to wait in a small area with the laundry and garbage. Plus, in violation of the city code, they keep the fire doors open which could present a real problem if there is a fire in the building. A second issue  is that I read on TripAdvisor that guests can use a gym nearby, but that is not something they tell guests about. And third, the internet is unreliable. The decor is traditional, but I have no problem with that. Do look at the visitor's photos of the rooms, however, and not those posted by the hotel. My room looks nothing like the photos shown by the hotel on TripAdvisor.

The price was high, but I was confident and excited because the hotel has good reviews and was part of the Library Hotel Collection.  What we received was shockingly disappointing.  \n\nFirst, the hotel\u2019s elevator was out for the entire stay - a fact that should have been disclosed to us before we checked in. We were forced to use the hotel\u2019s ancient freight elevator, which was slow, ugly, hot and usually unavailable because it was (predictably) full of staff or repair people.  The entire process of entering and leaving the hotel was constantly difficult and unpleasant.\n\nSecond, the hotel\u2019s restaurant and bar, which are the basis of many of the good reviews, failed to open for three of the five days and closed early the other days, so there were no facilities of any kind available for much of the stay. A hotel without a restaurant, bar or fitness center is not a first rate hotel.\n\nThird, the rooms themselves, along with the entire hotel, are frankly tired looking and obsolete (very few electrical outlets; slow and inconsistent WiFi).  I expected a more attractive and business-friendly facility.  \n\nFinally, while the staff was mostly friendly, the management was indifferent to the fact that the hotel was operating at such a poor level for us.  It offered no meaningful accommodations.  \n\nThe Library Collection should be embarrassed to have this facility as one if its signature hotels.

We choose based on location and tripadvisor reviews. \n\nWe were traveling as a couple, for leisure for 5 days. Important to us are service, comfort, quality and price. \n\nWe booked the grande king suite which had a beautiful large sitting area, separate bedroom with king bed and bathroom with shower, tub and two sinks. Also there was a small kitchenette area. \n\nThis hotel caters to a demographic that appears to be 50+, mostly couples, repeat clientele travelling for leisure. \n\nExcellent touches:  breakfast is included. Although mostly carbs (bagels, pastries and cereals), there is some fruit, yogurt and eggs for protein available. \n\nHappy hour every evening:  wine is included as well as cheese, olives and crackers.  The best part of this is that it creates conversation and connection amongst the guests and also with the staff. I noted that the staff greeted many of the return guests with smiles and warm hugs. \n\nIncludes:  bottled water, turn down service\n\nCheckin:  quick and seamless and the team has excellent memories. They were quick and efficient with any request or inquiry. \n\nCleanliness:  rooms are clean, but you do notice what doesn\u2019t get cleaned regularity for example, make up mirror was full of fingerprints. \n\nBeds:  I found the bed extremely hard as well as the pillows ridiculously soft.  There is a room menu that includes extras like different pillows, ear plugs (and it is noisy all night long) and feather bed toppers.  Although we requested both the bed topper and new pillows (originals were floppy messes), it didn\u2019t improve the situation much. \n\nOpportunities for improvement:  change up the continental breakfast and happy hour every few days. It becomes repetitive and boring very quickly. A pianist on the weekends might be a nice touch too. \n\nThrow away those pillows and invest in a decent pillow menu selection. Same with the. Toppers. Maybe invest in some foam ones and feather. \n\nWould we stay again?  Yes. None of my issues are deal breakers.

Very nice to start the day with a freshly prepared continental breakfast of fruit, yogurt, a variety of breads and bagels, juice and excellent coffee.  The staff in the 2nd floor lounge is very customer service oriented and helpful.  Our room, while not large, was comfortable and well-appointed, with nice closet which included robes and slippers. These came in handy as our only complaint is that the bathroom was always cold, even when we left the door open to the bedroom.  Not sure if the window or an exhaust vent were the problem. It would have been helpful to have a heat lamp or small wall heater in the bathroom. (It was extremely cold in NYC during our visit, that could have been the problem!), The Elysee evokes the atmosphere of the charming European boutique hotels which my husband and I enjoy so much..

If for whatever reason you require more standardized accommodations when you travel, you would be better served sticking with one of the more generic, large hotel chains. As to the Hotel Elysee itself, it offers an excellent location in NYC on E. 54th between Madison and Park with a good selection of fine restaurants and other services in the immediate vicinity. There is an interesting variety of room types available so choose carefully when you book. My Junior Suite was very generously proportioned and featured an ornamental fireplace.The club room on the second floor, where the included continental breakfast is served, has large windows overlooking the street below, is well furnished, comfortable, and offers a great perch for people watching.

The hotel was nice but I've got to believe there are more than seven hotels in the city that are better.  We were in a suite on the back of the hotel on the 8th floor.  It was spacious (the size of two regular rooms) and very comfortable, though it's starting to appear a bit worn.  If you're over 60 the d\u00e9cor will remind you of your grandmother's house.  The bathroom was fairly well lit but no exhaust fan, no fog free mirror, no heated floor, no soft close toilet seat and minimal room for toiletries.  The tub\/shower combo had an old fashioned shower curtain and no hand-held sprayer.  The towels were regular size but very thick.  The bed was king size and comfortable.  We had to order other pillows as the ones in the room were too soft for side sleepers.  There were two closets with plenty of room for clothes storage (in the closets and in drawers).  The floors in the suite creaked as we walked on them.  There were separate HVAC controls for each room of the suite - a very nice touch.  The breakfast is on the minimal side and it can be very crowded in the relatively small lounge.  There is a happy hour in that same space every evening with complementary wine and light snacks.  The lounge is open 24\/7 with coffee, tea, fruit and cookies (no coffee service in the suite).  We didn't need anything from the front desk, so I can't comment on service other than our pillows and ice one time.  Photos are attached.\n\nThanks for reading.

We booked two rooms, one with two beds and one with a king.  The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to 5th Avenue, Central Park, Times Square, Theatre, etc., but quiet and far enough away from the Times Square madness.  This was the first time we had stayed a more \"boutique\" type hotel and really noticed a difference in the level of attentiveness and detail.  It's a smaller hotel, but as a result, you're greeted whenever you enter or leave, the staff know who you are, which is nice.Breakfast is included and it is the same everyday - hard boiled eggs, fruit, cereals, bread, pastries, instant oatmeal.  It is fresh and enough to get you going.  Valet parking is $30\/day which is very reasonable.The room with the two beds somehow felt more spacious, and had a tub.  The king only had a shower.  Both were super quiet at night which is great for a light sleeper like me.  A great stay, and we'll be back!","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When I\u2019m traveling with my wife and kids, I\u2019m also looking for enough space such that we\u2019re all comfortable.  My recent stay at the Hotel Elysee checked all the boxes.  The location at 54th just off Madison is central to much of Manhattan.  As recommended by some reviews, I asked for a room at the back of the building and the room had no street noise - you could hear the building air conditioning units a bit but that was a less offensive white noise.  The room was clean and we booked a 1 bedroom suite for about the same price as a regular room in Manhattan ($329).  It came with a good sized pull-out sofa and a separate bedroom with a King-size bed.  Plenty of room for all.  While the value of the room was good, it was the lack of penny pinching so prevalent at many hotels that was particularly appreciated.  They had two complimentary bottles of water in the room.  There was a \u201cthank you\u201d brownie with a business card from the manager wishing a pleasant stay.  WiFi was included and even the valet was extremely reasonable - $30 per 24 hours is very fair.  It\u2019s little things like that, along with the excellent service of all staff members we encountered, which means we\u2019ll come back again.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This almost boutique-style hotel is small by Midtown mega-hotel standards, but that absolutely works to its favor. The location, a half block east of Madison on 54th, is close to everything, but perfectly far enough away from the more crowded Midtown craziness. To a person,all management and staff were professional, friendly, and helpful. Our Grand King Suite on front side of hotel was spacious, quiet, and very clean. The bath was older-hotel small, but was efficient and nicely finished with marble. In general, the room and furnishings could use a refresh, but certainly fine for this price point, and the bed very comfortable.\nRegarding value, there is much to like here. Daily continental breakfast, and evening wine and cheese are served in the cozy second floor Club room with large windows overlooking 54th St, all included with the room charge, plus the hotel does not tack on any of those annoying resort fees, unlike so many other hotels. Valet parking is a Midtown hotel bargain at $30 per day.\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Elysee, and would certainly choose it again when staying in Midtown.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"NONE"}

It became clear from other reviews and our own experience that whether you will like your stay here depends largely on which rooms you get, and unfortunately we align with the despondent ones. Our only saving grace was that we were hardly there, having a full schedule that took us away all day and much of each evening but the issues we noted were unacceptable. The double bedroom was just adequate but had some shabby worn furnishings and a bathroom with no free shelving for belongings. Also irksome was that aggressive bar fridge notice which scared us off ever touching anything in there and oh yes, that used shampoo bottle left by a previous guest in a corner of the shower which stayed there throughout. The other, twin bedded, room on a different floor seemed to be haunted by extremely noisy housekeeping staff in the corridors whose walkie talkies echoed for intense periods, and there was one occasion when a \u2018supervisor housekeeper\u2019 woman barged in without knocking and then left without apology. Shame that didn\u2019t coincide with the time when we slid one of the single beds aside to look for a dropped piece of jewellery and ... well, suffice to say we regretted looking under that bed. Don\u2019t want to hear that we should have faced the hassle of reporting any of this; a hotel of this long-standing should have monitoring systems in place. We allocate 2 stars  because the guest lounge looked lovely and the waitstaff there very welcoming, however we never got to have breakfast there because there were no spare chairs and so we gave up and started our days at a great little coffee shop just down the street. Front desk staff were ok, though they didn\u2019t manage the occurrence of a mysterious extra charge at checkout very well.  We were told \u2018don\u2019t know, it\u2019s after hours\u2019 so we let it go as we had a plane to catch and we just wanted to leave.

The Elysee had been recommended to me a couple of years ago and we finally had a chance to try it out.\n\nFrom the moment we pulled up in front of hotel we were met with kindness and professionalism.  The Doormen, Front Desk Staff and Bellmen were friendly and took pride in the hotel.  The rooms are beautifully appointed with colors and fabrics you would expect to see in Provence.  They are not large but by no means small.\n\nThe wine and cheese reception in the 2nd floor lounge was a nice treat and a great place to meet our friends before dinner.  The continental breakfast blew us away!  There is so much to choose from that we could have eaten there every morning and not been bored.  This brings me to the staff of the lounge which were all friendly, busy bussing tables and greeting guests.  I want to make sure I give them a shout out.\n\nThe reason I gave the hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because our room which was supposed to be handicap accessible, and was, but missed in a couple of areas.  Now, before I continue,  there is a fully handicap accessible room with a roll-in shower but it was taken when I booked our stay.  They have another room with a tub but it has grab bars by the toilet and being we were staying for 1 night only I booked it.  The problem with the room are the marble thresholds at the entrance to the room and entrance to the bathroom.  If these were removed the room would be easier to use for someone in a wheelchair.  Also, I suggest the hotel check the mattress which is sunken in the middle.  None of this will stop us from staying here again.  I will make sure I book when the handicap accessible room is available.\n\nOne more thing.  I mentioned we would be celebrating our wedding anniversary when I booked and when we got to our room there was a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates from the hotel.  What a nice touch.  Please try this lovely hotel when you are in NYC.\n","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Our stay was only two nights because we had flown in just to see Hamilton. Check in was very easy, and we were greeted in our room by bottled water, chocolate, and a box of yummy cookies. Our room was a corner room with two windows, which I enjoyed for the view of the street. The first night we were awoken by loud street noise around 2 am, but using a sound machine app on my phone fixed that issue. The room was small, but big enough for our needs, and I appreciated the historic feeling and antique furniture. The bathroom was quite lovely and was well stocked with necessities and soft towels. \n\nThe second day had a few hiccups. We were on the 4th floor and awoke to a broken elevator. After walking down for breakfast in the club room, we were offered use of the freight elevator. This elevator issue persisted the rest of our stay. Not a huge deal, but we chose to take the stairs most times because the freight elevator was overtaxed and slow. After a lovely day walking around Manhattan, we returned for a quick shower to refresh before dinner and found no hot water at all!  We called down and were told someone would check on it, but we had an hour to get ready for dinner and we\u2019re unable to shower during that time.  By the time we returned to our room around midnight after an evening of karaoke, we had hot water again. \n\nOne of the biggest draws in booking this hotel for us was the breakfast and afternoon reception offered in the Club Room. We enjoyed this aspect very much. My husband and I were both able to find something to eat in the morning, from boiled eggs to fruit to pastries and hot coffee. The afternoon reception was also lovely, with several wine options and a fantastic cheese platter with other accompaniments. \n\nOverall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again and recommend it to our friends!","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is ideal \u2013 we were able to easily walk to a show on Broadway, restaurants, shopping, Central Park, etc. Every morning for breakfast there was an array of cereals, muffins, breads, hard-boiled eggs, coffees, juices and fruit.  We enjoyed the wine and cheese offerings in the evening. The staff was so attentive and helpful. If we needed anything, it was brought to the room quickly. The furnishings are charming and there is a large and comfortable common area where the food is laid out that overlooks the street. I know hotels can\u2019t pick their guests, but we really enjoyed chatting with other lodgers during the breakfast and wine time!  In all aspects, our stay was a most pleasant experience. Yes, the bathroom was small \u2013 but then it is an old hotel \u2013 and I had read other reviews so I wasn\u2019t surprised. The Monkey Bar is located in the hotel (FYI \u2013 not open Sunday night) and is a nifty restaurant and also has a bar area!

Stayed for a long weekend. Our room had 2 beds, facing the street. I believe on either the 2nd or 3rd floor\u2014can't recall. While others have commented on street noise, that didn't bother us as we are used to the city.  The room is small but more than adequate for NYC. The decor is dated and worn. They offer a carb breakfast (good coffee) and ok wine\/cheese in the evenings which we took advantage of a couple of nights. Me (in my 50s) and my son (in his 20s) were definitely the youngest guests there. There is ample room in their lounge and, with the older crowd, it was very quiet\u2014almost too quiet actually as we felt we should whisper.  The attached Monkey Bar offers excellent cocktails (albeit pricey)\u2014again older crowd. The employees working in their breakfast and lounge area were delightful. The location is within easy walking distance of MoMA, Central Park and the Theater District (albeit the weather was good while we were there).  The reason this hotel gives me reason to pause returning are: 2 doormen\/3 people working the front desk and none of them were friendly or helpful. I had to ask for the internet password, ask for the MoMa passes which were included with the reservation, ask where their library\/lounge was located and ask how to get to my room. I arrived at 3:10 pm, no-one was busy and was told my room was not ready.  That was annoying since check-in said 3 pm and I had been at airports since 4:30 am. I patiently waited in their empty lounge (after asking how to get there). No further contact until I called the front desk and was told my room had \"engineering problems.\" I had to ask when those would be resolved and the answer was that they did not know but were working on it. Close to 4 pm, a gentleman came and said I was being changed to another room and hoped it was okay.  Since I didn't see the first room, I can't compare and I was so happy to get a room that we just stayed there, which was fine.  Around 5 pm, the manager came to the room with cookies, a bottle of wine and a nice smile to apologize for the inconvenience.  He was the 1st one to do so as the front desk had not.  The Elysee asks for full payment at booking, I realize that this is common amongst smaller hotels but, since it does that, maybe employees working the front desk don't think about smiling or being attentive to their guests. Saying \"good morning\"and not frowning when a guest asks you for a paper receipt would also be nice. There are better options for the price. And, usually there is something else going on behind the frowns.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We found the staff to be universally pleasant, from the front desk to the housekeepers. There are, however, basic features that one expects from any hotel in the 21st century that were missing from our room.  I don't know if other rooms are better.  There were very few electrical outlets in the room, so I had to crawl under the desk to find one (only one outlet) to charge my phone. There were two of us and we could not both charge our phones at the same time.  Forget about charging my laptop.  Please do not tell me I could have asked for an extension cord--I should not have to.  There was very little space in the bathroom to put one's cosmetics.  The shower had neither a non-slip surface nor a grab bar so was a safety hazard. The beds were rock hard and very bad for my friend, who has severe arthritis.  The hotel staff tried to remedy it with foam pads, but nothing helped.  The fact that they offer pads indicates that they know the beds are too hard.  As a result we are leaving a night early.

The location (54th Street between Madison and Park) is among the best you can hope for visiting Manhattan; stops for the subway\u2019s green line are on Lexington at 51st & 59th Streets, which is not really far either way. The only disadvantage is that the departure of the LaGuardia shuttle is a few steps away from Grand Central Terminal, and this makes the Library Hotel more convenient if you choose this mode of transportation. On the other hand, a cab ride from the Elysee is just a few dollars more than the shuttle for two people.\n\nThe continental breakfast and the complimentary wine and cheese at the end of the day plus the availability of coffee, tea, and cookies anytime are very good reasons to choose a hotel from the Library Collection. Being able to sit down comfortably with tea and cookies when returning from a concert or the opera is a nice way to end a day in New York. Our room was very comfortable, though the air conditioning unit\u2019s blower makes a noise that would be more appropriate in an industrial setting. I wish the hotel (all hotels) would install silent units. The card listing the hotel\u2019s amenities mentioned that ear plugs were available, but I forgot to ask and ended up setting the unit so that it would not start too often. The rates are not modest but decent for such a hotel in Manhattan during the weekends, when business people are gone, but rise dramatically for weekdays. The free wifi is very efficient, with no nagging screen or registration before being online; only once in a while did pages take time loading. More space to put bottles, tubes, etc., in the bathroom would be appreciated, but it may be difficult to do more in such small spaces.\n\nWe cannot consider going to New York and stay elsewhere than in a Library Collection hotel. Though we might try the Casablanca next time, we would return to the Elysee anytime. As with cruise ships, staying in a boutique hotel with hardly more than one hundred rooms is so much nicer than in those gigantic hotels with lots of amenities but little personality.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room felt clean and the amenities of continental breakfast and happy hour on the second floor were a lovely touch. \n\nThe decor is a little olde-world, but that adds to the charm. We did experience some inconvenience with the lifts when they were out of order, a couple of times, but there was a service lift as backup.\n\nWe spent a good amount of time walking around the city so some nights all we wanted to do was get a takeaway pizza and eat it in our room, which was something they could arrange and put on our bill no problem. We arranged for the love package and thought the roses (the most beautiful long stemmed red roses) champagne and chocolates were good value. The whole experience was seemless; from the pickup at the airport, check in, room delivery\/service, happy hour and check out, nothing was a bother. Location was great, you can walk to Central Park, great bagel shop around the corner (Essa bagels) plus a short walk to the shopping areas and bars if you like that sort of thing.

They have a great selection of cheeses, crudit\u00e9s, crackers, bread, nuts, and unlimited wine and prosecco. Plus cookies and fruit. We ended up having that as our dinner.

So, I hadn't used a hotel for years. I went online and this place looked like the kind of place I wouldn't expect to find in the city: small, charming, including continental breakfast, wine and cheese at 5, and fresh fruit, cookies, tea and coffee available all hours, in their lovely club room. This is for ALL guests. You don't have to stay at a certain priced room.\n\nSo, my taxi pulled up and a lovely person opened the door of the taxi for me and took my bags. Another opened the door to the hotel and welcomed me. The lobby is small but pleasant. The front desk is populated with young, professional, warm, great people ! (Their parents should be proud of them !!)\n\nI had asked for a quiet room. I went up and was immediately struck by the route to the inner part of my room after I got in the door. You know the long, continuous shot in Goodfellas where Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco are going through the kitchen to the front of the nightclub??? Well, I had this dramatic little winding hallway to get to my room, which was SO PRETTY, SO CHARMING! Not tiny, a perfect size. It was so tasteful , looked fresh. The bathroom was also great. There was plenty of storage and 2 bottles of water provided as needed, and a lovely chocolate bar with them.\n\nThe view was nonexistent, I faced walls and other big tanks or whatever they were, but it was QUIET, which was the most important thing to me.\n\nThey also have a lot of things that are available beyond a forgotten toothbrush: Sound machines to block noise, special pillows, eye masks, I mean it was crazy what they had ! I asked for a sound machine only because my room was right next to the elevator. Up it came and worked perfectly.\n\nThe staff could NOT have been better, from the front desk to bell persons, to the charming women that were responsible for the club room.\n\nI felt seen and acknowledged and appreciated. When was the last time you felt that way about anything ?????!!!\n\nI'm so grateful for the decision I made.

That's why we keep going back.  If you are not fond of the big hotels and\/or chains and would like something with some character and impeccable service - look no further.  From the moment you arrive, you feel like you \"belong\".  Everyone greets you with a smile and nothing is too much to ask.  Each room is unique (no cookie cutter here) and actually they differ quite a bit.  If you call the hotel directly to make your reservation, let them know what appeals to you and they will be most willing to accomodate you.  Breakfast is included AND the happy hour which begins at 5PM (they serve wine, cheese & light snacks) is always a fun way to start the evening.\n\nI cannot thank the staff at the Elysee for giving me the experience of the lifetime during our recent trip to NYC.

We wanted to be close to the Theater District, but in an area that is a little quieter. \nWhen looking for a hotel, I was impressed by the excellent traveler reviews, especially with the reports of hospitality. I\u2019ve lived in NYC and visited many times, but this is my new favorite place to stay. The Hotel Elysee exceeded my expections!\nFrom the moment you pull up to the front door till the moment the staff help you load your car, everyone was genuinely nice and helpful. The manager checked on us and gave us a complimentary bottle of wine. We felt like VIPs!\nThe rooms are classic, but have nice, modern bathrooms. And they are roomy, a rare find in NY. My husband and I could have easily shared 1 room with our boys, (but it was nice to have some privacy). The beds and furniture are comfortable and we had a large closet. There was plenty of room for our things. And we had a nice patio which we would have enjoyed if the weather had been better. If I had a kitchen, I could have lived here!\nThe continental breakfast was a big positive. It was great to roll out of bed to good coffee, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, good pastries, etc. Although it is buffet style, the staff will make you specialty coffee drinks and is attentive with clearing plates, etc. The only slight negative was that it is sometimes difficult to find seating for your whole group. My husband and I split up one morning and sat with a very pleasant and interesting couple from England. I enjoyed our conversation, so that worked out well. \nThe happy hour was enjoyable and allowed us to have a snack before our shows, so we could have a late dinner.  \nEven at this high level of service and with these perks, the room prices were about average and parking reasonably priced. \nIn summary, this place was terrific! I just hope that it doesn\u2019t get too popular, so we\u2019ll be able to stay here again!","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We arrived a little earlier than checkin from a long oversees flight and they managed to accommodate us.   They also helped with tips and recommendations.\nThe room was large for NY standards and cozy in French decor.  Water was complimentary and a bottle of wine was also waiting for us.  Super for husband that was able to enjoy it.. I had to watch.  \nWe had to ask for coffee maker.  If there is any room for improvement I would suggest getting new Coffe makers and leaving them in the rooms.  I would also suggest new larger tubs in the bathroom.  The current ones are shallow.  Room service was always around to make sure we were taken care of \u2764\ufe0f.\nComplimentary Breakfast is simple but very well prepared and just enough to get you going for the day.  The girls at breakfast are suuuper friendly and helpful.  It was a joyful moment to have breakfast every morning.  The only issues is that seating is limited and it can get crowded.\nThere is coffee and cookies all day around.  Major bonus since their coffee is delicious.  \nIn the evening there is a happy hour with drinks and cheese.  Again, husband was very happy and was able to enjoy the complimentary wine.\nTo top it off, the hotel bar, the Monkey bar, is a great place to spend the evening.  \nIn sum! We were super happy with our choice and just found our new favorite place to stay in NY.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Hotel Elysee location was very convenient for me on this trip.  I was able to walk to Central Park, dinner and a Broadway show (off West 44th) and Bloomingdale's.  It took me 45 minutes by Uber at 3pm in the afternoon on a Thursday to get from Newark airport to the hotel (call it luck or timing as some folks said it would take 2 hours).  Front desk check-in was quick and the staff friendly. Dropped off my suitcase, went down to the 2nd floor to enjoy the wine and cheese \"happy hour\" offered by the hotel, got another Uber and 20 minutes later was sitting with my son (NYU law student) at a contemporary Korean restaurant in the East Village. I came back to the hotel and had a cup of tea and some cookies, also on the second floor.  I stayed in a suite and it was gigantic except for the bathroom which was a bit cramped but comfortable. I really enjoyed the small details like bottled water, a bar of Leonidas chocolate, hotel stationary and a card wishing me happy birthday.  The room feels and looks old European.  I was fine with it but some people prefer a more modern look and feel.  The television sets definitely need to be upgraded but wifi was perfect. During breakfast (cheerful staff and decent variety of food, coffee\/tea, juice) I had a chance to see  guests staying at the hotel: majority were in their 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s.   If you are looking for a place to see and be seen, with a younger crowd, Hotel Elysee is not the place.  The front desk organized dinner reservations for a group of 6 at a local Italian restaurant, on a Saturday night and on short notice.  Very helpful and well done! Enjoyed a pastrami sandwich in Queens one day but traffic coming back to the hotel was horrible on a Sunday late afternoon (congestion getting on to the Williamsburg Bridge).  Overall,  I had a very good experience and think Hotel Elysee was great value for the money.  ","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Location is awesome on 54th between Madison and Park. Ideal for virtually everything midtown. Except sleep before midnight.\n\nI pre-paid for the room through Trip-Advisor and Agoda;  checked in at around 3:30 PM. At that time the very nice and pleasant hotel clerk checked me in and gave me a room on the THIRD floor. I asked for a room on a higher floor. \u201cSorry, we\u2019re sold out; that is the only room available.\u201d I went to the room, opened the door and found THE DARKEST HOTEL ROOM I\u2019VE EVER SEEN. Mind you, this was mid-day and the window shades were open. I stumbled around and found the lights, and managed to get them on. The room itself is fine, if dated a bit, just dark during the day without the lights turned on.\n\nThen I heard the street noise. I figured that it would subside by evening, and went downstairs to go to a mid-town meeting. That was about 4PM and I saw about four parties checking in...wonder if they got the third floor too? \n\nAfter a business dinner, I went to the Monkey Bar, inside the hotel. Very nice \u2014 great dessert, and great piano music that sounded like the soundtrack for a Woody Allen movie. Got back to my room around 11 and it was pretty quiet. Very, very comfortable bed. My room was next to a stairway, and noise from the stairs and from the street was easily heard.\n\nBathroom small but usable...great water pressure. They could do better by installing a shelf for toiletries.  Housekeeping did a great job...in and out of the room very quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe breakfast served in the hotel is very nice for a continental breakfast and includes all NY newspapers, rolls, coffee, fruit, etc. Served in a perfectly lovely room on the second floor. \n\nBesides meetings today outside of the hotel, I worked in the room and the street noise wasn\u2019t terrible. Went to dinner, came back and demolition was going on at the building on the other side of 54th street, resulting in ongoing LOUD noise from a trash truck processing the refuse. Doorman advises that it goes until approximately midnight. OUCH! I have a 6AM train. \n\nFront desk was very nice and offered ear plugs. The demolition isn\u2019t their fault...however, they gave me the noisiest room in the hotel because they could. Lesson learned...when you pre-pay, you\u2019ve got no leverage. Had I not pre-paid, and they had only offered me the third floor, I would have walked. I may give the Elysee a chance again, but not before getting assurance about room location. I wish I could record the noise I\u2019m currently hearing to share...you\u2019d understand much better.\n\nAgain, very nice staff. Awesome location. Good breakfast. Comfortable bed. Just wish they I hadn\u2019t drawn the short straw on room selection...aided by my prepayment!","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I am happy to say the hotel completely met our expectations again. \n\nWe were assigned side-by-side rooms on the quiet side of level 12. My wife and I had a room with large queen sized bed and sofa, and our daughters shared a larger sized room with two king single beds. \n\nThe hotel is only served by one lift for guests and we often experienced lengthy waits for the lift (by lengthy, I am talking 2 - 3 minutes maximum!). This was the only 'complaint'.\n\nWhat continues to set Hotel Elysee (and other Library collection hotels) apart from the rest is that generous breakfast is included in the room price, as are Hors d'oeuvres (wine, champagne, cheese, crackers, pretzels and vegetable crudit\u00e9s) from 5.00pm to 8.00pm. We made it a ritual to meet up on level 2 most nights for drinks and canap\u00e9s, before heading off to dinner. \n\nStaff at Hotel Elysee were always friendly and obliging. On a few occasions we sought assistance in securing restaurant bookings and the staff were only too willing to assist.\n\nAs my wife and I discovered five years ago, after a long day exploring NYC it was always a pleasure to return to the hotel at night. \n\nAcross the road from Hotel Elysee are three restaurants. We ate at two - Bills, and Cellini. On New year's eve we booked a table at the hotel's own iconic restaurant, the Monkey Bar. For those who may be interested, I discovered the Monkey Bar has featured in two TV shows, Sex in the City and Mad Men.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

But I fo very often to this place and it occurred to me (while waiting for this terrible Latam flight four hours delayed) that I had never evaluated it to TA. In fact, this is my favorite place to stay when I am at NY for business. Sometimes it can be very expensive, as Manhattan is always unpredictable. The place makes me feel at home. When I arrive early from meetings, around 6pm, they always have cheese and wine at the lounge in the second floor, adjacent to the library, and I love to do laptop work with a glass of wine. This is the same place were they serve breakfast, a very good buffet which is included in the room rate. The rooms are not very big, as the hotel is small, and for that reason, charming. You\u2019ve Monkeys Bar adjacent to the hotel, what is a very good choice to eat at night, when you are tired and alone.\nThe only negative are the elevators. They have only two for several floors and when the hotel is busy it can be stressing to wait. Other than that, if you want to avoid big-chain hotels and not pay a lot of money, this is the place to go.\nD.M.Pinho Neto","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The cost includes a sturdy buffet breakfast of high quality (with fresh cut fruit, fresh bagels and breads) cereals, yogurt and other standard items of a cold breakfast.\n2. The cost also includes, every late afternoon, a cocktail party featuring wine and a good selection of snacks. No one will deny you a second glass of wine if you want it.\n3. Those two features will enable you to cut down on other expenses of your stay (you need not eat three meals a day at expensive restaurants, nor need you inflate your costs by buying drinks at bars or restaurants). But these two features are not just a chance to eat but an opportunity to meet fellow travelers. The large \"club room\" has upholstered chairs and sofas, circular and rectangular glass-topped cocktail tables, and a few standard tables built just for eating meals. The wait staff was excellent at both breakfast and cocktail hour, and we never felt rushed to eat and run.You could bring your family into this room and sit around a large table, or enter it alone and sit at a cocktail table and find interesting and convivial guests to chat with. We were there during the week between Christmas and New Year's, and many guests had children and teens with them. It's a bit like a bread-and- breakfast in the middle of a great city rather than in the quiet countryside.\n4.The hotel is near high-end shopping and the superb museums arrayed along the east side of Central Park.\nThis is an older, small, comfortable place to stay, not a new harsh glass-and-steel behemoth. Its decor reflects the hotel's name. \nThe only drawback is that there is only one elevator, but that's certainly not a deal-breaker for this hotel.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}
