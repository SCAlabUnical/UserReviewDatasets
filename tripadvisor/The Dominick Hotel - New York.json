But we wanted to start branching out to other areas, and cam across this hotel in Soho.   We loved this location.  When you go outside, instead of the madness and crush of people in midtown, you get a totally different vibe with people walking their dogs, kids in strollers, low rise residences instead of skysrpaers, but still has TONS of great restaurants, bars, shopping, bakeries, etc.   10 minute uber ride and  your near Midtown,  10 minute uber ride the other way and your near the World Trade and City Hall.

First, this was my best friend\u2019s first time in NYC for her birthday trip. We thought we would splurge a little extra for this special occasion. When we first arrived a touch after 8pm on a Friday night, there was no doorman. No one to helped us out of our car, welcomed us, or offered to take our bags. We went to check in, and again, no bellhop, and no one at the front desk offered to call one down. So, we lugged our bags over to the elevators, which took approximately 20 minutes to arrive! When we unpacked, we looked around for somewhere to have a drink. I think it\u2019s important for guests to understand there is no \u201cbar\u201d, just a few restaurants that need reservations. \n\nThroughout our stay, we ordered a few complimentary items (pillows, blanket, dental kit). Only the pillows were delivered, the other items were ignored with no explanation.  We had also read there was a guest car service that could be used if our designation was within 2 miles. When we called down to reserve it for dinner, we were notified that the car service was out of service\/unavailable. \n\nWhen we went to check out, we waited 30+minutes for an elevator that wasn\u2019t sardine-packed with other guests trying to get to get to the lobby. We finally got on an elevator when someone suggested we cram in (even though the elevator was going up) because it was impossible to get on any other way. The elevator stopped on every floor, opening up to more distraught guests just trying to get down to the lobby to check out. I saw one woman opting to walk down almost 20 flights of stairs rather than wait. This is no way a \u201c5 star\u201d hotel. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this over-priced motel to my grade school bully. I can\u2019t wrap my mind around what this $45 a night designation covers other than straight up theft. I highly recommend looking for another place to stay.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Beginning at check-in where we were given an \"upgraded\" room so mediocre it made us question what their basic room features.  The noise begins outside your door from service people at about 6:30am.  By 8:30 they have knocked to clean your room.  Too early for vacationers and a weekend.  One sink in the bathroom too, meaning taking turns.  The shower door did not close and needed repair.  \nThe restaurant for breakfast is noisy, the food is pedestrian.  Although it was included, we didn't return.  \nThe pool is empty at this time of year, there is no meaningful service on the 7th floor terrace, and yet they assessed a \"resort fee\" which isn't divulged until checkout.  \nThe doormen said hello but were not interested in offering any assistance.  \nWe were tempted to check out and go elsewhere and should have.  Definitely not worth over $3500 for 3 nights for a small room with one sink in the bathroom.  Dreadful lighting, too.\nBeware.  NYC has so many fabulous hotels, there is no reason to stay here.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}
{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1456416,"title":"Great experience","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Service. It was exceptional. I had forgotten to pack a few items of clothing and ended up ordering them for curbside pickup at Bloomingdales hoping that our driver from LGA would stop for a pick up. He said it was too far out of the way so he couldn't. We asked the concierge at the Dominick for help. He offered a courier service to us at a very reasonable price. It turned out the concierge misunderstood that it was actually the Bloomingdales on Lex and not in Soho. No matter. A short while later, just as we were getting ready to head to dinner, the courier (a very helpful young lady) showed up at our door, looking exhausted, with my items. It truly saved me from stretching the limits of Le Bernadin's dress code that evening. The remainder of the weekend was emblematic of that experience. Breakfast room service was excellent and delivered precisely on time each morning. Anytime we needed anything--steamer, blow dryer, etc.--there was a knock on our door with the item in less than five minutes. The concierge, doormen, everyone were very eager to assist with anything we might need.\n\nHotel amenities. My wife and I used the fitness center. It is small with a limited number of machines. The machines are high end however and given that this is a boutique establishment I would imagine there rarely is a wait to use them. My wife got a facial and a massage at the Spa and said both were amazing.\n\nSome of the previous reviews talk about the furniture, interior design, etc. being somewhat jaded and dated. I suppose that could be true depending on what reservation class is booked. Our room on the 31st floor was very spacious with a great view. Furniture was beautiful and modern. Not dated at all. All aspects of the interior of the room were just as advertised on the hotel website. The only thing that I would point out is that while the commode room, which located in the bathroom next to the shower,  does have an opaque glass door to it, the bathroom as a whole is not separated in any way from the main room. Just FYI, in case that could be important to anyone.\n\nLocation is excellent. Walking distance to many shops and restaurants. If you're looking to travel to mid-town or further, it's not difficult to get a cab right away in front of the hotel. There is a subway stop a couple blocks away as well.\n\nOverall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Dominick. Some of those that left negative reviews mention that this is not a \"5 star\" hotel. The concept of 5 star vs 4 star is antiquated IMO. It's true that one's experience at a \"5 star\" NYC hotel that costs $2-3K a night might be better than one's experience at this hotel. That said, dollar for dollar, based on our experience, I believe it would difficult to find a better high end hotel in NYC.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This hotel's commitment to delivering genuine 5-star service has left an indelible mark on me. It all begins with the warm welcome from the bellhops, who seem to always remember you. Their kindness is truly remarkable. They always go the extra mile to making sure you have water after a long night out or searching for an umbrella, even when they think they\u2019re all gone, they\u2019re manage to find you one so you don\u2019t have to walk in the rain. \n\nAs I step up to the front desk, the staff's friendly and genuine greetings make me feel like an old friend returning. But it's not just the staff at the entrance that makes this place exceptional.\n\nThe housekeepers, who go above and beyond, have a way of making me feel like more than just a guest; they make me feel like family. They've turned what could be an ordinary hotel stay into something special, something that keeps me coming back. In my frequent trips to the city, I've experienced a wide range of 4 and 5-star hotels, but I can honestly say that the Dominick's service stands on its own, if not surpassing renowned establishments like the Ritz and the Four Seasons.\n\nI'm not one to leave reviews often, but when a place like the Dominick goes above and beyond, it's only right to acknowledge it. I genuinely look forward to returning here. It's more than just a hotel; it's a place where the staff has made me feel like part of their extended family. The kind of place where, over time, they remember you and ensure your stay is nothing short of extraordinary.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I ended up booking with Dominick because of the reviews on TripAdvisor. (I always feel that some of these reviews are highly inaccurate, so here's an unbiased review).\n\nLet's start with the good - perfect location (very near good restaurants and shopping areas, church, supermarket, drug store and most importantly the subway). Plus the fact that they had very good breakfast and very good in food dining.\n\nI loved the room and the fact that they didn't scrimp on amenities was almost the icing on the cake.\n\nUnfortunately, the bad superseded the good. We were assigned a connecting room. Beside me was a very rowdy woman and I don't know if it was a family or couple that was occupying that adjacent room. And their voice - it was like there was so much chaos occurring at 630 AM. I mean, there is nothing more irritating than paper thin walls. And this hotel has that.\nYou can even hear the trains running underneath from the 23rd floor (where we were staying). The cleaning ladies and crew were also busy knocking at the neighbors' doors and they were so noising that we even the sign outside the door of DO NOT DISTURB was disturbing. \n\nWhile our room was far from the elevator, the noise was imperceptibly a big turn off. It was sad that in spite of the pomp and beauty of the hotel, and its amenities and perks, the noise was irritating. \n\nEach time I attempted to pick up the phone to complain to the manger, the noise would subside. There was even a family that was fighting in the corridor with the young daughter being called a bitch by the mother! Imagine in the middle of the hallway, I could hear all the raucous. Seriously, this is a five star hotel? \n\nWould I return to this hotel? Maybe. Is it worth the price? Well, the rooms are big and the amenities are excellent. But I came for a vacation. Get some rest and enough sleep. The noise was not worth it.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I have never been treated so poorly for so much money.  It started before check in.  We had reserved 3 suites and multiple rooms for a wedding weekend.  I personally had reserved two of the suites and a room so I was paying a lot of money.  I requested that tow tables be brought to the suite for makeup and hair consultants.  I was told I would be charged 1500 dollars for that.  I was appalled.  I also asked about food delivery and told I could not have food delivered so I had to use their room service or catering.  We ordered a pot f coffee for 15 people.  An hour later, when it still hadn't arrived, we called down to inquire.  It finally arrived about 15 minutes later.  The charge was 140 dollars.  Are you kidding?  No bagel, no muffin, just coffee. I had wanted tea too but I was told it was 12 dollars per cup so i didn't order it.  That same Saturday morning, when I arrived at the suite, the bridesmaid, staying there showed me her pillow with a HUGE stain on it!  Disgusting!  And impossible to miss when changing sheets!  \nThe next morning I called for my car, gave my ticket number and a \"description\" of the car as requested.  I was told the ticket and description didn't match.  It was the description of my car and the ticket they gave me!  I went to the concierge who had the same response but was going to pursue it when my husband saw my car brought to the front.  I don't know how they figured it all out but we left.  My son was still waiting for our other car but since he had called at the same time and was not told of any issue, we assumed he's be right behind us.  one hour and twenty minutes later, the car was brough out.  Even the door man was appalled and kept inquiring and apologizing.  On Monday morning, I received the Dominick's standard survey regarding my stay and I assumed I would get a response from someone.  On Monday afternoon, I got an email from the person who had handles our group reservation and I shared the same feedback with her later that same day.  Yesterday, I received my notification from American Express regarding all the extra charges but to date, not a word back from anyone at the Dominick.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

And all of the plates, and debris still there in theiddle of the lounge. It suddenly clicked why the whole suite smelled a bit. They just weren't doing their jobs properly. I only ordered room service twice, and was let down twice. \n\nWhen I complained politely to the manager (apparently front desk weren't able to print a simple bill off for me to check the night before leaving .. I had to leave my kids and travel 44 floors down to speak to him personally and press the button).. he just said sorry, I'll feed it back. No comp, no discount next time.

There is a nice restaurant right off of the lobby and there is a great chill out area on the 7th floor with a small bar, ample seating inside and seats around a nice small pool, which was a big surprise. There are so many shops, places to see and nice restaurants near the hotel, that there is a lot to do !  I definitely will come back to this hotel on my next visit to NYC.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1456416,"title":"Beautiful hotel but beware of the bathroom","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-08-24","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We stayed 5-nights at this hotel. The Dominick was beautiful and the staff was very accommodating. Upon entering, the hotel smells wonderful and looks very elegant. It gave us a warm and inviting feeling immediately. The room was stylish, modern, spacious, and clean. The view was fairly nice of the city at night considering its location, and I loved the auto-open\/close feature of the curtains on the bedside table. The bed was large, extremely comfortable and soft. Overall, I gave it 4 stars and not 5 for a few reasons: (1) The shower was not designed with efficiency in mind and is a hazard, in my opinion. The showerhead is a wand that faced towards the door of the shower. When turned on, sprayed so hard, it would flood through the opening in the corners of the glass door and onto the marble floor. We had to put an abundance of towels down to soak up the water after every shower. Water on marble floor makes it incredibly slick, so it's as if you're ice skating barefoot if not soaked up immediately. It's a lawsuit waiting to happen. If you tried to turn the shower head left or right away from the door, it then sprayed onto the bottles of shampoo fixed into the wall or into the only two very small shelves (which held just two travel sized body washes and a washcloth). Of course, it still sprayed so hard, water would splash off of the shelf\/bottles that it would push water through the opening in the glass door onto the marble floor. There is also an overhead (straight above you) \"rain\" shower, but if you have long hair like me, you may not want it wet during every shower, and therefore, you must use the wand. (2) The ice bucket always had little particles in it but I believe it came from the ice machine\/ice. We switched out the bucket and refilled the ice a few times hoping to get clean ice but every time, it had brown particles in it. Don't use the ice in your drinks, but for chilling only. (3) The bedside lamps were broken. Not only were there pieces missing from both lamps but the lights sometimes would not turn on, and the outlet to charge your electronics was very worn and would not hold a charge for very long. (4) Other small inconveniences were that the room refrigerator was not cold at all and the couch was a little outdated. Lastly, it was my fianc\u00e9's birthday and I had ordered strawberries and champagne at booking to be delivered to the room. Unfortunately, it was never delivered because when they tried to deliver it, we had the DND sign on the door. There was not a note left on the door or another attempt as far as I know. When I inquired about it the following day, I was refunded for that cost and they also gave us a food and beverage comp for the restaurants\/bars at the hotel, which we were appreciative they did. My experience at this hotel, despite the few issues above was overall very nice! It was comfortable, upscale, and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to other guests but would certainly caution them about the bathroom floor.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our kids were both under 10 years old then and we selected this hotel because it was one of the few that had an outdoor pool.  This hotel was a brilliant find for us then and remains so now.  Back then we could all fit in a one bedroom suite.  The kids are in their late teens now, and so we have expanded to the SoHi 2 bedroom suite.   I think we've stayed at the Dominick about 6 or 7 times since 2012 -- we love NYC for a 3 to 5 day vacation from Ontario, Canada --  and have brought my parents with us twice.  We love this hotel, including its location, and will keep returning.  This time I did notice that it is becoming worn -  at least the suite that we were in (3010\/3011) which definitely needs a refresh.  The carpet has some stains, and the furniture\/cabinetry is looking a little banged up.    Still a lovely hotel with great service.  We also really liked the changes to the seating around the pool.

Arrival was as expected with the doormen and Eddie helping us with our luggage, both were great! \nThe check-in process was normal as usual, very nice welcome! After this is where it all went downhill. Upon arriving at our room, we noticed it was looking out into a brick building, really wish their website made it a point that if you weren't in a SoHi room, expect to get absolutely no view whatsoever. Obviously before we unpacked, we called down to see about getting a different room with a better view, they obliged with an upcharge of $150\/night which I did agree too. When we got to the new room, the view was stunning, overlooking the Hudson with a good view of the Freedom Tower.\nThe room was ok, nothing special and not the type of furnishings you\u2019d expect in a 5-star, but like I said we stayed there before and knew what we were getting. These rooms are all electronic, with curtains and lights able to be used with the touch of a button that\u2019s near the bed or a switch at the entry door. Well needless to say not one thing was working. Curtains wouldn\u2019t open or close nor would the lights come on. I managed to shut the curtains by pulling on them like Guest Services (1st time I was called by the wrong name) suggested I do. 5-star LOL!! After they were shut, they would not reopen so I again called down to Guest Services (2nd Time called by the wrong name and immediately after I asked them to correct it). They finally send up an engineer to work on the problem, now keep in mind that we were only in the room about \u00bd hour before I had to call down about it, one would think a 5-star hotel would ask if we\u2019d like a different room at this point (the hotel was nowhere near full)! The engineer arrives and manages to get the curtains open and rig it so they can be used manually, but he needed to get behind the bed to swap out a plug, at which point we decide just to have them come back when we weren\u2019t in the room. Another opportunity was lost to ask us if we\u2019d like a different room. \nAt this point, a little frustrated, we decided to go out to have a bite to eat and have a few drinks, we called down the concierge to get some recommendations, but the phone would just ring and no one would answer. We instead get guest services (3rd time being called by the wrong name) who states, the concierge must be busy or on the other line and asks if it would be alright if they call us back, which wasn\u2019t a problem, except they never called us back\u2026. even gave them our cell phone number. \nLater that evening we returned to the hotel about 11:15 PM with plans to have a drink at the Bar, their One Michelin star restaurant, the Vestry.  We were shocked to find out that they close the bar at 11PM on a Saturday night. Again, I do realize that we were there after close, but there were still people in the restaurant, one would think they\u2019d invite us in for a nightcap cocktail. We then asked the reception desk if there was another place in the hotel to grab a drink and we were informed that The Vestry is the only place at that time. Maybe they could have asked us if we wanted a bottle of champagne or wine sent up to the room, but nope! We soon returned to the room and called down for room service (4th time of being called by the wrong name) to order some dessert and some tea. We decided to order a hot fudge sundae with nuts, well we were told there\u2019s no nuts nor hot fudge, really in the middle of June at a 5-star hotel!!!\nThe next day we have some plans for the morning hours and then decide that it would be a nice day for the pool, the pool area is gorgeous and there aren\u2019t many hotels in the city which do offer a roof top pool. This is an extremely nice touch for a hotel in the city! Before going to the pool, we decided to call down guest services (5th time being called by the wrong name) and have them send the engineer up to fix what is wrong with the room, which they assured us would be fixed. Well after returning to the room from the pool, it was a great surprise to see that the room was made up but again the controls were still not working. I know the engineer was there, bc we crossed paths, but it never got fixed. \nNext day is check out day! We call down (again called by the wrong name) and ask for the bellman to come pick up our luggage and have the car ready. This all went well also, so I guess the only times this hotel is worth its $800\/night price tag is when you\u2019re arriving or leaving. If you plan to spend that much on a hotel, do yourself a favor and spend an extra $100 or so and stay at The Pierre or Trump International, much better maintained and very well-trained staff.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are huge compared to most in the city. \n\nCons: I had to switch rooms - in the first room the deadbolt lock didn\u2019t work as it was misaligned. I will admit the switching of rooms was very easy after maintenance said it couldn\u2019t be fixed. It was just a little bit annoying since it was late. The second room had stains on the floor - not a huge deal, but it would have been nice if the carpet was deep cleaned. \n\nMy main con at this hotel was the elevators. One of the elevators was sat at the lobby floor with the doors open so I went to walk. When walking in it the doors shut on me. They hit off my shoulders and hit my hand hurting me. I was initially in shock and felt like I was going to cry.  Then I realized my thumb was in a lot of pain. Surely, no elevator should do this? Especially not a guest elevator! I took advil for the pain and went down to the reception and asked for ice. They were initially more interested in logging it for their record than getting me ice. No one asked if I was okay. At check out the lady just printed my invoice off she didn\u2019t ask if I\u2019d had a nice stay or mention the incident either. \n\nMy thumb still has a lump on it that hurts if touched\/ knocked and I now hate going in elevators!! \n\nI would maybe stay here in the future.

Instead the guest is asked to pay $14.99 per day for a proper \"high Speed\" connection. The food and beverage in the breakfast room is monumentally overpriced and of average quality, hence the offer of a breakfast food credit to the value of approximately $100 per day.

I asked whether they had many folks stopping in and angling for a free breakfast ? Why would I make it up ;-)  So we were assigned a room, and told the breakfast scheme would be handled later. OK.

It was a breath of fresh air to be at The Dominick! Every person we encountered\u2014doormen, bellmen, front desk, bartender, housekeeping\u2014was really pleasant. We stayed in a Skyline two bedroom suit and it was nicely appointed, clean, and comfortable with great views. One thing that I LOVE is the complete guest control over the heat\/AC, so you can pick the temp that you prefer to be comfortable. The in room Nespresso is very convenient, and even the hair dryer is high performance. Linens are top notch, toiletries are Bulgari (same au th\u00e9 blanc as the Ritz). Water pressure is excellent, and the bathrooms are very nice. The beds are medium firmness and the pillows are very soft and thin, for people who care about such things. If you\u2019re allergic to dogs and asthmatic like me, this hotel is pet friendly but it\u2019s not overrun by dogs like Kimptons. It\u2019s NYC, so expect some noise; if honking car horns and yelling construction workers bug you, bring earplugs. My only complaint is that it\u2019s dimly lit and there is literally no good lighting for makeup application after dusk; the bathroom mirror is lit from the left side so it\u2019s hard to get direct light. I ended up going from room to room, lamp to lamp to see if I applied properly. If you wear makeup, bring a lighted mirror. The neighborhood can\u2019t be beat with tons of good restaurants right there. Overall, this is an excellent hotel, and if you\u2019re looking to ball out, the Skyline suites are beautiful. For us, this is now officially \u201cour\u201d hotel to which we will return for all our NYC trips. Many thanks to everyone at The Dominick\n for making our anniversary trip wonderful!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My previous stay was the Bellagio penthouse suite in October 2022, everything about the stay, service and amenities were superb. \nMy husband and I travel once a month for romantic getaways after 20 years of marriage, adult kids graduated and gone and my private practice is merely running itself. This is our time to create new memories for this phase of our life. First romantic trip of this year \u201cThe Dominick\u201d. \nUpon arrival this hotel appeared average; as follows the room which is suppose to be a suite is average ( basic). The only suite feature in this room is the private bar w\/private prices.  The alcohol featured doesn\u2019t reflect this room quality. My room doesn\u2019t even include wine glasses, you have to call room service to get it, and it takes at least 40 plus minutes. Cafe is closed, the large restaurant onsite closed and the other eatery on site is subpar and had no host. My burger is still saying moo on the nightstand. There are drawings on the bathroom wall ( looks like maintenance may have done the drawings). The bed isn\u2019t comfortable at all, the mattress is hard, it feels worn. The bedding given it is the dead of winter in NYC is inadequate. The price point is not commensurate with a 5 star\/diamond hotel. When I checked in late last night, I desired to check right out. My husband insists we stay given we paid in full at check in and he doesn\u2019t want to try trekking through NYC to find another room for one more day.  Next time we will not be selecting this establishment. Forbes allegedly named this as a fine establishment. Perhaps that distinction was bestowed in error. On the plus side the bathtub is very deep. There is a television on the wall of the bathroom ( not in the mirror). The doors use keys not your mobile device. The decor is dated inside the room. The door man from tonight did grab the door, he just stood there looking at us. The robes aren\u2019t plush and the slippers are none  descript . By far this hotel has been one of the worst hotels , for which I stayed in the last 10 years. Essentially this place isn\u2019t worth the money I paid in my opinion.  Upon evaluating perhaps it is the view I am paying for to look at the Hudson, as that is the only feature that is okay. I so wanted to love this place , as it was the reviews that drew us in.  I considered trying to reserve their penthouse or just switch rooms in the hotel. My spouse is a laid back individual, he recommended we just stay gone all day and return only to sleep. I am a person that travels for the hotel , food and theater. Essentially I am the person that spends more time in the room than out. My rooms are the vacation .  The reason I will spend $500 to $6000 a night is for the experience. Next go around here will be at The Beekman.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My birthday was amazing and I'm glad I spent it here. Let's dive in! From check in to check out my experience here was seamless. I had the pleasure of checkin in with Marlene and Cassandra at the front desk who were both amazing and pleasant. I had an issue with my room key on my second night and that was easily remedied with no hassle.  I had my bags brought up by Evans the bellman who gave us a full walk through of the suite. THE VIEWS HERE ARE AMAZING!!! Floor to ceiling windows that give a full view of the city and to top it off you get a beautiful view from the bath tub also!! Upon entrance to the bathroom we noticed the bath was decorated with rose petals and candles which was a great touch from Tiffany from the luxury team! My birthday couldn't have felt more special, the staff took great care of us during our stay. From a bottle of wine to fruit cups to chocolate ornaments we were definitely treated with prestige. Also the location of the hotel is close to everything (Tribeca, soho).  We were about 3 mins from Wolf Gang (hotel made reservations for my birthday) and a short walk to a number of other spots we visited. Eric the concierge got us a table at Mr. Purple rooftop which was a nice touch for my birthday. Overall it was a great stay here and we will deff be back. Excellent views, excellent services, short walks to everything and very clean. My only regret is that I had to leave lol 10\/10 all around and would definitely recommend.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

It came to me due to the many losses I experienced this year. I lost friendship, my job of 14 years and 50lbs. She saw me at my worst and continued to be my biggest cheerleader. We\u2019d planned this trip months ago without knowing what was in the near future for us. \n\nThis was also a long distance \u201cLockdown Love\u201d - we met in 2020. I decided to propose to her on her birthday because this would be the first time we\u2019d been together since we have been dating. And why not in New York? I like to stay at different hotels every time I visit, but she did not want to stay anywhere else, but The Dominick. I called and spoke to Steven. We chatted, but then he went on vacation. Some how our chat fell through the cracks so less than 14 days out I called again and spoke to Nicole. Nicole not only cleared my cloudy mind for the proposal, but engaged me with ideas I\u2019d never thought of! She spent almost 1 hour with my on the phone to ensure all details were etched out and I was comfortable with my plan. In this conversation I expressed my gratitude with her being so open to me as a minority and being a part of the LGBTQ community. She made me feel like she would have given me the same treatment regardless of who I loved! October 7, 2022 my life changed. This was the 7th day of our trip. I proposed to my girlfriend on a sailboat in-front of the Statue of Liberty that afternoon. She said yes! We came back to the hotel, changed and went to our reservations at RH on 9th Ave. When we came back to the room \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\nUnbelievable! We were both gobsmacked with the attention to detail and the elevated ambiance. I sent Nicole a random email with a photograph of ring to let Nicole know she\u2019d said yes to the proposal. Not only did Nicole accurately follow my pre planned asks, but she PRINTED OUT THE PICTURE I SENT HER! It was elegantly placed all through the rooms with our names on them! This small gesture over filled us with joy. It was honestly overwhelming. My fianc\u00e9 and I sent videos to all of our friends and family and everyone wanted to know where we stayed. So here\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. Not only are we going to begin to come to New York more often, but this will be the only hotel we will stay at going forward. Nicole\u2019s dedication, communication and execution surpassed our expectations. We are forever indebted to Nicole. She deserves a standing ovation and a promotion to the moon!\n\n \n\n \n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2018s perspective:\n\n \n\nDominick review\n\n \n\nThis trip was easily the best trip of my life. Already loving The Dominick and NYC I thought the trip couldn\u2019t be any better but on Friday my partner proposed to me and it was a dream!!!! I am so grateful the Dominick made sure our day was extra special, from the kind staff to the suite it was absolutely perfect. Coming back to the room with it decorated was absolutely fantastic, I was speechless. Everything was sooo beautiful, I truly feel like the luckiest girl in the world.

I work for a luxury brand and travel around the world often staying at the most luxurious 5 star properties. NYC is\u2026. Tricky. I lived in NYC from 2002-2019, so have only recently had to stay at hotels for business.  I\u2019ve found unless you\u2019re staying at one of the top tier hotel chains - especially in the past two years - the service has just suffered. Not at The Dominick. \nI stayed in two different category rooms - a top floor one bedroom suite and a standard (21st floor) king room. Both were spacious and clean, large bathrooms, great lighting, great closet space, very comfortable beds, beautiful views. Both had generous wet bars with sinks and microwaves which was an interesting surprise (would have been perfect if I was traveling with my babies) and both rooms were very quiet and comfortable. \n\nThe staff - from doormen to check in to room service to housekeeping - were impeccable. Everyone I interfaced with was friendly, professional and kind. The housekeeping staff in particular went above and beyond. I was often in a rush in the mornings and left the room a bit disheveled. I\u2019d come home to my clothes neatly folded in piles, and my bathroom toiletries precisely arranged on the vanity. I haven\u2019t experienced this kind of service in NYC or perhaps anywhere in the US since the pandemic. \n\nThe prices are high - (a chicken soup and bottle of sparkling water came to $60 after \u201cservice fees\u201d and gratuity).  But not incrementally higher than other nyc luxury hotels. \n\nThe one bedroom suite needed a few technical updates - the automatic light switches didn\u2019t work, TV in the bedroom didn\u2019t work, hotel iPad didn\u2019t always work,  but I was too busy and\/or tired to need to address any of these things - I\u2019m sure they would have been promptly fixed or addressed. \n\nOverall I was so pleased with my stay at the Dominick and so impressed with the service. I hope to stay here anytime I need to travel to NYC for business.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Our travel agent reached out the hotel almost a month before our arrival to get contact info for the concierge so that we could book dinner reservations while we are In New York.  This is a birthday trip for me so I was really excited to try some of the new restaurants in the area.\n\nDespite me following up, it took Nicole almost 10 days to respond, by which point one of our requested restaurants was already full - the reservations opened 3 weeks before and they were fully booked by the time we heard from the concierge.\n\nWe were also told that the concierge would monitor the reservations for our other requested restaurant.   It's now less than a week before we arrive and we haven't heard anything.  I checked myself and the restaurant we wanted is actually closed for renovations.   Luckily we made our own alternate plans.\n\nReally disappointed that this is the level of service we are getting from a hotel that charges the rates The Dominick does.

Besides, the gym is fantastic! It even has a Peloton bike!\n\nThis time we stayed for a week and had a seamless check-in as usual. We were greeted at the door by door and bell staff who are very friendly and helpful, especially Chris and Marek. They were always there for us, ready to assist in all that we may need whether it is getting a car or directions. The front desk experience was even more flawless! We got a room in less than a minute and absolutely loved it! We also had to check out for a couple of days and come back and were concerned that this could be an issue since we didn\u2019t book directly with the hotel. However, Gaby at the front desk explained what we needed to do and was able to resolve the issue very effortlessly and quickly! She was very kind, professional and knowledgeable, and picked an even better room with Hudson river view for us so that we could enjoy the Fourth of July fireworks.\n\nThis hotel really has all a traveler could need. And, if there is something that we\u2019d wish to have we simply called housekeeping and talked to Mona.

We haven\u2019t travelled in years due to Covid so this was also a nice stress relief from being a nurse. To start off, our concierge was friendly and had amazing service! I believe his name is Michael, he was the one wearing a white arm sling. He made the check-in process easy and quick, especially after being in the car for a long period of time. After having this experience, I had high hopes for The Dominick. We were lucky and grateful to have our room upgraded to the 38th floor with one of the best room views I have ever seen. I was in awe with the bedroom views, how spacious and clean the room was.  We were welcomed with a bowl of fruits and a lovely card. The card had a mistake on my name but that\u2019s okay. These small gestures made the stay a better one. The view was beautiful during sunset. The area felt safe to walk around. Overall, I recommend staying here and would come back the next time I visit NYC. Thank you for everything :-)","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I tried several hotels that didn't fit the bill, but after my first (of many) stay at The Dominick, it immediately became my new NYC home.  \n\nThe most notable thing about TD is the level of service. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  From the doormen the moment you step in, to the desk agents (especially Gabriela), to guest services and everyone else.  They are friendly, pleasant, warm and incredibly accommodating!  \n\nThe rooms are well appointed (including a discrete microwave and shelves, with small bar sink) spacious and tastefully decorated. The beds, sheet and towels are comfortable and clean. The blowdryers are fine, but could be better. The mini-bar has a solid selection.  The lavendar chocolate (and water) at turndown are nice treat.  The rooms are very clean, and well-maintained but some have small wear & tear that need attention (e.g. wall paper coming up in a corner).\n\nGuest and room services are promptly delivered and attended to. Room service (and all 3 restaurants) are delicious with great service and nice range of items (though a rather pricy).  The pool area and grill is a real treat on a nice day to be able to take a swim while in the heart of NYC and looking at the building and skyline. The frozen drinks alone at the pool grill make it worth t visit. \n\nAs hotel gyms go, the Dominic has a great one. Very easy to get in any type of workout you need (and I'm rather particular about gyms). If you want more, there is a Barry's Bootcamp just down the street, and and Equinox the other direction. \n\nThe neighborhood is very convenient.  Situated between Soho, Tribeca and Hudson Square, there are lot of great restaurants and shops in walking distance, with a Starbucks and Trader Joe's right across the street, a Sweetgreens down the street, and short walk into Soho one of my favorite men's wear shops, Thom Sweeney.  Both the 1.2.3 and A.C.E subway lines are just a couple blocks away, providing each and fast access up and further downtown.  \n\nAll is all, The Dominic knows how to treat a guest well, and create a consistent hotel experience worth going back for time and again!","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Good location. I happened to stay there during fashion week, so it was a bit busier than usual. The neighbourhood is nice and very walkable. The staff are not what you expect from a 5-star hotel: expect for them to walk in on you naked. \n\nI arrived at the hotel early (~2 pm or so) after flying since 5 am that morning and my room wasn't ready, which was fine. They were able to store my baggage while I waited in the lobby then walked around Soho for a couple of hours. It was check-in time and my room still wasn't ready. I waited an hour or so more and it still wasn't ready. There were no other rooms or upgrades available. The front desk offered me a complimentary room so I could change and shower while my room was getting prepared.  I wasn't completely happy with this but there was no real alternative. After I showered and was exiting the bathroom, a hotel staff member (I assume a bellman) entered the room unannounced while I was naked. After I got dressed, I went down to the lobby to inform the front desk of this. I was told that there was nothing they could do because I booked through a third-party website. I was understandably upset and had to plead with them for something; still nothing until my boyfriend intervened and voiced his concerns. I was eventually told that they would offer me $200 in complimentary room service\/restaurant charges off my incidental bill after my stay. \n\nMy boyfriend and I stayed for over a week and our stay was fine, but not up to the standard we're used to at comparable hotels near Central Park in terms of treatment from the staff. \n\nWe spent several hundred dollars on room service and hotel restaurants, but there was only $100 taken off the bill I received via email once I was home. I emailed and called the hotel several times about this but never got a response. This, again, is not in line with the type of treatment I've received from the Park Hyatt or the Ritz.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Our room wasn't available so we decided to upgrade to a Skyline Suite for an additional $200 which was ready.  We were impressed by the size of the room and the master bathroom, but were left in disgust by a room that was not thoroughly cleaned.  The minibar area was filthy, the carpet smelled of smoke and the bathtub had hair in it!  Later on, our experience improved after ordering room service and being taken care of by hotel staff.  The food was okay but we definitely expected more from the $34 short rib burger (missing lettuce and tomato as advertised) we ordered that failed to outperform the $10 Shake Shack burger we had the day prior.  We ordered room service again the following morning which was much better this time around.  Overall, for the price we paid... we expected a higher quality experience and more luxury.  Though we would give The Dominick a chance again in the future, we would most likely decline to upgrade and to order room service.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Everyone at the hotel goes above and beyond to ensure that your stay exceeds expectations, and that you have everything you need to make your stay at the hotel just perfect. Gabriella in particular at the front desk was extremely helpful and extremely sweet to interact with during my stay, and I am grateful to have met her, and thankful she helped make my stay at the hotel so wonderful. \n\nAs for the rooms, they are extremely spacious, elegant, and just wonderful.

My personal favorite feature in the rooms were the electric black-out blinds\/curtains that covered the floor to ceiling windows with the push of a button....I love the \"good night\" and \"wake up\" buttons that controlled the blinds and lights in the room, that turned your room into a dark cozy cocoon for sleep, or bright gorgeous space to wake up to! I was also very impressed with the Bvlgari toiletries provided by the hotel. Very nice touch. \n\nOverall, I would say this hotel is hands-down the best hotel in NYC.

We had a corner suite on the 34th floor and even that high up the constant construction noise from a new adjacent high rise being built was a real bummer. The suite was disappointing in that the bathroom opened into the bedroom so when you closed  the divider to give the person sleeping privacy while you were in the living room area working you would still have to disturb them by opening the divider and going into the bathroom that had no door. My wife could get no rest if I wanted to get ready in the bathroom while she was sleeping. The living room TV was placed above the work desk so if I was on my computer my wife would have to look through my head to see the TV. Also the couch in the living room was placed  so that you had to sit sideways on the couch to see the TV. They had a nice turn down service but they did not bring ice with that service until late in the evening. Thus, you had no ice to make a happy hour cocktail.\nCarpet was stained. Nice robes and bed.

The service is amazing, location is great albeit Soho-ish but I like it better than Soho proper. Big glass boxes in the sky is hard to beat and the rooms are the size of a suite in some NYC hotels. HOWEVER, the room I stayed in on the 40th floor corner was a little worse for the wear. Lots of stains on carpet & chairs. Hard surfaces and walls scuffed and scratched, not what you see in a 5 star hotel. I am not sure they can call it a 5 star as room service is not available after 10:30 PM. We stayed in mid-October and NYC was very busy and back to \"normal\" in most areas. Restaurants and most all attractions require Vaccination proof (which they DO CHECK) THANK YOU! Masks are also enforced but not consistently. My only complaint is the Doorman inconsistency. Marek was very helpful and genuinely friendly and a pleasure to interact with. Some of the other fellows not so much. Specifically in needing assistance in securing transportation. I like to use Taxi's and can usually get one myself with little trouble but part of the benefit of this kind of hotel is asking the doormen to do this for you. If you are a huge tipper or want to use their private car service connections you get taken care of. If you are a regular person, you are on your own. I find this distasteful. Marek did not fall in this category, he treated everyone like they were a priority and had a sense of urgency when needed. THANK YOU MAREK for being a great person. I also want to commend the housekeeping service. They were PERFECT and turndown service was given (other reviews mentioned this was not available but it was during my stay, likely COVID related in the past). I have also seen many mentions of the pillows. The feather pillows are very squishy and you will need at least 2, however you can request foam which are much better if you want something firmer and not flat. Lastly, if you like a big tub with nice hot water you will be very happy. My wife was in heaven as our room had a large window by the tub which was amazing at any time of day or night.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Disappointing to get a ticket after a $50 tip. \n\nOur room didn\u2019t have any nesspresso pods or a microwave.

I knew my husband and I would need plenty of closet space and a large bathroom so we could change quickly in between events.  So I called in advance to ask which category I should reserve to get the larger rooms (2 closets, large bathroom with 2 sinks, etc) which is the room I booked.  Upon check-in, Gabriella made assumptions about me before I even said hello and proceeded to make our check-in a stressful process (after a long night and 5 hour drive).  We had to wait until 6pm to get a room with a large bathroom but tiny (2 feet wide) closet.\n\nTrust me - there are much better hotels that are part of the amex preferred program with better front desk staff in NYC (at similar price point).  I agree with the other 1-3 star reviews here and more people should inform Amex so as to remove the Dominick from the preferred program.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

For one, Gabriela at the front desk is amazing. She gave us a wonderful upgrade and provided individual attention and care. It's a big hotel, but she made everyone feel special. \n\nThe valet staff were kind, patient and attentive -- which really meant something to us given that a five-star hotel in midtown we stayed at recently had dropped valet service entirely and sent us to a public parking lot two blocks away. That other hotel's restaurant has cut its menu, its hours and its offerings, but The Dominick has not. We ate at the restaurant for breakfast, grabbed complimentary coffee throughout the morning, and had dinner at its chic Asian-inspired restaurant that night and everything was exceptional.  Plus the rooms and suites are large, spacious and elegant -- and The Dominick seems to be the only hotel in Manhattan that actually provides enough bath towels that we didn't have to call down for more.

The housekeeper Igor took care of a situation that went above and beyond the call of duty- and he did so happily.

When I told the hotel about my plans, I was immediately connected with the Luxury Ambassadors team who treated the proposal like it was their own. I was instantly upgraded to an amazing room with breathtaking views of the city on one of the top floors. The hotel has several fantastic event spaces but we ultimately  decided that it would be the prettiest and most COVID friendly to propose at one of their private cabanas on the rooftop by the pool. It turned out to be such a perfect night and weekend and we even had another bottle of champagne waiting for us back in the room courtesy of the hotel and events team.

The hotel itself is in a location I love; convenient to SoHo, TriBeCa, the Hudson River, and offers amazing walking proximity to many of my favorite parts of NYC, alongside easy access to the subway.  Alongside that, the rooms at The Dominick are beautiful, spacious, and incredibly quiet.  Without a doubt, the hotel itself, and the rooms, make it one of my favorite places to stay in New York.\n\nWhat truly makes The Dominick special is the staff.  During one of my first stays, I met Gabriela Bucheli at check-in, who went far above and beyond anyone I\u2019ve ever met in a hotel before.  During one of my first stays, Gabriela walked me through (even showing me on a map) where the rooms faced, and took into account my preference that I was hoping to be on a high floor so I could overlook the city.  In future stays, Gabriela remembered my preferences, and often, would have my room prepared for me before I reached the check-in desk.  This is a hotel where I truly feel like a valued guest, and is an experience that makes New York special.\n\nEveryone at The Dominick has always been incredibly kind, friendly, and helpful throughout my stay.  For anyone visiting New York, I absolutely recommend staying at The Dominick.  The neighborhood is fantastic, the service is fantastic, rooms are well furnished, and the staff makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world (I\u2019ve been able to communicate with the hotel via e-mail, too, which really makes communication and requests so easy).\n\nTruly, I think this is the best hotel in New York City with the best team of any hotel in the city.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

One of the better hotels in Soho, very large rooms for NYC and nicely furnished. 5-minute walk to the restaurant scene in Soho. Rooms are larger and more polished than the Soho Grand, but the bar scene is less \u201chappening.\u201d  \n\nOn pulling up, immediately recognized it as the former Trump Soho from when the hotel was failing in 2017 and advertising a lot. Heart sank. \n\nSearched extensively on the web and asked but unable to determine if Trump still has an economic interest (e.g. equity and profits) from the hotel. They took his name off and he lost the management contract after visitation slumped in 2017, but he had a 14% equity interest when the hotel was built and nowhere could I find that he had given that up. \n\nSo, despite a very enjoyable stay, we won\u2019t go back unless the hotel makes clear that there is no association with an insurrectionist. Publishing their ownership and management contracts is the only way to make a clear break. Yes, we believe in voting, and voting our wallet.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

In all the years we've been visiting her I think we've finally found our Go To spot.  We loved of course the location (close to everything), the nice staff, the multiple\/roomy elevators (never had to wait long), and most of all the large\/modern equipped rooms (spacious bathrooms and loads of technology).  We didn't have time to use the spa, fitness center or dine in the restaurant, but we did enjoy a nightcap on the rooftop lounge by the pool (great cocktails and friendly wait staff).  \n\nA couple things of note we picked up on this visit was the relative parcity of available taxis and likewise Lyfts\/Ubers.  In particular we noticed that the ride sharing services were surprisingly expensive and also not easy to find, so not wanting to risk any early morning issues getting to JFK we ordered a car (shout out here to Precision NY Chauffeur Airport Transportation).  The morning bellman made sure the guy had a place to park in front and advised us he was waiting outside.  The gentlemen working the front door were extremely friendly and helpful.  We always felt safe coming and going to the hotel (we walked around a lot and at all hours) and did not pick up on any negative vibes whatsoever in the surrounding area.  \n\nThe Dominic's lobby is large, cool and comfortable, and there never seemed to be a notable queue of people checking in or out.  That process we found to be smooth and speedy.  Again our room was huge, the king bed very comfortable, automatic everything it seems, big shower and tub, large closet (with plenty of space to store our suitcases, which is a pet peeve of ours not wanting to always be tripping over them in the notoriously cramped NYC boutique hotel rooms we've stayed in), good sized safe, etc.  We did need to have an iron\/ironing board delivered to the room, but that process was quick and no big deal.  It was also nice having the guest services phone actually answered after a couple rings and the person on the other end addressing you by your name and having an accommodating demeanor.       \n\nWell, The Dominic is where we'll be staying on all our future visits (finally we don't have to look around anymore).   The rates all considered we felt were quite reasonable based on the overall quality we received for our money.  Honestly you can't go wrong if you stay there, and I venture to say you will be pleasantly surprised.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

We came to stay for 9 nights in early May and were a bit hesitant when we found out it would be reopening just a few days before for the first time since it closed for Covid, but we needn't have worried at all!!  The hotel was fabulous as always and the service top notch with many of the old employees returning.  We started staying here before our kids moved to the city and even when one lived UWS and one in EV we chose to stay here, now that they both live in WV we DEFINITELY won't be staying anywhere else.  So conveniently located to WV (about 10 min walk or one subway stop, or just turn to the right outside the front doors, walk two quick blocks and you are in the heart of Soho.  Tons of good restaurants, bars, and shopping in easy walking distance and a 1 min walk to the ACE and 2-3 min walk to the 1,2.  So easy access to anywhere you might want to go in the city.  \n\nBecause of staying there 9 nights we opted for the one bedroom suite - but even the regular King rooms are bigger than your average NYC room with very large bathrooms with tub and separate shower, and most also have a separate toilet room.  Our room was on the Skyline level which had amazing views, we had a corner room so could see One World, Hudson River, Empire State and our son noticed we could see all the way up 6th to the entrance of Central Park.  We have stayed in a So-hi level before which of course can have even more incredible views - and you won't  find views like that anywhere else in Soho.\n\nOur breakfast was included in our rate, and though the breakfast restaurant was still closed we had room service every morning and you could put your order in the night before via the iPad, or we often called every morning and our breakfast was there in 20 mins max.  \n\nThis is our go to NYC hotel.  We are so glad NYC is back and so is The Dominick!!","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

That although there is an investigation into finding out who this person who called herself Lisa is, they won\u2019t do anything about it now.

I asked him to listen to the recording they took, her refused.\n\nMy family and I travel often and we stay in many superior Hotels all over the world. I am beyond upset at the treatment I have received, basically being called a liar and now being put in a position having to find a hotel in New York 2 days before traveling I am not a complaining kind of person, or someone who writes reviews but this time I will be commenting everywhere including the BBB, Tripadvisor, yelp and anywhere else I can find. The feeling of being dismissed and given only the option \u201cto cancel my reservation\u201d is horrendous customer service. On Monday starting at 3:52pm Los Angeles time. I called 3 times to make a reservation. The first time I was on hold waiting for the reservation department for 10 minutes (I looked on my phone), I hung up and called back. Waited 8 minutes on hold, hung up and called back. The third time I asked Veronica who answered the phone again if there was a problem with the reservations department and if I should leave my phone number or call some other time, she said no, she would put me through. This time it was not that long. The representative who answered seemed very busy and short. Wanted to make the reservation immediately, I told her that I wanted to ask a couple of questions, she didn\u2019t seem to care wanted my information and what kind of room I wanted immediately. Only after giving her all the information, but before giving my credit card she finally allowed me to ask my questions. I had a question about the bathroom wall, because in the pictures they seem see-through to the room and I didn\u2019t want that, she said no they weren\u2019t. After clarifying that, I asked her about price matching, that I had found this rate and I had it right in front of me. She said just to take a screenshot and to bring it with me and the price would be matched at the reception. I confirmed this with her I think 2 or 3 times. She went ahead and took my cc information and only then told me the price that the hotel was charging me and I said wait, that is even higher than the hotel website. She said well maybe it\u2019s because those rooms aren\u2019t available anymore. I said but you are matching the price I have right, she said yes again. I asked the representative her name, finally after 4 times I could finally hear her name and she said Lisa. Musa told my husband there is no one in the reservations department by that name. Convenient?\nMy husband emailed the hotel just to confirm even though I said that wasn\u2019t necessary, he was right we have defrauded by your hotel. \nNot only am I not getting the price I was promised that I had found online, I would have to pay the higher price than I had seen on your website while I was talking to \u201cLisa\"\n \n\nOutraged and cannot believe your customer service.","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

She's right other than the bed and I guess we have to agree to disagree. So I guess we'll be getting a Sleep Numbers bed, soon enough after the wedding. Breakfast did not live up to dinner expectations we had the American breakfast. The fingerling potatoes were dry and hard the chicken apple sausage was overcooked. The eggs, toast and juice was good. Overall the staff was so polite, kind and helpful. From Room service, the doormen to check-in with Tajeena. She's a doll, we love her, so cool and down to earth. She was so helpful and she saw how nervous I was checking in for my proposal. She was patient with me and towards helping me get it done properly, by making sure the room was to my liking and to anything else I needed. Even check-out with Gabriela, she was cheerful, friendly and very helpful in explaining to me the bill and how everything is broken-down. She took her time and went over everything twice to make sure there was no mistakes. I love how everyone who works there gives you that personal attention and care. Thank you to everyone that works there and to those who I've mentioned by name\u00a0for making our first time and hopefully not our last time at the Dominick such a special and an amazing experience. A special thanks to Slava from in house reservations for helping me make the right decision picking the Dominick and towards making our proposal a memorable one for years to come. Thank you for your help and patience.\n\nSincerely Ryan C.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Amazing location and quite envious at that, for there are not that many SoHo\/Tribeca\/Village hotels that can boast spacious rooms and luxurious amenities. \nGreat service, a perfect check-in experience meriting more than 5 stars. 4 quick and smooth-riding elevators, spacious fitness center with excellent views, big rooms with breathtaking views, all of the above are essential components for a good and relaxing stay. \nHowever to be fair and objective, there are several things that require improvements, and a few problems that do not befit to a hotel of that rank. \n1. The overall upkeep is starting to show some wear and tear, such as stained carpet or bathroom lightswitch covers that come apart falling on the floor. \n2. Even with our registered 4 PM check-out, the programmable room keys stopped working precisely at 12 PM, involving the inconvenience of going back to the reception and getting new keys. \n3. No turndown service, even though a hotel employee had stopped by our room in the evening for a complimentary fruit plate. The absence of the turndown service is a major... turndown, excuse the pun. \n4. No shoehorn, no clothes brush in the room, even though the said items were available during our previous stays.\n5. The TV streaming is only enabled for iOS\/Apple devices and not for Androids, that is despite almost equal amount of Android phones vs Apple phones in the US. \n6. Even after 1 year, the former Spring and Varick restaurant that has been touted as a long-awaited venture of a Michelin-star chef Shaun Hergatt, still hasn't opened its doors.  \n7. The bathroom lighting is way too low, making it virtually impossible to shave or apply makeup. To be fair, the bathroom lighting scourge is very common, even among the top luxury hotels.  \n8. Now, there is a certain incorrect advertisement regarding the Varick Street Icon parking, for which the hotell allegedly validates its guests' parking. True, for 25 hrs parking, after presenting our validated parking ticket, the price was reduced from $130 to $84. Great, isn't it? The problem though is that $130 is not the real price but the advertized price. If you are using the ParkWhiz app, the same parking, for the same time would cost you exactly the same $84, whether you stay at The Dominick or not.  Otherwise, the parking price is fair for the area; it is impossible to find anything more affordable in the immediate vicinity. \nTo sum up all of the above, only out of our dedication to the Dominick we rated it as 5 stars. A more unbiased approach would necessitate a 4-star rating.  \nWe are looking forward for the Management to take care of the above. We will be happy with another pleasant stay at the Dominick.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

In the beginning, I would try staying in a different hotel each time just to explore the many options this city has to offer. Eventually, I got sick of the trial and error. I hate Times Square with a passion, can\u2019t stand the amount of tourists in Midtown, and uptown is too inconvenient for my meetings at Hearst and WTC. SoHo is my favorite neighborhood in all of New York, and The Dominick is the only 5-star hotel in this area. Naturally, The Dominick became my 2nd home.\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to applaud their doorman Stanley. He always greets me with a smile and a warm welcome, offers directions when I leave the hotel on foot, helps me with my baggage without me having to ask, and walks me to\/from my Uber with an umbrella in hand when it\u2019s raining. He truly makes my stay so much more wonderful than it already is.\n\nThe reception staff are courteous and polite, and hotel management is quick to address any issues I have with my room\/stay. Rooms are extremely spacious - a rare sight in NYC. My favorite rooms are the 1-bedroom suites facing the Hudson River. The housekeeping team does an amazing job, and the ladies greet me kindly with offers of water and chocolate even when I decline turndown service. In fact, every hotel staff that I\u2019ve encountered would greet me politely as I pass them by - I\u2019ve stayed in too many notable NY hotels with staff that lack basic courtesy. Need I even mention the location?! You have Trader Joe\u2019s across the street, Dominick Ansel Bakery a couple blocks away, plus some of the best shopping and restaurants in SoHo.\n\nTo give a fair review, I have to mention some areas of improvement:\n\n- I\u2019m quite sensitive to smell, so I\u2019ve had to switch rooms many times due to a weird stench that smelled like some sort of chemical. I\u2019m also not a fan of the air freshener that they use in the hotel lobby - it makes me feel nauseous.\n\n- I wish they had a real business center. Since I\u2019m primarily in NYC for work, I\u2019ve had to use the business center quite often. It\u2019s not really much of a business center - simply a computer and a printer located in the corner of the mezzanine level, where people often dine or congregate in big groups. They charge you for time spent using their computer, and for each piece of paper printed. Their printer does not have scanning or faxing abilities, which is really inconvenient. \n\n- Lastly, I think their elevators are quite old and in need of an update. (But I\u2019ve learned that this is super common in NY buildings.)\n\nIf The Dominick\u2019s management were to improve on the above, this would truly be the best hotel in New York. Regardless - The Dominick delivers on its promise of a five-diamond stay.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Really enjoyed the set up and the whole family loved to hang out in between walks around the SoHo and Tribeca areas. \n\nLocation is absolutely fantastic with the best places for food and shopping in New York right around you. \n\nThe interiors in the rooms are not exactly new but nothing to fault there. Set up is good and beds are great.\n\nCouple of weird things: nowhere to hang your hand towels and single-ply toilet paper (which you really should not have in a five star hotel). \n\nIf you wake up early (like we do) then a highly recommend hotel. If you\u2019d like to sleep in, then that\u2019s probably not going to happen due to the construction noise which starts very early, every day of the week.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Walking to the Village or SoHo, TriBeCa, Little Italy, Nolita, etc, is dead easy.  If you want midtown madness on your doorstep then this maybe isn\u2019t your best bet.\n\nThe views from our suite (SoHi two bedroom facing north and east) were breathtaking.  Could spend literally all day looking out of the massive windows and not tire of it.  The rooms were very nice, beds super comfy, shower nice and large.  It was kept immaculate by the housekeeping staff.  However we did notice a few things looked a bit tired (hinge falling off a cupboard door, laminate starting to peel back, etc).  It\u2019s a shame they didn\u2019t have Netflix or a Bluetooth speaker, both seem like they should be as standard.\n\nI had thought we were entitled to a welcome drink, and coffee every morning, and decent WiFi without extra charge, as part of the SoHi booking.  When my husband checked he was told it was because we had booked through booking.com so weren\u2019t entitled to those enhancements.  However on our last day were were told by another member of staff that we hadn\u2019t used our \u2018room credit\u2019.  It was disappointing to be honest as for the money we spent on this stay you\u2019d think a glass of Prosecco on arrival would be the least they could do!  It also would have saved shlepping over to Starbucks in the freezing cold.\n\nThe staff were great, very helpful and in particular we want to mention Dominick, who was delightful.\n\nOn the whole I would recommend this hotel, but would say they squeezed every last dollar out of me and I don\u2019t feel like I was getting anything \u2018extra\u2019 even though I paid \u2018extra\u2019 money.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From the moment we arrived, the entire hotel staff went above and beyond to make me and my daughter feel welcome and special.  I booked through Amex Platinum, and we enjoyed the extra amenities- especially the late 4pm checkout that the hotel graciously extended to 5pm for us as we had a late night flight.  \n\nThe breakfast through room service was a highlight.  It arrived all 3 mornings within 20 minutes of ordering and the omelette, pastries and coffee were especially delicious.  It was my daughter's birthday, and the wonderful gentlemen brought her a cake and candle and sang Happy Birthday to her!  \n\nThe doormen were always so friendly and kind.  We felt like we were staying in our own NYC apartment building rather than a hotel.\n\nThe location can't be beat!  Within easy walking distance to all the best restaurants and shopping in SoHo!  I especially recommend Dominique Ansel Bakery right down the street.  The hot chocolate is the best in the city and so are the pastries (the famous Cronut deserves the hype).  Also Pinch Chinese is not to be missed. Trader Joe's and CVS are right across the street if you need anything!\n\nOur SoHi view room was perfection on the 41st floor.  Huge for NYC and thoughtfully appointed with every detail for comfort.  I recommend upgrading for the view- it is worth it!  The tub sits in a huge window and taking a bath looking out over the city is heaven. The bed was very comfortable with nice quality sheets.  There was not a door separating the bedroom from bath.  This was a bit awkward for privacy.  Loved the rain head shower and C.O. Bigelow bath products.  I do think the quality of the towels could be better.  But the robes were wonderful!!  One touch controls to open curtains and turn lights on\/off are very nice features.\n\nI think this is the best value of any hotel I've ever stayed in!  Very reasonable for NYC.

The hotel honored the upgrade, and I was pleased to learn there were no restrictions (other than the destination fee, below) on use of the property credit.  Even the minibar is included.  The upgrade to a \"Sohi\" room was quite nice -- though the room is the same as elsewhere in the hotel, the city view from the 37th floor was pretty remarkable.\n\n- I realize that most hotels in NY these days are including a silly \"destination fee\" to mask higher room rates, and this one was no exception.  To be fair, this is all clearly disclosed at the time of booking, so there's nothing really dishonest about it, but I'd much prefer the rate simply includes the cost.  It's really quite silly to charge me $40 a day for things that should either be included, or which I have no desire to pay for: \n coffee and tea (which is complimentary in literally every decent hotel anywhere), garment pressing (which most travelers won't use), a $40 spa credit (which many travelers won't use), access to the fitness center (which is complimentary in literally every decent hotel anywhere).  The fee also \"includes\" Wifi (which should be included anyway), shoe shine service (which most luxury hotels provide), and local phone calls (seriously?).  I don't fault The Dominick for having to compete in the NY market, but this list of included items is pretty ridiculous -- there is nothing special for The Dominick to offer for this fee, so it really just should be folded into the room rate.\n\n- The location is fabulous:  just enough away from all the crazy, while still being right down the block from multiple subway lines, with a Trader Joe's and CVS right on the corner.\n\n- The rooms are fine -- quite big for NYC standards, with a great bathroom, comfortable bedding, etc.  I wish they could have put in a decent lounge chair, however -- the one chair in the room was not particularly comfortable.\n\n- Service was extremely friendly -- both at the front desk, and housekeeping.  \n\n- Breakfast was very good, though the bar and restaurant area are tiny.  For a hotel of this size, I would have expected a bigger bar area.\n\nOverall, this was a nice hotel for a fair enough rate for NYC.  With the extra amenities of the FHR program, it's worth the stay.  Even without those amenities, this is a nice, quiet hotel in a great location.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Our rooms were not ready at check in time at 3pm, we were told to come back at 4, rooms still not ready.

By the time we got back from dinner, it was 11:30pm. Not fun unpacking your bags with 2 kids at 11:30pm. \nThe other huge fail was paying for a 2 room suite with a skyline view. Our view was far from that!! False advertising at its finest. We talked to 3 mangers over our 2 day stay, none really cared that we got our room late or that we didn\u2019t get the room we prepaid for. Because it was prepaid they had us, no credit for their mistake or misleading us. The waiter in the restaurant was rude and bothered, it was just not a welcomed feeling. \nThe website pictures of our room and our actual views were just wrong. The only thing they offered was for us to move again! We were only there for 2 nights, such a waste of our time and added unnecessary frustration to our holiday weekend. We have stayed in hotels all over the world, this was by far the most misleading experience coupled with terrible customer service!

This being my 7th visit, but now under the 'Dominik' brand, \nOh dear, from the moment I turned up, it was not looking good. A lot of familiar faces still working there but compared to all previous visits, there has been an unacceptable & endemic change in their attitude to service. No more fresh 'macaroons' & no other options for mattresses apart from 'super soft' - used to be choices for medium and firm. \nThe upsell started on checking in - 'as I had booked directly with the hotel, how about moving from your dark lower floor room to a bright city wide view - for only $150 per night'. Clearly lots of better rooms available, but no free upgrade for a repeat customer.\nI was told there was a package waiting for me and they would send it straight up to the room. Porters how bought up the baggage, asked if I needed anything and i requested some Ice and a kettle and tea bags. Ice arrived 5 minutes later.\n2 hours later, still no package & no kettle and the TV was on the blink, switching itself off every 10 minutes. Went to reception to remind them about the package and kettle and went back to the room to meet the 'IT'  engineer. He fiddled with a few knobs, pointed the remote control in various directions, and said all would be fine with the TV. \n10 minutes after he left, the TV kept on switching itself off again and again and again. \nHad to leave to go on an appointment reminding them for a 3rd time that the 'package' & kettle still had not arrived and that the TV still not working.\nGot back 2 hours later, package and kettle arrived, TV - not working and now TV in Bathroom not working.\nNext morning, told them yet again about the TV and they promised faithfully to get it fixed.  Went out for breakfast meeting, returned around midday - room not made up, TV not working yet someone had clearly been in to check the fridge to see if I had used any of the apparently solid gold drinks (apparently according to the prices).\nReminded them yet again about the TV. Went out for afternoon, returned around 5pm. Room made up TV not working!!!!\nWent to reception to complain. Receptionist suggest that they send up the IT engineer to check out the TV. Pointed out that they had apparently been in 4\/5 times already and clearly could not fix it, but did not let me know. I told receptionist enough was enough and wanted to move to a room that had a working TV. Despite all the problems i had encountered, I was moved down three floors to an even darker room with a kitchen space half the size and a smaller living area. \nSo, here I am, 2nd night of a 3 night stay and decided to go through previous recent reviews for this hotel and low and behold, the TV problem is quite clearly endemic for many other customers - but clearly is the case that its ok to 'twiddle a few knobs and look as if it it fixed' knowing that the problem is most certainly not fixed. A bunch of reviews highlighting the same problem.\nNow, lets get to the food ...................er..............what food. Restaurant closed and a mezzanine level cafe serving $30 sandwiches with room for no more than 25 people. That area used to be a lovely space to just sit, read, relax, get a coffee. Now, no lounge and unless you are there before the germans bag the tables, Uber Eats appear to be the better option. \nShower pressure very low, have to pay for milk for the tea (which turned up 3 hours after request)........................(if you've made it this far, then you need to get out more!).\nSo as long as you dont need a TV, bring your own milk, don't mind sleeping on a mattress no firmer than quick sand, not expecting any packages, dont need to eat, don't want to relax in a lounge\/bar area, prepared to use your own netflix and amazon on your own devises, happy with being downgraded after complaining,  all for a bargain $700 a night, then this is your dream hotel. \n\"Stick then in 1209 as they don't look like they want to watch the TV'. In the meantime, I've already booked an alternative hotel for my next trip, in the hope that my 'new lover' will be more appreciative of my custom.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Could have stayed at MUCH NICER hotel for HALF the price!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-12-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I booked the Dominick through JetBlue vacations accidentally because I didn't calculate the per night price correctly in my head and then I couldn't change the resy. Since there was nothing I could do about it, I made peace with it, but for $700\/night (!!!!!!!), I naturally had very high expectations. \n\nAll I can say is, don't stay here. I've stayed at the Empire Hotel, the Standard in MePa and others for exactly half the price and they are far superior to the Dominick. Sure, the view from our room at the Dominick was amazing, but the flaws are oh so many! For just a taste of them...\n\n1. The room itself is nothing special and in fact, felt shabby around the edges--the closet door, for example, really needed to be repainted. The furniture\/furnishings are quite outdated. The water pressure in the shower is lacking. \n\n2. The toiletries are cheap and my hair looked terrible the entire weekend. You think for $700 a night, we could get decent shampoo! Even the disposable slippers in the room were cheap.Worst of all, the towels in the bathroom are thin and scratchy. I have nicer towels in my home that I bought at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Maybe the owners of the Dominick should go shopping there. Also, the blow dryer was a cheap drugstore kind.\n\n3. There was a non-operational Nespresso machine, and as it is, we were given only three pods--all decaf! We had to call down for more (we didn't know at the time the machine wasn't even working) and when they brought a handful, most of them were also decaf. We asked for just a bit of regular milk (as opposed to those awful creamers) and were initially told we'd have to pay for it. Seriously? To be fair, they eventually brought us some, but the machine didn't work anyway and we gave up.\n\n4. The bed was uncomfortable and the room was HOT. It was winter, but we had to put the manual fan on and turn the AC (!!) on to 66 to be able to sleep at all--and that wasn't much. The sheets are not cozy and I think it's a memory foam mattress--and those mattresses sleep very hot. We barely slept in the three nights we stayed.\n\n5. We were on the 39th floor--nice!--but as opposed to most tall NY buildings, this one did not have elevators split up, meaning that all elevators serviced all floors and so it took a really long time to get to 39 and to get on an elevator back down.\n\n5. The night before we were leaving--when it was already raining--we asked at the front desk about a cab to the airport in the morning. We were assured there would be plenty of cabs outside the hotel and we just needed to be down there an hour before we needed to be at the airport. They knew it would be raining at that time and we were quite emphatic that we'd be leaving at 7 am. They assured us, no problem. Next morning: zero cabs and the doorman said the front desk was wrong--that there are not always cabs there. On top of that, he suggested we walk to the corner to try and hail one, but did not offer to do so for us. Again, for $700 a night? And speaking of which, the front doors of that hotel are super heavy and only one time when we were going in was there a doorman to open the door\/greet us.\n\n6. To say the service was unexceptional is not quite right, because really there was no service at all. I have never in my life stayed at a hotel so expensive and yet this was the least remarkable hotel experience I've had. It could have been a Holiday Inn!\n\nI could not be more disappointed about this experience, and I am so angry at myself for putting myself into more debt to stay at a place so undeserving. I had hoped for a very special and romantic weekend with my husband in NY and this was not the place to make that happen, but given the exorbitant cost, it will be a long time before I can return to the city.  :-(","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Its  location is on the edge of Soho, not its centre. Its decor is getting rather dated, having (it seems) been inherited from its predecessor the Trump Soho (yes, it was one of his). Facilities are not up to 5 star standard - no Netflix, Amazon Prime etc, meaning nearly all TV is constantly interrupted by inane ads.  Maintenance not up to scratch - air con vents covered in dust, wallpaper peeling, doors in bathroom not fitting correctly. Lighting poor, especially in the bathroom, which is dingy, with light only on one side of the mirror. And ridiculous prices for services etc - $14 for a can of nuts! Plus cleaners rearranged EVERYTHING in the bathroom  on one day so we couldn\u2019t find anything. The place needs to wake up and get into the 21st century.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Very frustrating if you are watching a game or show, you miss the action. Stayed 8 nights, spoke to IT and others. They knew it to be an issue, but seemed unable to do anything to repair issue. The restaurant was hugely inconsistent with heavy construction going on in the adjacent space, so loud you could not hear yourself think.

As other reviewers have noted, the hotel charges a non-refundable $40\/per night resort fee, for which one gets a cup of watery coffee and supposedly three items of clothing pressed, in addition to the high price of the room. Very strange! When I called to ask if I could get my clothing pressed, I was told it would take 24 hours to get it back. The view from my room was great, as advertised. The couch was very worn and the carpet  had some filthy spots on it. The windows don't open and the air conditioner was extremely noisy.  The motor switched on and off intermittently and when it was on, it made a loud and persistent banging noise.  This can be expected at a budget hotel, but should not be a problem at a luxury hotel.  I asked the front desk if the unit could be repaired or if I could change rooms, as I am a light sleeper.  They sent a repair man up and he listened to the motor and laughed and said that the noise was totally normal, then shut the door of the unit and left.  I was woken up several times by the motor. I turned the unit off but it was very hot and stuffy in the room without it.  So I wore my noise cancelling headphones for the rest of the night in order to sleep.  The next morning, I asked if I could change rooms.  Staff helpfully showed me another room, where the air conditioning unit was nearly as loud. There were no other rooms available.  I said I would like to leave the hotel and the staff graciously waived the penalty I was supposed to pay for leaving early.

The Dominick is centrally located in SoHo so it\u2019s close to all the shopping.  The Dominick hotel is the only five-star hotel in SoHo.\n\nOnce we arrived at this luxury hotel, we were greeted by a bellman who took care of our bags and gave us directions to the lobby\/check in area.  This property has a modern high end feel to it.  At reception, we received an upgrade to our room (nice!)  Once we completed our check in, we were given our key and made our way up to our room, which was a well-appointed room with amazing views of the city.  Our room was a King SoHi Guest Room on the 31st floor (room 3104).  I would recommend staying SoHi or Penthouse to get the views.\n\nNote: When staying in NY the rooms can be on the smaller side.  It is city living!\n\nAfter settling in, we decided to go check out the hotels bar. The bar is just one floor above the lobby and opens up to the downstairs area a bit.  It is very small and more like a lobby bar than a true bar.  There are no views from this bar, and it isn\u2019t a place you would want to spend a lot of time.  We grabbed some drinks and headed back up to our room to freshen up for dinner. \n\nIn our room we had a cheese plate delivered and it was yummy.  The room service breakfast for each morning we were there wasn't the best.  I would say moderate and not one of my favorites.  \n\nWe also tried out the spa, Babor Signature Spa.  I would use the word spa loosely as this spa is very small with limited options.  When we were there the sauna was not working for the ladies area so they opened up the men\u2019s as a co-ed.  Um, no thanks...  Also the pool and jacuzzi were under renovations.  Perhaps soon all of the renovations will be done, and it will be a better version of a spa.  The spa staff also seemed a bit disoriented.  My massage was amazing, so if you can get past the smallness of the spa, it works for the purpose of a massage.  However, the massage was expensive considering the spa is so small and doesn't offer a lot of options.\n\nOverall it is a nice hotel, but still has some kinks to work out with the spa and room service.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

All previous stays were excellent, marked by great service. This time, however, the service was substandard, from the three-hour wait for a room change on check-in to the failure of the hotel to fix a room phone with no receiver volume and the failure to replace a leaky Nespresso machine to the surprise of a daily \"destination fee\" on my bill. Re the room change, the hotel clerk first attempted to interest us in an \"upgrade\" in the form of a suite on the 17th fIoor with a depressing view of a couple of industrial-style water-tanks. I expect more for being a frequent guest. On the plus side, the views from the upper floors are phenomenal, and the doormen are great.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We had a high floor room with a wonderful view.  They offer free coffee and small pastries in the morning.  Pricing is high ( look for a deal or promotion) and there is a $40 destination fee plus tax ( about $45 extra per night) that you don\u2019t find about until you check in.  I am not sure if this is something new for all hotels in NYC or not, but you might want to check about that before booking.
