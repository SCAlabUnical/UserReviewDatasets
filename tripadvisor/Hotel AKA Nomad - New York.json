It is a designer hotel, elegant, very comfortable room (small bathroom). No cleanliness issues. It is very well located, central in a quiet area. There is a bus station almost across the street from the hotel, the 6 subway station one block away, and 5th Avenue one block away. Point of improvement: expensive breakfast, with little savory choice in the formula at 29 dollars per person (no hot chocolate either). I recommend the Slate caf\u00e9 right next to the hotel, which has lots of delicious choices and which opens from 8am. Lots of hotel guests meet there.\nToo bad the terrace is closed during this period. Hot chocolate offered between 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., a nice touch. The staff is attentive. We are already looking forward to coming back.

We spoke to staff over the phone before arrival about having an early check in and was told different information upon arrival. We informed the hotel prior we would need early check in based on arriving early after an over night flight and having a service animal, we agreed that we would pay the $100 fee. However, the assistant manager at the desk was rude from the start of us entering the hotel, He was in a heated conversation with a guest who had requested an upgrade prior (also over the phone before arriving) which he was then denied & stated that would not be said over the phone. After helping him check in early, he then approached us stating \u201chow can I help you if you want early check in it will be $300\u201d. A $300 fee is more than a one night stay. We then asked what time can we expect a room, he could not provide us with a time as he stated the hotel is fully booked, however on their website it is not. So far very disappointed in the miscommunication from the hotel staff, main reason for selecting this hotel was the accommodations that were stated over the phone. They have requested we wait for our room with no other accommodations, we have been waiting in the hotel lobby for over 6 hours, with no update on when the room will be ready. We have asked multiple times for an update for time and none is provided. We have lost an entire day of our trip waiting for this hotel to attempt to accommodate its guests. Again, we spoke over he phone 24 hours prior and told there were plenty of rooms to accommodate us earlier.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We have stayed there many times over the years under different names: the Roger Williamson, the Roger, etc and were always content. This newest brand, AKA Nomad, has a very chic vibe but the practical parts are missing. The bathroom was so dark that it was impossible to see to apply makeup and contact lenses; with no fan, it steamed up; the rain head shower with small partition flooded the entire bath floor. It would have been nice to have luggage stand instead of putting luggage on the floor, some plugs other than between beds (isn\u2019t that electrical code?), to have our mini bar and coffee dishes replenished and with clean dishes. During our three night stay, dirty dishes from prior guest were never removed or replaced (finally I put them out in the hall on day 3) and our minibar never replenished. We alerted the management numerous times but they never responded (except for more towels so each of us would have a towel after 3rd try). They charged us more on our credit card than our bill reflects so I will need to battle for that refund next. Won\u2019t be back.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":80110,"title":"Most disappointing hotel in NYC- poor customer service","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-08-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Rarely do I write negative reviews, but our experience at this hotel compels me to share. Upon check-in, valet parked our car, and while it was in their possession, it received a $115 parking ticket. Astonishingly, the hotel tried to shift blame onto us, stating that our expired inspection caused the ticket. However, the ticket, clearly marked as a PARKING ticket, was for their valet spot, not vehicle-related. Despite this, the hotel repeatedly bothered us about the ticket, even calling us at 9 pm. The next day, they claimed we asked to attach the ticket to our reservation, which we never did. Our attempts to resolve the situation were met with poor customer service. The hotel did  nothing to rectify the situation, made no attempts to enhance our stay, despite this inconvenience. While the hotel was clean, the disappointing customer service overshadowed everything. Only at checkout, after multiple confrontations, did the hotel reluctantly offer an apology, yet they again referred to our inspection and still wasn\u2019t clear if they were going to take care of the parking ticket. This experience left a negative impression on our entire trip. Given the numerous fine hotels in NYC, I recommend exploring alternatives that provide superior service. In a city where hotels can make or break a stay, this one fell far short of expectations. I hope upper management reviews this and think about how they can provide better customer service for future patrons.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I booked the hotel on the MegaBus from Philly to New York. It was a reasonable price for my one-night stay for my birthday. Within 30 minutes of booking the hotel I had received an email asking about any special accommodations. I let know them know it was my birthday. They wished me a happy birthday.  The hotel was 10 minutes from the Mega Bus stop. When we walked in it was beautiful. Nice and clean, modern. The hotel concierge was amazing polite and very helpful.     When we checked -in it was fast and easy.  No surprise charges. Just basic hotel fees hold for damages. We received our keys and went to the room. The room had a king size bed with a beautiful bathroom. Nice mirror and was the perfect size for 2 people. To my surprise there was a card from the hotel with amazing chocolates and water from my birthday.  I love how accommodating everyone was and just wanted us to be comfortable. Like example, There was an  umbella in our closet just case in rain and a bunch more at the front door. \nI love this place. The location is walking distance from times square. The most important part was the staff. Their positive energy made me want to come over and over again. ","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I stayed here for a week with a large group for a work trip. I really loved walking back from my office each day and getting to relax in this hotel. Everyone at Hotel AKA NoMad-- especially Ian, Ardita, and Lourdes-- was so professional, accommodating, and did everything they could to make our stay an excellent one. The level of service and attention they pay to guests was definitely a five star experience. I highly recommend!","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We stayed in room 1603 on the penthouse floor and booked an empire state terrace view. It seems like the building used to be an apartment building and only the interior was renovated. The view was great, other than that the room was mediocre, nothing special. Pro tip- if you\u2019re having difficulty finding the button to turn of the strip light on the dresser, the button is behind the coffee machine and teapot. Balcony net door fell off its hinges when we tried to open it. Netflix turned off and wouldn\u2019t turn back on halfway through a movie. And a huge cockroach crawled up on me when we were sitting on a terrace late in the evening. So there is definitely room for improvement. Staff was very nice both at the front desk, restaurant and the doorman.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Having requested a room on a higher floor, and figuring that mentioning my 60th birthday might help, we were upgraded to a balcony room with views of the Empire State Building, and greeted by a cake, flowers, and a personalized card.  Meanwhile I needn\u2019t have worried about the floor level as the rooms seem well insulated. The bar is lovely and perfect for a nightcap after an evening out.   Literally every member of the staff greeted us with a genuine smile every time we entered the building or had a request (which was honestly only once bc everything is so well organized). All in all, the perfect spot for a 60th birthday visit to NYC.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}
