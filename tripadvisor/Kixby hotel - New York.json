The staff are also friendly and are helpful when it comes to directions, booking airport taxis etc. Another positive was the very comfortable bed and cosy bedding - needed after long days exploring the city. \n\nNow for the negatives - our main issue was the noise at night. Obviously we expected noise to some degree in central NYC but there didn't seem to have been any attempt at soundproofing the windows\/rooms - we were on one of the highest floors and could still hear loud traffic\/street noise all night. We have stayed at other NYC hotels very close to this one and this has not been the case. There was also a constant humming from an air conditioning unit which seemed to continue regardless of whether or not we turned it off in the room. \n\nWatch out for the $35 per day facility fee per room that will be charged upon check in (on top of $250 refundable holding deposit). We did not know about this beforehand but were informed that the fee was for things such as the gym, unlimited flavoured water and a branded water bottle that was left in the room. I believe that this is relatively common in NYC but even so, we would have chosen not to pay for these things had it not been mandatory and again is not something that we have not experienced elsewhere. \n\nUnfortunately due to the above reasons, we would stay elsewhere next time, however I expect that you could do a lot worse than this hotel.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I complained again on check out as it really affected our stay, and again no compensation was offered. I emailed and complained on our return and it took the hotel a month to get back to us and simply offered 25% off of our first night stay. Feels miserly. Wish I could upload a video on to here for people to understand how loud it really was at 02:36am when I recorded it; felt like the bin truck was in our room!!! Would definitely not recommend this hotel when there are so many options in NYC.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

All we were told was that they needed my credit card for a $250 retainer for the room which would be refunded and that was it. No information about any fee  tobe taken or what the facilities were for tht fee, or that we would have to pay and it was not optional.\nYet upon check out which was early at 7am so we could do more shopping, we were again told nothing about this fee. To make matters worse when we returned from our shopping we were told we would have to go to the restroom ( which was small and shared with the adjacent bar) to add the shopping to our cases.\nWhen I noticed this deduction from my credit card and asked what the fee was for, we were told it was for fast WiFi, the bottles of water, free tea and coffee and the gymnasium. I explained I had not been told anything about this and asked for the $66 dollars to be refunded to my card but told no, even though we knew nothing of these facilities and so didn't ever use them. \nI am frustrated about this as the website states free WiFi and complimentary tea and coffee but clearly it isn\u2019t free or complimentary so anyone thinking of staying here please bear in mind that these facilities are not free or complimentary. Indeed I onserved as another client checked in and was not told anything about a facilites fee being deducted from the retainer.\nFor all of the above reasons I would not stay here again, especially when I have been charged for something that was never mde available to me or that you have to add to your packing in a public toilet.\nThis was a trip for my birthday which was long awaited after it being cancelled due to covid, so it wasn\u2019t a nice way to end the experience.\nThe room was fine and clean\/comfortable but being hoodwinked in this way means I would not stay again or advise other to do so.\n\nJeanette","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were met at reception by 2 male receptionists. One didn't raise a smile and the one who gave us our our keys went through the info very quickly.  Didn't feel particularly welcomed, more herded through. Felt more of an inconvenience than a guest. \nWe booked the Kixby as the rooms on their site looked spacious and airy. Believe me, they are not. We were upgraded to a king size room. You had just enough space to walk around the bed. The bathroom was tiny and the toilet was set in a recess so small, you couldn't put your elbows out!  The whole room was painted in a very dismal blue which brought the room in even more.  The windows don't open & we had to keep the blinds shut as we were looking directly into other rooms. It was quite claustrophobic. On the good side, it was very clean and the bed and pillows were very comfortable.  Paper cups to drink from rather than cups, which I don't expect at any hotel.  If you want a quiet room, make sure you're on a high floor at the back of the building. The corridors are black\/grey and very dismal. \nWe were supposed to get 2 complimentary bottles of water a day, which we didn't. We asked a lady on reception who told me that they should be left by the maid. We mentioned this on 3 consecutive days and left a note for the maid.... still no water, although she did take the tip.  Gave up in the end and bought water from the 7\/11. \nThe adjoining Black Tap served a decent burger. A Chardonnay (which was from a tin), was $16. \nThe Hilton Garden Inn next door looked much nicer and with hindsight, I wish we'd have booked there instead. \nThe hotel is very central. A minute from Maceys and a short walk from Times Square. Subway at the end of the street. \nMy personal opinion..... would I return to New York?... no. Very dirty and everywhere you go smells of cannabis.  If I did return, would I come back to the Kixby?... no.   Much nicer hotels available. \n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We searched high and low for an ideal room configuration for the four of us all over the city and were thankful to have discovered the family room at Kixby.  When you enter the room, you actually are entering a hallway.  The closet and a small enclave with a bar sized sink are both on the left.  The next door on the left is the bathroom with a walk in shower, toilet and vanity.  There is a very large bedroom with two queen size beds on the right and at the end of the hallway is another bedroom with a king size bed.  The king size room has a door on it, but the bedroom with two queens doesn\u2019t.  The queen size room is downright palatial by NYC standards!  Having the small bar sink in the enclave was nice to have since four of us were sharing one bathroom.  If anyone at the hotel is reading this, my only suggestion would be to add mirrors in the bedrooms since there are none.  As far as location goes, this can\u2019t be beat.  Tons of restaurant options all around, less than one block away from Macy\u2019s and the subway stop is at the end of the block.  It was an easy walk to Times Square and Central Park.

There were 4 of us and we had 2 adjoining rooms on the 4th floor above the main entrance. I only noted noise on 1 night, probably too tired the rest of the time and wasn't bothered by the Aircon but I sleep with a fan on at home. \nOur room was slightly bigger than the other, both lux king, but both perfectly suitable for our needs. Clean with daily service, purposeful bathroom and a great touch for my birthday from the team.\nWe didn't have much reason to speak to reception but on the occasions we did they were polite and helpful and friendly. We were booked for bed and breakfast and made full use of this but  when I return I will book a room only and explore the city. We had 2 rooms, therefore 2 charges of $250 were held pending on my credit card and we paid a half day fee to keep one of the rooms until 3pm on our last day to give us somewhere to change, use the bathroom etc this was taken from the deposit and the rest cancelled within 48 hours of our checkout.\nWe generally used the subway a lot because my partner is awaiting a knee replacement but it was so handy a few yards from the hotel. We took advantage of the ESB being so close and visited there on our first night and also ate in The black Tap attached to the Kixby on our first night which was very tasty, didn't manage to try the shakes though. \nWe would definitely stay again, the location is perfect, between 5th and 6th Avenue within easy walking distance of many attractions and away from Times Square which I wanted. Great trip overall, I will be back! ","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My second trip to NYC. \nI spent quite a while choosing the hotel as I wanted us to be centrally located but not in madness of Times Square. The location didn\u2019t disappoint. The next street from The Empire State Building yet always a fairly quiet street after returning from a day exploring.  \nOn arrival I didn\u2019t realise check in was as late as 4pm so after a long journey from the UK it was disappointing not be able to check in earlier. I just assumed it would be around 2pm which seems reasonable. 4pm is quite late, especially when you have to check out at 11am. \nI paid the tourist tax, which I was\naware of before we arrived. I was not aware of the upfront $250 deposit, but paid this on a debit card. In every other hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed in card details are kept to debit any charges at the END of the stay, not before, yet here they took the $250 off the card there and then & it didn\u2019t get returned to my account until days after I returned to the UK, which wasn\u2019t ideal.\nThe hotel itself is nice. It\u2019s clean & designed well. Once you get used to using the key card to operate the lift it\u2019s easy to get to your floor.\nThe refreshment room is a nice touch where you can get tea, coffee etc. there is a gym next door. \nThe rooftop bar area is lovely. The view of the Empire State Building is stunning.\n\nWe liked the hotel but won\u2019t be returning. \nI have travelled a lot and was very disappointed by the customer service (not staff on reception, housekeeping etc, they were fine), but the \u2018office\u2019 customer service. \nI emailed them months before our stay to ask for a twin room as I was travelling with my adult child for their birthday (I\u2019d organised & paid for the trip as a surprise). \nI was told that because I had booked the trip via BA I was unable to make changes! I\u2019ve absolutely no idea why \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nI responded that I was fully prepared to pay any additional costs, but I really needed a twin room, which I knew the hotel had. Again, I was told this wasn\u2019t possible, despite being prepared to pay.\nI had no choice but to accept the room with the one bed as I had already paid and couldn\u2019t afford to change the booking and lose the money.\nThe room we were given was very small (with one bed). The housekeeping are great though, and attended every day of our stay.\n\nThe last sting in the tail for me was that other people arrived during our stay and were upgraded to much bigger rooms, without asking, for free!! \nI was prepared to pay, I wasn\u2019t expecting anything for free, yet was told this wasn\u2019t possible, yet other people arrived and were just given alternative rooms! For this reason we will not be returning to the Kixby. I am already planning our next NYC holiday & it won\u2019t be here. The hotel is busy enough not to care, but equally there are 100\u2019s, probably 1000\u2019s, of hotels in New York. It\u2019s a saturated market with lots of choice and customer service is always at the top of the list for most people, so the hotel should bear that in mind in such a competitive market.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Check-in was quick, polite, and informative, first impressions were excellent and then we had also been upgraded from two King to two Queen rooms.  I also even got a call after check-in with something reception realized they hadn't told me.\n\nThe Rooms - Spacious, well equipped, three lamps in the room, and all had USB sockets along with three pin US wall sockets so felt safe and secure even when using a UK to US convertor.  \n\nI even found a bottle of Wine waiting for me along with a lovely note for my Birthday (celebrating my 40th a few days later) this was a lovely gesture, while I don't drink another member of the family made sure it didn't go to waste :-) \n\nThe rest of the stay - A pleasant greeting from every member of staff, the housekeeping team was polite, friendly, and efficient.  Cleanliness was excellent throughout our stay.  \n\nThe air conditioning in 511 was very effective and although it took a bit of getting used to the noise was actually very quiet for an AC Unit as big as it was.  Unfortunately, the unit in 520 was a fair bit noisier, however, it was just as efficient.  \n\nThe view from the roof of the hotel is excellent, seeing the Empire State Building that close was quite a fun experience.  The bar also seemed to be popular, although I will admit I didn't really make use of it.\n\nThe only slight hiccups we encountered were resolved with a quick call to reception, in fact, the only negative we can report is that the breakfast on paper plates and plastic cutlery with limited options wasn't what we'd expected.  However, we are aware that as the hotel doesn't have it's own kitchen it is limited in what it can provide.\n\nIf your traveling with Virgin then taking the Air Train from JFK to Jamaica station followed by the LIRR to Penn Station is by far the easiest (but not cheapest) option.\n\nOverall, I can think of no reasons not to stay at the Kixby, and if you are reading this wondering if it's a good place to stay IT DEFINITELY IS!  DO IT :-)","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel is attached to 'Black Tap', who offer excellent food, and there are a range of other good places to eat and drink nearby as well. We recommend The Liberty. The rooftop bar is a cool place but very expensive even by NYC standards.\n\nSo why only 4*? Well, unfortunately, the air-con was temperamental. It was either off entirely or on at full blast and very loud. There were controls on the unit itself but they didn't do anything, as it was instead controlled by a wall thermometer. Changing it one degree (F) seemed to be the difference between having it on or having it off entirely; it was impossible to have it at a 'low' level. \n\nNYC itself is constantly noisy and busy, so the air-con in and of itself is not disrupting an otherwise quiet paradise, but it was frustrating.

Also is just a few steps away from the Herald Square Subway Station, which from our experience can get you pretty much anywhere you\u2019d want to go. We went as far as Coney Island, Yankee stadium and pretty much everywhere in between on direct trains from this station. \n\nBreakfast is pretty much what it says (a continental breakfast) a choice of bread for toasting a range of bagels and two types of cereals, fruit etc. Perhaps could have had a more exciting choice of cereals and it\u2019s served on paper plates\/bowls with plastic cutlery. \n\nStaff are great and friendly. Would recommend and would stay again.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The friendly manager\/supervisor took care of us especially during the Drag PRIDE event which was SO much fun.  We loved it.\n\nAlso worth mentioning the Black Tap bar and kitchen - great service and the food is divine. We used it a lot.  \n\nThe shining star of this long visit has to the be the friendly, professional, attentive staff.  Also present and always helpful.  Inna stands out and deserves an accolade.  Every day we saw her she checked on us to see if we had everything we needed or could she help.  Amazing asset to have in such a boutique hotel.  We requested a late checkout and it was processed at a very decent rate.\n\nI dont recognise any of the review that make a point of elevator noise, street nouse (see comment about being in mid town NYC !) rats or lack of housekeeping.

We were not disappointed.  Stylish and unfussy and in a convenient location.  \n\nThe room was large and spacious.  We had a deluxe kingsize bed - very comfortable.  The bathroom was a little small but fine.  It had a good shower.  We were not disturbed by any noise in the corridor or other guests when in our room.  There were city noises but these are part of NYC.  We could see the Empire State Building from our window on the 11th floor.  Amazing!    As it was out of season the rooftop bar was closed but the area was open so we had it to ourselves to view the ESB even more clearly.   The fridge and heater\/AC were quite noisy.  We turned them off but you may not be able to do that in the summer\n\nWe didn't eat in the restaurant and I think the bar was closed.  As others have said, one lift always out of order but we didn't find this a problem.  \n\nCheck in was simple although later in the afternoon than we expected so we had to hang out in Herald Square for a bit.  The hotel staff were happy to store our luggage until we could check in.\n\nAll staff friendly enough.   All public areas and the bedroom very clean.  Wi-fi not a problem. \n\nI was not happy with the resort tax.  We did not want to use the gym so it worked out as an expensive way to pay for 2 bottles of water a day and hot drinks in the room.  There was a bottle of rose and some chocolates and a nice card when we arrived.  A nice touch and appreciated, however, I think we paid for it with the resort tax.  NB a deposit is taken upon check in.  This is quickly paid back when you check out.\n\nLocation is really good.  Easy walk to Broadway\/42nd St\/Times Square\/Empire State Building\/Madison Square Garden\/Macys\/5th Avenue. \n We ate at Andrew's NYC diner and the Tic Toc diner for breakfast.  Only a block or two away.  \n\nWe enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again. ","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is around 8 minute walk to Penn station, so is easy to get to and from JFK. Get the air train to Jamaica station then the king island road train to Penn station. Is around 45 minute journey give it take and much cheaper than getting a taxi or Uber.  There is a subway station in the same street of the hotel, though I preferred to use Penn station for where I went. There is plenty of places to eat either at the hotel, the same street or elsewhere. Can also buy bits and pieces from the 7\/11. It is ideally located for access too Times Square, Bryant park, Central Park, top of the rock, summit one, high line, Hudson court and more. All within walking distance. Central Park is quite a walk away so factor this in. I stayed on the 8th floor and the room was fantastic . It was very clean, spacious and comfortable. I didn\u2019t find it noisy though was situated towards the back. Hotel facilities are top notch and staff are friendly and helpful. If you got to the very top of the hotel there is an amazing view of the Empire State Building also.

Das Hotel ist wunderbar zentral, in einer Seitenstra\u00dfe mit direktem Zugang zur Metro, unmittelbar am Herald Square, Broadway und Macy\u2019s, gelegen. Wenn man das Kixby betritt hat man den Eindruck man wird zur\u00fcck versetzt in die goldenen 20er. Das ganze Hotel ist neu renoviert und trotzdem wurde der einzigartige und charmante Art d\u00e9co-Stil des Hotels erhalten. \n\nAls wir am Nachmittag von unserem ersten Rundgang, wir sind \u00fcber den Broadway am Herald Square bis zum Times Square und schlie\u00dflich weiter \u00fcber den Broadway bis zum Central Park gelaufen um schlie\u00dflich \u00fcber die 5th Avenue,  vorbei am Rockefeller Center, der St.Patricks Cathedral und dem Bryant Park, wieder zur\u00fcck zum Hotel zu gelangen.\n\nZur\u00fcck im Hotel erhielten wir unser Gep\u00e4ck, als auch Informationen und Unterlagen f\u00fcr die Stadt, sowie einige Restauranttipps (unbezahlbar) von der wirklich sehr netten Inna an der Rezeption und ein Zimmer in der 4.Etage zum Hinterhof. Einige haben geschrieben, das die h\u00f6her gelegenen Zimmer \u201ebesser\u201c seien wegen Lautst\u00e4rke und Aussicht, das hatten wir vorher nicht ber\u00fccksichtigt, aber unser Zimmer war ger\u00e4umig, wir fanden den gro\u00dfz\u00fcgigen Kleiderschrank toll und alles war sehr sauber und das Bett total komfortabel! \nWir hatten keine Schwierigkeiten mit dem schlafen, ich habe aber die Klimaanlage nachts komplett ausgeschaltet.\n\nWie bereits h\u00e4ufiger beschrieben, findet man ein gut ausgestattetes Fitnesscenter, sowie einen Raum mit Computer, Teewasser und Tee, Kaffee und einer Eisw\u00fcrfelmaschine (Eisk\u00fcbel in jedem Zimmer) auf der zweiten Etage. Aber in jedem Zimmer befindet sich auch eine Kaffeemaschine mit Kaffee- und Tee, au\u00dferdem kann man das Wasser in New York ohne bedenken trinken. Die Rooftopbar ist in der Winterzeit leider geschlossen. Diese Info hatte ich aber bereits auf der Webseite gelesen.\n\nWir hatten in unserer Buchung das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck inklusive und so haben wir den ein oder anderen Morgen einen Kaffee\/Tee und einen Bagel mit Cream Cheese und etwas frisches Obst oder Fruchtjoghurt gegessen. Es gab au\u00dferdem jeden Morgen eine sch\u00f6ne Auswahl an Muffins und Marmelade. F\u00fcr mich war das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck absolut ausreichend,da ich eher selten fr\u00fchst\u00fccke. Wer jedoch gern ein sehr \u00fcppiges Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck und eine gro\u00dfe Auswahl genie\u00dfen m\u00f6chte, der sucht sich ein Restaurant aus der Liste aus ;) \n\nDirekt neben dem Hotel liegt ein tolles Restaurant \u201eBlack Tap\u201c, man kann abends sehen, da die T\u00fcren zum Hotel ge\u00f6ffnet sind, was gegessen wird - unter anderem Burger, tolle Salate, Milchshakes zum Tr\u00e4umen.. wer etwas asiatisches bevorzugt, es liegt ein paar H\u00e4user weiter ein koreanisches Restaurant \u201eCho Dang Gol\u201c, wo man leider immer warten muss. Unmittelbar in der N\u00e4he gibt es au\u00dferdem eine Rooftopbar (Monarch Rooftop oder auf Empfehlung von Inna ein paar Meter zur Refinery Rooftop Bar laufen). Mein Freund hatte am vorletzten Tag unseres Besuches Geburtstag und wir haben eine wunderbare Karte von Inna und eine Flasche Rosesekt erhalten. Mein Schatz war begeistert \u00fcber diese tolle \u00dcberraschung und Aufmerksamkeit. An dieser Stelle nochmals Danke daf\u00fcr!\n\nLeider kommt der Tag der Abreise dann immer viel zu schnell, unser Gep\u00e4ck wurde am Vormittag von Floyd angenommen und verstaut, er war sehr aufmerksam und hat sich auch um die Bestellung unseres Taxis gek\u00fcmmert, welches uns am Nachmittag wieder zum Flughafen bringen sollte. Alles in allem war es ein wunderbarer Urlaub im sch\u00f6nen New York und hat es durch die tollen Mitarbeiter, wie Floyd und Inna, abgerundet und unvergesslich werden lassen. Wir w\u00fcrden jederzeit wieder ins Kixby kommen, wenn wir einen Trip nach New York planen.\n\nAuch nochmal Danke an Natalia und das Housekeeping, sie haben noch Dinge gefunden, welche ich im Hotelzimmer vergessen hatte!","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The one downside was that only 2 out of the 3 lifts were working and we gave up a number of times and walked the stairs. We were on the 6th floor so it added to the steps and exercise! They have a roof top bar\/terrace (bar only open from May), but you can go and sit up on the roof top and look over Manhattan. You can see the Empire State Building from the roof top and very lovely view at night. The hotel bar down on the ground floor wasn\u2019t open which was a shame.

Quite disappointed as I booked the hotel for my partner\u2019s 40th birthday and we\u2019ve been extremely underwhelmed from the moment we arrived. The rooms are significantly smaller than they look on the hotel photos. We booked a Lux King room which is one of the smallest king rooms we\u2019ve ever stayed in. Room features are basic, nothing to wow. Two small bottles of water are provided in the room upon arrival, and when they weren\u2019t replenished I phoned reception to ask for more to be told that the two provided upon arrival are complimentary but no further bottles will be provided during the stay - very strange and something I have never experienced in any hotel anywhere in the world. We also had an issue with being unable to open our safe one morning, so we phoned reception for assistance to be told they\u2019d send an engineer up right away. 20 minutes later and no one arrived, so we went to reception to ask for an update to be told the engineer was in a meeting!! Surely guests are the priority here and the meeting should be interrupted to attend to guests rather than guests having to wait around for the engineer?! We waited a total of 30 minutes for this to be resolved which was unacceptable.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m extremely disappointed by the lack of little details (such as bottled water being replenished daily) and also the lack of good service which would make a big difference. I\u2019m really upset that I chose to book the KIXBY over the other hotel choices I considered, and I would not recommend the hotel to others who enjoy good service as it doesn\u2019t seem to exist here.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The beds are very comfortable and the linen is changed every 2 days. Breakfast is simple and can be collected from the bar area and taken back to your room, if preferred, (about $22 per person). The only negative is that the air-conditioning, while effective, is very noisy and may disrupt a light sleeper. (Suggest that the Hotel look to upgrade). However, we found it a very good base for our 6 night stay and, being centrally located, allows you to explore NYC while never being too far away. Lastly, and very importantly, the staff are very friendly, efficient and helpful. We booked it as part of a British Airways joint flight\/hotel deal.

The location of the hotel within Manhattan cannot be faulted, central, close to the Empire State Building and a minutes walk from a subway station. However as other reviewers have said, the presence of black bags of rubbish along the street close by are very off putting. The smell as you walk into the street is appalling and it wasn't unusual to see homeless people going through the bags. Not the fault of the hotel but something to consider when choosing this hotel. The room (Deluxe double) was very nice. Spacious, well decorated, nicely equipped and with complimentary water and coffee. It was clean and the bathroom was spotless. The downside was that the noise of the air conditioning plant outside the room was continuous throughout the night resulting in very poor sleep quality. The in room air conditioning was also noisy but at least we could turn that off. Public areas were also clean. The hotel is trying out a complimentary continental breakfast. My view is that they should charge and put on a better breakfast. Bagels, pastries, coffee, orange juice and yogurt is ok but the quality was very average. If you are expecting a typical US hotel breakfast buffet then you are going to be very disappointed. It is self service too. I have little doubt that the reason for the change is staff shortages which are being experienced everywhere post Covid. Staff were generally pleasant and helpful with one exception. We arrived early morning before we were allowed to check in and left our bags. The member of staff on the bag storage was not at all representative of other staff. He grumbled when he saw the number of bags we had, muttered out loud when he picked up one of the bags due to its weight and had no manners (please or thank you) whatsoever. As this was our first contact with Kixby staff it wasn't a good advertisement for the hotel.\nAll in all it was an ok stay. A few areas to work on but nothing serious which spoilt our stay.

Didn't have any issues with cleanliness in the hotel or our room or any noise even though we were at the front of the hotel.  Our first few days we had access to the \"grab and go\" breakfast which was good, but then changed to fixed price menu downstairs (which we didn't use).  If you are looking for something good in the mornings, we can't fault Andrews Coffee shop which is just along the next block and had amazing choice.  The rooftop bar wasn't open - however you were still able to use the area any time of day or night.  We loved it at night, when we just wanted to finish off a days sightseeing with a few drinks to wind down.  Took our own drink & snacks and we were able to chill out with amazing views of the Empire States Building and surrounding skyline.

We did get this back at the end so I assume it is related to the condition of your room at checkout. \n\nWe were in room 420 which is next to the elevators, the dinging and other noises took some getting used to for the first couple of nights, on the subject of the elevators there are three, but the left one is currently out of order (Though there were people working on it throughout our stay), the working lifts were a bit noisy and would make you wait a while when you called one, we got in the lift to come back down from the rooftop one evening and the lift just didn\u2019t work at all interestingly. \n\nThe grab and go breakfast leaves a bit to be desired, it\u2019s just a little room on the 2nd floor with coffee, muffins and fresh fruit, that being said the muffins were lovely! Reception told us it was served 8:00am til 10:30am but it is actually served 7:30am til 9:30am so by the time we got down there a lot of stuff had gone already. \n\nNow onto the good stuff! We had champagne and chocolates on our arrival as this was our honeymoon, so that was a nice touch and turned a few heads when we took it up to the rooftop at 8:30 the following morning! The room was lovely, everything you could need for a stay in NYC, complimentary dressing gowns, big umbrella, ironing board, iron, hairdryer, fridge, safe (Which you set the pin for yourself), coffee machine with pods and other accessories, little toiletry bottles in the bathroom. The room also included a huge walk in shower which my wife loved! It was also clearly recently renovated and spotless. The only thing we would have improved would be the A\/C which as a lot of other people have mentioned is really noisy, you couldn\u2019t have it on overnight as it would keep you awake, but in the day it is very effective nonetheless. \n\nThe hotel has a rooftop bar but it wasn\u2019t open during our stay, it also seemed like it would not be open for some time but I know that hospitality in NYC has struggled since the pandemic so I can understand their hesitancy to open this, although I\u2019ve no doubt it would get a lot of custom. On the subject of bars there are two others in the hotel, Lot15 and Black Tap, these are both run by a third party and the opening hours are a bit strange (Not open Monday or Tuesday, then only open until 9:30pm other nights) but I guess this ties back to my point about hospitality in NYC at the moment. We tried both bars and they were great, the food at Black Tap must be tried as it is fantastic!\n\nWorth mentioning that the hotel has good WiFi coverage but you have to sign into it every 24 hours on each device to ensure you have Internet access, WiFi was good and we were able to video call home which was pretty much all we used it for. \n\nWe would definitely stay again and would not have wanted to stay anywhere else for our honeymoon, thank you Kixby!","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Hotel itself is nice. The best thing about it is the bedrooms, in particular the beds\u2026.. so so comfortable! Loved climbing into it after a full day sight seeing! The bedrooms were kept very clean and tidy. Bedding changed every second day and towels everyday if required. It also has a well stocked coffee machine and a fridge to store your cold drinks! I did feel the communal areas in the hotel, such as lobby\u2019s outside the bedrooms could have been cleaner though. Didn\u2019t look as if a hoover had been used in quite a while! \n\nThere is a roof terrace with fantastic views. However,I was really disappointed with  it. The hotel advertises that it has a roof top bar. I emailed the hotel to ensure this would be opened whilst we were there and was informed it would be opened on the 1st June, we arrived the 2nd! The bar was not opened and hotel said it was unlikely that it would be opened this year!!! Please bear this in mind if this is what you are looking for in a hotel. You can take your own drinks or get them from the bar downstairs, really not the experience I was expecting though! \n\nThere is a bar\/restaurant but this was closed most nights of our stay, only managed to visit once as it was closed for private functions or not opened that night! When we asked about it we were told, well there is other bars down the street! Don\u2019t advertise that you have these facilities if your guests can\u2019t use them! \n\nOverall the hotel itself is in a good location , the bedrooms are fab but I feel there is nicer areas to stay in! View outside our window was of a very dirty street, with quite a few homeless people which had camped up across the street( very sad to see). There is a subway very close, so great for getting around!

OK I'm not picky like some people but if anyone has a complaint it was certainly not my experience.\nArrived 2 pm on the Monday and room was ready despite being before official check in time. A bottle of complimentary cava in an ice bucket was waiting for me. Coffee machine,fridge,safe, dressing gowns, umbrella and fancy toiletries were a great bonus.\nSlept really well in the comfy bed and air conditioning was welcome in a climate hotter than Scotland! It may be the city that never sleeps but I certainly did every night and despite it's central location was surprisingly quiet.\nThe next morning was up early and enjoyed free breakfast of muffins,cereal bars, fruit, orange juice and coffee. Gave the gym a bypass but great facility for anyone who appreciates that sort of thing.\nAfter a busy day got a bottle of wine and filled an ice bucket to take to the rooftop. Bar there wasn't opening till June but it is a fantastic space with stunning views of the Empire State Building just a street away.\nThen I went to the downstairs bar which I frequented every night it was open. My friends were in another hotel and after packed days often just wanted to relax in the evenings. Lewis (Louis?) the barman deserves a special mention as he was not only friendly but engaged me in really interesting conversations which I'm sure was above his job description.!He works hard and is an asset to the business.\nAll the staff were friendly and helpful from cleaning staff to receptionists and Floyd who stored my bags at checkout on the lsdt day and arranged a taxi to the airport.\nIn summary, fantastic hotel in a stunning location, great room, brilliant staff and if I ever go back would be my first choice.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Booked a package through Virgin. The hotel location is great for sight seeing and exploring as very central within Manhattan and subway station is just down the street. \n\nWe found check in to be quite frosty (not the famous American welcome we had expected!). Stayed on the 10th floor. The room was very clean, seems to have been newly furnished and the decor was very nice, however, photos on the website from Virgin and the hotel were quite deceptive in terms of the space in the room, we had chosen the hotel VS another due to the appearance of a more spacious room. We weren\u2019t in the room a huge amount but it did get a bit annoying having to shuffle around each other. There was also no mirror in the room and so nowhere to style hair if needing a plug so dashing between the bathroom mirror and plug socket to check for missed bits was a bit of a pain. The beds and linens were very comfortable and very welcome after a full day in the city. \n\nBeing in the centre of the city there is street noise, mainly horns and sirens which you can obviously hear at night time, we did find that the air con was needed so used overnight. As mentioned by others the air con was very noisy but we found the constant sound from that was better than the street noise at night time as your brain seemed to be able to switch off from it. If you\u2019re sensitive to noise though you may benefit from earplugs. \n\nThe grab and go breakfast was very welcome, we took a coffee, (huge!) muffin and fruit most days which was really handy especially with an early start for sight seeing. \n\nWe\u2019d definitely stay at the hotel again, mainly due to location, cleanliness and comfort rather than service as we didn\u2019t find this especially friendly or helpful. A couple of niggles could be improved upon to improve the rooms but overall a good stay. \n\nThe Duane Reade on 6th Avenue is handy if needing water, snacks, medications etc, Keens steakhouse on 36th is a must visit (but book in advance if you want to be guaranteed a table) and Barn Joo across the street from the hotel does amazing Korean food if you are looking for something local.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Other doors closing were quite loud and we could clearly hear neighbors talking in the hall but not in their rooms - fortunately our neighbors came and went at reasonable times so it did not disturb us a bit. Breakfast was grab-and-go fruit and muffins, which was all we needed. I would have loved other tea options.

It was more like the kind of unit found in a budget motel\n- the TV is very small and the sound is really poor quality, trying to listen to it was impossible\n- the breakfast was very disappointing.

I think we were expecting a little more for its 4* rating but I highly suspect this is their own rating, not an official one. We stayed at the 5* Conrad last time which was miles superior. I would say this is a 3* at best. The road it\u2019s on is a little run down but it is in a good location, 20 minutes to Central Park, 10 mins from Times Square, 5 mins from Madison square gardens and about $15 to most other places around Manhattan. \n\nThe room was ok, quite spacious and very clean. The aircon was so incredibly loud, you\u2019d not be able to sleep a wink if you wanted it on through the night. The TV was tiny and the sound quality was dreadful. The front doors slam hard if left which rattled through the rooms, makes you jump every time another guest comes or goes from their rooms. There was no mirror at all in the bedroom, only on the back of the bathroom door which is totally unacceptable. I asked the less than helpful staff for ear plugs, a kettle and a small mirror. We never got any of it. Fair enough they don\u2019t have a kettle, they don\u2019t really use them but ear plugs and a spare mirror, especially as half the place is currently being renovated, they must of had 1 small mirror somewhere!! The bathroom was fine, shower was always hot and it was spacious. \n\nWe didn\u2019t have the grab & go breakfast at all but did make use of the 24\/7 hot water and coffee on level 2. When the hot water was full, it was often empty. We did take room service one night which was really expensive and my chicken wings were as tough as leather. The burger my boyfriend had he enjoyed though. \n\nWe slept well and felt clean so that is the most important. It\u2019s just not quite luxurious enough for our tastes, we like a doorman and staff that go above and beyond. This had hostel type vibes. But, it was cheap so we definitely got what we paid for.

The bathroom has tiled flooring which is very cold so I recommend taking some slippers or something to slip your feet in whilst using the bathroom. Your rooms have the towels chained daily but your bedding is only changed every third day. You\u2019re told to keep the bottles of water which are in your room on arrival as they won\u2019t be replaced and you can refill on level 2 24 hours a day.The manager of the reception is quite rude and unwelcoming whereas Maria is so kind and lovely and would try to help in any way she could. Breakfast is described as continental but it\u2019s simply assorted flavour muffins, breakfast bars and some fruit. Tea and Coffee are available 24 hours a day on level 2. Alternatively, there is a coffee shop at the end of 35th street next to Macy\u2019s called Andrew\u2019s coffee shop which is very nice and have friendly staff. You could go up to the rooftop to see the Empire State but it was shut and so were the cocktail bar and restaurant which was also a let down. On a more positive note, The Kixby is in an ideal location for site seeing. The subway is easily accessible from the Kixby. \nThere\u2019s places I didn\u2019t manage to see whilst in New York so can\u2019t wait to return to New York but whilst there is still many covid restrictions in place it won\u2019t be for a few years.

Check in very fast and efficient although we found the staff here weren't as welcoming as other hotels we've stayed at in NYC, entrance to hotel extremely clean and modern. Our room was on the 7th floor, it was huge probably the biggest hotel room we've had in any hotel we've stayed in to date which was great. We had 2 bedrooms - 2 double beds in one room and another double bed in a separate bedroom. Views of the empire state from the window were amazing - especially on Valentines day where it lit up red with a 'heartbeat'.\nSmall box of chocolates in room on arrival as it was mine and my sons birthdays whilst here which was lovely. Rooftop bar was not open due to time of year however could still go up there to see the views of the ESB which was amazing!\nLiterally a few steps from the subway, Herald Sq.\/Macy's\/MSG etc which was fab for sightseeing and shopping. Given a voucher for a free breakfast at Black Tap on arrival at check in, however i don't recommend breakfast there as it was terrible! Very little options (croissant, baked beans and pain au chocolat) Would not have paid for that breakfast! The milkshakes there however, were amazing and definitely worth every cent!\nRooms were warm and air con also worked well, however it was -8 when we were there so the air con didn't get used a great deal. \nAdvisory i'd give of the hotel was that the windows were old and thin and so it sounded like they were completely open when they were not as the street noise was so loud. I spent the first few days trying to figure out ways to block the noise out at night, but i was woken at least 4 times per night the entire trip. The best bet is to put the heater\/air con on to drown the noise out a little of the rubbish carts and vehicles.\n\nOverall I would possibly stay here again, but only if guaranteed a room on the highest floor away from the road.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

This was probably the problem I had with our stay......the room with Virgin was classed as \"premier\" and at time of booking I would have expected our room to be as described on the virgin website, which is actually the hotel's old \"classic\" room. However from booking to arriving I had seen the transformation from Metro to Kixby and was hoping for a new room, even though these are classed as \"Lux\" by the hotel.\nOn arrival I was disappointed to find we had been allocated a classic room, but equally delighted with the view of the Empire State Building, and the lovely fizz, card and chocolates. However, the downside to the view was the street noise, its a busy city so be aware of the level of noise you can hear.\nThe room had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, but it was niggling about Virgin's room classification and I sent Virgin an email, as I don't believe, it was right to complain to the hotel. However when I spoke to reception they had received communication from Virgin and explained we had been given a bigger room, with the view. The next day they then offered us an upgrade to a new room free of charge (Soni must have been sick of me, but he didn't show it).  We had a look at the room, and they are lovely, and made our classic look tired and shabby. If we hadn't already spent a few nights in our first room, and hadn't been so tired from sight seeing, I would have swapped, and thought this was a generous gesture. Which kind of sums the Kixby up, quite understated, relaxed, but underlying good customer service.\nThe front of desk staff are reserved, but polite and willing to help, (extra coat hangers, sorted; broken blind fixed immediately; lost remote control, replaced straight away)  you just have to ask. The guys on the door were excellent, really friendly and helpful. Cleanliness of the room was great at first, but did start to notice a slip by the end of the week, such as toiletries not replaced, cleanliness standard drop and the removal of the tv remote, but we put this down to staff levels at this testing time of Covid 19 as by the end of our stay, the city was bracing for lockdown and must have affected staff availability. \nIt was really sad leaving and saying goodbye to the guys on the door, knowing the hotel was closing for the lockdown,\nThe hotel has a great location for all the sights, and the subway is seconds away, with a few bars and restaurants close by. Lot15 was lovely, and staff in there are great, especially the girl who had lived in manchester ( sophie?). \nOnce the hotel transforms totally into the Kixby and leaves the Metro behind, this would be 5 rated.","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Check in was easy and hassle free. \n\nWe booked a classic queen room. From reading previous trip advisor reviews, we noticed many guests had been upgraded to these new rooms. We were hoping this would happen to us as it was my partners birthday whilst staying at the hotel however this wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nThe room itself was spacious but very dated - carpet was grubby, curtains\/blinds dirty and windows had clearly not been cleaned in a long time. The room is in desperate need of renovation however I understand the hotel is in the process of this. The room had many amenities including coffee machine, mini fridge, iron\/ironing board, hairdryer and safe. However, there were no drinks in the mini fridge. The bed was comfortable but seemed small compared to other hotels we\u2019ve previously stayed in in New York. However, one of the main problems with the room was the air conditioning unit. It was impossible to get the room to stay the right temperature meaning you\u2019d go to bed freezing but wake up boiling. The AC unit was also very loud. In audition to this, the hotel lobby and corridors were absolutely boiling 24\/7. Moreover, the room was at the front of the hotel meaning we had a lot of road\/traffic noise which was extremely loud - if you\u2019re going to stay here definitely ask for a room at the back of the hotel. \n\nThe bathroom was extremely small and cramped with no room to move around. However, it had all necessary amenities including shampoo, shower gel, shower cap, cotton buds etc. It was clean and pleasant enough. \n\nOn check in we were given a voucher for a complimentary continental breakfast - ?not sure why but was a nice touch. However, the breakfast was disappointing. There was a fairly varied choice of cereals, pastries, bagels\/muffins and fruit - but the quality of these were poor. The milk was also more like water which put us off having cereal. We therefore didn\u2019t eat here again - there\u2019s plenty of places in New York for breakfast. \n\nThe staff at the hotel were okay - not overly friendly and nothing special. Apart from the doormen who were always friendly and polite. \n\nOverall, great location for all of the main tourist attractions. The subway is 30 seconds away, Times Square 8-10 minutes, 5th Avenue 5 minutes, Top of the Roc 10-15 minutes etc. However, let down by dated room, poor AC unit and loud noise all night from nearby streets. \n\nJust to add there is a rooftop bar however due to going in March this wasn\u2019t open during our trip. However, we did go up and take in the views of the Empire State which were amazing.\n\nTo conclude, we would stay in the hotel again as the location was amazing but not in a classic room, instead in one of the new renovated rooms (as long as the AC\/windows were also upgraded).

What we actually got was a very tired and scruffy room with stained carpets and shabby paintwork and an air-conditioning unit that didn't turn off. \nI asked for a quiet room but was given a room on the 12th floor next to the lift shaft from which a very loud rumble could be heard at regular intervals. I requested to move once I heard the noise but was advised there were no rooms to move to. \nWe tried to turn the air con unit off but found the only way to reduce the temperature in the room was to turn it to cool which made it sound like a jet engine. Not pleasant or relaxing. The hair drier had less force than a hand held fan, this was changed upon request for a new one. The towels are tiny, they just about covered me and I am a size 10, there were no bathrobes however on Instagram they claim there are bathrooms in all rooms. \nAfter reading the amount of comments on here from people who have been upgraded or had complimentary breakfast vouchers I feel this is a different hotel to the one we stayed at. The staff on reception were not friendly or helpful, they could have made the effort to move us the following day when a room became available, but they did nothing. \nIn short, it is in a good location and if you are lucky enough to have one of the new rooms and be chosen for special attention then it is probably a good hotel, our experience was negative and I wouldn't return or recommend it mainly due to the poor treatment by the staff.  There are many other hotels in New York, just as close to Times Square and subway stations to choose from.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Would be good to have 1 in the room somewhere so others can use it to get ready. \nThe convenience room on the 2nd floor was great for coffees and teas. \nLocation of the hotel was brilliant which was a major thing when booking this hotel and they even sorted our taxi to JFK on our final day.\nFinally, housekeeping wasn\u2019t great, we were woken most days by vacuuming of the hallway outside the room around 8am, refills of the coffee machine was mixed -  some days we had 3 coffees, 1 tea, others we had a good mix, some days cups weren\u2019t left so we got them from the convenience room and then the final day it wasn\u2019t even topped up. We also kept finding her hair dotted around the room, ie on the bedding, by the sink etc. \nAnd on the final day, housekeeping knocked on 3 times before 11am to see if we had vacated, surely on your final day they would know to come in after the checkout time.\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay again but in the hope housekeeping is improved.

The rooms were clean, the service was excellent and we even had a bottle of champagne waiting for us with a welcome note and a congratulations. We did unfortunately have to move from our excellent room to a smaller one because of a burst pipe, which was annoying as the larger room was much fancier - but couldn\u2019t be helped the the hotel, a burst pipe is a burst pipe! We never used the hotel bar or food as we were out each evening, so I cannot comment on these facilities.\n\nThe staff were very friendly, offering advice and going out of their way to help move stuff from room to room. The door staff were excellent too and always positive. With regards to location, the Empire State is a block over, Macy\u2019s and further shopping is at the end of the street, the tube station is also a minute walk away from the front entrance, and finally, Times Square is a 10 minute walk away through some excellent shops and architecture.\n\nOther than not staying in the same room we arrived at, the experience was amazing!","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon arrival we were greeted by two ladies who were pleasant enough but a smile and welcome to the city would have been nice. The concierge staff were super friendly throughout our stay though and always greeted us everytime we walked past them.\nCheck in was fast but I think $250 security deposit was a little steep in my opinion. We were given our room number and key and were pointed to the elevator. We had to figure out for ourselves it was the 11th floor. Coffee room with pods topped up daily. Again very appreciated. \n\nThe roof top bar was closed but you can still go up to take in the view. Excellent view of the empire state building as it's one block away. \n\nThe location of this hotel is perfect if you want to be near times square but not in the centre of the noise. Its only a 10min walk away. We also walked uptown to central park by staying on 6th avenue. Quite a long walk but a great way to see buildings and shops. \nWe then braved the subway and used the city mapper app to get around. Super easy to understand. \n\nOn our last morning we took advantage of a free complimentary continental breakfast at the black tap restaurant right next door. The general menu looked really good but we didnt try it as we were out all day every day away from the hotel. \n\nOverall we had a pleasant and comfortable  stay and I probably would use the hotel again as it served our needs. The only suggestions I would make for management to consider is 1\/ have city maps available for first timers 2\/ invest in soft closing mechanisms for each door to the rooms. The heavy and loud closing of neighbours doors woke us up a few times. \n\nI will be recommending this hotel to friends and family and hope to come back again one day.\n","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We slept every night with ease and confront. Not 100% sure or not but the room we stayed in (816) was slightly, or definitely seemed outdated. We knew it was going through a changed but not 100% sure if the whole place had been completed. It was clean, tidy and really enjoyed our stay. I\u2019d say the only downfall would be the noise (we actually stayed at the back of the hotel and I know this can\u2019t be helped). The breakfast buffet available in the black tap was good, lots of choice and something for everyone. Evening meal & menu at the Black Tap was also very excellent, their Crazyshake menu is to die for!! \nThis hotel is very central which we were pleased about. Not once did we catch a cab. Everything is in walking distance, shopping, Empire State Building (which if you go to the Pent House roof top at this hotel you will get an astonishing view!), Times Square and Broadway is all just a short walk. The subway is moments away within a 2 minute walk, with all the stops go from this route to the main places in NYC. \nI would rate this hotel 8\/10 and would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in NYC, and would definitely come back here.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Plenty of drawer space and the free coffee throughout your stay and complimentary refreshments on arrival were an unexpected but great addition. Would I stay here again, without a doubt. So much so, my partner made a reservation for myself and our daughter in a lux queen queen room through Trivago for another 4 night stay from the 2\/3\/2020 at a fantastic price using the early bird option once Trivago directs you to your own site. My partner realised he hadn\u2019t entered his email correctly on the booking once it was confirmed so emailed yourselves to advise of this. As he had no reply he did call the reservation team just to check the booking did go through. Our booking was found and the lady asked my partner to check if the confirmation had came through once amended. On checking this my partner noticed\nthere was a difference in the price to what he had booked through Trivago . The lady proceeded to say that the booking wasn\u2019t made through Trivago, but directly through your website. This was not the case ( Trivago automatically directs you through to your website). My partner had emailed a screenshot of the booking which clearly shows the price but is yet to receive a reply.

The hotel was just finishing up it's refurbishing. The lobby was a warm inviting space, check in was efficient  and happily checked me in early. If this wasn't possible they were able to hold your luggage whilst you explored. The situation of the hotel itself is perfect. Two blocks away from the empire state building in central Manhattan most of the tourist attractions weren't too far away. \n\nWe had a slight issue the first night when another guest of the hotel was assigned to my already occupied room which resulted in them entering my room. The staff were apologetic and rectified the situation accordingly. The also then supplied me with complimentary breakfast for the rest of my stay. \n\nThe room was comfortable and cleaned daily, complimentary soft drinks were supplied in the room along with a coffee machine. Bathroom was clean and modern. \n\nThe cleaning staff are eager to get on with their day so make use of the do not disturb sign. As on my last day i had 2 cleaners enter my room before 9.30am as i forgot to place the do not disturb on the door. \n\nAll in all i had a good stay. However i have to say the highlight of my stay was a young man called Leo. He was concierge\/doorman on most of the days i stayed. He was helpful and went out of his way to accommodate any questions or recommendations i requested. His attitude and work ethic was refreshing and honestly would leave me smiling after talking with him. I hope he manages to go far within your company as he is a fantastic member of your staff.

The noise prevented us from opening the window so we had to use the air conditioning, which we found rather noisy. We were also woken at midnight one night and one o\u2019clock in the morning on the following night by the noise of the bar furniture being dragged around in the room above us.

I checked back on TA a few times before we went and noted that the hotel was or had been going through a re-furb so expected some disruption, but it was mostly completed when we stayed. We arrived slightly earlier than the stated check in time of 4pm but were able to check in to our room a few hours early. Our room was on the 2nd floor and had been recent redecorated. \nWhile simple it had everything, a large comfy bed, bathroom and space to unpack and store cases, we were easily able to drop our things and go straight out exploring. We had a very packed trip so were often up early and didnt return to late in afternoon, each day we had fresh towels, room cleaned and bed made. Decor was good and was in keeping with the revamped dark look the hotel has re-modelled itself to. The room does have air con which for us was a bit annoying and noisy on occasion, the temperature when we were there was mixed but in between 16-21 degrees. The things that we didn't particularly like were the size of the towels which were no bigger than a hand towel, a bath sheet size would've been better. The noise the toilet makes when it flushes and re-fills was so loud it reverberated through the entire room vibrating the desk in the room. I never heard a similar noise from other rooms, either its well insulated that you dont notice others or our neighbours were too polite to say 'what is that racket?' very noticeable in the middle of the night i thought. \nWe stayed over a weekend and the friday\/saturday evenings were pretty noisy, as were were only on 2nd floor any noise from the lobby or hall is easily heard at our room so a few nights, coupled with the jet lag the noise was annoying and kept me awake. \nThe hotel was just doing the final touches to its re-furb which meant the main staircase was out of action so initially our only choice was the lift to our floor, further investigations discovered the service stairs which we ended up using all the time as the lifts were as others have note were slow, unreliable and frequently packed with other stayers. One occasion i jumped in at floor 2 after expecting to go to the lobby, it was filled with about 5 others who were a little flustered apparently trying to get to the higher floors. The lift then went to basement where one of the maids assured us we should just keep pressing the buttons till we get to where you wanted, fortunately its next stop was lobby so i nipped out and thought never again! \nThe hotel is ideally located just behind the empire state building, for us this was a good base from which to explore NY. Black tap have recently opened next door which meant we didnt have to go far searching for food on our first night.\nAll staff were very helpful, including printing our boarding passes for our flights home and while we didnt use the doorman service too much we noted that the chap was very helpful and friendly","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We decided on our next visit to NYC we would stay at the Metro. In the interim, the hotel underwent a major renovation and upon our return, the deco-style, elegant lobby we remembered has been replaced by a more contemporary design. The lovely cocktail bar\/restaurant evoking a mid-20th century charm has become  a \"fast-food\" like eatery. We are guessing the hotel management decided the previous version of the Metro may have had a \"tired\" look and needed a face lift, of sorts. In my humble opinion, they made an error by not investing in a makeover of its original design, reminiscent of the days of Cole Porter. \n\nIn addition, the management offered us an upgrade to a larger room. This was very kind of them, but they gave the room, in error, to a friend of ours who was traveling with us. It took two days to correct this mistake. The manager of the hotel at first advised us that it might not be possible to fix the problem.Then shortly afterwards, we were told we would be given the same upgraded room, one floor above, because our room was going to be used for a marketing event the next day. Our first reaction was why couldn't the hotel use the room one floor above for their presentation. The next day, the hotel apparently decided to do that, and we were able to stay in our original upgraded room. Overall, our room was comfortable and the bathroom great, very spacious.\n\nWith the exception of the first two days, the remaining eight days of our stay were pleasant. We were offered vouchers for complementary continental breakfast; very nice, but would recommend they add a hot option, for example scrambled eggs and bacon and extend breakfast an hour, from 10am to 11am.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

I didn't go to NY to watch telly though so it's not a big deal, but it would be too noisy for some. Very well located with a lovely Burger restaurant called \"The Black Tap\" attached and I think part of the refurbishment includes a breakfast bar behind reception. They used the service elevator to serve the bar when they could and we never waited long for one to arrive. The staff were always friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The bed was massive and very comfortable, the pilllow was the most comfortable I've ever slept on. There was a safe in the room and we were given a few soft drinks in the fridge on arrival but they weren't restocked after that. The hot drink machine in our room was replenished every morning though. All in all, a great location not far from Times Square and all that Midtown Manhattan had to offer and I would stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

I had to be moved from my original room due to a broken safe, but staff handled this efficiently.\n\nThe hotel no longer offers complimentary breakfasts, but that wasn't too much of a problem as rooms have fridges so you can organise your own; there are also good options locally (including the terrific Andrews Coffee Shop a little further down the street). They're currently renovating the ground floor, but other than a bit of noise and mess during the day this didn't really affect things.\n\nThe big frustration this time was the lift problem and the redesign of the roof terrace. One of the 3 lifts was out of order for the whole stay, and the 2 remaining lifts were slow, rather creaky, and sometimes too full of guests, staff, housekeeping trolleys and equipment to get on. When I stayed here last time I was on a low floor so just used the stairs when the lifts broke, but this time there was no access due to the renovations. \n\nThere's now a very energetic rooftop bar open to non-guests, which is a shame as previously this was a lovely space with plenty of seating areas where you could read, relax or actually have a conversation. It was shut for private functions a couple of times during my stay, and on the other times I went there was loud music and so many people it felt like a night-club. I spent a lot of time there last time but unfortunately had to stay away this trip.\n\nThe other downside of the new bar is the number of non-hotel guests now using the 2 remaining lifts. It's a bit annoying when you can't get to your own room because you're at the back of a queue of revellers trying to get up to the Look-out. I lost count of the number of times random tipsy people asked me 'so what's the hotel like?' as they headed down from the roof. The lifts could have done without the extra traffic!\n\nI'm very fond of this hotel and its lovely staff, location and style. Unfortunately getting to and from rooms was really frustrating this time, and selling the roof as a party destination for non-guests is a bit off-putting. I'd like to think I'll stay here again, but will probably be checking out nearby hotels too.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"NONE"}

We were happy with our stay until we checked out and got to the airport and realised that money was missing.\n\nWe had a substantial amount of US dollars in cash in the safe in 2 rooms (the other safe wasn't working). As we travelled as a group we each took money out each day that I looked after. The rest of the money stayed in the safe. We all knew how much we started with and exactly how much we'd spent. At the airport we looked at how much money we should have left and it was out, for the whole group by $310.\n\nWe checked and re-checked, counted and re-counted and we all agreed that unfortunately there was no other explanation, the money must have been stolen from the safe.\n\nWhen we got home I emailed the hotel explaining what had happened. They emailed straight back saying they take feedback very seriously and asked me to fill out an incident form. I did this and emailed it straight back. One week later I'd heard nothing so send another polite email chasing it up. Still nothing. Another 3 weeks passed with no reply so i emailed saying I was really disappointed no-one had even bothered to reply and I'd be writing a review on TripAdvisor. They emailed me back immediately (funny that!) saying they'd carried out an investigation and found nothing, and gave me the phone number of the local police department.\n\nI realise that we won't get any money back, but I doubt they even looked in to this. We are very disappointed, we loved our first visit to New York but feel very angry and upset that a huge amount of money was stolen from the safe, and the hotel did not even care.\n\nWe obviously don't know which staff were responsible for this, but if you have already booked to go there, our advice would be not to leave any cash in the safe as it won't be safe there. If you haven't booked yet, do not stay at hotel metro!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

On check out the next day (I decided to move to Hilton next door) someone mentioned the temporary guest lounge. I had not been advised of this facility but when I went to have a look felt it was not not worth spending any time there as there was just over brewed coffee and hot water,and tea bags.

On returning to the hotel after our day out going back to the room we immediately felt the gloom so went back to reception and requested an upgrade and paid extra to move to a Premier King room,  there was absolutely no comparison between the two rooms , the Premier King we got was at least three times the size of the queen room we had and had much better light and we were very happy with this room.  Apart from the room the only other part of the hotel available due to the renovations was the roof top bar which appears not to be run by the hotel so if there is a private function hotel guests have no access to it, and outside guests have priority,  anyway although a lovely area it is badly run and very expensive.

The staff in the bar seemed badly organised and there were a few errors, which were quickly rectified.\n\nOverall, we would recommend the Metro Hotel.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Generally, a good experience and if I find myself back in NY I will happily stay here again. \n\nUpon arrival the receptionist checked us in, very quickly and efficiently and gave us some general points, like complementary drinks we will find in our room, where the safe is, coffee facilities 24\/7 in the reception area and so on. \n\nThe hotel, I believe has 12 floors and our room was on the 10th floor. The hotel is still undergoing a massive refurbishment, however there was absolutely no noise of that at any point during our stay. We also noticed that although the rooms next to us on both sides were occupied we could not hear the occupants or their television in the evening, which for us was a really positive point.  Having said that though, although on the 10th floor the traffic noise unfortunately is very present and on a 24 hour basis. I didn\u2019t mind it at all, however my partner found it very difficult to sleep uninterrupted and found himself awake quite a few times throughout the night due the traffic\/sirens noise.  I will be completely honest and definitely not recommend this hotel if you want a quiet night\u2019s sleep. In the hotel\u2019s defence though, they are refurbishing so if the windows are changed, it will hopefully improve the outside noise situation. \n\nThe room (and bathroom) was very neat and clean with the right amount of furniture and a very comfortable bed, beddings and pillows. However we did noticed that the room and bathroom were also very tired but again this will probably change once the refit is finished. Housekeeping did a brilliant job with keeping the room clean and tidy whilst there and although we were happy to use our towels more than once (so left them hanging on the hooks rather that leaving them on the floor) they provided us with clean, fluffy towels the entire time we were there. Only complaint is the temperature of the room, which we found to be too hot and when attempted to turn the heating down it would just default back to the set temperature. At the end we decided to just turn off the heating which dropped the temperature to a comfortable level. \n\nThe hotel\u2019s location is ideal in midtown Manhattan (Koreatown to be precise); there is a list of things to see\/visit in walking distance ranging from 2 mins walk to one hour and 10 mins if you are brave enough to walk all the way down to lower Manhattan and Ground Zero. Also, it has a lot of amenities and places to eat in the area around it and as a bonus if you are lucky your room window will face the Empire State Building which is literally on the next block over. There is a subway station pretty much outside the hotel (100m on your right when exiting the hotel) and loads of cabs once you hit the avenues either on the left or right side of the hotel).\n\nThere is currently no offer of breakfast at the hotel due to the refit so cannot comment on that.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable stay, a nice hotel that will happily book again and efficient, and in the majority, very friendly staff.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's not a 5 star hotel but there were improvements from last year. There were refurbishment works and the hotel is starting to belong to this century. The beds are extremely comfortable, a dream to sleep in. The rooms look much nicer but the finishes leave a lot to be desired and, if you're a clumsy person, you could easily break things that are literally hanging on for dear life like the thermostat on the wall for example. The housekeeping is great, as are the housekeepers. The rest of the staff are nice enough. Now, when we booked this hotel we weren't aware we wouldn't be able to have breakfast in the premises and instead we'd be given vouchers for a deli around the corner. The breakfast selection was one of the reasons why we chose this hotel again so this was a let down as you're only allowed a bagel\/muffin and an orange juice\/coffee. The service at this place isn't great and the ordering system is confusing to say the least. Also, you may be used to be let into your room earlier like many hotels would allow you to - forget about that here. Not a single minute earlier than 4pm (at least!) so don't rush here from the airport thinking you'll be that lucky. All in all it is an average hotel, which is good and it I'd say it is good value for the low price you pay.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

In addition, the  top deck provides a spectacular view on the Empire State Building. We had a nice size room, comfortable and very quiet,  with a modern bathroom. The hotel has charm and I can imagine that after the renovation is completed, it would be one of the top choices for me to stay in the city. I give the hotel 4 stars (instead of 1 or 2, as I was originally tempted), because I hope that the Metro hotel can become a perfect place, despite the problems that we experienced.\n\nSomething is happening with aging, otherwise attractive hotels  in Manhattan. They lately became more expensive than usual (maybe because of the renovations). Most often the heating\/AC does not work ( as it was the case with our room at the Metro), the electricity in the room may go off (it happened to us, too,  at the Metro, but it was fixed twice and immediately).\n Hotels under renovation\/that are aging, must have staff that will be willing to make up for (temporary) shortcomings, to make guests comfortable and welcome.  They should train staff to be polite and accommodating. When we complained about \"no heating\" in our room, a repairman was sent and became skeptical about fixing it. I asked if he could bring a portable heater, he said yes, and he left, and did not come back. After a while I was in the lobby and complained about the broken heater, the front desk person said categorically:\n \"we do not have portable heaters\", \nthen I asked:\n \"could I have then a new room\"?\nshe answered: \n\"you were in the room for many hours, and our staff that makes the rooms is gone, and if we move you, then we cannot make your room. We cannot give you a new one\"...  what a ridiculous explanation...\nhmmm, I said \"what I can do, I can write a bad review on Tripadvisor\",\n she said \"you can write any review you want\"...\nI went back to my room, and I called the hotel asking for the manager:\n\"the manager is gone for a day\" - another front desk person replied.  I demanded a solution, and complained about the lack of staff that could be helpful; he finally said: \"a portable heater is being sent to your room\"...  I asked \" what was the story about not having portable heaters\", he answered: \"we are not supposed to make them available but we are making an exception\".  An exception? A hotel that has broken heating system, should have a storage full of portable heaters. In a few minutes a portable heater was brought in... \n\nStill, the unnecessary, upsetting interaction will stay in my memory. Metro hotel, you can do better. I wish you better.

It\u2019s not often but on the whole about 10 times over the years. No matter if the room was large or small it was always well designed for the space and made for a pleasant stay. I also enjoy the rooftop deck and midtown location. The staff at the front desk were always gracious and friendly and the breakfast light but good.\n\nThis trip has been a disappointment. \n\nThe room is fine except for the bathroom. The shower has a slow drain. There is no hook on the door. There is no separate place to store clean towels. Other rooms usually have a shelf. In this case all clean towels are on the one rack leaving no space to hang towels in use. The flush handle on the toilet is hard to reach. The toilet paper holder is loose.\n\nOh, and the pillows were neck breakers. No soft alternative.\n\nThere has always been light breakfast offered. We received notice that the restaurant was not open but nothing was said about no breakfast. Even though the restaurant is closed we thought breakfast would have been provided because no cooked food was ever offered. Breakfast was usually yogurts, fruits and muffins.\n\nOur biggest problem was the supervisor at the front desk. But first let me give a short review of what happened with our reservation made through Tripadvisor and Booking.com. \n\nWe made a reservation for two nights and got a great deal at $441. Booking.com brought up a credit card, likely the last one we used. I didn\u2019t pay close attention to the number because Booking.com said they would not charge the account till we were at the hotel.\n\nTwo days before our trip I got an email notification that the reservation was canceled due to an invalid card. Several months ago my bank replaced two cards due to a fraud alert. I figured it was one of those cards and called the number in the email from a Booking.com to get it straightened out. The number was actually the Hotel Metro and they refused to assist. Said I had to call the third party who booked the room. It would have been helpful if Booking.com had included their phone number in the notification.\n\nConcerned about getting rooms, I went onto Booking.com trying to reach someone and couldn\u2019t figure out how to get help so I just made another reservation for Hotel Metro. Didn\u2019t get the same good price. Ended up with something like $553. I grabbed a card, in this case a debit card and made the reservation. Again, it said they would not charge the card ahead. \n\nI was surprised then to see an inexplicable $397 hit my debit card that day. I figured we could sort that out when we checked in.\n\nAfter a long train trip we arrived and asked about the $397. Turns out Hotel Metro now has a $250 security deposit and the $397 first night with tax etc. I was confused because I thought the price quote from Booking.com included tax. I will go back and check.\n\nAnyway, not wanting the rest of the room charge and security deposit to go on the debit card, we gave a credit card. The supervisor at the front desk put the entire amount on the card $825. After we realized she had done that we asked about reversing the charge to the debit card. She was cold, unfriendly and showed no empathy about the fact that we had been double charged and might not get the resolution that day as it was the weekend. \n\nTurns out we did get the credit same day but her attitude was just unacceptable for the hospitality industry.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Bed was comfortable but the heating ~ air con unit was extremely noisy so tried to avoid using this.

(See my review of Hotel Excelsior). The travel consultant was very enthusiastic and so were we when we saw the convenient location, a few blocks from the Theatre District and practically next door to the Empire State Building. Sadly, she either was not aware or neglect to mention that the hotel is undergoing complete refurbishment. We ended up on the yet to be renovated 6th floor, so the dust, noise and pungent chemical smells of the 4th and 5th floor works permeated 24\/7. The room itself, although  very compact, was reasonably well-equipped and proved adequate to our needs for three nights. The lower floors which were already finished looked far more modern and it would have been a reasonable gesture to move us when I complained about the early noise, smells and dust. The Metro's own restaurant was closed during the works and FWIW, the top floor gym and roof terrace (with its view of the ESB) were also fairly shabby. Perhaps as a result of this hotel half life, we found the staff very disengaged and disinterested in our experience of our stay? With the exception of porter Shawn, even our cute five year old found it hard to raise a smile - something we had never experienced in many years of staying in NYC. Our final morning proved the nadir as I asked for written confirmation that the hefty US$250 credit card deposit for incidentals (where they might have come from with no mini bar and no breakfast restaurant, I'm not sure?) This was not possible and at time of writing I am still waiting to see if this large sum makes it back onto my card? When I asked the duty receptionist for the name and email of a manager, he demurred, only when pressed scribbling something on a card which was crossed out several times and finally illegible. Another word of warning, the complimentary wi-fi was NOT a secure network and my email has been compromised several times since logging on via the Metro. If you don't want to start receiving tons of spam, better stay safe and don't even log on. The Metro may well improve once these renovations are completed - I was told spring or summer 2019 - but even then, we found the lack of guest engagement surprisingly poor for a Manhattan tourist hotel.

There\u2019s also a gym up there which we never used.\nLocation is great too, easy walk to Times Square, Macy\u2019s and Empire State are on you doorstep with lots of places to sit in and eat or take away around you too. Subway is a minutes walk away which we found easy to use having never used any before!\nWith the hotel\u2019s bar\/restaurant being closed for refurb we tried the Irish bar down the street and enjoyed the cocktails. \nThe hotels refurb didn\u2019t impact or stay at all, you barely know it\u2019s happening.

Nothing is particularly far from the Hotel and well within walking distance.  \n\nUpon arrival at the Hotel we were upgraded to a suite which was a lovely surprise, particularly as we'd gone for my husband's birthday.  This was a real bonus.  The beds are incredibly comfortable, shower very efficient and there is lots of space in the room for luggage.  There is also a safe for valuables. \n\nThe Hotel itself is very clean, well tended and whilst they were having renovation works it didn't affect us at all.  We were given breakfast vouchers which we used really as a snack as there is so much choice of eateries from the second you step outside.  The hotel cleaning crew were meticulous and our towels changed daily, everything was spotless.  The reception staff were very helpful and able to offer assistance and advice when required.

We knew the restaurant \/ bar and lounge area was closed. Yes, this is a bit inconvenient at times (esp. when you are required to leave a credit card deposit behind the desk but there is nothing to buy). In saying that there are loads of bars and restaurants (and we really like Brendan's across the road for service and atmosphere) so whilst a bit of a pain this didn't really bother us. Yes, there are several floors that are being worked on but we didn't hear any noise. Granted we were out much of the day but we have the occasional late start and we did not hear any drilling or noise. The door boy and the cleaning staff are very good. The front desk, however, is another matter. We were greeted in a very perfunctory manner by the woman who checked us in. No welcome back, or have you stayed with us before, nothing. Basic information with no smile or anything. It then turned out she had given us the wrong room key (back up and down to the 8th floor). Generally over the course of the week (we were here seven nights) only two of the front of desk staff actually went out of their way to acknowledge us (and it was just an acknowledgment). The hotel was not especially busy and mostly the desk staff were just stood around chatting amongst themselves so we found this disappointing. On check out we simply got a 'that's it, nothing to pay' (as I said before there is nothing to buy as far as we could see!) There was no have you enjoyed your stay, have a safe trip, although the door man did say have a good journey (credit to him and shame on the front of house staff). This seemed very different to how the hotel was last time we stayed and whilst it wasn't really a major problem as such it was a bit annoying. I did begin to wonder if there was an issue about the staffing related to the hotel refurbishment as none of them looked very happy! On the positive side the location is great and the hotel does have a good internet connection (which you would expect in NY but don't always get). The thing that really made our stay was the roof terrace. The views of the Empire State Building are nothing short of spectacular and watching the sun go down there is pretty special. They do not have a roof top bar but you can take your own drinks up, which we did several times. An absolute gem, although I do have to add the terrace looks a bit less pretty pictures on the web. There are a few chairs and tables that look quite old and nothing much else. It didn't really matter as we were there for the view (as were many others) but they were short on seating and the terrace could do with some TLC. It really wouldn't take much to make the place feel cared for and cared about.\n\nI rarely stay in the same place twice but we chose to with hotel metro as we were so impressed the first time around. Would I choose to go back? I wouldn't say no, but I would certainly look elsewhere next time","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

While the standard of service rooms and food and drink where all high. The wine tasting that happens each night is not only friendly and relaxed it has some great wines served in an informal and happy way.  The man who pours them not only knows great wine he knows how to get the best from it for his customers. As it is staff who make a hotel a good experience and staff that keep it that way.

It is perfectly situated for both exploring on foot and by Metro. Our room this time was a little smaller than the other times we have stayed but was still bigger than some other hotel rooms in New York.  Everywhere was spotlessly clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly.  The bathroom, although small, was very clean and the shower worked well.  There were good quality complimentary bathroom products in the room and plenty of clean towels everyday.  There were 2 bottles of water left in the room for us plus a small box of chocolates. There is also a coffee maker in the room but as coffee is freely available from  the foyer all day we did not make much use of it. The beds were comfortable.  The hotel is a little outdated but is currently being renovated so the restaurant was closed.  We did not hear any building noise while we were there.\nThe only small niggles are that the lifts are very slow, the air-conditioning in the bedrooms is very noisy so you have to either put up with this or turn it off which means that the room gets very hot during the night.  Was disappointed that the muffins at breakfast are no longer available as these were the best part of breakfast and were the best muffins we have ever tasted.  Wi-Fi connection is free and good  but you have to log on to it every 24 hours which is a bit of a pain.\nFree wine every night (except Sunday) from 5-6.30 is an absolute godsend at the end of a busy day.

And we're so glad we did. \nRestaurant, bar and roof terrace all remained open during our stay, which was great. The floors that were closed meant you couldn't take the stairs and needed to use the 2 lifts. ( one was out of order for the whole of our stay). This meant that you could be waiting quite a while for the lift to come during busy periods.  This was the only negative point. \nRoom was nice but window overlooked building and not much natural daylight. Quiet though. Staff were polite to us. Check in and out was quick. Breakfast was fine. No frills but did the job. Wine tasting was great, not really wine tasting as you had a choice of several bottles and just asked for a glass of which one you wanted.

The receptionist kindly offered to switch our room to one that was ready, which we we\u2019re very grateful for. \n\nHowever we had to wait 90mins for the room to actually be available, the receptionist was disinterested in following the situation up which was very disappointing and not a great first impression of the hotel. This was the only downside to this hotel. Better communication from staff would have changed this experience.\n\nWe were on the 11th floor, however street noise was still very loud and the window appeared to offer no soundproofing or protection from the freezing cold weather outside! I think this could be improved. There was a heating system that was intermittent. However these gripes aside the room was a good size, enough space for two suitcases to be laid open. The bed was a double and comfortable. Bathroom was shower only with three separate shower heads. Water was hot with good pressure. Towels were changed daily, the bath towels were on the small side.\n\nThere is a hairdryer in the bathroom, it was not very powerful, if you have long thick hair, I\u2019d recommend taking your own!\n\nComplimentary water and coke provide in the room on arrival and the hotel had kindly left a bottle of bubbles in the room as we were celebrating our anniversary and my birthday.\n\nThe complimentary breakfast consisted of bagels, pastries, muffins, cereal, yogurt, fruit, tea, coffee and juice.

We got to the hotel using the air train from JFK to Jamaica station ($5pp) then the LIRR to Penn station ($7.5-$10pp depending if travelling in peak time).\n\nWe walked from the hotel to all usual NYC tourist spots, however we did get the subway to the Statue of Liberty ($3pp each way).\n\nOverall we were very happy with our stay, location excellent for exploring, room comfortable, breakfast good to set you up for the day and staff friendly.

When youre there though the view of the Empire State building towering over you is fantastic. The hotel should make so much more of this feature.\nOverall there was a clear need for the hotel to upgrade - one of the lifts out of action the whole time we were there, air con that had a mind of its own and just a general feeling of tiredness. \nIf the few (relatively minor) issues were fixed i would stay again - although I'm not sure how they could make the rooms big enough to be adequate !","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

On entering the hotel we didn't receive a particularly warm welcome despite the hotel being very quiet. The lady on the front desk was trying to quickly sort out our room and send us on our way. I had to repeat myself 3 times as she was looking at the computer whilst I was talking. \n\nWe would not expect a member of staff to hold the front doors for us at a normal hotel.

The older gentleman who worked there held the door for guests day in day out and was always so positive and asked questions about our day. He was greatly missed this time and obviously hasn't been replaced.\n\nWe were allocated a tiny room on the 5th floor which was very dated.

Its location, right in the heart of everything, is pretty much perfect for sightseeing - many of the big sights are within easy walking distance and there is a subway station less than 100m away. It's also only about a 5-10 minute walk from the LIRR station for connections to JFK airport. \nAnyway, apart from location, the hotel itself has so much going for it! On arrival, we were delighted to find that one of our rooms had been upgraded so that both rooms were on the same floor - a considerate touch. Both (premier) rooms were a good size; the queen room was normal city hotel size, but the double double room was spacious! Both had small bathrooms, but the showers were excellent, as were the toiletries, and plenty of towels were provided. The beds were extremely comfortable, some of the best I've ever slept in! \nHaving a fridge in the room was a nice touch, and then we discovered complementary water and coke for our arrival, which was really nice. We didn't ever use the coffee machines in the rooms as tea and coffee were available downstairs at all times anyway. \nHaving breakfast included in a US hotel is a real plus - saves that extra cost and bother of going out for breakfast - and yes it was simple but still good, with several different bagel types, bread, muffins, pastries, yogurt, fruit and juice on offer.  \nThe hotel is currently undergoing renovation\/redecoration work, so two of the lower room floors were not in use whilst we stayed, as well as one of the lifts, but there was no noise or disruption on our floor and our rooms had a very good standard of decoration and cleanliness. I hope that they do give all the lifts a major overhaul, as that was the only downside to the hotel - the lifts were very very slow (but essential when on the 8th floor, as we were, or higher!) and you could end up waiting around for quite some time for one to arrive, especially in the morning.\nOverall, this really is an excellent hotel, especially for the price, and I would definitely both recommend it to anyone else and also stay again myself in the future.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

You can access the best of midtown easily from this hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated and ours was a good size with good facilities. Breakfast is continental, so no bacon and eggs, but they do have gluten free bread and cereals, should you need them. Staff are efficient but not the happy, smiley types you'll find in Florida. But most New Yorkers seemed to be like that. My big issue came upon leaving. I did my usual check under the beds for any dropped items and found quite a mess left from previous guests. So, note to housekeeping, clean what you can't see as well as what you can. The hotel is being refurbished in 2018, so that will give them chance to have a good clean up.

Plus we were told there was free wine if we gave a small tip to the person serving. We sat and had one glass before going to our room.

The room also has a free safe so we felt happy we could lock our money and passports away while we were out. The bathroom was big enough with nice toiletries if you have forgotten to pack some. Breakfast was just enough to start the day, hot drinks, real orange juice, cereal, toast, bagels, cakes and some fruit.

The free WiFi was also essential to keep in touch with home and extended to the rooms with no trouble.\n\nThe location was great as well, 35th street which was only a few blocks away from Times Square and Broadway (walking distance) and only a short subway ride away from the 9\/11 museum, Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty. The hotel is right next to the 34th Street Subway station and it is therefore extremely easy to get to anywhere in Manhattan, Brooklyn or even Queens and the Bronx if needed.\n\nThe staff were friendly, always saying hello whenever we entered and goodbye when we exited. They were also happy to help if we had any queries regarding restaurant suggestions or  to help you navigate the city. All in all I am so glad that I stayed at Hotel Metro during my time in New York and I am already wondering when I can come back! Very happy indeed. ","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Absolutely perfect.\nMacy's, Grand Central, Times Square & of course the Empire State Building are all within a 5 to 15 minute walk away.  Lots & lots more too.\nIf you want to use the subway, the nearest is just 40 steps or so from the front door.\nOur 7th floor room - & it's cleanliness & daily service - was excellent.  A large double double with an effective en suite & a free-to-use fridge & small safe provided an excellent crash pad.  The only negative about the room as that the air-con unit was relatively noisy.  Bearable though.\nIt was really quiet too - rear-facing meant a non-existent view, but road noise was zero.\nNegatives are relatively few, but just might be important depending on what you look for in a hotel.\nThe reception team were oddly disengaged.  No welcome.  No goodbyes.  No 'have a nice days'.  You really did feel like you were disturbing them when you needed their help.  As I say, really odd given the high level of customer service throughout the rest of the city.  Our limo driver later told us that our experience was consistent with other feedback he had heard.\nThe breakfast.... a real mixed bag.  A fairly good selection for a continental brekkie - a variety of individually packaged cereals, juice & fairly good coffee.  A great choice of breads & the high-end muffins were delicious.....\n.... but.  Plates, bowls, cutlery & cups were all disposable, which gave a cheap feel to things.  Worse still was the environment.  Even thought the breakfast rooms were quite atmospheric, the furniture was a 50\/50 mixture of standard restaurant-height tables \/ chairs, & low seats & sofas. This meant that half of the diners had to sit down low, balancing paper cereal bowls on knees.\nThis leant a really cheap, functional feel to what otherwise would have been an acceptable breakfast experience.\nSo, if you need to be pampered over breakfast, this is not a hotel for you.\nLikewise, if poor, unfriendly front-of-house service ruins your day, avoid.\nHowever, if you can live with this, the incredibly well-sited hotel is a really good choice for the New York tourist with sizeable, quiet, well-fitted & clean rooms.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Initially the room seemed a little noisy from traffic outside (New York drivers love to sound their horn), but in all honestly we stopped noticing it very quickly (if you do New York properly you'll sleep through anything!!\ud83d\ude0a).\nHotel lobby and lounge are beautifully decorated in golden and black tones in an art deco style.\nThe roof terrace on the penthouse floor was a little chilly to enjoy in this trip but provides brilliant photo opportunities as it is overlooked by the Empire State Building.\nWe weren't expecting breakfast to be included in our deal but were informed on arrival that it was. Breakfast is continental with food on offer including fruit, cereals, bagels and bread (toasted yourself on rolling toasters), muffins, yoghurt and spreads. Fruit juice and hot drinks are available from urns and dispensers.\nThe coffee urn is available and free 24\/7 during your stay.\nDuring our stay the hotel were offering copious amounts of free wine in the guise of wine tasting for differing lengths of time between 5.30-7.00pm. We thought this was an amazing bonus from a hotel we were already impressed with!!\nWe ate 3 times at the Metro bar and grill (1\u00d7 breakfast, lunch and evening meal) and would highly recommend you try all three.

Turn left and within minutes you're on 5th Avenue. A few minutes more and you're at the Empire state building. \nTurn right and you're just minutes from Maceys store. 10-15 minutes more an you're in Times Square.\nNearest subway station is very close (34th St station).\nIf you're making your own way from Newark Airport, Penn station is very close too with just a couple of blocks and corners to navigate (we did).\nThis was our first trip to New York, but it will not be our last.

We knew several people who had stayed here and had loved it so we had high expectations. We were greeted by the lovely reception staff, it didn't matter what time of day it was, they were all lovely. The inside of the hotel is beautiful and spotlessly clean. The rooms are really nice, not the biggest of rooms and the bathroom was very small, but worth it for being in such a great location. There is a free safe in the room and lovely toiletries, there's also a hairdryer and an iron, no kettle but there is a coffee machine, larger bath towels would be a bonus though! Breakfast is included which is great! There is a great selection of bagels (which are huge and very fresh) fresh fruit, and cereals. There's tea, coffee and fruit juices too. You are allowed to help yourself to the tea and coffee 24 hours a day which is really handy. Every evening around 5.30 for about 90 mins they serve complimentary wine in the lounge area, we never got the chance to experience this but it looked very popular!. When we needed to check in online we were allowed to use the conference room to print everything off. The hotel is in the most perfect spot for seeing all of the sights, it has a subway station literally 1 minute from it's front door ( which was really easy to use once the receptionist explained it to us!) and at the end of the street is Macy's. Time's square is literally about a 15 minute walk away and central park is also within walking distance. We walked to the financial district one day and it took about 1 hour and 40 mins! A bit further than we expected! When you arrive go straight up to the Penthouse floor and go out onto the roof top bar, there is the most amazing view of the Empire State building! The Metro is very close to it, it's literally around the corner. When we checked out they allowed us to store our luggage until we left and the lovely doorman ordered us a car, which cost the same as a tax,i to take us to the airport   When we come back to New York we will definitely be staying here again. .","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

On the edge of Herald Square, and walkable from Times Square, we couldn\u2019t get over how central it was. There is a subway station just down the road too. Check-in was prompt, and our room was large, clean and comfortable, with a coffee machine (pod type) and a welcome pack of soft drinks and water \u2013 very nice touch. It\u2019s a pity there was no kettle there to make tea with, but it didn\u2019t upset us too much! Bathroom was spacious and clean, and well stocked with toiletries and towels. We also had an in-room safe which was great for leaving passports and other important documents in, and we were supplied with an iron and ironing board (not that we used it on holiday!). There is free wine tasting in this hotel every evening at tea time and we took part in it on our first evening. A nice way to unwind after a very long journey from Ireland. We went for a walk-about and up onto the roof garden on the 12th floor \u2013 wow, what a sight \u2013 there was the Empire State Building looking down at us! It is a magnificent sight, whether in daylight or at night when the stars are twinkling, and the moon is out. There is also a gym on the top floor of the hotel, for the more energetic, but we didn\u2019t see anybody in it whilst we were there. We dined in the Hotel Bar & Grill and a separate review will be done for this, but we did think it odd that it didn\u2019t open at the weekends. Breakfast was very good \u2013 self-service style with dispensers for fruit juice, boiling water, milk and coffee, and tea bags. There was fresh fruit, yogurt, breakfast cereals, different types of bread and pastries and several types of bagel that were already sliced and ready to be toasted. There was cream cheese, butter, and jams for the bagels, so all we had to do was choose!

We had booked it all on line in Australia and confirmed by email the costs and taxes.  The hotel was okay, there was no room service and no place to have meals.  They had a dining room for a continental breakfast only.   The rooms were comfortable, we were upgraded because of a mix up and a mess that occurred when we arrived.  They had a restaurant next door that they recommended, they have a full breakfast and other meals.  We had a breakfast that was so disgusting, my husband looked at it and got up and walked out, he just went back to the room rugged up and had his breakfast elsewhere.  He said he could not eat reheated food, eggs that were supposed to be sunny side up was just mush in the middle of the plate and bacon that looked like strips of leather.  The toast was cold and our muesli was just awful, it was like eating cardboard.  The room was comfortable as it was -12 outside so we came back each day to a warm cosy roomThe day we booked out all hell broke loose as they had charged us higher rates than we were quoted, plus the higher rate was the Christmas period.  We had booked all this in March 2017.  There was no point arguing because the tiny writing on the bottom said it all. The view out of our window was a back alley and it was full of rubbish and disgusting bins piled high.

First, the location of the hotel was excellent.  West 35th is kind of in the middle of Manhattan. We were able to walk to almost everywhere we wanted to visit. When we arrived at the hotel ( 9am) our room was not ready. We fully expected that. The hotel provided a secure location for our luggage, while we started to sightsee. By the time we got back to the hotel, we were able to easily retrieve are luggage and take it to our room. There was someone to transport our luggage to our room if we desired, but they were not pushy about it. They upgraded us with out being asked. The room was small, but I\u2019ve been told that all New York Hotel rooms are small and for as much time as we spent in the room, it was more than adequate. The was clean, well decorated and had the amenities we need. We chose Hotel Metro, first because of the price and second because of the reviews it\u2019s received. The hotel offered free wine tasting in the evening and and free continental breakfast in the morning. I would recommend Hotel Metro to anyone.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The convenience to the train station was what convinced me to book a room for the weekend.  Anyway, the hotel itself is very cute.  It is a budget bargain 3 star boutique hotel.  All reservations come with complimentary breakfast which includes bagels, toast, and muffins, juice, fresh fruit, yogurt, coffee and tea.  Cream cheese, butter, jelly, peanut butter is also provided.  I was very pleased with our room.  We had a king-sized bed, a flat screen TV, a mini fridge, alarm clock with convenient USB ports, free WiFi, nice toiletries, and a freshly renovated bathroom with a shower with a rain-head.  Also the hotel provided complimentary bottled water as well as soda.  Our room also had an individualized thermostat for both AC and hot air.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens were fine.  Additionally, our room was very quiet.  There is a restaurant attached to the hotel, but I cannot comment on it since we dined elsewhere.  The entire staff was super accommodating and nice.  I am very happy to have stumbled upon this little hotel, and I know we will return again.

There is room for improvement and various things in the room seemed a little on the shabby side. Our room didn't have any views, it faced into other windows\/courtyard.\n\nThe breakfast was included in our package which was excellent for a continental. Bagels, cereals, muffins etc.  Great for on the go or just before going out exploring. \n\nThe hotel has a great rooftop which has amazing uninterrupted views of the empire state building. We went in winter so there was nothing else up there but a few chairs. But still very impressive. \n\nThe hotel itself is in the most perfect spot for exploring New York. Right next to the Empire state building and Macy's.  With only a 5\/10 minute walk to Times Square and 15 max to Central Park. \nWe walked everywhere and it is achievable to go down to battery park and Brooklyn bridge, just be prepared for sore feet! \n\nOverall the hotel itself could use a little TLC but for the price and location I would definitely stop here again and always recommend the area\/hotel.

This entailed paying \u00a335 a night extra for a premier room and waiting around for hours until one became available and we could move but it was a great relief to be on a higher floor (10th) and also to have a bathroom without peeling wallpaper and rooms that were a little less rough around the edges.\nThe breakfast was nice, difficult with two children eating at a coffee table but we managed however don\u2019t try to sit in the library after 10am as you\u2019ll be ordered to move! The roof was great, amazing to show the children the Empire State Building when we got there and overall it was a nice hotel but just a few niggles that made us wish we\u2019d booked elsewhere. Having said this the location is great, door staff really friendly and some reception staff helpful, room service keep the room clean...i guess it depends what you want but if you\u2019re after sleep and great customer service then perhaps look somewhere else.

I arrived early at 10 AM knowing that likely I would not be able to check in. However most hotels can accommodate most travelers in the morning. When I was not able to check, I was not that surprised and left my bag. I was told to return at 2 PM to check in. I was exhausted and really needed to rest before I went out again. When I arrived at two I was still told that my room was not ready and that check in time is at 4 PM.  This to me is way too late and unacceptable since it takes very little time to clean a room. However I waited. I also asked if there\u2019s another room and I was told that since I requested a high floor, quiet room I need to wait. I was sitting at the lobby just waiting. They knew I was there and didn\u2019t say anything. I finally went up an hour later and ask if there\u2019s any room available. I was given a room not on a high floor facing the shaft. It was certainly not worth the wait and I was very disappointed with the terrible view and the low floor.. The room was spacious by New York standards but the bathroom was outdated with fixtures that were rusty and old. I had very little time to rest before I went out again which ruined my evening.

It is ideally located for all of the sights in New York located Midtown with subway stations nearby, Macys and Herald Square at the end of the road and many eateries within walking distance. First perk a free breakfast in New York what more do you want - a good substantial breakfast set us up for the day consisting of cereals, yoghurt, bagels, toast, cakes fresh fruit, juices and tea or coffee. We never had a problem finding a table, though we did get up early so as to waste any minute in the city. Check in was very easy and we managed to check in early which was very much appreciated after a long flight. The hotel were kind enough to fulfil our request for a low floor and we were allocated one on the third floor - a large and comfortable room with a Queen size bed unfortunately the pillows were a little uncomfortable for our liking. Safe, ironing bard, iron and umbrella are all provided in your room for you to use. Second perk free wine tasting on an evening from 5 - 7 was very relaxing after a long day sight seeing around the streets of this amazing city. We managed to see all of the sights on our wish list and ate in the Metro Grill on our first night, substantial portions, though look out for the service charge; Stella34 Italian in Macys and O' Sullivans on 35th were also  very good value for money. Do not forget to go up to the roof terrace to admire the view of the Empire State Building maybe take along a glass of wine and nibbles. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating nothing was a problem and help was always at hand if you needed it. We can wholeheartedly recommend Hotel Metro and if we return to New York this will be on the top of our list for accommodation. Thank you for making our celebration one to be remembered.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

After a hot and tiring journey into the city ,we were very pleased to be checked in quickly by a very nice receptionist called Soni. He also informed us that we'd been given a complimentary room upgrade which meant we had a lovely big room on the 12th floor, partly overlooking the street far below. There was also a bottle of fizz waiting for us too. The room had plenty of wardrobe and draw space and included a safe, coffee machine, fridge (stocked with some complimentary cokes and water) and air conditioning. The bed was large and really comfortable but, unfortunately, I found the pillows to be rather lumpy and not comfortable at all. The bathroom, whilst being a tad on the small side, was perfectly adequate and had a fantastic walk in shower with 2 facing shower heads and 1 deluge shower head from above. We found the sleep quality really good but be warned, don't expect too peaceful a night, this is New York after all, and even being 12 storeys up, we could still hear sirens, horns, air conditioning units humming and the commotion that is New York!  Ear plugs help!\nUnusually for a New York hotel, the Art Deco style Metro includes breakfast in your stay. It's perfectly adequate offering cereals, pastries, muffins, toast, bagels, fresh fruit, juices, yoghurts and tea and coffee, (the T and C are available 24hrs free of charge and are most welcome after a hard days sight seeing.) Also, for a small charge, you can upgrade your breakfast to a cooked one which is eaten in the main restaurant at the front of the hotel. In the early evening, the hotel lay on a wine tasting session. We only managed to do this once but it was a very nice, relaxing hour and a tip to the bar person is all that is required.\n\nThe Midtown location of the hotel is spot on, being only a minutes walk to Macey's dept store, numerous good restaurants of varying cuisine, Fifth Avenue,Broadway and the all important Herald Square Subway. The Empire State building is only one block away too (you will want to visit it after viewing from the Metros roof terrace, so close you can almost touch it.)  A little further, but still walkable, is Times Square, Bryant Park, The Flat Iron Building and The National Library.\n\nOn check out (by 12pm), the hotel will store your luggage if required and you should ask the doorman to secure a fixed rate yellow cab to your departure airport. \n\nSo, to summarise. Great hotel, friendly staff throughout and perfect location. Should I ever return to New York City, I would definitely stay here again.\nThank you Hotel Metro.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Additionally, the shower was very poorly designed; The sliding glass doors were spaced about 1.5-2.0 inches apart, so there was no way to prevent flooding of the entire tiny bathroom, even with just a quick shower. (And yes, we tried adjusting the angle of the rain shower head to prevent this, to no avail.)\n\nBut truly, the most troublesome issue for us was the lack of wifi connectivity. If we tried repeatedly connecting and disconnecting and connecting again, and waited a long enough time in between, we might get a decent connection for 1-2 minutes, long enough to respond to an email or take care of some other quick business - and then it would disconnect again. Obviously, that wasn't a practical workaround, and we eventually gave up. We actually left for the airport earlier than we needed to check out, just for LGA's wifi connectivity. \n\nAside from those negatives, there were a few positives - the complimentary wine tastings every evening, and of course the outstanding view of the Empire State Building from the roof were both nice touches.
