It was incredible.\n\nWe booked the Guest House to use for our wedding party to get ready and for some guests to congregate for our afterparty (and of course for the two of us to sleep at night). The room itself is stunning, with two floors, all high end finishings and furniture, tons of usable space, great light, modern conveniences like digital room controllers to customize the color scheme of the funky LED lighting in the living room, seamlessly project music through all the rooms and control the 10(!) head shower. And, of course, don\u2019t forget about the glass bottom hot tub on the patio upstairs. Totally awesome, and we comfortably fit 30-40 people at a time between the bridal party, family, photographers, hair and makeup staff, etc. We also had the South Tower Terrace across the hall so we had the whole floor and plenty of overflow space, and the terrace in that room is enormous and has really good views. They offered us a good deal to combine them and we are glad we did. The lobby area also looks really cool and was a great setting for a chunk of our photo shoot.\n\nBut of course a hotel is only as good as its staff, and this place has a Dream Team. From Esther in sales, who answered a million questions and helped prep for our arrival, to Irtiza at reception who managed the flow of dozens of guests and ensured they could easily get to our suites and that our every need was taken care of, to the maintenance team who rushed upstairs with a crow bar to remove a cement block on the patio when one of the wedding rings was dropped in the crack during the photo shoot (yikes). They helped make the weekend so enjoyable and removed so much of the stress we were expecting. \n\nThank you so much for an amazing weekend!\n\n-Josh and Ali","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We arrived around 11 PM after a show and there was a line around the hotel to get into the night club. Check in was prompt and easy once finding a way around the line. The area of the hotel where we stayed could use an upgrade. Table in hallway outside of the room had cracks in it, buttons to turn on lights in our room were not working, stains on tiles in bathroom. Our room was located on the third floor facing the front of the hotel. The noise was unbelievable through the night. As parents of young children, we were so excited to have a weekend away and be able to sleep through the night. This did not happen - the noise from the club, people outside and taxi cabs beeping went on until 3:30 AM. We even checked to make sure our windows weren\u2019t open. The hotel offers earplugs (per other reviews) but cannot believe they do not warn people about the noise pollution. It seems there is another part of the hotel that may be quieter. We ended up cancelling our 2nd night here and booked at another where we had a wonderful experience! Unbelievable that they are able to book the rooms we stayed in without any kind of warning. Not worth risking if you want to sleep at night. I would not recommend! ","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"NONE"}

The light in the closet wouldn\u2019t go out because the door wouldn\u2019t close properly so maybe that is the best they have? The bed is low to ground and the headboard is cool looking with circle cutouts that seriously need a good dusting.

When we called the front desk they sent someone up who told us there was nothing he could do. when he came back for the light same issue... he had to undo the wiring to disconnect the light so it would at least stay off. After that another employee came up with a bucket of ice suggesting this was the only way to main our drinks cold. We were told to take photos of all these issues and ask for a refund. That was the solution provided. We showed them the exposed wiring in the bedroom they once again said they couldnt do anything. \nThe bathroom lights turn on and off with a button, the cover of the button kept falling off, only way to use the lights was turning them on in the living space or bedroom. Our shower curtain was 2 sizes too small for the size of the shower and had some type of leak that flooded our bathroom floor no matter how much we pulled the curtain. To top it all off the sink head fell off and our sink was clogged so it would take forever for the water to go down. \nThere's no seperatiom between the club guests and hotel guests so if theyre drunk and all over the lobby you're in for a show and an obstacle course to the elevators and your room. \nI was holding off on leaving a review since I was told someone would get in contact with me to come to a resolution but it has now been 2 days and no one has even reached out. \nWe love to do staycations and apart from the great view and convenient location this was an awful experience and highly recommend you look elsewhere for a much cheaper and better run hotel that is being maintained. \n","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The bathroom sink was made of metal - felt more like a prison bathroom than a four star hotel. There was the option to order food (I got a order) from a neighboring restaurant delivered to the hotel reception; the burger was decent, but the fries were caked together and tasted of old frying oil - I threw them out. The right place to enter from the street could be clearer (it says the hotel name on the side but not directly on the door); this fact was abused by a scammer who intercepted me as I was arriving looking for the entrance, and tried unsuccessfully to lead me away.\n\nOverall, this was a much worse experience than I would have expected.

No matter, as there was no place to actually use the ironing board, except the floor. That would have been okay, except it was a table top model - and the only surface in my room was a thin desk, and it didn\u2019t fit there (literally not wide enough). \n\nThe lighting system was also way too complicated, especially when you enter a dark room and can\u2019t read which button is for what.

Go to one of those.\n\nThis place used to be the spot 10 years ago, but now it stands boldly un-updated, deteriorating on the coattails of its former glory. The rooms are very small and poorly lit. I was using my phone flash to find things. There are 6 buttons for 2 lights, but only 2\/6 do anything. The button labels have worn off with age. The bathroom door is hefty, like mean hefty, and the bathroom walls are transparent -- thankfully, because the light spills into the darkness of the bedroom, helping to compensate. When I asked the front desk person via the telephone in the room for a food recommendation, he said he didn't know. I later discovered the hotel has at least 2 entire restaurants, one of which might also be a night club? \n\nThe air conditioning, however, was perfect. 71 meant 71.

The first time I stayed, I was in one of the smaller rooms, which seemed a bit claustrophobic.  For my second stay, I chose to go with the King \"gold\" (320sf), which was MUCH better, although the bathroom was still quite tight.  The mood lighting was a little over the top, as it was so dim it was hard to read and even do makeup in the bathroom.  Every light is equipped with a dimmer setting, but the highest setting is not high enough to be practical.  Also, odd that they didn't have facecloths as part of the bathroom towels.  Other than that, the decor was wonderful.  Lots of cool art in the lobby and the rooms reflect the same sensibility.  There is some sort of night club on the roof (that I did not attempt to visit) and there are some fancy restaurants in and around the hotel.  The Chelsea location is great for any activites in that area (close to the Highline and Chelsea Piers).  Also, the front desk staff was great on both of my visits.  On my first visit, I thought my room had been booked by another party; it was not, but the night shift concierge (so sorry I can't recall her name), really made effort to accomodate me and find me a room at a good rate.  On the second visit, the other night shift concierge was great about giving me neighorhood restaurant recos (clearly NOT paid referrals - just where she liked to eat), and the place she recommended - a Cuban-fusion local spot (Coppelia) - was terrific.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We also knew that the hotel had to have a large lobby so we could sit together with our family in the evenings.   We searched for a hotel in an exciting area of Manhattan to accommodate our guests' diverse interests and ages. The solution was the Dream Hotel in the Chelsea\/Meatpacking district of New York. We were not disappointed! The hotel was once the annex of the National Maritime Union and, therefore, the round porthole windows. The hotel has a lovely outdoor pool, which was terrific for guests in July who had spent the day touring the city. Chelsea Market was a five-minute walk from the hotel, a site where our guests spent a lot of time exploring.\n\nThe staff of the hotel was incredible! They are trained to meet guests' requests with kindness, patience, and courtesy. In fact, in all of our travels, we have never worked with such an accommodating staff.  \n\nAlthough the rooms we reserved were small, they were clean and more than adequate for everyone's needs. The bathrooms are large and very modern. They look as if they had just been renovated. There is a small cafe in the lobby where one can buy breakfast, which we did twice during our 5-day stay. However, with the Chelsea Market so close by, along with dozens and dozens of restaurants and bars within a short walking distance from the hotel, a restaurant was not needed. We think the Dream Hotel (now part of the Hyatt Hotel system)  is a wonderful and reasonably-priced choice in the most exciting area of New York. ","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I chose this hotel due to location, being close to part of the city we had not explored yet and because it had a pool.  It was an easy walk to Chelsea Market, The Little Island, The High Line, The Vessel, Greenwich Village & Meatpacking District, etc. It was a great location, but honestly, there wasn't enough positives about the hotel itself.  The line to check-in was long, which we understood for a Friday evening, and didn't seem so bad after I saw the line was nearly triple the size the next evening!  After checking in, we found out that the pool is only open to registered hotel guests from 8:00-10:30am daily. At 10:30am, they empty the pool area, close down for 30 minutes, then reopen to the public from 11am-6pm.  We also found out that you have to reserve pool chairs ahead of time (days or maybe weeks ahead of time, actually) and I was personally told by someone poolside that it cost them $200 for two chairs for the day.  With a wristband you have to acquire the day of from the front desk,  you can enter the pool deck with the outside guests between those hours of 11am-6pm - only if they have the space limitation to allow you in.  We did get wristbands for Sunday afternoon, so we sat on the edge of the pool, as there were no chairs available to us.  The poolside DJ was great, everyone seemed to be having a good time.  But when I tried to order a drink from a poolside waitress, she said \"I'm only allowed to serve guests who reserved chairs, but you are welcome to walk inside to the bar to order for yourself.\"  The color of our wristbands were different than those who reserved and paid for chairs, that's how they could tell.  When really looking at the hotel website now, this is what it states:  \"Daily Hours: 8:00am to 6:00pm. General Admission Pool Access does not include lounge chairs. Lounge chairs may be reserved in advance by clicking \"Learn More\".  General Admission Pool Access will be available to Registered Hotel Guests on a first come, first served basis due to spacing and capacity limitations.\"  \nSo my point is, please just be aware that as a registered hotel guest, you will only have access to the pool from 8:00-10:30am. Otherwise, you will either have to pay and reserve chairs for the day way ahead of time OR just take your chances and on a first come, first serve basis see if space limitations allow for you to get a wristband just to enter the  pool deck with no chairs or poolside service!  Yay!  I overheard from another pool guest that the hotel and the pool are separately owned, so this makes a tad more sense as to why it's ran this way.  \nThe King Bed Platinum Suite (with direct pool access) had a lot more space than you'd get at most NYC hotels, but the d\u00e9cor and quality of furniture was unimpressive.  The sitting chairs in our room were very tiny and not comfortable to sit and watch TV in them.  The bed was a very low platform style that was awkward and not comfortable to sleep in, the low profile ended up feeling very odd for a hotel room.  The walls are paper thin and we could clearly hear people talking and walking around in high heels next door... among hearing other things, ha!  The toilet resembled one you'd find in a campground bathhouse and was situated so high that my toes could barely touch the ground when seated (I'm 5'5\").  The night club in the hotel is open until 3am - from our room we could definitely hear the music but thankfully not loud enough that it kept us awake.  The line for the night club started in the lobby and extended outside to the front of the building making it super congested when we'd enter\/exit the hotel.  We did order room service the first night, which delivers from Philippe, an Asian inspired restaurant in the hotel.  Food was great and super easy to order online, but very pricey... we split one main dish, one side dish, one appetizer and one cocktail and it came to $123.99 with tip.\nTo top off our trip, my card on file was charged a $50 plus tax per night \"facility fee\" upon checkout.  I paid in advance for the hotel room and I've never, ever seen a fee like that being charged after the fact.  I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, especially with kids, as it's not kid friendly at all.  And maybe I should have read the fine print on the website a little closer and maybe I wouldn't have felt so disappointed or unwelcome in my own hotel.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel doesn't have the best signage on the street so it is easy to pass by if you're not really looking. The lobby was pleasant and very modern. The front desk staff were helpful. I was able to check in and go right to my room, but they do offer baggage storage if your room is not quite ready.  The lobby\/bar area is fun and was crowded most evenings. \nThe rooms were pretty funky. Lots of glass in the rooms. The lights are controlled by buttons on the walls. The bathroom has the tallest shower curtain I've ever seen and it's made out of chains. There is a mini bar available. The room was actually a decent size for NY standards. I had a large bed, a big window and the bathroom was good sized. \nSince I was there for a work function, I ended up needing to print a few things and they do not have a business center. I was surprised by that, but the front desk staff were helpful and printed it for me. \nMy one complaint was that my lights were not working properly. They would go on and off throughout my two day stay at random. Wasn't great to have the lights go out in the middle of my shower. I reached out to the front desk twice about it. The first time they sent a maintenance staff up to look at it and he couldn't fix it. The second time I'm not sure anyone came up. Thankfully there were two lamps (desk lamps) that did not operate off the main lighting system so I wasn't completely in the dark. \n","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Right above our rooms was the PHD club but the rooms are so well sound-proofed that had I not seen the flashing lights reflected in the building opposite us, I wouldn\u2019t even have known there was a club upstairs. \n\nThe hotel lobby is magnificent and leads to the lobby bar with its very futuristic NFT Gallery curated by Ice Cube himself and includes art by Paris Hilton amongst others. The decorations are modern, fun, avant-garde and sublime. \n\nAll the staff I interacted with went out of their way to help us out. I requested a kettle to make tea on our first day and they promptly delivered one up to the room. There is no room service currently but the hotel is located a stone\u2019s throw from Chelsea Food Market which is very reasonably priced considering the area. \n\nThe rooms themselves were fun. Each room had a murphy bed that could be stowed away for more space if needed and the TV comes right out of the ceiling. There is a safe and a mini fridge. The bathroom design is futuristic, the towels are replaced whenever required \/ requested and the water pressure is spot on. Furthermore,  toiletries are Karl Lagerfeld branded and give a further air of class and sophistication. \n\nRestaurants & Clubs - The hotel is right above Philippe\u2019s - legit the best asian fusion cuisine I have EVER tasted - which doubles as a bar. The most amiable manager, Kostas, took great care of us. On the other side of the Dream Downtown is the TAO nightclub, right around the corner from the TAO restaurant, a gyro truck and another steak restaurant. \n\nThe cafe at the hotel boasts the most delicious pastries and definitely try the avocado toast if you\u2019re there.

We visited on a Thursday in August and it was fantastic. Not too crowded, beautiful space, delicious food & drinks, and fantastic service. If you're looking for a perfect escape right in the city, I'd highly recommend at least booking a pool reservation for the day -- it truly felt like an oasis and not a hotel right in the heart of the city!\n\nThe food was great -- we had the chips & guac appetizer and the fish tacos and steak tacos. All were delicious and very well-priced. Drink menu was great too!\n\nReservations were easy to make (prices vary based on the date), and they send you a reminder text the day before. Cancellation policies are super generous too (we actually had to cancel our first reservation, so this was a makeup). \n\nWe took the train into Penn Station and it was a quick 15-minute walk.

I get that\u2019s how they market the place, but to have a pool that your paying guests can\u2019t use after 11am (and not at all after 6pm) isn\u2019t the best. We also had a few other issues - bathroom fan and a fridge that didn\u2019t work, and were never fixed even after we reported them (we stayed 3 nights).

From beginning to end, and even after voicing complaints to the hotel manager after my stay, I experienced an impressive lack of hospitality from a hotel I used to think of as one of the top in NYC. I chose this hotel for my best friend\u2019s bachelorette party and booked one of their top + most expensive suites for 2 nights. The Dream Downtown Sales Director provided me with inaccurate information about the bed sizes in the suite. When I went to speak with her in person after seeing the room, she could not care less that I was unhappy. The least she could have done was provide something minimal like a bottle of champagne to show any sense of empathy, however that was not the case. Another issue arose as I had been communicating with another employee of Dream about going to PHD on Friday around 6pm. She only told me it was up to doorman discretion (which is still ridiculous given we are high paying hotel guests). She neglected to tell me that PHD didn\u2019t open until 10pm that night, and Google has the hours listed as open at 5pm. Again, the employee who told us it wasn\u2019t open until 10pm could have provided the slightest bit of hospitality and said they could accommodate us elsewhere at the hotel. And lastly, we had lunch near the pool area. Each person\u2019s meal was brought out separately over the course of 1 hour. Meanwhile the place was nearly empty. Overall, with the countless other hotel options in NYC, I would recommend going to many others before being ripped off at the Dream. I realize this is NYC, as I\u2019ve lived here for 8 years. However I\u2019ve stayed at other hotels for staycations and had much better experiences. And lastly after being passed around to different people for days before reaching the hotel manager, I still have not received any official form of compensation for the complaints I voiced almost a month ago.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I had asked if my colleague and I could get a room close to each other but alas, we were able to get to be on the same floor.\n\nThe elevators are difficult to use - the card doesnt quite register your floor so you have to try a couple of times and if you miss it, you either end up going in the other direction (not just me but other guests had the same issue)\n\nThe hallways are extremely narrow and a bit dark but i guess that is the vibe of the hotel.\n\nI got the bronze room (621?) which is the queen bed room.

The chair for the desk definitely looks worn and its feel fragile.\n\nMini bar - dont bother refrigerate anything because theres no space for your stuff - it is filled with beverages and if you remove any of it, it has a sensor to charge you.\n\nBathroom - its really spacious - too spacious -  Stand up shower with lots of room.  Karl Lagerfield toiletries, sink is wide but not too much space for your own items.  There is a towel ladder for towels.\n\nhere were my biggest peeves of this place\n-the walls are pretty thin - i heard almost every single person who rolled through the hallways, i heard every door close and it kinda shook the room.

I want to blame covid protocols but I don't necessarily think that was it. Besides a great location, that was about the only positive. And the bed was comfortable.\n\nFirst the room, was just run down and so basic. The lights? Don't even get me started on whatever person created that button system. The view I had was great though. The fridge wouldn't open. The blow dryer didn't work. There was one tiny trash can in the bathroom. We were sparingly given two towels, one each. The toiletries were awful. Just all little things that when you stay at high end hotels, are standard, you shouldn't have to ask. This was not the case here.\n\nThe staff was nice for the most part, minus the one morning it rained, and I asked for umbrellas, and the girl at the desk had a major attitude problem about it. Another day we asked for recommendations of places to go eat\/grab a drink outside and the staff was clueless. Gave us 1 recommendation. I understand NYC has been closed down for quite some time but come on, they looked so confused. Then the desk girl made some comment about us wanting to go party? I was like it's 2:00 in the afternoon, we just want to go some drinks and apps and sit outside. When someone travels to a city, they expect the staff to be knowledgable of the area and have decent recommendations. The worst.\n\nFood options, absolutely terrible. The one cafe that serves breakfast had a \"limited\" menu. With ONE option for food that wasn't a pastry. What kind of cafe in a hotel literally has one option.  Room service? Nope. You'd think a hotel that's supposed to be \"high end\" would have room service and food options for late night or early morning. Just sad. The bars weren't open in the hotel.\n\nWe wanted to get a cab to take us to JFK? Nope, they didn't have anyone to help us do that. Unheard of. There was no doorman. No one helped with anything.\n\nOverall? Disappointed. Would not stay here again. Take your money elsewhere because I have stayed at hotels in the city with less stars than this one and had 100x better service.\n\nAgain, I want to blame covid but honestly, I don't think that is it.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Yet, when I stayed during the July 4th holiday weekend, I was incredibly disappointed at so many aspects of the hotel, that I felt compelled to write this review.  First of all, the roof terrace is not accessible to guests during the day, and is only accessible if they visit the club on the weekends, in which case they have to be \"screened\" by the door staff.  This is because, like the pool, it is an area which is managed by a separate company.  Access to the pool costs $80 (just to get a lounger and couple of towels). When I arrived in the room, the minibar had no water or sodas - just hard liquor and wine.  There were no snacks or glasses.  In addition, there was no room service available, which was because of the lack of staff, I was told.  In fact, there was no food or drink available in the hotel at all. \nSo: for what you pay per night, this is definitely terrible value for money, and I would not recommend it at all.

Lets start with the good:\nOn the plus side the location is excellent. Its a 5 minute walk to the subway, a 2 minute walk to Chelsea Markets and its a very cool neighborhood in general. \nAlso on the plus side is the cost - its very affordable for New York. We had a special rate that worked out around $200 per night including tax, but that was in January, I'm not sure what you pay for it during a higher season. But $200 per night in New York is very rare indeed.\nOther positives - the bed was comfortable and the room was clean,\n\nNow to the negative:\nSo many things irritated me about this hotel. Firstly, it has a nightclub and bar on the premises and becomes a magnet for an extremely noisy and trashy clientele that fill the lobby and the public areas. That's fine if you're a 20 something into clubbing looking to hook up with loose, half naked women, but I prefer my hotels a little more quiet and respectable.\nNext, nothing seemed to work as it is supposed to. The elevators need a keycard and don't always read them properly, the sink has a strange faucet that just doesn't make sense, the TV channels were impossible to decipher so you had to play roulette to try and find a channel - sometimes you go back and the channel had disappeared, sometimes you go round and there were channels that weren't there last time.... I just found the place poorly thought out. \nOverall I would not return to The Dream, but I can understand its appeal to younger travelers looking for a low budget NYC hotel. It wasn't for me.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It has many good qualities, but it just irked me. But you're not me, and I'm sort of annoying.\n\nIt gets the most obvious and important things right: The staff is friendly. The hotel is very clean. The room was small, but normal size for a NYC hotel. It's in a fun part of town. It's modern. So, they nailed the basics.\n\nHere are the discretionary things they could have gotten right but, according to my irked judgment, they did not. (It's in no particular order, but the last one is the most egregious.)\n\nThe wifi was ok at 12mbps, but not great these days.\n\nThe free exercise room was surprisingly small, with only a handful of machines. For a large hotel, that can be a problem.\n\nI know the following is a tiny nit, but, like many hotels, the little shower bottles are identical except for a small print label. Those of us who are older generally don't want to have to shower with our glasses on. So, yes, you can line the bottles up in the shower beforehand, but I was irked. Irked, I tell you!\n\nThe TV channel guides was inaccurate, so finding a channel you wanted was very annoying. There's an onscreen guide, but the numbers it lists are not the numbers you need to enter to get to the channel. Plus, the guide scrolls so very slowly. A printed list of channels would have been far handier, especially if its channel numbers were accurate.\n\nThe little cocktail lounge charges $20 for a cocktail. Big city prices are irksome.\n\nThe towel rack was a wooden ladder that leans against a bathroom wall. I found it virtually impossible to remove a single towel without dumping others on the floor. Very trendy, but a waste of towels.\n\nThe lights, etc., are controlled by button panels in various spots. They make no sense. (I'm not an idiot about tech. About other things, yes, obviously.)\n\nWhen I arrived, the TV in the main room was blasting its sound into the bathroom, I had to call the desk to find out how to turn it down; there's an inconspicuous, unlabeled dial near the toilet.\n\nFinally, I'm posting a photo of the only art in the room. What the heck are they thinking? Really? I've shown this to a few other people just to be sure that I'm not the only one who finds this to be an inappropriate painting.  The hotel should think about replacing its art with paintings of creepy clowns. It'd be a step up. \n\nSo, all of these are small points -- assuming you can ignore the creepshow on the wall -- that mar a hotel that otherwise is good. If my company puts me up there again, I won't complain. I may sigh, but I won't complain.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The Dream hotel fit the bill. Was super cool.. maybe a bit to cool for us it turned out (as older parents).\n\nLocation: Loved the location in the meatpacking district. Beautiful views of the skyline from the rooftop bar\/club- Phd. Convenient to the High line, The Whitney museum, tons of bars, restaurants and the subway. (see below tips)\n\nDecor\/room: The decor was very stylish. I liked the American flag made out of Mexican beer cans in the lobby. Wonderful view of the skyline including Empire state building from the round \u201cporthole like\u201c windows. Had a hard time locating the drinking glasses in the room. (ended up being inside a cabinet in the bathroom). I would\u2019ve expected them to be near the mini bar. We found the light switches to be difficult to use. I know that sounds strange but trust me. Also, I was not a fan of the big hole in the door where the doorknob should be. Looks cool but I didn\u2019t like the \u201cPeephole\u201d Lovely smelling toiletries. Sadly, we couldn\u2019t take advantage of the pool as it was Nov. But it looks super fun.\n\nRooftop bar \u201cPhd\": The lobby was absolutely packed with young adults in skimpy clothes waiting for the bar to open. Once upstairs, it was quite the scene.  The bar was fun to people watch, and has a fantastic view. We were there in late fall but I imagine it\u2019s spectacular in the nice weather when it is more open. \n\nCons: Even though we were floors away, the music from the club kept us awake. Drunk PYTs were walking around our hallway, cursing and making lots of noise. The elevator is confusing.  You need to put you room key card in for security but there were glitches and many guests including us almost gave up and walked down the stairs. All the beautiful young people made me feel old. LOL. \n\nTips: Be prepared to be surrounded by young hipsters. It can be fun but if you aren't in the mood.. well then... don't stay here.  Bring earplugs, If you plan on going to the rooftop bar for the view and not staying to dance and party\u2026 go early. Go all the way to the back for a great view.  Be sure to check out Chelsea market for many cool shops, bars, and restaurants.

Our mattress had a feather pillow topper on it and you could feel the feathers from underneath the fitted sheets, poking and scratching you all night. I slept with pants and a shirt on and it was still insufferable. The pillows were flimsy and ended up completely flat after laying on them for a short amount of time. They offered no neck support.\n\nFor being a party hotel, they've done absolutely nothing to soundproof. We could hear every single person walking by to get into their rooms and heard every word they said. Additionally, we were on the 4th floor of the hotel and could still hear the club music coming from PhD on the top floor. \n\nAll in all, this hotel is 100% overrated and not worth the cost.

We lived in NYC for 17 years, we heard about it alongside the Gansevoort Hotel and others in the meatpacking district.  If you're looking for new york's hottest club (think SNL's Stefon), and a safe place to crash once the sun comes up, you've come to the right place.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean it's a good hotel, if you're there for lodging purposes.  Let's leave aside the typical ~$500 price tag.  The rooms are tiny, the amenities few, the design downright odd, the space not very clean, and (worst of all, for a party hotel) the soundproofing is miserable.  There's a mini fridge, thoroughly stocked with stuff they want to upcharge you for, but no room for you to put extra takeout food.  There's a wonky shower curtain that appears to be made out of linked chainmail, but the curtain liner has mold all over it.  The light switches are unusual, not intuitive, and hard to figure out if you're coming to it in the dark.  There's a coat closet that holds, at most, 2 garments (other than the Dream Hotel bathrobe they're trying to sell you).  And a desk with a depth of about 10 inches, so your laptop is cantilevered off the edge.  Basically, the decor tries to be funky while not being either classy or functional, and as a result comes off as tacky and cheap.\n\nBut the soundproofing, oh man.  We were back in town for the first time ever as ex-New Yorkers, and our rooms were near (but did not back up on) the elevator on the 8th floor.  We heard every word of every conversation in the hallway, elevator lobby, and adjoining rooms.  We could hear the oontz-oontz of dance music from the rooftop club.  Without white-noise apps on our phones, it's doubtful we would have gotten to sleep at all.\n\nIf you're coming to the Dream for any reason other than keeping it going all night, I strongly recommend going elsewhere.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

What do they stand for, what is the brand?? All very confusing, even more when you read TripAdvisor and the Hotel manager\u2019s answers. He mentions a lot of times that the hotel wants to give a good service and experience. \nHere is our experience:\nThe room was clean and modern. We had a suite on 10th floor, a quiet room. No disturbance from all the parties at all. Good size of the bathroom and great view. But that is about it. The service of this hotel is really bad. I have never been to a hotel with so slow service of all in the staff. We arrived just before midnight on a Saturday, then you have a dj just by the front desk. So you cannot hear anything and our check in took more than 30 min. We were so tired and just wanted to sleep after a 24 hours travel. A good hotel would have given us the key and asked us to to the real check in the next morning. We asked for an extra duvet, we got one after a long waiting time but without a cover.... Everything we asked for took ages to get and usually it was wrong. I wrote an email to the manager and got a nice answer, but no action. Usually you see if a hotel is good or not by how they deal with problems. Here I gave them a chance but nothing happened. Not even a small gesture. I must say that it was surprisingly empty words. \nWe asked for 10 more hangers, got 4. We asked for normal coffee, got decaf. Asked for a cover to our duvet three times until it was fixed. This list with small, not important but annoying things could continue...\nWorst was the drive back to airport. \nWe grabbed a taxi from the JFK airport that cost us $58 with an ok driver. The hotel arranged a bigger car but still bad quality back to airport but for a cost of $105 (hotel said it was $80, but then toll and tip was added) and with a crazy driver. \nSo my proposal is that this hotel should just go for being the party hotel and not try to be the nice service hotel. Be honest who you are and be clear about that. Then you will have many more happy customers. ","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This hotel needs to figure out what business it wants to pursue. I was booked in this hotel by a third-party service for a trip with two older teens. The location is good, and when our room was quiet, it was a nice place. The problem was that our room was not quiet when one would like it to be, like between the hours of midnight and 5 am.  The hotel had an event that we heard, and even more disruptive to any hope of sleep, felt in our room, with the LOUD music vibrating walls and the beds. The hotel told me they could not turn the music down, as it was from one of their biggest events of the year. Moving to a different room at 3 am was not the situation I wanted to be in and not a positive solution.  The hotel could have handled the situation much better from the very beginning by alerting me about the conditions when I checked in, not booking rooms impacted by the noise, not running a nightclub, etc.  I left feeling really unwell, tired, misled and unwanted.  I have never stayed at a hotel that created such an unwelcoming environment\u2014and all utterly avoidable. Management reached out after my stay and I appreciate that gesture, but the fundamental issue I have with this establishment isn\u2019t addressed by an afterthought. The inhospitable environment was intentional and a bigger priority to the hotel than my comfort. This business needs to figure out what it wants to be\u2014a nightclub or a hotel. Until then this hotel is only suitable for people who go to bed when the sun rises.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms are supposed to be hip, but they're just annoying. The lighting is terrible. The dimmer switches are maddening. The bed is practically a mattress on the ground and terribly uncomfortable. The nightstands have no place to store anything; no shelves, no drawers. There are no outlets near the bed unless you pull the bed out and probe around with your fingers near the baseboard. The ironing board is useless. There were no washcloths. There's a peephole into the bathroom. The do-not-disturb sign is a light on the doorbell that is so impossible to comprehend that even the housekeeping staff ignore it. The refrigerator is crammed with things to buy but has no room to put any of your own food in it. There's not even a coffee machine. What kind of hotel doesn't provide a coffee maker? (Hint: this one.) There's a speaker in the bathroom to play the sound from the TV--why? The bathroom has a sink that reminds me of a prison. But there's no place to put my toiletries save a teeny glass shelf. There are no reading lights near the bed. But there's a useless purple entry light. One of the outlets on the desk works but the other doesn't. No idea why. There are maybe 2 small drawers, one half the depth of the other, to put clothes in. The only positive thing I can say about it is the water pressure in the shower was good.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We got exactly what we were looking for!\nLet me start off by saying that I was a bit concerned because of the mixed reviews recently left here; complaints of noise from the parties being heard from the rooms, elevators smelling like weed, and bad service from staff. \n\nThis was far from the truth!\n\nWe chose the weekender package directly from their website, highly recommended! It included continental breakfast at Bodega Negra; the best continental breakfast I\u2019ve ever had! Their menu had a nice variety of breakfast options, from a delicious smash avocado toast to a massive stack of pancakes, all fresh made to order. And of course, breakfast isn\u2019t complete without mimosas, but if spicy is more to your liking, they had bloody Mary\u2019s to kick start your morning! We only had a chance to try the carrots off their lunch menu, very tasteful by the way, but there was an option for every palette. \n\nAll of the staff was very accommodating! Check-in was smooth. The staff addressed our questions and helped us with recommendations on local sites to check out and try. We got the bronze king room without balcony and were situated the ninth floor. It was plenty of space for the two of us on our 3 night stay. Besides, you don\u2019t visit NYC to be trapped in a room all day, get out there and take in the sights\ud83d\ude09. The service requests we had (one of the light fixtures weren\u2019t working) were addressed immediately. Best of all, in my opinion, is that they message you directly to your phone after check in should you have any questions or concerns. This is where we addressed the lighting fixture, and they fixed it while we were out and about. \n\nThe 12th floor rooftop venue called PHD came with great music and drinks. Whether your thing is to sit back and sip on your manhattan or show off your freshest dance moves, there\u2019s plenty of space for both with the views and decor to add that finishing touch for your next night photo selfie. We already had plans for Saturday night, but we had some serious FOMO when we saw the crowds start to arrive for PHD. \n\nWe didn\u2019t come prepared, but they also have a heated pool with beach beds, cabanas, and a bar just steps away.  Definitely something to consider for our return during warmer weather. \n\nNeedless to say, I recommend this place to anyone who is looking to be centrally located with shopping dining and leisure all within walking distance.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is very modern and has a hip vibe to it from the time you arrive. I loved the style and arty decorations throughout the building.\nAs I was travelling with a friend we had booked a two bedroom room (A Silver Double) which looked cute and quirky online.  To be honest I was disappointed with the room when we checked in.  Yes it had the quirky feel of the photos (with round windows reminiscent of ships port holes) but it was missing basic amenities such as tea and coffee provision or complimentary water.  These are standard items in a hotel of this quality and price point.  In addition the room was incredibly small and had very limited storage space, to the point we both lived out of our suitcases for the week! It was also dirty in places, the 'carpet' was surprisingly threadbare, and the bathroom fixtures were not secure (the toilet roll holder fell off the wall at one point).  I get the feeling this is the kind of place the young hip crowd go for a weekend to party but isn't really somewhere that caters to international guests wanting a longer term luxury holiday.  We did spend time at the Beach Club \/ Pool and PHD (separate reviews) both of which were fantastic.  The location for visiting Chelsea and Greenwich is also perfect.\n\nHaving said all of the above, except for a little hiccup at check-in we could not fault the service of the staff.  Incredibly warm, welcoming and professional.  All requests to the guest services, housekeeping and bell staff were dealt with quickly, efficiently and as though nothing was too much trouble for them.\n\nIn Summary: Great place to stay to see and be seen and to experience the celeb life style BUT you are paying for the name and the associated brands of the restaurants and bars, not necessarily the quality of the hotel itself.  We did have a blast however and would definitely stay again, just perhaps in a different room and for a shorter time.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Part of the reason I liked this promotion was because it offered early check in or late check out based on availability.  I get that.  However, when we arrived at 5PM (check in at 3PM) our room wasn't even ready and we were asked to wait an unknown amount of time.  We had an event to go to and needed to change and get going and this delay ended up making us late to our event.  Front desk tried to get me to agree to temporarily be moved to a bronze room ( we booked gold) in the interim which was unacceptable.  The promo offered a free complimentary upgrade.  If there was ever a time for an upgrade I would assume your room not being ready by 5PM would be one of those things.  So we waited at least a half hour or more, and when we got to our room there were dirty room service dishes on the floor next to the door of our room.  So gross, obviously they must have JUST cleaned it who knows but that is terrible to see dirty dishes from the guests before you.  Upon check in I asked about the late check out (we needed it) and he said he would accommodate it up to 1PM the next day.  Sure enough that was not communicated because a woman came by our room at like 12:15 asking us to leave.  I explained we arranged for the late checkout with the desk but she said she never got any word of that so that was another factor of the promo that never panned out.  We valeted our car and forgot something in the vehicle by accident.  We were told they would charge us a whole day valet charge to bring it around.  They told us to walk across the street to the parking lot and find an attendant to help locate the car so we could find what we were looking for,  When we got here...no attendant in sight.  We ran back to the hotel and one of the very nice bellmen escorted us back to the car and here's the kicker...they left the car unlocked!!  Terrible, who know what could have happened with an unlocked car in that lot.  Room was very small but had a great view.  The beds were terribly uncomfortable and temperature set point in the room was hard to get to the right temperature.  It was either too hot or too cold.  There was a strange moisture odor in the hallway that I attributed to the fact they have a pool but why would you smell moisture on the 10th floor?  One positive was the Concierge was very helpful though for an urgent request that he helped us with.  I would not book here again.  Promo seemed like a scam just to get you in the door.  There is too much competition in NYC with hotels that have great customer service.  This location needs a good lesson on that as well up front customer marketing.  I left feeling very disappointed and ripped off.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

I specifically requested a quiet room as soon as I booked the hotel. Instead I received a room where I listened to thumping club music until 3:30am.

No hotel or front desk employees say hello when you walk through the doors, club bouncers waiting at main elevators to let people up into club frown at you as you try to get to your room (the elevators are shared\/next to each other).

No hotel or front desk employees say hello when you walk through the doors. The doormen or club bouncers I should say, are more concerned that if you are here for the club that you have a stamp and are not sneaking past the line. Last night (on a Monday) we slept to loud thumping club music until what had to be 4am. And if you want to take a nap during the day, forget about it. The vibration of the music from the daytime pool party will overwhelm you. The room was a decent size although felt like a cruise ship cabin from the 70s. No coffee maker. No access to water other than the (1) 12 ounce bottle they provided over the 3 nights we were there & of course the $15 bottled water options from the mini fridge. The toilet in the bathroom was way too high and a huge design flaw in my opinion. I was on my tippy toes to even use it and I am not short. We had fun at the restaurant downstairs (bodega negro) and enjoyed cocktails on the rooftop - despite those around us being overly intoxicated and throwing up on the terrace. I liked that there was a lot going on at the hotel but it should not have been to the extent it was. The hallways always had empty drink glasses and leftover room service trays that would sit for almost 24 hours before anyone came to pick it up. It\u2019s just clear that there is little concern about providing good hospitality and that the focus is on the party scene. I would like to note though that the housekeeping staff is far better than any other staff in this hotel. They always said hello, serviced our room as soon as we would leave and responded right away when we needed fresh towels. I am giving 2 stars bc of this and the location but my husband and I would never stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our visit was wonderful.  The staff was friendly and helpful from the front desk staff at check-in, (which took about 5 minutes), to the concierge, room service and cleaning staff.  A piece of birthday cake was even delivered to our room at 10 pm, compliments of the management--complete with the nicest hand written birthday note.  I have NEVER received anything so nice at any other hotel.  We had requested a room away from the nightclubs when we made the reservation, and when we arrived we had been upgraded at no extra cost to a beautiful room with a king bed.  The room was fresh, modern and immaculate.  The bathroom is very cool with a tiny round  tile on the floors all the way to the high ceilings, and a chainmail shower curtain and a rain shower head.  I have stayed at a lot of Hilton, Mariott, and Holiday Inn hotels and the bathrooms frequently have dingy baseboards, peeling wall paper in the corners and plastic enclosure showers but this bathroom is new looking and spotless.  The towels are hanging on a ladder leaning against the wall.  The inside of the bathroom is frosted glass and the outside is mirrored glass.  Plenty of hot water.  Some reviewers complained about a lack of towels and no blow dryer.  We had plenty of towels, a blow dryer, and complimentary tubes of shampoo, conditioner and body wash, and a nice, cozy bath robe.  People complained that the concrete floors were cold.  The concrete floor lends to the industrial chic look of the room and there is a large antique style rug under the bed, which covers most of the floor.  The small section of concrete floor you might walk on is cool and feels good in August.  People complained about a lack of plugs by the bed.  There is a plug strip on the floor on one side of the bed with plenty of outlets.  There are also USB ports for charging phones, on the side of the bedside lamps on both sides of the bed--as well as multiple plugs on the small wall mounted desk across from the bed.  We requested a refrigerator, (for $10), which was in our room when we arrived.  We went to Chelsea Market, (across the street), and purchased delicious croissants and teeny tiny jellies from Sarabeth's Bakery which we ate for breakfast the next day.  We also went to Duane Reade drug store down the sidewalk from Dream and brought back water, soda, OJ, chips and snacks--so we didn't miss the fact that there is no coffee maker in the room.  There are also snacks in the minibar for a charge--and there is an order form for breakfast you can fill out and hang on your doorknob and your breakfast will be delivered to you at your preferred time.  Some reviewers complained about noise.  There was absolutely no noise at all in our room....no noise from either night club, or from the room above us or beside us, or from the hallway.  There were no rude or loud obnoxious guests anywhere--and the guests we did encounter in the public spaces and on elevators, were nice, polite and well dressed.  Speaking of elevators, there are several and we never had more than a minute or two to wait. And there was no smell of smoke of any kind anywhere.   We did not have time to go to the clubs or the pool, but the front dest was happy to share information on both.  The clubs are not owned by the hotel itself, however, hotel guests are guaranteed entrance if they wish to go before 9:30 pm.  If you want to go after that time, it is like entrance to any other NYC nightclub, which means you may have to stand in line, or pay for a minimum drink order.  As for the pool lounge chairs, they are first come, first serve starting at 8 am, but you can be wait listed or sit at the grill and wait. We found street parking nearby and were able to stay all Sat\/Sun free of charge.  In all, we found the Dream Hotel to be a peaceful and amazing get-away, and will definitely return.

The first night we were there we waited for 35 minutes to go to our room ( we took the stairs after this but we had luggage the first night).

I stay at the Dream hotels in NYC and Hollywood quite regularly.  I am  also a fan of a good party as well.  The Dream is a good hotel, but I think people need to understand what they are getting into when they stay here. Especially in the Summer from Weds- Sunday. I have to give it to PH-D ( the rooftop club), at the Dream. In club years the run has been amazing and it is still packed on most nights. The pool in the summer is a zoo . Understandable  it is NYC and the Soho House is not letting just anyone come to their pool and the Gansevoort is not cool anymore. The point I am trying to make is this, if you are a conservative business person in town for meetings or traveling with a young family , this probably is not the hotel for you.  This is what I would call a party hotel. As party hotels go The Dream is the best , as I mentioned largely based on the success of their in- house club PHD.   A lot of wear and tear  on the rooms comes with being a party hotel, look at the Standard or the old W hotels. The Public  hotel is dealing with that now.

The pool should only be available to hotel guest for a holiday weekend or any weekend for that matter. We ended up sitting at the edge of the pool for two days and did not get a chance to lay on a chair. Hotel guest should get priority for amentities. The staff at the pool were amazing!! Naomi was amazing, super sweet, and attentive,We love you girl!!! We also enjoyed the restaurants bodega negra is great and Phillipe's was even better!!! the rooftop was Great too but once again hotel guest should get priority to enter and enjoy the nightlife. The staff at the front desk were nice and helpful when needed. I would probably not stay here again because of the overcrowded pool but we did have a very good time!

I know the clientele this place mostly attracts. I have been to PHD and Bodega Negra at Dream several times before, without ever staying at the hotel. \n\nI have stayed at Dream Hotels outside of NYC and had wonderful experiences where the staff treat you like a paying guest, and even more-so, a friend. The front desk staff here was extremely unwelcoming from the moment we walked in to check in. When asked questions the lady at the front desk was dismissive and seemed like she didn\u2019t want to be bothered. We thought maybe she was having a bad\/busy day and let it go.. next. We arrived around 9 AM, and were told by the same lady the room would be available around 12. We decided to try and enjoy the pool in the meantime, we found a tiny spot in the corner to cram our stuff into and sit in the cramped pool. During our time at the pool Sara let us know she\u2019ll try to help us get a seat while we\u2019re on the waitlist. She then proceeded to text me a bit later that she can get find us three seats for $200. Is this a joke?  Cheating hotel patrons for a quick buck? First off, I am already paying $200+ a night to stay in this hotel, shouldn\u2019t that give me some kind of priority to enjoy myself at the hotel pool? Nope, not at Dream downtown where the employees couldn\u2019t care less about you. Pool enjoyment was also interrupted by guests complaining and frequently calling management and security - clearly they know this is a problem - BUT YOU GUESSED IT why would they care when they can make some extra money letting people buy day passes and cheating them to get chairs \ud83d\ude09. \n\n12:39 PM we got a call from the same woman we checked in with that the room was ready. We show up to the front desk about an hour later and a different front desk employee tells us that it looks like the hotel is so busy and backed up because of the holiday weekend our room isn\u2019t ready yet... mind you this is almost 2 hours after scheduled check in time. We of course tell him that we got a call that the room was ready so how does that happen? He checks again, says oh looks like she gave it away to someone else. EXCUSE ME? IN WHAT WORLD DOES THIS HAPPEN? This isn\u2019t my first (luxury) hotel stay, especially in NYC and only made me think about how many patrons they lie to and abuse. \n\nWhen he realized our room had in fact been ready and given away by another employee he did rectify the situation and get us another room - took about an hour, but resolved. This was the one and only front desk employee that was somewhat welcoming throughout our entire stay and felt extremely apologetic towards the situation so he actually worked it out, but here we are, getting to our room about 4 hours post check in time. \n\nThe next morning we got up at the crack of dawn to get a chair at the pool as we were told by others the day before that people line up around 7 AM. When we got downstairs at 7 to what we thought was the only pool entrance and there was no line we asked the lady at front desk if this is where people line up, she seemed to be dismissive of our comment and just stared at us with a smirk, while another guy chimed in just saying \u2018yes this is the entrance it open at 8, you can wait here\u2019. As a couple people joined us they were also surprised and going to the front desk to ask if this is where we wait, and everytime the front desk was approached they answered in a rude unhelpful tone. Of course they know what we\u2019re asking and that there was another place where people where supposed to line up but for some odd reason they decided they didn\u2019t want to help the hotel guests. We figured it out on our own and found a line of about 15 people lined up at the other entrance. Thanks for the help. \n\nI WILL GLADLY LET ALL MY FRIENDS VISITING NYC TO NEVER BOOK A STAY AT THIS GREEDY UNWELCOMING PLACE AGAIN. There are way too many other great, trendy and welcoming places to stay where the front desk never make you feel like crap, and you don\u2019t have to deal with pretentious personalities.

This is NOT FOR FAMILIES OR BUSINESS TRAVELLERS OR OLDER ADULTS OR CHILDREN. Take the hint. I can't be more clear than that.\n\nWe stayed at this hotel for Gay Pride because it had a pool, it was close to the gay area, the pride march route and we knew this would be a bit of a party hotel. Upon checkin we were given a room on the 2nd floor facing the pool. They probably thought looking at 2 gay men for pride we wanted to be in the complete thick of it. We do...but not for sleeping. We walked into the room and the pool could see us and the noise, well, we might as well have been outside stood next to the speaker. We handed back the room and took one on the 8th floor. So hint, do not take a room on the 2nd floor or the top floor below the rooftop bar. Room was nice, small, but it's New York. Little storage space. No bin, why no bin? Made us laugh.\n\nAs other's have said, the pool is not owned by the hotel. I'm not sure how this can be, it sounds beyond strange. Anyway, we went to the pool to be told there is a waiting list. Basically forget the waiting list. If you're an internal traveller they don't ring you because ringing an international number requires going downstairs. We just grabbed towels and found a spot in the pool by the steps. Best place to be honest. It's too hot on the sunbeds and the pool is the place to be. It had a great party vibe and to be quite frank we got drunk on champagne in the pool and just people watched. It kept us thoroughly entertained for the whole afternoon and left laughing in hysterically. The sights by that pool. I doubt you'd see the same if it wasn't Pride. Annoyingly to order drinks you have to provide ID or a credit card. Annoying to have to go back to your room just to get ID!\n\nAt night the hotel transforms again, I presume the rooftop turns into a nightclub because downstairs becomes the queuing lobby with roped queues, bouncers and a dedicated lift. Do like we did, cheekily view the upstairs when it is closed. Get the lift to the 11th floor (as they close the 12th so you shouldn't be able to get access). Then just take the emergency exit stairs up to the 12th and have a nosey round. We even walked up further to the roof roof, probably a little dangerous, this is not for the faint of heart.\n\nCheckout was a mess, at checkin we gave a different card to the reservation card to use for incidentals. During our stay any pool\/minibar charges were charged to the wrong card. So frustrating and they couldn't fix this.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We are 2 mature ladies who abandoned our families and flew off to NYC for fun. We chose the hotel for its pool (which we thought would be a great place for relaxation when needed - how wrong can you be!) and for its location near Chelsea Market and the great restaurants and cafes in the nearby areas.\n\nFirst impressions of the hotel were fabulous; It is a very unusual building which appears to have been styled and targeted at upwardly mobile, young people and we were probably NOT their target market.  Visually, it is a dream but it was definitely a case of 'form over function' and there were lots of little issues that marred the experience.  \n\nWe enjoyed our stay despite the little niggles: not enough towels left for 2 adults, inconstant turn down service, inadequate storage for a 2 x Queen Room, lifts out of order, very fancy but dodgy electrics, hoards of non-residents using the pool at weekends\/queuing for lifts to get to the roof top club\/attending private parties held in the communal areas, no first aider available when my friend had a nasty accident, traffic and street noise until dawn, mistakes on the bill etc.  \n\nThe hotel is obviously a very popular venue with NYC clubbers, corporate and personal events and pool parties and we enjoyed the buzz, on the whole. There is a sense, however, that residents, are insufficiently catered for and that the Hotel's Management Team would benefit from reviewing their product through the eyes of the resident if they want guests, other than weekend clubbers, to come back.\n\nAll that said, the staff were wonderful and the concierges couldn't do enough to help..

The window was a circle, and there were buttons to do everything, and every inch of the bathroom was covered in tile.  The room was very small but very high ceilings.  The bed was extremely low and uncomfortable, and then the TV was quiet small and high on the wall.  I was satisfied with my room on the 5th floor, however my boss stayed on a higher floor underneath the bar and he said it was noisy.  I stayed there on a Tuesday and Wednesday night, and the lobby was filled with young women in tiny dresses.  I'm a 30 year old woman who appreciates night life, however when travelling for work, I want to relax in a quiet environment.  One of the three elevators wasn't working (from other reviews it looks like this is always the case), and another elevator was reserved for guests of the bar, so there's only one elevator for the hotel guests and an annoyingly long wait at 11pm when you just want to crash.\n\nThat being said, although it wasn't a relaxing or cozy hotel, as I mentioned, it was very clean and the location was unbeatable, so I would likely stay here again.

Also, to ban children from the pool from 12 noon is kinda harsh - maybe extend that to 3pm?\nThe concierges tried to be helpful but did not appear to be very knowledgable about pretty basic things.\nAsk for extra pillows - they supply one per person, and they are of a low quality.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This didn't bother everyone in our party but worth knowing if you are sensitive to this kind of sound. The baths don't drain properly due to a design feature which makes the base totally flat. Otherwise, the front desk staff were lovely, especially John Tadros and the concierge Chris Scali.

I was worried because of some negative reviews I\u2019d read, but I\u2019m SO happy we decided on Dream. \n\nBefore arriving, I called the hotel and requested a room with a city view and not too much noise. A lot of negative reviews seem to be about the noise from the rooftop and basement clubs. I also mentioned it was my birthday the day of check in. The hotel accommodated us with no issues and we got a room on the 7th floor. We arrived to find a bottle of champagne and a hand written birthday note which was so sweet. \n\nNoise was a non-issue. We didn\u2019t hear a thing and slept like babies! Having said that, the hotel is close to the Meatpacking District and does attract a younger crowd. The lobby has a DJ and bar at night and can get quite busy until the early AM hours. For us, it was a bonus. A beautiful space to have a drink without leaving the hotel. A lot of people also commented on the \u201cfrustrating\u201d lighting system. It was literally a button that you push to turn the light on or off or hold to dim. No difficulties there. It\u2019s a boutique hotel so it wasn\u2019t the most spacious room I\u2019ve been in, but it had what we needed which is most important! \n\nWhat blew us away was the staff\u2019s personal touches. On the 2nd day of our stay, my boyfriend proposed and the staff was beyond awesome! From delivering champagne after the the proposal to sending chocolate covered strawberries with ANOTHER handwritten note to our room, the customer relations at this hotel were above anything I\u2019ve ever experienced! \n\nI\u2019d recommend this hotel to anyone who\u2019s looking for a more authentic NY experience away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square and other touristy place, but still close to a vibrant nightlife scene. Thank you to the \u201cDream Team\u201d! Can\u2019t wait to visit again.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I booked a Gold King room for my girlfriend's birthday, and was very excited for our stay. I have never left a negative review before, and am not usually one to complain, but since this hotel was less than impressive for the price point and for such a special weekend, I hope this review will save others the disappointment. \n\nUpon our arrival, we were greeted by Aaron at the front desk who was kind and pleasant, and we had an easy, straightforward check-in. When we got on the elevator, we had to try at least 5 times to get the key card to work so we could get to our floor. We had issues with the elevator reading the key cards every single time we used them, which was annoying and seems to be an on-going issue for everyone. Once we made it to our room, we were impressed by how spacious the room was and the beautiful skyline views, including the Empire State Building. Since it's winter time on the East Coast, the sun sets pretty early, and my girlfriend and I noticed that even with the lights on and windows open, our room was completely dark by 4:30-5pm. We were trying to get ready for dinner and a night out, and spent at least a half hour trying to work the bizarre light switch buttons. We managed to figure them out, but were disappointed when we realized the single overhead light in the room lights up almost nothing at it's max brightness. The lightbulb in the tiny lamp on the desk was broken so we called to have it fixed. Although the man who changed the lightbulb came shortly after and was very nice, the newly lit lamp did almost nothing to brighten up the room, and he told us the lights did not go any brighter. We were left to change and do our hair and makeup in darkness. We literally had to use the flashlights on our phones to try to get some light. Why is there not at least more lighting in the bathroom? If you like living\/getting ready in the pitch black, maybe you will enjoy lol. \n\nAside from the whole bizarre lighting situation, there were too many details lacking that made the price of this hotel not worth it. Their website states that Gold King rooms include \"ultra plush bathrobes,\" which there were no robes. We had to call for an ice bucket, which took far too long to be delivered. We then realized there are no glasses or cups available in the room so we had to call again for those. The bed is not particularly comfortable like most I've stayed at in the city. The pillows are absolutely dreadful. Sleeping without the pillows probably would've been more comfortable since your head will sink into them and practically touch the bed anyway. It was also annoying that there was no body lotion provided in the bathroom as we did not pack any since it is usually provided at other hotels. The drain in the sink must've been clogged or broken because washing your hands for a few seconds would cause it to fill all the way up and take forever to drain. You can imagine this gets pretty gross when you're brushing your teeth. Lastly, the thermostat seemed to not be working as it was freezing cold even when we turned the temperature all the way up to 78 degrees. \n\nThere were just too many things wrong. We only stayed a night and wanted to enjoy our time so we tried to overlook them and did not go out of our way to try to get all of these issues fixed. However, they are worth noting so that others can steer clear of this overpriced, underwhelming hotel. Definitely would not stay at a Dream hotel again, and will opt for better hotels at this price point.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The whole space had a modern elegance, especially the fascinating interactive Mother Nature art installation.\n\nThe front desk workers were welcoming and friendly, and made sure to tell me about all the amenities, including the restaurants and the rooftop nightclub.\n\nI chose a room with direct access to the outside, heated pool, and I\u2019ve included pictures of my room with this review. Even though it was rather cold out, the pool itself was warm enough to get into. (I didn\u2019t stay in the pool too long because the part of my body that wasn\u2019t in the water was very cold, but if it had been a normal winter day rather than high winds and rock bottom tempteratures, I probably could have stayed out there longer.) The pool deck area was pretty, and I\u2019m sure it would be a popular attraction in slightly warmer weather.\n\nMy room itself was comfortable, with plenty of space and well stocked. (The robe was missing, but as soon as I asked about it, they were quick to send someone up with two!) I really liked the rain shower, and the shower supplies were fancy enough that I actually bothered with taking them home with me. When the nighttime turndown service housekeeper came around, she was extremely attentive and made sure to give me extras of all the consumables, and offered me ones I didn\u2019t think to ask for.\n\nFor dinner, I went to happy hour at Bodegra Negra, their Mexican restaurant. I was able to have a few excellent margaritas and two delicious small plates (either of which could have been enough on their own) for a much lower price than you would expect from a high quality restaurant attached to a high-end hotel.\n\nLater that night, I went to PhD Nightclub, their rooftop club. That\u2019s a separate experience that I might review another time (it wasn\u2019t bad, but it just wasn\u2019t my scene), but I figured it was worth including that they do have it there and it has an amazing skyline view.\n\nI had room service breakfast the next day, which was a relaxing treat and didn\u2019t cost too much extra, considering the fact that it was room service. I wasn\u2019t in a hurry to get moving in the morning, since check out wasn\u2019t until 12 (and simply by calling the front desk and asking nicely, I got it extended until 12:30.)\n\nI was kind of sad to leave, but I think I\u2019m going to come back soon for my birthday in February, and probably bring friends this time!","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Awesome Koi fish painted on the walls and limited availability. Like many NYC hotels you get what you pay for with size of the rooms. I have stayed in three sizes and the cheapest rooms aren't at all bad, you can definitely walk around. The circular windows facing the pool  open and the decor is very modern\/chic. PHD is a blast on a Friday\/Saturday, be prepared to spend. At times they require 100-150$USD hold on a credit card for alcohol purchases to gain entry. The entire night club overlooks Manhattan and the drinks are top notch. If you are looking for a great night out, a beautifully designed room, an awesome pool, and cafe for brunch in the morning you literally get that all in one place.

I was willing to let that go given the fact this was rated a 4 star hotel and I was assuming the rooms would overcompensate. I was sorely mistaken, each full bed only has two pillows. I called down to request more pillows, come to find that the hotel was out of pillows, I repeat, a hotel, where you pay to sleep, was OUT OF PILLOWS. I can assure you the walls are so thin, we were able to hear our neighbors bumping their music for the entire night despite several calls and complaints to management, including an in person visit to the front desk in my jammies. This was followed up by management with the offer of EAR PLUGS so we could get some sleep. The icing was the fire alarm going off at 1:45 AM, followed by a fight in our hallway at 2:45 AM. To top it off, they have charged us $1,100.00 for two rooms for one night. Needless to say, no member of our family will ever frequent a Dream hotel again.

Also as there is a constant party in the lobby with dj playing, talking to the staff is difficult (but they didn\u2019t seem to take listening to their customers after all)\n\nI pointed out the bad reviews on websites like yelp and the manager told me such reviews \u201care not important\u201d and \u201cdoes not count\u201d (why I\u2019m posting here my review in addition to yelp and google)\n\nOn top of that you can hear the music from downstairs (bar with dj).\n\nThere is no coffee maker in the room.\n\nAnd the size of the fitness room is ridiculous with 2 elliptical, 2 treadmills and a bike. \n\nAnd the card in the elevator can take 10 times to swipe before you can go anywhere, allowing you nice rides to the roof and the basement before you can go to your floor.\n\nFor $500 a night you expect: (1) another quality of service and (2) real customer service. You get none of that.\n\nI had a two days reservation and I cancelled. That time I carefully read reviews on yelp to pick my next hotel ... hope you follow the same advice!","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Unless you\u2019re a 20-something scantily clad club hopping Kardashian wannabe, you will hate it here.  (Actually, you will hate this whole block.)

Upside: the bed is super comfy. Downside: it doesn\u2019t matter because if you\u2019re here on a weekend you will get zero sleep until at least 3:30 AM, due to the thumping and shrieking coming from every which way, from the clubs and from drunk idiots roaming the halls after hours.  AND, you will have to fight rude obnoxious club goers (and doormen) to get in the door TO YOUR HOTEL.  Where you are STAYING.  And forget the elevator situation, also shared with club hoppers.  Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to grab a drink at the lobby bar, unless it\u2019s Monday\u2026the lobby\u2019s a club too.  Even small annoying details of this hotel are made more glaring in the face of the club situation: like, if you have a coffeemaker you will not get coffee replenished, ever. If you take a water from the minibar, it will never get replenished, ever.  You will get lots of towels at first, but as the days go on, sometimes you\u2019ll get all of them, sometimes you won\u2019t.  There is zero closet space, but LOTS of mirrors.

We should have had a wonderful celebration and a great time. Instead, we were exhausted and stressed the entire trip because of this hotel.\n\nThere was jack hammering outside our window well past midnight, and after two nights of this, we insisted on a room change. We were exhausted, and in the rush of changing rooms, my husband left his wallet behind. He went back to the original room around 8 a.m., and the wallet was gone. One week later, and no one at the hotel has made any move to address this with us.\n\nWhen I checked out, I told them I was extremely disappointed that they didn't tell us about the jack hammering when we checked in and provided us immediately with the option to switch rooms. The millennials at the counter kept telling me it wasn't their fault, that it was the city's fault, and I kept trying to explain that I understood that, but it was still their responsibility to take care of their guests. Apparently, they half heard me, because when I came back for my suitcase, I heard them tell someone checking in about the noise, and that if he wanted to avoid it, he would HAVE TO PAY FOR AN UPGRADE.\n\nThere are no words for how awful that is. That is not customer service: that is extortion.\n\nThis hotel is great if you want to see and be seen. It was clearly very hip.

We were first greeted after a 14 hour flight by a queue to get in to the lobby which doubles as the entrance for a nightclub (not kidding). Lots of heavily done up young girls and men walking around, incredibly loud and intoxicated. The reception staff were nice however got a call from American Express shortly after checking in to confirm at charge of US$ 10,000 to my card from the hotel, no wonder the reception staff were so nice. \n\nQuickly rushed downstairs and informed them of their error (overcharging $7000 to my card) to which they didn\u2019t initially oblige and after some debating finally agreed to pay the price that we booked at. F**king ridiculous. Further, the bond\/incidentals charge is $2000 (they charged me twice - thanks) which is absolutely pathetic. \n\nReturned to the room - terrible water pressure, TV doesn\u2019t work and there is a consistent barrage of noise coming from my neighbors, a girl celebrating her 21st. Little did I realise, this would set the tone for my entire stay - exhaustively, both metaphorically and literally. \n\nNext thing I became aware, the pool may as well not exist. Always INCREDIBLY crowded and somehow people manage to reserve the pool chairs even though there is a policy of no reservations - funny that. \n\nFire alarm went off twice during my stay, once at midnight and another at 3am one morning. The lifts weren\u2019t working for part of my stay and so the security guards were polite enough to inform me that the only remaining lift that works is for the night club - you\u2019ll be taking the stairs pal. \n\nThere was vomit in the hallway that had been half cleaned up for the duration of my stay. In fact, I believe that if I returned this instant that vomit would still be there. Potentially even more. \n\nIn conclusion, the hotel is for partygoers and holds itself out as a trendy, chic and nice place to stay. This is completely misleading. Regret my stay and would advise others to consider other options, particularly if they want to sleep at all.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were already prepared for the hotel to be a loud, club feel and we figured the rooms were going to be very small....what we weren't expecting was the poor service. We checked in late evening on Thursday and asked if they had a king bed (rather than queen) and we were told there would be a $25 upgrade fee. That's fine, but as it was so late, it's not like they would have sold that room, so I'm not sure why they had to charge me. The process to check in took so long and there wasn't any hospitality. I believe the staff is so worn down by the annoying clubbers using the rooftop bar, but they shouldn't let that affect how they treat the people staying at the hotel. We went to several other hotels around the city to use their rooftop bars or clubs and all of their staff was very gracious to us...would have been nice to get the same treatment from our own hotel. \n\nBesides the bad service, the King room was impossible for two people to get around. And the bathroom was also very tiny...no where to put your stuff or even hang a towel. The only reason I give this place 2 stars (and not just one) is because of the locations.

We reserved a room for 4 persons and the hotel gave us a room for 2. They said it was Booking's error and they proposed to give us another room with an extra bed and to pay 75$ extra. To my opinion,  we shouldn't have paid for such an error and the Hotel should have been comprehensive. i have to say that staff from reservation were really trying their best to help us and to move us to another room. It was done quickly. I appreciate the room service. Always cute and nice. People from front desks were also nice.\nThe mattress was a little bit hard in our room compared to the first one we had which the bed was super confortable.  We had issues withe the shower. The water would just go everywhere in the bathroom. A real disaster. We had to put towels on the floor and have advised the hotel about this issue.\n\nPool :\nPool is nice. Not a big one but still very convenient and pleasant.\nIts possible to tan depending where you are sitting.\n\nBefore booking,  i read other reviews and I can confirm that the waitresses are really the worst.  They would just ignore you or giving you some attitude. I remember on last Sunday (August 26),  they had this fake blond girl  who looked so upset.  She was the only one working on the terrasse and she seemed so frustrated. Another client told me that she has shared to them that she was not used to do day shifts. She also seemed not used to use her common sens either. Even when i tried to get her attention she just blew me off with the sided eye. That b%$\/!\nAnyway. She kept walking around like a frustrated woman who never got the proper training to work with the public and then they expect to get the tip, right?! She had this mad face... ouf!\nOther clients around me were also complaining about the lack of service at the pool and the poor attitude of the waitresses. Some of them thinks they are all that but need a quick reality check:  they are not even hot. Just cute girl with too much make up. Skinny doesn't make you hot.\n\nAverage faces with some much attitude. Poor them.\n\nAnyway,  the other staff like the lifeguards were really nice  and service oriented.\n\nOne thing that i think needs to be improved :   no waiting list for the pool chairs. This is a weird way to distribute the places. Its all reserved by 8h30 am and you can litteraly see empty chairs just because they are reserved. \nIt shouldn't work like that. \nIt should be first come first serve and to forbid  to reserve a poolchair for someone who is not even there! \n\nMusic is good. The vibe is really great as well.\n\nI think the service at the terrasse \/ the restaurant is a big shame for this hotel.\nIt's really a huge dissatisfaction.\nI remember that the first day when i was sitting at the restaurant and looking at one of the waitresses,  she just turned her head in a way to avoid me. I was losing my patience.\n\nI got up and went to see her and she was just : oh yes,  sure! Where are you sitting?!\n\nCome on,  as if!\nHypocrite and incompetent. \n\nFood:\nGood food. \nA little bit pricey but it is a Hotel.\n\nPhd Rooftop\n\nI was happy to be able to go to the club. I liked better the music on Thursday night .\nSaturday night,  the dj was so-so. Music was good but the dj was not on point.\nOne of the positive :  you have a direct access to the club with no cover when you are client but they still ask you to wait online. I think they should have two lines:  one for the clients of the hotels and another line for the clubbers.\nBy the way:  view is amazinf from the top.\n\nBe careful with the charges. Hotel over charged me and now i am disputing the charges.\n\nIm happy that i lived the experience once but i don't  believe i would go back unlesse i read positive comments and they take in charge the services.\n\nThe service at the pool with the waitresses does not match at all with the rest of the staff at the hotel.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":2173604,"title":"Terrible","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-06-24","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"We (a couple in our early 30s) stayed here for five nights at the end of May\/beginning of June. It was a rubbish experience. \n\nTo start - when we checked in the lady at the front desk accidentally charged me twice (2x $600 charges so $1200 total) for the incidentals block (i.e. the amount they block off your account as a bond). She didn't realise, but I checked my account by chance up at the room and tried call the front desk. Took us about 5 or 6 phone calls before someone answered, but then we spoke to a friendly guy who said he would fix it, and the extra amount would be off my card on 24hrs. \n\nFour days (\/three nights) after checking in, both amounts were still on my card, so I went down and spoke to another friendly guy (Manuel?) who said that nothing had been done about it yet, but he would fix the mistaken charge that very day, and he would give me a call to confirm (and took my number). I also asked him to get us some bathrobes \u2013 as we\u2019d had our bathrobes taken away by housekeeping on the first morning, and despite calling maybe 3 times, no one had returned these yet. He assured me these would get put in our rooms.\n\nGot home that night, no bathrobes, no phone call from the guy on the desk. So the next morning (five days after overcharging me $600), I was starting to get cranky and I went down to the desk again, the same guy said it was going to take another 24hrs, and that he hadn\u2019t been able to call me because it was an international number (you would think that a hotel could call international numbers but whatever). He said he had apparently tried to come to my room to let me know, but I wasn\u2019t there (we had told him we were going out, so this isn\u2019t surprising). He told me he had \u201ctried his best\u201d. But by that point I was really annoyed. I didn\u2019t actually get the amount unblocked until after we had left NYC six days later.\n\nThe pool itself is cool and I didn\u2019t have a problem getting sunbeds. The froses are delicious and the food is also fine. Service is again terrible. It was really weird \u2013 there were staff hanging around everywhere, but the only people allowed to serve were the waitresses, and trying to flag them down took about 45m each time. Once I got off my pool bed about three times to keep asking the front guy (a lifeguard\/door guy of some kind) to send over a waitress and he would be like yeah sure and do nothing about it, and the waitresses would literally walk past so quickly without making eye contact I just wouldn\u2019t get a chance.\n\nDespite telling them your room number, they make you hand over ID, and when we paid the bill at the end of our first day they didn\u2019t return the ID. We had drunk a fair few froses so didn\u2019t notice. So the next day I\u2019m lying on the pool bed asking about our ID and it took me maybe five times of asking (keep in mind it takes forever to get someone to come over to you in the first place) before someone checked on the ID \u2013 they said yeah sorry really weird but we don\u2019t have it. Waitresses seemed totally unconcerned about this. I kept asking different people about this as it was pretty annoying and so they checked with security and were like yep sorry no one has it and then they would walk off again. Like wtf \u2013 you guys have definitely got it, you took it off us just yesterday and didn\u2019t give it back. In the end I walked inside the restaurant and was like ok so where do you keep ID\u2019s \u2013 can you show me? And then the waitress shows me this little alphabetical rolodex thing and I\u2019m like have you tried the letter behind? Lo and behold the ID was under the wrong letter. It would have been so easy to find if they had bothered to try.  \n\nIn the meantime, we had tried to have breakfast at the Bodega Negra restaurant once, where the service was also terrible. We walked inside, and just stood there waiting while the staff were just chatting to each other (it wasn\u2019t busy). We stood about and were like ok maybe we sit ourselves down and someone will come over. We\u2019re sitting there for ages and no one comes over and we had decided what we wanted to eat by then so were like ok maybe we have to pay at the counter during breakfast? So we walk over, and waitress is like oh we will come over for your order. Ok so we sit down again. The girl wanders out the back, comes back with a box of drinks and proceeded to unpack all the drinks into the fridge before coming over. Pretty rude. She takes our orders, then my husband\u2019s meal comes out but no sign of mine. We wait.. he finishes his and then I asked about mine and she\u2019s like oh did you order something? I was like yes\u2026 and she\u2019s like \u201cdo you still want it?\u201d. Ah yes\u2026 I don\u2019t just generally sit around waiting for a meal when I\u2019m not hungry.\n\nIt was honestly just the most overwhelmingly and consistently poor service I have ever had at a hotel in my life. And despite all the continual screw ups, no one was ever like \u201coh hey sorry I said I was going to call you and fix this and didn\u2019t \u2013 here have a free drink on us\u201d. Little things like that make a big difference, and I probably wouldn\u2019t have been quite so pissed off if from time to time I had been offered a free frose or coffee over breakfast as compensation. To be clear \u2013 the staff aren\u2019t unfriendly, they\u2019re definitely friendly enough (when you can grab one), but they\u2019re totally incompetent.\n\nWhen we checked out the guy at the front desk was like hey hope you enjoyed your stay. I proceeded to tell him all of the above, and he apologised, was really nice, and then took the resort fee off my room. This was good of him, but no one had actually told me there was a resort fee in the first place so it was a little hard to feel gracious at that point. Oh and when we paid for all of our room service etc, he forgot to take the other incidentals block off my account (i.e. the $600 charge which I had authorised being blocked), so two weeks after checking out of the hotel I had to email and ask them to sort out. So annoyinggg.\n\nThe whole nightclub thing in the hotel is pretty weird too \u2013 you get back after being out for dinner and there are all these wasted, heavily made up people hanging out in the lobby and the sound from the club is reverberating through the hotel. We didn\u2019t mind that so much as we went out a fair bit, but I can certainly see why people who aren\u2019t out every night would hate the hotel. Not a place for kids!\n\nIn terms of the rooms \u2013 these are a little shabby for what you pay for. Our room had large marks on the carpet etc. The bathrooms are tiny, and have serious limescale or something building up on the tiles which is a bit gross. If the service had been OK I would have said that it\u2019s probably not a place to stay for as long as we stayed (5 nights), but I would have said it was an OK hotel for a long weekend for a girls night out etc. BUT the service was so bad I would honestly just skip it. Stay away.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Yeah, it is a quarter of  the size and the only way you will get a chair is if you are up before 9 am to lay on it the entire day. It is interesting they say it is first come first serve however apparently you can reserve a chair for $150..? There are empty chairs throughout the day yet if you go to sit on one (that has been empty for an hour) you are promptly told no and the chair stays empty.\nWant a drink? Great they need to know your room (fair) and then have you wear two wristbands and keep your Id at the desk with them (as hotel guests this is odd). The front desk already has a copy of your id when you checked in. They refuse to serve without keeping your id. As someone who sees identity theft every day this is an issue. You never want your id being help onto. You already have two wristbands and one has your name scrawled on it.

So we were happy to put our bags in their luggage storage and hang around by the pool. Whilst there we asked the pool bar staff if we were able to charge a phone (we have the charger so all we needed was a spare socket) to be abruptly told to go downstairs to the public bar area where we could pay 2 dollars to use charge box. Strange, seeing as only hotel guests are allowed by the pool so surely it's all the same electricity if we were to charge it in our room? Fast forward to 4:30pm, still no phone call or update on when our room would be ready, we addressed this to the clearly not bothered reception staff who reluctantly investigated and after having to chase 3 times we finally got into our room. \nOne evening we called room service to bring up some water for the room, 1 hour later still no sign of the water so we had to call back to find it's whereabouts. Eventually, with no luck or water we went down to the bar to get it ourselves which took around 2.5 minutes.\nA couple of days into our trip one of our guests had a suitcase delivered to the hotel, she's 4 months pregnant so kindly asked at reception if someone could take it up to our room as she was heading out, which they agreed to do. 2 hours later when she returns, to the suitcase still in reception unattended so she was then forced to take it up herself. \n\nBy the end of the trip we were convinced the staff were told\/trained to be rude, dismissive, inattentive and have zero personality. We lucky if any of them managed to force a smile at us, very bizarre..","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Dream Downtown is very popular so much that I ignored the recent bad reviews. \n\nI checked in about 20 minutes early, everything seemed on the up until I got to my room. Although they are currently working on the hotel you can tell everything is very old and outdated. The carpet in the room smelled pretty bad, the mirrors were dirty, and the bed was very uncomfortable. \n\nNow to the biggest problem the service, I understand this was a holiday however there was no communication between the staff. Upon check in I was given two free drink cards for the on site restaurant MEGU, when we went to redeem the cards we found out the restaurant was in fact closed. After confirming with the front desk, we were told oh we are so sorry they don't expire you can always come back. (Terrible)\n\nThe only great experience was at the Bodega restaurant where the service was great and food was good. I will review this separately but wanted to mention that. \n\nLastly, the rooftop loung PHD, terrible terrible staff. As a hotel guest I was shocked by the treatment we recited trying to get up there. The woman at the guest was very rude, she pointed us to the door man who was also rude. When I asked for her name, I was told by the door man that he didn't know. (Yeah, like I was born yesterday). I totally understand the crowd they are trying to attract however you should really consider treating everyone with respect because you never know who you are dealing with.\n\nI do not recommend this hotel to anyone, and as a New York native I really hope that visitors spend their money somewhere where their money is appreciated and truly enjoy the big apple.

Having heard horror stories, paranoid me wasn't sure if things were getting done... but by the end of the second day, I was at ease and felt that I could trust the staff to take care of me and my oddball requests. One staff even suggested he called me after the deed was done, just so I don't need to worry. Another put down the work she was doing so she could help me right away, saying \"I know this is important to you\".\n\nThe cherry on top was the kind soul at the door who stood in a downpour for about 20 minutes trying to flag me a cab. He was not only courteous throughout but ushered me into the cab so quickly so I wouldn't get too rained on without even giving me a chance to tip him. When I checked out, the same person automatically helped all my luggage into the cab while I was on the phone.\n\nLet's be clear, this isn't a stuffy business hotel, it's a buzzy boutique-y hotel. There are clubs in the building and there are lots of partygoers strutting their stuff in the lobby. If, like me, you're going to go downstairs for any reason in shorts and a tshirt, unmakeup-ed, and feel that you should've coiffed up and put on a pair of heels, that's something you'll need to bear with. Once I was back on my floor, I couldn't hear a peep from the music downstairs.\n\nAll in all, I've travelled a lot, stayed in a lot of hotels, and encountered lots of hotel staff. The team at the Dream hotel is unquestionably some of the most friendly, competent, and considerate people I've come across in a while.

Unfortunately the stay I was hoping for did not happen... You will be greeted by rude, pretentious receptionist staff that don't seem to understand the cost of a nights stay in the hotel, if they did - their attitude would be different! Oh also, early check in is $75 so don't bother going before 3pm. \n\nYou will be told you have EXCLUSIVE access to all of the hotels facilities - You don't.. If there's a private event (there was private events all weekend) you DO NOT have access. Reception advised  'you can try to queue up and get a stamp with non guests but entry is not guaranteed', obviously this made us feel super special (NOT).... Plus point - you can get up there once the event has finished which was post 3am on the Saturday - Big woop!\n\nI complained via email directly to the hotel as I didn't want to deal with reception and they were understanding and apologetic, they also offered to send a bottle of Prosecco to the room for the inconvenience. After a day out, we returned to the room, no Prosecco. I then emailed to chase and waited nearly an hour (with an added prompt of a phone call) for the Prosecco to arrive. \n\nThe rooms are average at best and I paid an upgrade fee of $50 for a queen room with balcony, the noise from the road outside is insane (especially on a Saturday night) and the drinks at the hotel bar are way too expensive! I can accept all of the above but rude staff and not being able to have FULL access to the hotel facilities when paying so much money is un-acceptable. \n\nMy stay in the Dream for 2 nights was $764 including tax.. When I return, I will be staying in one of the nicer hotels in the area and probably pay less. \n\nThe location and the gentleman that arranged us a cab for the journey home on the other hand are great!\n\nBuh bye.

My work put me up here since it's very close to the office.  First, I wonder why they call it Dream Downtown? It should be called Dream Chelsea since it's in Chelsea and not Downtown.\nAnyway, check-in was easy. The staff are friendly.  The lobby area is very trendy.\nThe location is perfect! The ACE Subway line is close, and Chelsea Market is literally right around the corner!\nFiguring out how to use my room key to activate the elevator was a challenge. I noticed others had the same issue as I was, so I didn't feel too bad about that. \nRegarding my room, the room was clean, and so was the bathroom.  I liked the stainless steel sink, and the tiled shower with the large shower head that feels like it's raining was terrific. The large porthole windows are a great touch, but  that was where it stopped for me.\n1. The bed is literally on a platform, and you're sleeping 8 inches off the floor! There is no box spring, just the mattress on a wooden plank, that's it. I felt like I was sleeping on a friend's mattress in his living room!  I had to sit on the desk chair to get dressed and put on my shoes!  Maybe that's the new trend, but it wasn't my cup of tea to say the least.\n2. The shower curtain would not close all the way on both sides, especially with the heavy chain mail that was on it.\n3. I could not figure out the light switch buttons which controlled the dimmers to the room.  First of all, when the buttons were not literally FALLING OFF THE WALL, I could not figure out how to turn the lights off or back on in my own room! Once I did figure it out, I somehow activated the Do Not Disturb light outside my room. When I left for work the next morning and came back to my room that evening, of course my room was not made up!  Had there been labels or even basic instructions on how to use these buttons, that would have helped. And the fact that these buttons were literally falling out of the wall didn't help much either.\n4. Internet access was spotty at best. It kept dropping, so I gave up on that.\nBy the way on all 4 points, I had coworkers who were staying here as well, and they had the same issues with their rooms as I did. So I wasn't a lone case on this.\n\nAnyway, when I checked out, I spoke to Bridget at the front desk.  She was very nice, and I told her all of my concerns.  She wrote them all down and asked Engineering to look at the buttons that were falling out of the wall.\n\nIf it were not for Bridget's attentiveness and customer service, I probably would not go back.  I do like that it's close to the office and Chelsea Market, but the mattress being literally on the floor still bothers me the most! I'm still on the fence about returning because of this.  Granted, I was only there 2 nights, so it was bearable. But I probably would not stay there for longer than that.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":2173604,"title":"STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-04-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"There is something about new hotels being erected everywhere where the sole aim is to become the next hip and happening hotel to be. The focus is placed on stylish architecture, modern & contemporary artwork, and rooms that create a sense of \"wicked cool\". Some hotels have been successful in achieving this sense of art nouveau and you find yourself saying, \"this is so worth it\". Sadly Dream Hotel is not one of them. \n\nLobby- Check-in\nUpon arriving at the hotel at 1am to check in, we were greeted by a barrage of thumping music and partying right in the actual lobby. The bar area downstairs is part of an open plan concept and you are literally having to shout to get heard by the Front Desk attendant, who I have to say was not impressed by the loud partying going on. Regardless of it being 1am I asked her if this was a regular occurrence to which she replied most disappointedly \"yes\". And I can concur that on the second night, after returning from dinner and drinks we arrived back at the hotel at midnight to find the crowds gathering for yet another party night for both the upstairs bar and the lobby bar which was slowly turning into a night club. \n\nThe Room:\nOur room was located on the third floor of the South Tower. It was a very nice room and the nautical windows are terrific. The stylish sense of decor really gives the room a different feel, and you do feel like you have stepped into the guest room of a NYC celebrity or banker; stylish, chic, and cool. But that is where it ends. The bathroom door does not have have a knob, instead it has a baseball size hole as a handle and while I love my husband, the fact that he can see me sitting doing my business as he walks by just makes it lose that sense of privacy we all love in the bathroom. (not recommended if you are going away with someone you are first dating). There is hardly any shelving or cupboard space and so you find yourself having to find a way to make it work with all your toiletries.  Cupboard space is also lacking in the bedroom wardrobe so be warned if you are having to hang suits and shirts or dresses. You only get half a shelf each and two small drawers. There are also no coffee\/tea making facilities in the room so be prepared to go grab a coffee at the nearest Starbucks if you are like me and like a shot of caffeine before facing the world. \n\nFinally, I am sad to say that the walls are thin and so we found ourselves woken up constantly during the night because of the partying guests who would be making their way to their bedrooms next door. Worse still are the nautical windows which do nothing to prevent the loud sounds of constant honking cars and shouting party goers. Had the hotel invested in triple glazed nautical windows then that would definitely have created a sense of silence and going off into dreamland. Instead we woke up more tired and less rested because of all the broken sleep.\n\nThe Gym:\nThis room, you would hope, should contain modern equipment, which the cross trainer and thread-mills are. However one treadmill was out of service. The weights machines are stiff and non-functional so you find yourself having to use the free weights which is great apart from the fact that the only bench there is broken. \n\nSadly this hotel really has gone for style over substance, I can say that the staff are friendly and helpful and overall I would classify the service as good.

The room was clean and the shower was perfect.\n\nWhen I stay at hotels I always go for their breakfast packages so I did the same when I booked my stay at Dream. When we were given the vouchers at check in we were told where to go to redeem them in the morning and we were under the impression that we had paid for everything at that point. In the morning when we went to the cafe we presented the vouchers to the man who greeted us at the door and we asked if we could use our vouchers there before ordering anything. He told us that the vouchers would cover our meal and handed us a menu. My friend had pancakes, eggs, and bacon and I had a waffle, eggs and sausages. We left gratuity on the table. We were shocked to learn at the door and then again at check out that the vouchers only covered part of our meal and that we owed an additional $50+. I really appreciate Elizabeth and Jane for hearing out the situation and waiving the additional cost. It was an honest mistake.

Everything about this is horrible. For example, the curtains don't stay in place or don't fully close. They are placed so far from the window that the gap essentially allows the sun to rise inside your room. They only have two wine glasses in the room, and you can't fill them with tap water because the stems are too high. There is no body lotion among the toiletries. The mattress feels like it's been bought second hand after a good 10 year run in some suburban basement. Pretty much nothing has been thought of. No outlets by the bed so you can't charge your fun. The most unfriendly and pretentious check in personnel; one felt personally disturbed during check in because she felt I interrupted her class work--she was reading an intro chapter on government studies. No smiles, no friendly attitude, don't even look you in the eye. I'd just say never again here unless they put a gun to your head.

The hotel has a great summer scene with their pool deck & next level delicious frozen cocktails. \n\nWith 12 guests flying in from all over the country and abroad, when it came time to book my bachelorette party, The Dream Downtown seemed like the obvious choice. From start to finish, my friends and I received the best and most gracious hospitality I have ever experienced. Everyone from the doormen, front desk staff, cleaning staff, & PHD staff were amazing. \n\nWe were helped at check in by Tenzin, the hotels front office manager. He spent significant time rearranging our rooms for us so we could be on the same floor in close proximity. He emailed me through out our stay making sure we were having a great time, he even gave his personal contact information on his days off so I could reach out should I have any questions. To top it ALL off, he sent a bottle of champagne to our room to congratulate me. Hands down the best hotel management I have ever seen. \n\nAside from the incredible staff, the hotels convenience is also unparalleled. The hotel itself is home to incredible night life and dining, and in close proximity to many of New York\u2019s best (in my opinion) attractions. It was 14 degrees almost everyday of our trip, and we managed to never leave a 3 block radius and still have the BEST time. \n\nWe spent ended up spending two nights at PhD it was so fun. The hotel generously allows complimentary entry to guests before 930pm. The views are some of the best manhattan has to offer. If nightclubs aren\u2019t your scene, even the lobby bar is incredible (and Wednesday nights DJ has the best moves in the game). \n\nWe were in New York for a party, but I would recommend the Dream to absolutely anyone. Our rooms were SO quiet and comfortable, we didn\u2019t hear city noise or our neighbors once. \n\nAs a former resident of NYC my biggest regret now is not spending more time at the dream! I still visit the city around 5-6 times a year and the dream downtown is my new go to hotel. \n\nThank you, thank you, thank you, Tenzin & the rest of the staff at Dream Downtown... you made my bachelorette party SO special for my guests and I. \n\nSincerely,\nYour new biggest fan \nLizzy Thongpaithoon\n\n","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It was around 11PM, so I guess she was no longer expected to be hospitable.  I've seen a better service attitude at a Del Taco in Lubbock, TX than I experienced at the Dream.  \n\nI should have taken that as a warning to find another hotel right away, because the constant drum beat from the club upstairs reverberates through the paper thin walls of this hotel. I was in room 820 - supposedly the \"quiet section\", but every night of my stay I was awoken around midnight or later by the incessant thudding from the music.  Sleeping at the foot of the bed made it almost tolerable, as my head wasn't right up against the echoing wall.  And it just doesn't stop until sometime around 3-4AM.\n\nBizarrely, they've chosen to position glowing light switches right at the head of the bed, along with a phone with a large blue-backlit screen.  Those merely serve to exacerbate any attempts to sleep during the constant pounding of the music.\nI could also hear every conversation in the room next to me as well, even when sitting across the room from the shared wall.\n\nAnd forget trying to watch TV, unless you either want to watch the same station the whole time, or you're OK with standing directly in front of the screen.  That's the only place where the remote control worked, other than the on\/off and volume buttons.\n\nTo make things worse, there was no hot water the first morning of my stay, which -- after a mere 2-3 hours of sleep -- was the icing on the cake.\n\nAfter letting the manager know of my experience, my incredible compensation for my troubles was a free breakfast coupon.... at the hotel.

Anyone who knows me knows that Dream is like a second home and love to share my experiences there. I highly recommend staying in the summer in one the pool rooms to take full advantage of the amenities \u2013 there is no other place in the city to lounge poolside with your room just steps away where you can be laying in the most comfortable bed, have your door open and still enjoy the DJ and vibes.  Having your own area to be comfortable is also a plus. But don\u2019t get me wrong, winter stays are also just great but more relaxing! (Fun Fact \u2013 the pool is heated in the winter but do you dare go out there in the cold?)

Also at weekends kids aren't allowed in the pool after midday as it's more of a drinking place...The 'beach' isn't really that brilliant - a patch of sand at one end. What was most irritating was nowhere to breakfast - despite nice tables by the pool which isn't open til 11...all the staff standing round drinking Starbucks from a few blocks away was a clue about where you had to go if you didn't fancy the mexican restaurant downstairs streetside - missing a trick I thought.....

We had a very warm welcome but when I asked if I could have some champagne glasses and some ice in my room it took 4 hours. For the price you pay for this hotel I would expect exceptional service. The lobby is very beautiful and the servers are nice. The room was small with double beds. Somet things with the bathroom were a little annoying. The dimmers wouldn't go down just completely shut off or stay on high which made it very hard to sleep as the bathroom isn't enclose with walls but glass. Also, there was a huge chunk of cement broken on the floor by the wall. I thought this to be odd, also one of the light fixtures in between the beds was missing. One would expect the room to be top notch. I'm a New Yorker so I really have no need to stay in hotels here in the city but when I do and I pay good money for one I think we deserve the best. \n\nAs far as the night life this hotel is the happening place...So many young people come in to go to the bars and lounges and the rooftop bar. It was a little disappointing at how rude the hostess was for the rooftop lounge. She was very standoffish and didn't have any type of personality and was very snooty. That irritated me to no end. Since 3 of us were staying with us we were only allowed to bring 2 people up per one person. We were a group of 6 and if we all wanted to go up we were asked to pay $200 !!!! Really? This absolutely ridiculous. Honestly I wasn't impressed by this place. I'd much rather go to Vandal and pay $200 for a table than to fork over $200 to a smug hostess who thinks she's the President of the hotel chain. \n\nThe pool was gorgeous and relaxing and the food in the restaurants were great.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The Dream Downtown is not one of those hotels.  They provide the lip service to taking care of the customer but this hotel is all about taking care of their image.\n\nIt was not a good start from the get-go.  My front desk person firstly had a computer that did not work.  He tried to pass me to another lady who was working in front of a \"Google\"  sign, but she did not acknowledge her co-workers pleas for help.  She then took it upon herself to help someone else.  It was a strange behavior that I've never experienced before.\n\nSecondly, the room, which is basically a stylized concrete box is poorly designed.  The floors are concrete (no carpeting), and they are dirty.  As a person who does not wear their shoes in the room, this is unacceptable.  They should at lease provide slippers.\n\nThirdly, to prove they are not about service, they pre-light the button that refuses housekeeping services.  I admit, I was not aware that there was even a housekeeping button, but to premark it \"no housekeeping services\" is inexcusable.\n\nFourthly, the TV did not work, I had to call for service twice (over a 8 hour period - I'm still there, it may break down before I leave!).  The tech said that the Dish network service (from cable) was awful and blamed everything on the Hotel's awful decision.  I don't care, I just want a TV to work.  A Motel6 can manage that, why can't the Dream?\n\nAlso, it took over an hour for the tech to come the second time with multiple calls on my end.  Again, this is a hotel that cares about promoting their pool, their rooftop patio, their restaurant.  Nowhere do they promote their service, which is, I guess, truth in advertising.\n\nFinally, the room, in it's attempt to be cool, is overly complicated.  It took me some time to figure out the lighting system (how about on\/off).  The toilet system has a massive flush button that is hard to reach.  Even the cool shower, has a weak flow system.  What's the point of such a massive shower where the showerhead only covers the front 1\/3rd the room?\n\nFor a business traveler, this place is not worth it.   As a casual traveler, I guess I am just not tool, or tech savvy enough (I'm sure in their words).  \n\nAs a tech user who  works for one of the most advanced companies in the world.  I say that the experience in and of itself is needlessly complex, does not work and the service is not the point of this hotel.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The bathroom is on the bigger side but the sink reminds me of a cafeteria sink with it\u2019s cheap steel\/plastic. The rooms also have thin walls; I could hear people next door to me, as well as people walking down the hall as if they were standing next to me.\n\nService: Check in was fine, but on the last night of my stay (Tuesday night), there was a rager of a party on their rooftop club so I couldn't' sleep (mind you, this was at 2 am). Being on the 8th floor - I could hear their 12th floor's DJ playing loud bass so I requested ear plugs from the front desk. It took them an HOUR to get me my ear plugs. I called 3 times (every 20 mins) to check up on it until I almost gave up and downloaded a white noise app to drone out the awful club music. \n\nDon't waste your time here... it has failed miserably trying real hard to be a W hotel.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"NONE"}

There's so much right with this place but disappointingly so much wrong. So my not so perfect view of this place started before we'd even arrived, we were a group of seven girls staying for two of the girls 40th birthdays, I emailed ahead of time to ask if we could be placed on the same floor as one of the girls had a solo room and if I could arrange anything to make the birthday girls stay more special. I got a reply saying they'd do their best and asked if I'd like to speak to concierge to see if there was anything further I could arrange with them, I said yes and was looped in on an email, I replied twice but no one ever got back to me, I was slightly miffed as I'd never really been ignored by the concierge of a hotel, especially one in the USA. \n\nAnyway, on arrival at the hotel we of course weren't placed on the same floor, which wasn't a huge issue but I would have thought they would have at least tried to put the solo female on the same floor as at least one of us. They did put a couple of bottles of prosecco in one of the birthday girls room but not the other which was a bit of a fail. We also ended up getting to the hotel quite late on a Thursday night, the hotel reception is like a nightclub so trying to hear the attendant was pretty hard!\n\nThe rooms are nice, we all had very differently laid out ones and ours was slightly bigger as it was an accessible room.  The beds are very small, there's no proper wardrobe, not enough hangers, only one robe and no tea or coffee making facilities. All of this I probably could have lived with but what made me slightly cross was the attitude of the staff, they treat you like you should be grateful that your staying there and not like you've just paid out an awful lot of your hard earned cash. I've stayed in NYC too many times to mention in various levels of hotels and while the rooms are always small the service I've had from every other hotel apart from this one has been exemplary, it's such a shame as with only a few tweaks it could be so good. One thing I'd never experienced before in NYC was the use of a pool which was so nice, especially as it was so hot, will definitely be seeking out a hotel with a pool for my next trip, unfortunately it won't be this one.  \n\nOh, and if you're looking for a more reasonable breakfast than the one served in the hotel, try the Grey Dog on 16th just 5 mins walk from the hotel, excellent food and good old American service!","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

And, the odor lingered....thank god there was a small porthole type window that I was able to partially open to air out the offensive odor. The bathroom was nothing to rave about and the hole for the doorknob wasn't really hip...it just was another cheap feature.  The restaurants were ok...expensive, but ok. My guests and I went to the PHd lounge to have a drink before dinner. I don't think that I would return there.  The views are fabulous but the bartenders and waiters were inattentive and unfriendly. We were seated and handed drink menus. The waiter never came back despite the place being not very busy....it was early...515 pm.  So, my son said, \" Lets get out of this pretentious place and go elsewhere.\" So, that is what we did and we went to Megu. The cocktails were good and the waitstaff was MUCH more professional and friendly.

I was travelling with my family, kids are 11 and 15.\n\n1. On check-in, I was instantly asked to accept the pool policy which doesn't allow kids in the pool after midday.  When I asked why \"It is to protect them, as there are adults drinking alcohol by the pool\"??  You can imagine how my children took this news!! But, I couldn't check in without agreeing to the policy (it was 3.00 p.m. we were baking hot and looking forward to a dip in the pool)  Couldn't remember reading this on the website, it's hidden in Hotel Policies.  Who reads that before booking?\n\n2. Family room was small - would have been suitable for 1 double bed, not 2.  Bit disappointed, oh well, we're in New York!  View out the window was amazing.\n\n3. First night - woken up by bassline vibrating through my pillow at 1.30 a.m.  I text the main desk (this seems to be they're preferred communication method - I suppose they don't have to deal with you face or face.)  \nFirst reply - we don't know what that could be, our rooftop bar closed at midnight.  Our room was on the 4th floor.  \nMe \"It's still going\"  \n2nd reply - we'll send security to see where it's coming from.  \nMe \"I don't know where but it's vibrating through my pillow and my husband and I can't sleep\" \n3rd reply - Security can't hear anything \nMe \"Come to my room and listen!\"\n4th reply - It could be the club in the basement (do you think??), would you like to move rooms?\nMe \"No, it's 2.30 a.m. and I have two children with me!\"\n5th reply - We've asked them to turn it down (They didn't)\nMe \"What time does this go on to?\"\n6th reply - 3.30 a.m. We can move you tomorrow?\nI was so infuriated it took me till 4.00 a.m. to go to sleep anyway.\n\n4. Next day - moved to room, five rooms further along the same corridor. Same, small size (but view was better).  Apologetic but not even a drink to say sorry.\n3.30 a.m. Our new neighbours return to their rooms to continue the party for another hour.  The walls are so thin I can hear each swear word! My children can't be exposed to people drinking alcohol, but this is OK apparently.\nDidn't even bother to complain, they'll only move us again and we're only here for one more night, I can't face packing\/unpacking again!\n\n5. Kids use the pool (in the morning!) There are lots of beautiful people, by the beautiful pool, taking selfies.  The pool policy has more to do with beautiful people not wanting to be splashed by pesky children having fun in my cynical opinion. When I questioned the pool policy again, they said it 'should' be OK for the children to use it after 12 during the week when it's 'quieter' -  quieter, not at night!\n\n6. Check out, I make a point of doing this in person, so I can answer the \"We hope you enjoyed your stay\" remark.  She apologised before saying anything and said the Duty Manager (who had made no contact with us during our stay and our complaining) would allow us to upgrade next time we visited a Dream Hotel - I declined the offer as we won't be staying there again.\n\nThis was our once in a lifetime trip to NYC with the kids, saving for 6 months to stay in a 5 star hotel!

I chose to stay there becaue I had a HUGE presentation in New York and I wanted to find a hotel I could work from, enjoy being on whilst also being in an interesting neighbourhood I could stroll through whenever I needd a work break.  \nSo I arrived at Dream.  When my eyes got used to the dark interior, I quickly realised how beautifully appointed the whole place is.  The structural engineer is a genius... that swimming pool ceiling is just impressive and marvellous.  (The ceiling of the lower lobby \/ bar is  the rooftop swimming pool floor).   But  quickly you realise that their key clientele are the non-stop rush of corporate events that hire and use the lobby and the rooftop to host private parties and so on.  Where does that leave YOU the guest whose paid gazillions to be there?  Kicked to the curb, I found. \n\nBut its not even the fact that the space I thought I had paid to enjoy with other guests was always overlfowing with private events confining me to my room, or forcing me to eat out,  its the sad sad thing that happened the day I realised I'd need to order room service - I was working on a presentation, and would have preferred to eat in the downstairs bar but there was a huge corporate function going on.  I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO YOU THE MEAL THAT I GOT.  This huge, dry lump of \"steak\"  really tough - accompanied by a pile (literally) of cold, dry  fries.  ALl this appeared to have been dumped onto the plate.  Veggies?  Oh... no!  Ofcourse not!!!  Why not eat in the main downstairs restaurant?   Its Mexican!  People, not everyone likes Mexican food!!! Having said that, the room service waitress was great  - bubbly, friendly, prompt etc but OMG I could not eat what she delivered.... and it ended up being the MOST EXPENSIVE and most awful meal I ate in my 6 week stay in the States. THANK GOD for Chelsea market across the road. Actually even the kebab guy on the corner had better food. \nSomething else.  In my five night stay, I they had fire sirens waking up the whole hotel on THREE OF THE FIVE NIGHTS. IMagine being in a deep sleep with terrible jetlag only to have repeated fire alarms wake you up on the night. Awful.\nI chose a \"balcony\" room not knowing that huge droves of people come here to party on the rooftop each night and ... yes, you can kinda hear hem arriving and leaving.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":2173604,"title":"Experience does not live up to price.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-08-14","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"My friend and I stayed a night at Dream this past weekend and I feel compelled to write a review. We found this place via social media and online articles raving about the restaurants and bars, not to mention the hotel looked gorgeous from the images online.\n\nWe were greeted as most hotel guests usually are, very welcoming and accommodating, even making reservation for us at the Mexican restaurant there. Our room was far smaller than the images make it seem online. No fridge, only one robe, no ice bucket, no coffee machine, etc. But that was ok, the room, despite being tiny, was nice, looked clean and the bed felt comfortable.\n\nWe quickly discovered there are no ice machines available on any floor and after 4 phone calls to the concierge, house keeping and two to the front desk, we were finally able to acquire some ice more than an hour after our first call which was very frustrating as ice machines and a simple vending machine are typically available for guests at most hotels but perhaps the more money you spend and the \u201cswankier\u201d the hotel, the less accommodations you receive. Funny how that works.\n\nAfter spending some time in the city we arrived back to our hotel around 7 to get ready for dinner only to find that the lobby was flooded with drunk people. On our way to the elevators we saw an inebriated girl being carried out and a man being escorted out while fighting with a bouncer. This was definitely a surprise and yet another turn off. Let me just add that we are both girls in our twenties and we were there to go out an enjoy the nightlife our hotel had to offer too, we aren\u2019t a family with young children, so I think the fact that already we were turned off by the atmosphere in the lobby alone says something.\n\nWhen we arrived on time to Bodega Negra we were told our table wasn't ready yet and to wait at the bar. More than a half hour later after standing around my friend went back up to the hostess to check in and then only a few minutes later were finally seated, which makes me think we were forgotten about. This place was also incredibly rowdy and full of loud drunk people too. It was only 9:30. Our food was delicious but it took forever to come out and because of the blaring DJ music our interactions with our waiter weren't the best either. We also ordered two of the same drinks only to have them arrive to our table looking like someone took several big swings out of one of the glasses... almost half empty for a $16 cocktail.\n\nAfter finishing our meal we wanted to head to PHD, the rooftop bar we read raves about. We saw the separate elevator to the club had a line so we went up and waited, when we reached the front we were told by the bouncer we had to go back out to the front door of the lobby, wait in line there and get our hand stamped, come back, wait in this line and eventually get up to the bar. This was really disappointing as we thought being guests of the hotel we might be able to forego the line of everyone coming off the street but no, not the case and when my friend asked the front desk about any special accommodations guests may receive they told her, \"they (Dream) are not responsible for the club after 9:30 and it\u2019s technically a separate entity\u201d which is ridiculous, if you read about the club on Dream\u2019s website it says exactly, \"our haute rooftop nightclub and lounge bar\u201d seemingly claiming ownership of the club.\n\nThe rest of the experience to get into the club was incredibly unpleasant, we were treated with disrespect at every turn from all of the bouncers and staff of the club. The bar tenders were rude and could not even provide a gin suggestion my friend when she asked for one. I suppose they figured we were just like all of the other incredibly drunk people we were surrounded by the entire time acting like animals. Aside from the cool view of the sky line there were no redeeming qualities of this place. We were happy to leave and have a few drinks in our room.\n\nI'd say after spending a night here we would  not choose to stay again. There\u2019s definitely an air of elitism everywhere, which forgive me but, I think is just a common attitude of most people in NYC and this just confirmed it.\n\nHowever,  earlier in the evening we stopped at the Conrad hotel to check out their rooftop bar- The Loopy Doopy and had an awesome experience there. The bar tenders were very friendly as well as the wait staff. One woman was even kind enough to come grab us from the bar and offer a spot to sit on the couches which was mostly sectioned off for reservations. We would absolutely consider staying here next time.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I went for my bachelorette weekend and it was so much fun. We had a room with a balcony, which overlooked the streets of NYC and we were even able to watch a gorgeous sunset!  Pool party all day (make sure you arrive early in order to get a chair) otherwise you will need to wait - it's on a first come basis, unless you pay to reserve one. We woke up really early the next day and got a char. Food was delicious - try the watermelon & feta salad - drinks were refreshing. Clubs at night - rooftop club which has pretty skyline views of NYC. The club downstairs was more hip - hop with black lights, also very fun! The next day I wanted to make sure I was able to bring back my balloons as we needed to do an early check out BUT still wanted to hang by the pool. Mallory Matoush who is the guest service manager onsite was AWESOME! She made sure we were able to put them in a secure spot until we were ready to leave for the day.

Nervous that whatever we planned wouldn't match a 5 day kid free getaway as originally planned, we went into our NYC trip with some reservation. \n\nAll that worry for nothing because from the moment we walked into the Dream we were blown away.  The bellhop staff were very friendly and helpful finding us an inexpensive parking option. The front desk accommodated our early check-in request. We received a great corner room with a balcony - very clean!\n\nWe went straight to the pool and had a deliciously lunch. Prices were amazing and so was the food. Unique and fun drinks - We shared a pineapple tap - incredible drink for two (approximately 2.5 drinks each) served in a hollowed pineapple. The pool has a very fun, chill vibe during the weekday and the pool staff (lifeguards and waitstaff were wonderful and friendly). \n\nWe requested hypo-allergenic bedding and when we returned to our room, the housekeeping staff immediately converted our bed. \n\nWe enjoyed a cocktail on the rooftop bar. Beautiful and great views. \n\nWe spent day two at the pool and we had such a great time. They even granted our request for late check-out so that we could continue enjoying our day at the pool. \n\nThe manager, Mr. Basnet, was incredibly ingratiating and we had a fun conversation with Fernando, one of the bellhops. \n\nWe cannot wait to visit again (is next week too soon?!). \n\nPerfect visit from start to finish!  Well done Dream. It's obvious that the staff is treated well at this location as they were all nothing but smiles and friendly attitudes. ","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My company, and most people in our space, stayed at the Dream since it's in an ideal location. It's right across from the Chelsea Market, where you can get quick tasty bites. There are also some nicer restaurants in walking distance like Buddakan or Salinas. The hotel itself is very modern, full of young people. There's a pool that everyone utilizes. They even have a cool rooftop bar\/club, PhD, with a great view. I spent the first two nights there, and met a variety of people who were surprisingly nice. \n\nThe staff were all very accommodating, especially Tenzin. I checked in but my name wasn't on the room that my company booked, uh oh. I was tired from my flight and I was getting slightly agitated (although it was our fault) that I couldn't check in and nap. Tenzin trusted me, promised I wouldn't be on the streets haha, and added me to the room. I was very appreciative! \n\nThe same night around 5am, there was a domestic dispute next door. I couldn't sleep for an 1hr+ because these people were banging on the door. That morning the front desk called and apologized although it wasn't their fault, and offered me some breakfast vouchers and gave me a later check out. \n\nThroughout my stay at the hotel, I was constantly hanging out in the lobby or coming back at 4\/5am. Tenzin was usually there so he recognized me. His friendly demeanor made me feel comfortable chatting with him every night. I felt very welcome there so I'll definitely be back, along with the rest of the team!","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Everything was right there from fun pool parties, great restaurants to night clubs upstairs and downstairs. We were having so much fun we didn't even realize we had pulled an all nighter lol .  We did run into one little issue which was I had about 40 balloons I used to decorate the bride to be's room and no where to hold them while we enjoyed the pool one more day. Mallory M., the manager at guest services came to the rescue and assured us they could be held in the storage room. She was a life saver. Although many of the staff members were very pleasant Mallory stood out since she was the problem solver. After we enjoyed another full day at Dream we went home with smiles, memories and our 40 balloons in the car lol. Anything is possible in NYC and Dream was the perfect place to go for a fun weekend away. The property itself is close to other restaurants and nightclubs as well if we wanted to get out and see more of the city. We will for sure be back again and without a doubt make more amazing memories. Thank you Dream for allowing me to give my bff bride to be the best weekend as her MOH :)","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The main selling point for the hotel was the cool party vibes of the hotel overall. The lobby bar is great, with a very happening crowd and bumping music. PHD, which is a rooftop lounge\/club was great but somewhat of a pain to get in even as a hotel guest, the entrance guy asked for $300 minimum tab for a couple, despite my fianc\u00e9e not drinking at all... The pool is very nice but quite small (giant by NY standards I guess) and with very limited beds. If you want a bed, go before 10am either on Saturday or Sunday. On Sunday they sell the beds to non hotel people so you might have to wait till 11am to get a bed.\n\nThe staff was very nice but the Manager I gave feedback to regarding their shenanigans with the pool beds (they basically said all beds were reserved and paid for, $150 per bed, and if someone doesn't show up, then and only then even as a hotel guest would you get a bed) was close minded and not helpful at all. I explained that one of the main perks of the hotel was the pool, and not being able to get a bed on Sunday at 10am is a terrible policy. I get how capitalism works and I am a huge proponent of it, but there has to be some regard given to hotel guests...\n\nThe rooms are cool looking, very modern and trendy but tiny as pretty much all other hotels in NY.\n\nWould recommend for a party weekend.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

You can never count on what extra amenities will be in the room or how the front desk staff will handle your account. \n\nI understand this hotel chain doesn't have a reward program. However, they've got to figure out a way to record repeat business. If I notify them in advance that I'm coming, I almost always have free breakfast coupons and the highest speed internet. If I don't, it's like I've never stayed there before. I didn't have time to deal with them separately for this trip and they didn't even know I was a repeat visitor. They asked me if this was my first time. No...its about my 16th time here....under the same name. No apologies and no adjustment was made. So, no free breakfast or highest speed internet.
