The lobby is nice and the room was nicer than your standard Hilton or Marriott hotel, but there was nothing that made the cost of everything worthwhile.  The elevators are a complete joke.  They only have three for the whole hotel and one was not working the whole time.  We had to take the stairs multiple times after waiting 30 minutes for an elevator.  I know NYC is expensive, but what they charge for food should be illegal.  A standard breakfast is a minimum of $30.  A glass of orange juice is $17.  There is no way breakfast for 3 people should easily break the $100 mark.\nI would never spend the insane amount of money to stay there again considering there are a thousand hotels to choose from in the city that are very nice and much less expensive.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When stepping inside the Plaza, you really do feel as if you are entering a luxurious palace.\n\nIn addition to its stunning architecture, both my wife and I were quite impressed with the beauty and elegance of our hotel room. Our room was quite spacious and contained a very comfortable king size bed, gorgeous wooden wainscoting and furniture and a highly decorative chandelier. Our bathroom was also spacious, very well polished and outfitted with alluring floral mosaic tiles.\n\nWe found the hotel service to be first class and very accommodating.

He addressed all of our inquiries and helped make sure that our luggage was brought safely to our room, provided us with an additional refrigerator to store our food, and even offered us complimentary water bottles when we were leaving the hotel. We thank Patrick for his great service and for making us feel right at home.\n\nLast, but not certainly least, my wife and I also very much enjoyed our breakfast and service at the hotel\u2019s renowned restaurant, \u201cThe Palm Court.\u201d Located in the center of the ground floor, the Palm Court comes with numerous sight pleasing features ranging from its palm trees, its central marble and brass bar, its sculpted female figures and its exquisite stained glass ceiling.

Even from making the reservation and fighting to get someone on the phone to book the home alone package. This place is very special to us as we got married here. We had been so excited to take our kids here even though we live in NYC. We booked the home alone package as our kids live the movie. We called the concierge to ask for special amenities to be in the room on arrival. He told us that the in room dining department would call us as they handle this. They never called despite many calls and emails by us. We had arranged for the ice cream sundae from the movie which was part of the package to be in the room upon check in. When we checked in they told us they cancelled the order because they didn't know when the room would be ready. One of our rooms wasn't ready until 5pm on a one night stay. When the sundae did finally come it was wrong and had to be remade. We never received any amenities at all. Then ono ur check out day it took 35 minutes for the bellman to come and 20 minutes to wait for the elevator. When we finally got to the breakfast we were told it was closed. The manager of the palm court was not nice at all. The entire experience was lackluster. No one at all enjoys their job or has any pride at all. The property is coasting. It was upsetting to see.

Everything was a complete disappointment, from the lack of good and knowledgeable staff to an uncaring attitude. Let me just start at the beginning. Upon check in I asked if there was an ATM in the hotel and we were told YES there was, but it was located in the spa which was closed. Since I was going to the spa in the morning, I was content to wait. Upon my arrival in the spa, no ATM. An encounter with a bellman in the elevator confirmed there was no ATM in the hotel. That same morning my Fianc\u00e9 went to the front desk to request a newspaper and was told there were not any and they must be requested in advance. Understandable so he did just that for the following morning. The next morning we leave for a quick walk to grab a coffee, no newspaper. Stop at the front desk to inquire, and we are told his request from the day before was not properly entered into the system. I was not pleased and chose to walk away and return to the room to get ready for the day. Now let me start on the room. Our hot water was almost non existent in the bathtub, bathroom sink and shower. The climate control in the room did not work and it was like a sauna in there. The bed and pillows were hard as rocks and quite frankly the most uncomfortable we have ever slept in at a 5 star hotel. It has been 7 years since I had the pleasure to stay at the Plaza and I can tell you it is no the same. I have never stayed anywhere else in the city and I will never return after this stay. There are way too many options in this amazing city to spend a fortune on bad service, rooms that have zero comfort and offer much to be desired. My only compliment goes to Maria at the spa, who gave me one of the best massages I have ever had.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Nothing. \nI've stayed in suites before that offer butlers. They normally greet you and check in on a regular basis if there's anything needed. I even feel awkward and decline when they kindly offer to pack or unpack for you. \nWe didn't even see the butler that was advertised and at $1250 a night I expected more if I'm honest. \nThe room was a good size. Quiet but zero view. It also was a bit sparse. \n\nThe whole experience left me underwhelmed and one I couldn't recommend. I also would not stay there again which is sad because I got the distinct impression the hotel part of the building is dying a death. \n\nThere was a few other hotels on my list when I was choosing; most I'd stayed in overseas so knew the excellent service. We went into one that was on my shortlist for a drink and I was greeted in the way I would expect the Fairmont to - well done the Langham for setting the standard.

I brought it up on my own so we could get to dinner. The concierge was always friendly, but the rest of the staff was smug and boring.

HOWEVER, I\u2019m glad I had hotel points for this stay and did not use my own money. It would not have been worth it. The room was luxurious, and the butler\/housekeeping service was excellent, but there were a lot of things wrong with our stay. First off, we had to check in late. They didn\u2019t have our room ready on time, which was disappointing. Second, the room service (mind you for 2 people cost upwards of $120 for one meal) was served cold. It was not up to par with the food that I thought would be served. Third, when we left, I was not given my full deposit back. I was told when I called to verify that I was being charged for a meal that we did not order. All in all, it\u2019s a nice hotel that\u2019s run and treated like a Holiday Inn. It\u2019s only expensive because it\u2019s famous. Oh, and don\u2019t plan on having a lot of drinks at the bar. 2 drinks was $60!!!!!

The hotel was roped off and they were only letting a certain amount of people in. When we said we were there to visit the Eloise store for my daughter\u2019s birthday we were told to go around the side of the building, which we did. We went in and were immensely disappointed at the lack of Eloise display. What used to be a precious store with much to do is no relegated to a corner of a tiny store with a rude woman only allowing a few people in at a time. When I asked her what happened to the Eloise store she just shrugged and said \u201cCovid. At least you have this.\u201d Eloise is a staple of the Plaza and was such a fun experience. I understand Covid hit the hospitality industry hard, but it seems taking away something that draws tourists and money is a bad business plan. Also, the food hall is closed. After being let down at the shop and food hall, we needed to use the restroom and were let into the main hotel by an employee (to the front where we were previously told we couldn\u2019t go). Not sure why the front entrance is closed but the side is open? Any way, it was disappointing to see such an icon of an establishment lose so much of the magic that made it so special.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":675616,"title":"A sour taste ","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-12-16","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"This is a review of afternoon tea at the Plaza hotel NYC. Please don\u2019t waste your money at this hotel. The whole hotel has an awful attitude problem which started on arrival at the front door being refused entry and asked to prove that I had a reservation. I first took afternoon tea at this hotel four years ago and had a pleasant experience. This time however I felt cheated and frankly robbed of my hard earned cash. My issue is with the service received. The waiter didn\u2019t explain the sandwiches or cakes, we were not approached during the meal and asked if everything was ok. There was no pleasantries or customer engagement. In top London hotels you are offered additional sandwiches and cakes and the jam and cream can be topped up if required, sadly not at the Plaza you get what you are given, no more. Taking afternoon tea is a ritual experiencing different teas and flavours with each course, sadly not at the Plaza, you are allowed one tea choice which is not replenished during the meal. The ambiance of the Palm Court has been neglected over the years, they have added a noisy bar area in the middle of the restaurant which was frequented by hotel guests and their luggage plus frequent use of profanities. The decor is tired and so are the staff who just went through the motions of welcoming their guests. Most noticeable is the attitude of the management, we knew it was going to be expensive but when we offered our opinion of our experience and sought some redress through a reduction of the service charge we were ignored and refused any offer of recognition of our concerns. London hotels know how to treat their guests, this American rabble don\u2019t have a clue about service and don\u2019t care either. Very nearly $400 for a poor experience and a nasty  exchange of views with an arrogant, unprofessional and uncompromising restaurant manager left a sour taste to what should have been an uplifting and enjoyable experience. This arrogant brutish hotel and it\u2019s staff have a lot to learn. Spend your money elsewhere. ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

On checking in we were given a lower level of room than booked, after some debate this was sorted but no city view as booked. \nRoom had several things not working due to lack of maintenance, not particularly clean (TV remote very nasty), bed squeaked if you moved, had to turn off heating\/air con as no adjustment possible so either very hot or very cold. Water said to be included but we were told to find the housekeeper to get it - why can't they put it in the room? \nNo in-room tea or coffee facilities provided but chargeable at a high cost (I think we paid c$50 for tea bags and a kettle as you are charged for replenishment) . \nNo hotel information in room (apparently because of Covid), all on TV display but navigating room service menus very difficult. Room service cost is ridiculously high ($14 delivery + service charge + tip)\nThe Oak Bar shown on in-room TV info apparently closed 6 years ago. The current Bar area is unusual in layout, very cold, not cosy, certainly not welcoming, all empty tables have reserved signs on to stop people using them. \nWe had breakfast there at an extremely high cost ($11 for a piece of toast!) \nWrong order brought, waiter had his thumb pretty much in the plate leaving a greasy thumb print, cutlery was very small, probably for desserts not main courses.   \nIn summary we did not feel welcome there, too many unfriendly staff whose starting point is one of questioning and distrust (it was hard to even get in the building, let alone have a drink at the bar).\nA great pity but they could turn it around by seeing how the staff in the Savoy or Claridge's look after their guests.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had booked the reservation over two months in advance and were eagerly anticipating this special occasion, having traveled all the way from Australia.\n\nThe food at the restaurant was delightful, but our experience took a turn for the worse when we attempted to use the restroom. A security doorman named Tizan, stationed at the door labeled \"Hotel Guests Lobby,\" subjected us to an unwarranted interrogation. Despite explaining that we had just dined at the restaurant and were directed to the hotel's restroom by the manager, Tizan accused us of attempting to use the facilities without cause.\n\nHis behavior was not only unprofessional but also discriminatory and, frankly, racist. Tizan's actions completely marred what was meant to be a memorable celebration for my mum. I find it appalling that someone in a service-oriented role would treat guests in such a disrespectful manner.\n\nThis incident has left a lasting negative impression, and I will never consider returning to the Plaza Hotel. It's disheartening to note that similar experiences have been shared by others in previous reviews, suggesting a systemic issue that needs addressing.\n\nTizan, I hope you reflect on the impact of your actions and consider how they have soured the experience for guests who come from far and wide to enjoy what should be a special and memorable visit to the Plaza Hotel.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The check in was very smooth and the property appears well kept with nice fragrance pumped right through the HVAC system. The entire place smelled nice as a result. \n\nI am a die hard fan of Fairmont hotels and have tried many of their properties over the years. Having stayed at their flagship hotel the Savoy in London and their competitor the Ritz, it pains me to say that the service here fell quite short of my expectations of a flagship property.  \n\nThe staff working there seem just \u201ctired\u201d and they do not seem to want to have any sort of genuine connection with the guests. They are just all about business there. This is very different from places like the ritz there they take the time to get to know you and engage in meaningful ways to make the stay a memorable one. \n\nOur suite includes some sort of a white glove butler service but I\u2019ve not even see the butler once during my stay.  On the day after thanksgiving, somehow our room was not serviced all day. I even called in around 3 pm to request a house keeping service and it did not happen even then. I had to go to the front desk to request it to finally have the room cleaned.  \n\nI think this hotel is great and has a lot of potential, but the staff training isn\u2019t there yet. It\u2019s also quite unique in the sense that it\u2019s in a historic building in the sea of ultra modern high rises.   However, the hotel seems to only occupy the south wing and is quite small despite looking imposing from the outside. As a result most of the rooms don\u2019t have much of a view to speak of.  If you are looking for rooms with views, you will have to pay quite a bit more for partial park views. \n\nAll in all it was a rather uneventful and also unremarkable stay. I am Diamond with Accor and used four suite night upgrades for this stay, but they were not honored at check out. I had to call in and be out on hold for quite a while to get it sorted. The front desk person wasn\u2019t even apologetic for this clerical error.  \n\nI really want to like this hotel and would love more opportunities to experience its full glory. Perhaps the weekend was just too busy.  Although For the same price I\u2019d recommend going with four season or mandarin oriental both of which have much better views and modern amenities.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":675616,"title":"disappointing, avoid at all cost!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-11-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"Booked the hotel for its iconic name and let's just say it didn't live up to its fame. To list a few: \n\n1. the staff in general were not approachable and friendly.  Most of them gave me the impression that unless I'm someone super famous\/rich, it is not worth their 'warm\/premium service'. \n2. service response were EXTREMELY slow. I asked to take away my inroom dining table, and no one came for 45min so I ended up rolling up to the hallway myself. Due to flight change, I called to see if I can extend my stay,  and no one called me back after 30min, so I had  to go to the lobby myself.  One night the inroom service told me that it would be 2 hours before the food would be delivered. \n3. they charge EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING. I was charged for a kettle and some 'tea set?' which consisted of 2 slices of dried out lemon, some milk and sugar which I didn't end up using at all. When we ask for kettle in other hotels, it is always complimentary. Similarly, I was charged $18 for them to deliver me the Uber Eats (as the inroom had 2 hours wait). So unless you are loaded and these charges are a drop in the bucket, be aware of these 'surprises'! \n4. After checkout, I was charged $14 from snack bar which I didn't use. When I questioned the bill over the phone, the front desk person told me that he would need to \"verify\" before reversing the charge. When I asked how, he said they would have photos. Then I asked how would a picture of an opened snack be a prove that it is something that I ate\/didn't eat? To which the response was 'I am not trying to argue with you. Do you understand what I am saying?'. Mind blowing. \n\nI stayed in fair amount of high-end hotels around the world, and I can safely say this is the WORST stay ever. They probably won't care a non-significant customer like me anyway, but this will be an one-off experience and I will not be coming back ever again. ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":675616,"title":"Mediocre comfort and service for top dollar price tag","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-11-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"My husband and I decided to stay there on a Thanksgiving trip to New York. We figured it was worth the cost to have a truly memorable experience.\nThe good: the staff is extremely nice and personable, in a non-fake way. The bartender at the champagne bar was humorously grumpy about having to work on thanksgiving, which made us feel like old friends, for example. In-room dining staff (especially Freddy!) were funny and pleasant conversationalists while setting up breakfast. I was at the Philly Four Seasons in February, and the staff there was so snooty and icy, I felt like I didn\u2019t belong and I should just leave them alone. But the staff here were great, without fail. Other guests were also quite pleasant.\nThe rooms are good sized with great closet space.\nThe mediocre:\nThe bathrooms are large and lovely, but the sink vanity had no space for putting toiletry bags. The counter had no extra room when I was putting on makeup or doing my hair, so I carted my toiletries back to the closet every time. There was no hook next to the sink for hanging toiletries. There was a vanity mirror, but it was not wall mounted so I had to hunch down to use it. So I didn\u2019t use it. \nThe bad:\nThe mattress. It was super hard with no cushioned topper. We could feel the tufting of the top of the mattress. I am 41, so not particularly old, and I woke up about every 2 hours with sore hips and had to roll over. It was one of the least comfortable hotel mattresses I have ever slept on, and my husband and I have a very firm mattress at home, so we\u2019re used to a mattress that doesn\u2019t give.\nThe pillows. Fluffy down pillows that collapse. Maybe I could have asked for different pillows, but you know what? There was no book in the room listing the sorts of amenities we could change or services that would be provided. I\u2019m used to nice hotels listing the options you have for things like that (different pillow options being a common one), and I don\u2019t want to guess or feel like a jerk for asking. They should tell me.\nRoom temperature. We could not get the room to be 68 degrees or lower for sleeping without having the A\/C blasting cold air. The temp was set to 72 when we arrived, which is a little warm for us even during the day. For sleeping, it\u2019s way too hot. If we set it to 68 on the mixed or heat setting, it stayed at 72 and got stuffy. We could turn it on to fan only, which helped prevent stuffiness but stayed at 72. But the only way to lower the temp was to turn on the A\/C, which blows toward the bed, so when it turned on we\u2019d get a shot of cold air blowing at us. Which woke us up. We even set the heat to 68 when we went out at noon, hoping it would be cool by the time we got back at night, but nope. Still 72. So if there was another way to get it to be cooler, we couldn\u2019t figure it out. Yes, we could have called someone to see if we were missing something, but I prefer to have things just work correctly. Especially when you\u2019re paying\u2026$1800 a night. \nThe sheets\/bedding. Thin duvet that wasn\u2019t very warm, somewhat scratchy sheets. They should have blankets or something in the closet. Again, I probably could have called housekeeping, but in my PJs at 3 am with AC blowing on me, I just want a blanked to use until the AC shuts off. \nAttention to detail by staff. Housekeeping was very nice, but several things were missing when we checked in. I had a bath on thanksgiving morning, and I didn\u2019t realize that the jar above the tub was supposed to have bath oil\/bath salts. I thought it was a decorative empty jar. So I didn\u2019t have that. It was refilled the next time we had housekeeping, and then I realized. That same morning, after my bath, I showered to wash my hair. The conditioner and body wash bottles (wall mounted) in the shower were empty. We did make sure they were refilled, but still. \nWe had room service breakfast twice. Neither time did all items make it up the first time. Not a huge deal, but again, when you\u2019re paying like $18 for a pot of coffee, you don\u2019t want to wait 35 minutes for your cream to come up. \nOne small thing: no in-room coffee. Not even an nespresso or lavazza. In the morning, sometimes I want a single cup of coffee. I don\u2019t want a whole pot, and I don\u2019t want to wait an hour for room service to bring up a pot of coffee (and then anothe 35 minutes for the forgotten cream). I get that it\u2019s a little gauche, but it\u2019s pretty standard now. And again, $1800 a night\u2026and there\u2019s a huge bar with a sink in the room. Plenty of space to put the machine.\nCost\/variety of food. Exorbitant cost, and while good, it wasn\u2019t amazing. The tea is $155, and the Palm Court isn\u2019t so lovely as to make it worthwhile. The Palm Court is also not great for dinner, but it\u2019s the only restaurant on site. It was small plates\/lunch-type food but for the price of a nice dinner entree. I happily spend lots of money on food when it\u2019s good, but there wasn\u2019t a ton of variety or anything notable about the offerings. It was like a fancy kid\u2019s menu. \nThe public spaces of the hotel. If you\u2019re expecting expansive lobbies and places to sit and people watch or read a book, sorry. It\u2019s very underwhelming. The lobby shown in movies isn\u2019t for hotel guests, and there are three small old elevators. So you\u2019re often waiting several minutes for elevators with a bunch of other people. The champagne court is a bar\/restaurant in the morning for eating and drinking, not for guests to relax. It also encroaches into the lobby, so people are often tripping over each other in the little space left. There\u2019s no grand stair, the stores are down this dark hallway and then dark stair, and they are all very small. The hotel was decorated for Christmas, but the trees and garlands were tacky white-flocked and boring. I expected more.\n\nThat\u2019s the theme: I expected more. This is supposed to be an experience, and other than a lot of expensive marble, it was worse than most 4 star hotels I\u2019ve stayed in. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

You do not get what you are paying for at The Plaza. Staff seem undertrained and overwhelmed. Rooms are stark with no artwork and minimal decor. Front desk agent seemed dazed and confused. With all of the off the street traffic it is hard for the staff to tell who is a guest and who isn\u2019t. The end result is staff treating all with suspicion. I\u2019d rather stay at a lesser trafficked hotel in the future. It feels a little bit like the hotel doesn\u2019t have an identity, which is odd for such a storied and historic location.

My sister and I were in town for just Saturday night, visiting my niece who lives in the city. We were there for a quick research trip for an upcoming book and went to several open houses on Fifth Avenue. (Book is called The Fifth Avenue Apartment). This was our first time staying at The Plaza--and it was so amazing, exceeded our expectations in every way possible.\n\nI used my Platinum American Express card and when we checked in, we had a lovely upgrade to a junior suite with two queen beds. And when we walked in, our jaws dropped. The room was so beautiful and homey at the same time. It had two bathrooms, a spacious sitting area and bar and there was a little welcome box of macarons on the coffee table. The main bathroom was the nicest we've seen yet in any hotel, with a separate tub, toilet room, and huge standing shower with excellent water pressure. The details were so elegant--tile inlay in the sink, for example.\n\nThe beds were very comfortable as well. And the service here is just impeccable. We had the most delicious breakfast this morning in the Palm court. I had a chia pudding with almonds, pumpkin seeds, and fresh berries. It was light and flavorful and exactly what I was in the mood for. My sister had the American breakfast of eggs, bacon, homefries and toast. I had a slice of her bacon and it was so good. My niece had the special eggs benedict served on dungeness crab cakes. And that was insane. I am definitely getting that when I go back. \n\nWe can't wait to go back. This will now be our go-to hotel because it was just so special and made us so happy. Next time we want to stay for two nights, so we can have even more fun.

However, what was meant to be a once in a lifetime experience was actually very disappointing. \n\nMy husband contacted The Plaza beforehand to advise I\u2019m vegetarian. This was also acknowledged at the reception desk. However, we received the one mixed afternoon tea stand with meat, fish and vegetarian sandwiches next to each other. My husband then had to ask which of the sandwiches were vegetarian as nobody talked us through the items on the afternoon tea stand. Additionally, when my husband highlighted that he\u2019d requested a vegetarian afternoon tea, the colleague serving us briefly tried to apportion the blame onto us. However, he went away and brought out two more vegetarian sandwiches. \n\nWith a couple of exceptions (the cucumber sandwich and the savoury scone, which were gorgeous), most of the food we ate was of average quality. We\u2019ve paid far less for considerably better afternoon teas. \n\nThe colleague who served us was polite, professional and attentive. However, his service felt a little disingenuous and more like a tick box exercise. \n\nThe venue had noted that it was our honeymoon and brought us out a free chocolate cake (which was greatly appreciated), albeit an incredibly minor point-it stated happy anniversary on it. We didn\u2019t care as we were grateful for the gesture but we felt it symbolised the complacent service experience we received. \n\nThe venue itself is beautiful and the ambience lovely. \n\nAll in all, we both felt that for the amount of money we paid, the whole experience was massively overpriced.

Taxi from JFK took about an hour but only 30 mins in the early hours to get back (usual Manhattan set fare applies). Theres several Subway stations nearby.\n\nThe staff were wonderful from arrival to departure- everyone was very friendly and courteous.\n\nMy room was very spacious, always clean and elegantly & elaborately decorated- I particularly liked the chandelier. The bed was comfortable, the lighting was good but a bit confusing to operate and there was a well stocked minibar. The ensuite was also spacious with good toiletries, plenty of towels and bathrobes. Only gripe was that the shower pressure was pretty poor and the slippers were one size and far too small for me. \n\nI had breakfast at the Palm Court one morning and the service was fabulous, the food was perfectly adequate but nothing to write home about (equally nothing to complain about but I would expect a bit more from such a renowned restaurant). I had a drink in the  Champagne Bar on a couple of occasions and whilst the drinks were good the service was rather slow. \n\nThere's a good gym\/ fitness centre and the shop on the mezzanine level is very good.\n\nSo, I did enjoy my stay and there is no doubting that The Plaza is a very nice hotel. However, at over $4000 for my 3 night stay I really don't think it was worth the price tag- in one sense, yes it was worth it to tick it off my list, but on the other hand I have stayed in better properties for far less. In many ways, I felt a little like I was throwing money away where it wasn't really worth it. That said, the ALL points\/ status points bumped me up a level and I'm currently enjoying a free night at an Accor hotel in Aberdeen paid for by my stay at The Plaza!","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

Our server Faritz was so kind, friendly, and accommodating. He was always checking in on us to see if we needed anything else, and made sure we had separate serving dishes of jam\/cream etc. for the different diets and allergies. And I saw him paying just as much attention and providing excellent service to all the other people he was serving. He was fantastic!!\n\nCheck-in for our afternoon tea was also no problem. We arrived about five minutes early, and they took care of us from the start.

The grandeur that once defined this establishment now appears to have faded into the past.\n\nThe deteriorated state of affairs became painfully apparent, as the ladies' restrooms lacked cleanliness and proper ventilation, a far cry from the anticipated luxury. The hotel itself seemed weary, lacking the luster it once exuded.\n\nOur Sunday evening reservation for drinks magnified our discontent. Despite a sparse crowd, an excessive wait to be seated cast a shadow over the evening's plans. The evident understaffing was a glaring shortcoming that marred the experience. Our choice of a Sancerre wine bottle unraveled into a fiasco, with each person receiving a pre-poured glass only after multiple requests to the server.\n\nThe chocolate cake we ordered further highlighted the service's incompetence, necessitating three separate reminders and ultimately arriving after everyone had finished their drinks. The absence of an inviting atmosphere coupled with shocking service further dampened our experience. A comprehensive revitalization of the establishment is overdue, as the current state is undeniably dismal.\n\nEven the doorman's assistance was rendered only upon our prompting, as they failed to offer aid with a wheelchair until specifically asked. Overall, the performance fell painfully short of expectations. Regrettably, we find no reason to consider a return in the future.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

With a warm and welcoming demeanor, he effortlessly guided us through the menu, making thoughtful recommendations and ensuring that every detail of our experience was meticulously attended to. His attention to detail and genuine care for our enjoyment truly set the tone for an unforgettable afternoon.\nWhat made this experience even more magical was witnessing the incredible kindness displayed by another server, Fariz. We had the privilege of observing Fariz go above and beyond to make a young girl's birthday celebration truly special. His dedication and heartfelt gestures towards the birthday girl and her beloved doll were heartwarming and showed a level of care that is truly rare to find and had us casual observers in tears. \n\nOverall, our visit to the Palm Court was an enchanting experience that left me utterly enchanted. The exceptional service provided by Elvis and the heartwarming kindness demonstrated by Fariz added an extra layer of magic to an already splendid affair.

She made my dream come true, and gave me an upgrade to this beautiful suite. The room looks like you walked into the\n 1920s, combined with the great Gatsby and Fitzgerald himself along with his wife, Zelda, beautiful pictures and things of the era.

Expected luxury but maintenance was not what it should be and decor is not only dated but doesn\u2019t take advantage of the incredibly generous space which is so rare in New York. Interior designer was sleeping on the job. No table, no sofa. Refrigerator doesn\u2019t chill anything. A cabinet door didn\u2019t close all the way. A faucet splattered everywhere. A tub faucet wouldn\u2019t shut off so we had to call the Engineer. Toilet had to be double flushed. \n\nPros: Service was cheery  and kind (although concierge never returned my call) and the bathroom is quite elegant. The location is amazing next to Central Park. They did deliver a fridge to the room. Fabulous closet space. \n\nWe tried 2 rooms the first had a terrace which overlooks an interior courtyard with a fountain. The terrace was smaller than it looked in the picture and you need to step up to it from the room which is on the fifth floor and felt quite dark because the only windows were the doors to the terrace. The carpet was quite dirty. They moved us to a room on the 15th floor overlooking 57th St., which had windows at least but we could hear the TV from the Nextdoor room quite clearly. Security did ask the guest to turn it down. Overall, I\u2019ve stayed in lots of five star hotels, and this one just doesn\u2019t stand up to that level in terms of decor and maintenance. However, what is luxurious is the amount of space and the location. Might return if price were not so astronomical. At that price you expect more. ","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location can\u2019t be beat, and the lobby, restaurants and bars are all so lovely. However, we have stayed at other nice NY hotels (Waldorf Astoria - RIP, the Langham, etc) and I was very surprised that the mini bar and snack options were lacking in the room. When we came down the hall at 4pm after checking in, there were many dirty trays outside of people\u2019s rooms and an abandoned housekeeping vacuum leaning against a wall. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know they were coming back for it eventually but for the cost of the room, it was surprising. I was expecting the nicest of nice in all areas. Once we got in the room, the bathroom was gorgeous with all of the intricate gold details. But the lighting was definitely dark, so ladies keep that in mind when planning to do your makeup. It was definitely doable, just dark. Now this is what will make me sound extra.. but the toilet paper was SO ROUGH. I\u2019m talking the cheapest ply you can get. Again, I normally don\u2019t care at all about that sort of thing. But when you\u2019re payint over $1k\/night for a room, you figure the hotel could atleast buy some charmin. \n\nAfter this bucket list experience I realized that the Plaza is worth the price due to: it\u2019s history, the fact that it is the most iconic hotel in NYC, the location, and the grandeur rooms and lobby. But if you\u2019re expecting Four Seasons style amenities in the room, the newest and most techy room features, Vegas hotel minibar and snacks, you may want to look at a newer property.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was the rest of the experience that fell very short of our expectations.\n\nThe staff are sadly devoid of any charm or character. Most are cold and aloof with no real interest in providing anything close to good customer service.\n\nThe chap who tried to look after us asked after about 40 minutes if we had finished when we had half our food left on the rack and 2 pots of lovely hot tea still to drink.\n\nWhen we said we hadn't finished, he ignored us and started to clear our table. He was rather confused when I told him again we hadn't finished.  \n\nHe just didn't listen to us and wanted us to leave ASAP to get someone else at the table.\n\nIt was very unprofessional and typical of how the management \/ staff know that they don't have to try that hard to maintain a good reputation as business will always be pretty good because of the reputation of The Plaza Hotel.\n\n$400 for 2 afternoon teas is far from cheap but I have to say, based on my experience, it was nowhere near fair value.\n\nI wouldn't recommend going here.

Decided to treat myself to this amazing, reputable hotel. Room was splendid, 18th floor, loved the finishings and style, huge shower and tub and hot water! Exemplary service from each and every person I spoke with or who assisted. 5 star all around there for kindness. \nI'll admit the meals are way overpriced for what you get. At least stand out if you're going to offer same food other restaurants have and charge triple for them... Like a lobster roll with French fries... Came out warm instead of hot, fries were mediocre. Then a ceasar salad was $65 delivered to my room. They charge $10 just for delivery then you feel obligated to give a tip... For a salad, without meat, and buns that were hard and stale! \nSo besides that, still glowing with excitement, and everything was super perfect until later at night when I'd paid 21 for a movie and was in the last 30 min when I started to smell smoke... Well pot to be exact. I thought I could handle it but I noticed a fancy sign stating that it's a non smoking hotel and anyone caught would be fined 1500. So I called the front desk.. I was devastated as I couldn't handle it as it makes me so sick and I'm allergic and get sore throats right away from it... Took about an hour in total to have someone come investigate, confirm I wasnt out of my mind, and then move me to a new room. Lower floor, still no view, but a suite which was of no use to me since I had to check out early in the morning. So I had to pack everything up and couldn't go anywhere as it was late and I was already dressed for bed so had to stick it out until they moved me. Then had to unpack everything again and made me go to bed much later than I wanted to. \n\nJust really unfortunate for my only night there... And what didn't sit overly well with me is that upon check out, they never did anything else to make up for the inconvenience it caused... At any other hotel, fine, but at a Fairmont, at that price I have to work hard for to afford... Just disappointing. But I know it wasn't their fault and the staff did the best they could, I guess I had just hoped they would have gone above and beyond, especially cause now I'm sick \ud83e\udd2e. I'd of course still recommend the hotel though! \n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

Breakfast in the Palm Court was wonderful and we were delighted to be served once again by Proferio and  Babu who were exceptionally professional and really nice to our kids. All the staff whom we encountered in the hotel were absolutely lovely. Babu can do wonderful tricks with a napkin which was really entertaining and our children absolutely loved it! Check-out was super quick and no fuss. Tony, the doorman, arranged our transport to the airport and was always polite and friendly during the many, many times that we entered and exited the hotel. Ted was also very helpful and knowledgeable. Being so close to the shops on Fifth Avenue was super handy for dropping bags back to the hotel.

We had requested the upgraded accommodations for an additional fee (if available). Upon our arrival, we were surprised that there was no one to greet us at the door or help with our luggage. Anyone could walk right in. When we checked in (we were a little early and didn't expect our room would be ready, which was fine as there were plenty of sights to see), we were pleasantly greeted, and the kind young lady let us know that they would be able to honor our upgrade; however, it wouldn't be ready until after noon. No problem! We went to Mass and, on our walk back, received a call that our room was ready - much earlier than we'd expected. When we walked to the door of our room, there was a vacuum cleaner left in front of it. Not exactly what you'd expect when paying an exorbitant nightly fee. Upon entering our room, we discovered we did not receive the upgrade; it was the room we'd originally booked. I mentioned this to the bellman when he brought up our luggage, and his response was, \"oh, it's a very large room, though.\" It was a nice room, so fine enough; we'd end up sharing a bed instead of having two beds as we would with the upgrade. It also had a large terrace, but I had problems locking the terrace door, so I asked the bellman for assistance. He spent 10 minutes showing me how to operate the \"tricky\" door, but it never did lock. I did not feel safe, especially since it connected with the terrace next door and was so close to the neighboring building. The tv provided access to all the services, but when I went to use them, it said I wasn't checked in, so I had to \"chat\" with the concierge to get it activated. I also inquired about a late checkout since we had a later flight but received no response. We went for our spa services and tea. The tea experience was terrific, and we highly recommend it. The gluten-free option was wonderful! The spa services were nice (massage and facial), but nothing set it apart from any other spa. The staff in all areas were extremely kind and accommodating. That night, we ordered the Home Alone sundae - \"16 scoops of assorted ice cream.\" Hold onto your hats; we received the smallest scoops of only chocolate and vanilla ice cream. We were a bit disappointed. I'm glad I also ordered a steak dinner because that was amazing, and although room service said they were running a little behind, ours was delivered within minutes. I pushed the button for room service to retrieve our table, but no one ever came, so I just muscled the table into the hall. Let's talk about the bed: the most comfortable ever! We did ask for extra blankets because we required a little extra bundling that night. That was no problem. The next morning I ordered room service for breakfast. Again, they warned that they were running behind. This time they took well over an hour, and everything was cold when it arrived. This delay really set us back from checking out. Housekeeping had asked when we were checking out. I asked if 14:00 was okay, and she said yes, but at 12:20, the butler was knocking at our door, asking when we could be out. He could see I was frantically trying to get packed and told me to take my time, but it would've been nice if we could've just had the late checkout I had inquired about initially. Then, as I was waiting at the airport and reviewing my hotel invoice, I noticed that none of the spa credits that came with my package were reflected in the invoice. So, I spent a good amount of time on the phone getting that sorted out. It is a lovely hotel, and the people are so incredibly kind. The overall experience is not quite at the level I had expected. I'm going to blame the timing because I can see where perfection once was. Unfortunately, our visit came post-pandemic and during the busiest time of year, but we're fortunate to have visited at all.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

It was slightly fast paced compared to other teas, but I wouldn't consider it rushed (I'd say just fairly efficient, as I imagine they need to be). We splurged on a couple of cocktails each in addition to the tea and just had a great time. Two small criticisms..despite foie gras being banned in New York, they still had it on the menu. It was in the form of a macaron included in the savory portion; it was not delicious anyway (the only unpleasant item, actually...I wasn't expecting it to be really sweet). Also, the restrooms are located quite far and only one working stall in the ladies' room, which isn't ideal when we're all drinking tea and cocktails.\n\nOverall, there was a lot of food, and all but the foie gras macaron was simply outstanding.

Rather than have a guest list (and\/or a list of people visiting hotel guests) the doormen had no list and just asked a series of questions to determine if you were allowed in (a bit like customs on arrival at an airport - but with the suggestion that giving a tip each time would grease the wheels). This wasted time and was just annoying.

He made sure to keep our glasses full and snap a few photos. We thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful surroundings, the Christmas atmosphere and our drinks. Looking forward to our next visit.

The only reason I do not give this hotel a 5 star review is due to the issue of their private events taking up the amenities of the hotel. One of the things I personally enjoy the most when traveling and the reason why I select a good 5 star hotel is to enjoy the lobby, bar, amenities and enjoy myself in the property where I\u2019m staying. The Plaza has a nice bar area which is the Palm Court but unfortunately we have only been able to enjoy it once. The first night they closed early for a celebration and the third night closed for a wedding. They should have designated ballrooms and areas for private events that do not interfere with the hotel guests. We had to leave our hotel to have some drinks before dinner which for that I would stayed at a 3 star hotel. Very inconvenient.

We were met by the door man who insisted on helping us. As a visitor for the first time we were surprised at the help was given straight away? (I shouldn\u2019t have as it kept going). We were escorted to the reception and met Gary who again welcomed us to the Plaza Hotel and made us feel special. Told us the our baggage would be carried to the room for us.  Paul (again a smile and a conversation) kindly took us to our room and before leaving showed us around our room. To say we were blown away at our room would be an understatement. It was fabulous!!!!!  We were just settling in to the unpacking before going out when tap on the door.  A maid had turned up to Turn down the bed and close the blinds for us (Wow I\u2019m now feeling really Posh but I\u2019m not honest).  The maid asked us if everything was ok and if we needed anything please ask.\n\nOn the Sunday of our visit we had the privilege of the afternoon tea.  Again I will say this is a must even if you just visit New York book it.  The room was beautiful and the staff were excellent and helpful. It is a treat so be prepared to pay what you would expect from an exceptional hotel.\n\nI must mention the concierge as they too very helpful. They permitted my wife to charge her phone while we went to the afternoon tea. A simple request met with no fuss.\n\nAs we left again the Doormen were exceptional and could see we were concerned about our booked car. He calmly reassured my wife we can sort something out and she was not to worry. Thankfully it arrived and again carried our luggage to the car for us.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m sorry I can only give five stars because I can\u2019t give any more because I would.

We arrived in plenty of time for our Afternoon Tea and was asked to go for a walk(15mins early) which we did only around the hotel lobby and came back at 1pm and were left standing whilst they seated other people who had arrived after us. The waiter we eventually got was to say the least miserable and we asked if we could change the ingredients of some of the sandwiches, but we were told no as everything was pre done and there was no other option but to have what was on offer. Another waiter came over and asked if we would like some water, we asked for still water and it cost us on the bill $12.00. The two teapots came out and the tea was very weak. Then they brought us our selection of sandwiches and miniature desserts, we ate three of the sandwiches and left the rest. As it was my daughter\u2019s 21st we ordered two cocktails (costing $52.00). The only nice thing was when they presented my daughter with a birthday plate which had a small tin with a salted caramel brownie inside and macarons as decorations. I spoke to an employee who asked about our day and even he was shocked that we were not able to change our sandwiches the whole bill came to a staggering price of \u00a3358.00 yes I know it\u2019s a lot but don\u2019t think we would ever go or recommend to anyone.

This hotel has been so stripped back of its former opulence it is real hard to be impressed or excited about this once world class hotel. We booked a 3 night stay and were disappointed in so many ways. Good points: Room\/bed\/bathroom nice and comfortable but the repro furniture has a touch of English guest house about it. \nThe hotel's overall offer to guests is now quite basic. There is hardly any real 5* luxury or exclusivity left in the place and exploring it takes about 5 minutes.\nAll of the main areas are now sparsely furnished or closed. \nThere is a constant flow of tourists at the main entrance and lobby. And the Palm Court feels like a bus terminal with furniture that shows very visible signs of advanced wear. We ate there once and the food (basic burger\/sandwich) was dreadful. Very poor quality.\nThere are no guest areas for sitting and relaxing and absolutely no fine dining or even decent dining facilities. \nTo top it all the WiFi is not free in rooms, although ironically there is free WiFi in public areas. Can you explain the logic here?\nObviously it's location and history sells it without much effort, but otherwise it's not what you might expect.\nTo their credit the staff are lovely and very professional and are working hard with a product that is far from what it should be. \nWe have visited NYC many times over years and were looking forward to experiencing the Plaza, but it has sadly been a poor experience.\nChecking out tomorrow and won't be coming back.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I decided taxi due to the expediency. However, what the concierge failed to tell me that the Zoo was on a \u201cfree\u201d day and had limited capacity and that capacity was normally filled by 9am. So, at 9:30am I spent $50. to take a taxi out to the zoo only to be told that the zoo was at capacity and closed to any additional visitors. I then spent additional time and money trying to use both the metro and taxi to return to the Plaza.

We began to look at cocktail choices and were told that we should leave that and just decide on which tea selection we wanted as they stopped serving at 4pm (it was 3.30pm and we had booked weeks in advance)\nHe brought out water and slopped it in to our glasses and on to the table - which he didn't clear away. Brought the stand with sandwiches, desserts etc on and unceremoniously dumped it on the table. The bowls of cream and jam came with no spoons for transferring them so we had to use our knives which isn't practical for a few reasons. He never asked us during this time if we would like to order the cocktails that we had expressed an interest in. In fact getting anyone's attention was nigh on impossible. The sandwiches were hard and dry - certainly not made fresh. The sweets were just that - sweet. They looked pretty but didn't taste as good. The tea was brought out in huge pots (I'm talking family sized teapots) which for one person was just ridiculous. The waiter then reached across in front of me and my plate to pour it in to my cup without a word, \n forcing me to lean back considerably and the tea had not had time to soak in to the water let alone brew. \nBasically, very poor service and a less than average tea which cost a small fortune.

Toilet paper everywhere. To think we nearly booked this hotel. If the dining area , cocktail bar and bathroom was this bad I dread to think what the bedrooms were like. I think we had a lucky escape. This hotel will use the excuse that it is undergoing an overhaul , yes may be but that is no excuse for dirty chairs and bathrooms.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

And the sandwiches were small and just so-so. I thought it was all slightly underwhelming. And there were no refills on any of the sandwiches or sweets, which I know isn't typical but I remember having refills at a high-end tea at a high-end Chicago hotel a few years ago, which was very memorable. For the price here (more than $100 per person), why not refills? Or bigger and better treats? The worst part, however, was the bathroom situation: there was a long line-up for the 2 stalls in the one ladies room available to visitors, which was already out of toilet paper when I went in and no one coming around to refill it.

In fact, we were due to stay here on part of our honeymoon back in 2005; however, the hotel was closed for the refurbishment work and we didn\u2019t get to stay. We then booked for Easter 2020 but had to cancel due to the Covid-19 pandemic so, third time lucky. Alaina and Raechel in Reservations were so helpful in arranging and re-arranging our bookings as well as ensuring everything was organized precisely and so, fast forward to Easter 2022\u2026\n\nWe were efficiently checked-in by the wonderful Loai and our suite was amazing! Prior to being shown to our suite, Shweta from the International Sales team called down to The Champagne Bar to greet us. Loai and Shweta were both so lovely and welcoming. We stayed in a one-bedroom penthouse suite on the twentieth floor. The suite spanned across two floors. The first floor included a downstairs water closet with shower; cloakroom; living room (with sofa, arm chairs, desk and breakfast table); kitchenette (complete with microwave, drawer dishwasher, mini bar) and study. The study had its own sofa, TV, closets and pocket doors which would be perfect as a children\u2019s bedroom. Upstairs was a large king bedroom with a large bathroom (separate water closet, shower, double sinks, bath) and our own separate private terrace which overlooked the courtyard. We also had spectacular views of the many skyscrapers. The attention to detail within the suite and, the whole hotel, is first class. \n\nLocated at Fifth Avenue and south Central Park, The Plaza Hotel is so close to the shoppers\u2019 paradise of all the luxury brands \u2013 Tiffany\u2019s, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Van Cleef & Arpels etc. It was super handy to nip out to the stores and return to our hotel suite to save having to carry around lots of shopping bags. Also, with fantastic Central Park being opposite the hotel, it was great to simply cross the street for a lovely walk. Other must-sees are nearby including St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, the New York Public Library and the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nOh, and there was our butler! Mouhsine was superb \u2013 anything we wanted, Mouhsine was more than obliging. He kept us going with lots of tea and also organized macaroons for the room. Mouhsine also left two beautiful vases of fresh flowers in the living room for us on the second day.\n\nJudy in Housekeeping was fantastic and kept our suite immaculate. A really lovely touch was that on the second day, we returned to the suite and found that the two photos of our children which we had taken with us on our trip were now in proper photo frames on our lockers! We met Judy the next day on her rounds and she was so lovely. She couldn\u2019t do enough to make our stay so memorable and her kindness was amazing.\n\nWe had breakfast in the Palm Court each morning except for one morning when we had in-room dining. Breakfast in the Palm Court was amazing. Proferio and his team were consistently fantastic. The Palm Court as a setting is complete splendor. In-room dining in the afternoon\/evenings was always super quick \u2013 within 20 minutes from time of ordering to delivery. Rodney gave all meals 10 out of 10 marks - all were outstanding in terms of flavors and presentation which were second to none.\n\nOn the last day of our stay, we had afternoon tea in The Palm Court. Elvis and his colleagues were amazing and if you haven\u2019t had afternoon tea in The Plaza then you haven\u2019t had afternoon tea. It was so delicious. Every bite of food we ate during our stay was first class and my husband and I know good food. \n\nOverall, all the staff who we encountered at The Plaza were so polite, professional, kind and simply lovely. The hotel is absolutely magnificent and we had the most amazing stay. We look forward to returning with our children for our next stay during Christmas 2022.\n\nWhat makes The Plaza magnificent, outstanding and the best is not just the iconic hotel, the heritage, the location or the food perfection, it is the staff. Whilst the staff training and the aim for perfection comes through, it is more than that. It is the genuine kindness that the staff have which makes you feel at home and they consistently do their very best for guests. A stay at The Plaza will make memories that will last a life time.\n\nLynda Hegarty-McDermott","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}
