There are never free tables, but people, even without tables, can continue to enter, resulting in real masses of people with breakfast in hand trying to find a place, sitting in the hall or even on the floor. If you are lucky enough to find a place to have your breakfast you will have several people with their plastic plates full, standing close to you and your table looking at you and waiting for you when you get up.\nThe food is scarce and extremely bad.

As is usual in Manhattan, you can get something to eat\/drink every few meters (e.g. Taco Bell etc.)\n\nThe room is bigger than I thought. We had enough space for 5 nights. There is also plenty of storage space in the bathroom.\n\nThere is shampoo etc. in the shower, everything is clean.\n\nThe bed is comfortable.\n\nA big MINUS point is the very loud ventilation. Regardless of whether the air conditioning\/heating is on - the ventilation does not turn off and is very loud. You can even hear it through earplugs. I find that very annoying.\n\nAs often mentioned in the reviews, another problem is the elevators. There are only 2 for 14 floors. Sometimes you wait 10-15 minutes for one to come and then sometimes it stops at almost every floor and takes forever for the door to open completely and close again.\n\nThe breakfast is edible but that's it. It's not tasty. There's far too little space and it's completely overcrowded. We traveled in the off-season and still had to eat standing up. The selection is OK - typically American. The scrambled eggs tasted like unseasoned liquid plastic. And as is (unfortunately also usual) all cutlery\/crockery is disposable. Breakfast was included, so it wasn't that bad. If we had paid extra for it, though, I would have asked for it back. \n\nAll the staff are very nice. \n\nThere are two WiFi options - the free (\"slow\") one is completely sufficient and it loads everything without any problems. Videos etc. too. \n\nAll in all: a hotel that is great to book for a city trip if you're a deep sleeper and like to eat breakfast outside :-)","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Scrambled eggs and sausages available. With plenty of crumpets and bagels which were refilled regularly. Nuts , fruit and cereals also available. Lobby staff and security at night were very friendly always greeting people and wishing them a good day. There is also a shop in the lobby for snacks and drinks. The hotel looks very modern and the beds were comfortable. There is a large TV in the room with lots of channels. There is safe and a fridge which came in handy. There is a coffee machine also. The price is very reasonable for the location. My only qualm is that the bar staff did not interact at all with the guests. We sat at the bar and were charged double for our drinks although this was later put back on my card when I complained although it took a few days.

No one replied.  I landed at JFK that evening and logged in to the Bonvoy app only to find the booking had been canceled.  I called reservations and they offered no sympathy or help to the situation.  They said there was nothing I could do and I needed to book a new room.  So I did.  Then I got to hotel, checked in and then when I got to my room I see it's a tiny room with a double bed even though i'd booked a King Studio.  The check in person knew he was downgrading me but did not say anything.  I called the front desk and they said \"it's because of availability\".  I said \"but why wasn't I told that at check in, I booked a King\".  They realized they had screwed up when they looked up my Marriott status I think so they offered me some points to make up for it.\n\nWhat a terrible experience. \n\nOn top of this, the hotel is fine, but it is way too crowded with not enough elevators.

The room was not huge but it is NYC but plenty of space. I wish the bathroom had a regular door not a barn door but it was fine.  Never heard a sound from outside which was a very busy street so that was great!!\nBreakfast was great, such a big area with plenty of seats inside and outside.  They had eggs every day with a different meat and potato each day. I love how long you have to get breakfast it is served until 11!!  I also love how they have a cold or hot water machine. great for filling up my water bottles for the day. In the evening you can get a glass or wine or beer for free from 5-6pm.  They have out some veggies, dip, cheese and fruit.  It was a nice little snack.\nThe hotel was about a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square, Just FYI I would avoid going down 36th to get to 7th Ave, that street was a bit creepier then 37th, or 38th or 40th.

Any questions, please let me know.\n\nThis was a business trip for a single traveler. \n\nARRIVAL:\nArrived at the hotel from LGA. This hotel is a great location in Manhattan in the Garment District and a 12 minute walk to Times Square. My Uber from the airport took about 40 minutes which is not bad seeing as it was mid-afternoon. \n\nCHECK-IN:\nI was quickly checked in by a friendly and smiling front desk. They provided me a high-level overview of the hotel layout, including the bank of elevators that had a gremlin in it (wasn\u2019t working right), and the complimentary happy hour (wine and beer tasting) as well as the breakfast. Super easy process took about 4ish minutes. \n\nPROPERTY:\nThe hotel shares with another Marriott property, so it CAN be crowded, especially in the morning for breakfast. The lobby, floors and elevators all were clean and managed. My room rate was $297 per night for three nights, which is not bad at all in Manhattan. The reason why I chose this was a meeting we held with a customer. They had already booked here, so to make it easier, we did as well. Normally I stay at the now closed Midtown Marriott. I have no complaints about the overall property in general\n\nROOM\/ACCOMODATIONS:\nIf you have been to NYC, you know that many rooms are small. I will say that the rooms here are the smallest I have encountered. Just over 248 sq\/ft was my corner room 521. There is a couch with a desk area facing the window once you enter, a VERY small closet, fridge and microwave, coffee maker, you know the standard. There is NO place to put your suitcase away and only two drawers on each side of the bed to put clothes away. I always unpack. Doesn\u2019t matter how many or few days. \n\nThe bed is low to the ground, more so than other hotel beds, unless you are in Asia. It was a king and it was comfortable. \n\nBathroom is super small, which was to be expected given the overall room size. Nice shower and a clean bright white. \n\nThe overall lighting in the room, from the fixtures could be improved in the couch\/desk area. It is a little bleak. \n\nSTAFF\/SERVICE:\nAs I said before, the staff was always super friendly and helpful. From the bartenders to the meeting room staff, EVERYONE was great. Other high-end properties in Manhattan need to take a visit and see how they do it. \n\nFOOD:\/BAR:\nI visited the bar once late at night after coming back from a dinner. Drinks were good. Ordered an old fashioned and a vodka-soda with cran. All were done well. \n\nThere is a grab and go area to the side of the check-in counter with the basic snacks, water, etc. \n\nBreakfast is a tad crazy with ALL the people from both hotels converging on it. One morning I grabbed some eggs, sausage and potatoes. All items were very salty and I could not eat it so I grabbed a banana and a muffin. Blueberry was good!\n\nSUMMARY:\nFor the price the hotel was nice. Rooms were on the small to tiny side, so not fitting for more than one person, but you can make it work in a king if you don\u2019t mind using the couch for your suitcases. \nI loved the staff. That made this review easier for me. Would I come back? Yes, if I needed to be right in this area. I would not turn people away. \n\nScoring:\nCHECK-IN: 10\/10\nPROPERTY: 7.0\/10\nROOM: 6.5\/10\nSTAFF\/SERVICE: 10\/10\nFOOD\/BAR: 7.5\/10\nOVERALL WEIGHTED: 8.2\/10\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The check-in and checkout process was a breeze, and the staff went out of their way to ensure that my needs were met throughout my stay.\n\nHowever, my experience with the facilities left something to be desired. The elevators were an endless source of frustration, with long wait times and a constant crush of fellow guests that made it difficult to move between floors in a timely manner.\n\nThe rooms themselves were also a point of concern, as the lack of space made it difficult to navigate without feeling cramped and confined. Moving the small chair in the room was a logistical nightmare, as it effectively blocked the exit and made it impossible to leave without first rearranging the furniture.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the bathroom door was a flimsy sliding barn door that provided little to no privacy, compounding the overall sense of claustrophobia that permeated the room.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, I must concede that the limited breakfast selection was passable, if not entirely satisfying.\n\nIn conclusion, while The SpringHill Suites in NYC may not be the ideal choice for discerning travelers, its top-notch staff and reasonable amenities make it a viable option for those willing to overlook its shortcomings.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We stayed four nights in King room with terrace. The room had lovely comfortable bed, small sofa, safe, wardrobe with ironing board and steam iron. Fridge and coffee machine and desk and chair. As the room was small it meant one side of bed was close to glazed terrace door and the door to bathroom at the foot of bed so it was quite difficult to move round at night. The bathroom had lovely hot shower and large toiletries and towels and hairdryer.  We had booked room with terrace but as it was cold weather we did not use it and the cold came through the glass so we had to keep the blind down to keep the room warm. That said if the weather was warmer the terrace would be a bonus. The room was clean and housekeeping came everyday. Sheets changed on the third day. There was huge TV and provided you had own subscriptions easy to access Netflix etc. Good free wifi. \nI agree the lift is slow but we were only on 2nd floor so could walk down stairs. The breakfast had a good choice so long as you got there before 9. It was always busy and 7.30 seemed the best time. They also do a happy hour at the bar 5-6pm where you can get small glasses of wine or beer and nibbles. Very nice. We only did it once as we were normally out till later. \nOn our last day we booked transfer to JFK with the lady in the hotel.

Lastly, there was an airport transfer stall in reception. I enquired and booked a transfer to Newark airport. I was told by the lady that this was a car that would pick us up direct to go to the airport. When we were picked up it was actually a bus which then stopped at another 3 hotels then went to the airport.

After landing at JFK my family and I got the subway to Penn Station, we were then about 3 blocks away from the hotel! We easily managed to carry our luggage the required distance.\nI had read online about the homeless problem in the neighbourhood. There were a few homeless people on the street but I have seen far worse in most cities in the world and no one even looked in our direction. The street is pretty busy and I didn\u2019t feel unsafe at any point. \nIf you plan to go to Madison Sq Gardens it\u2019s an ideal location. I went to watch the Knicks and it was a 7 minute walk to the entrance we had to use.\nThe staff at the hotel are fantastic; exceptionally friendly, helpful and courteous throughout. The hotel will store your luggage if arriving early or leaving late. The foyer of the hotel is very modern, has a good vibe and is a nice place to have a coffee or drink at the bar. The foyer also acts as an overflow area at breakfast which does get exceptionally busy. If you are happy to wait and stalk a table then it\u2019s nothing to worry about.

Something for everyone in our group.\nWe were out all day but with kids you have no choice but to be back in the hotel early which means you can either hang out in the reception area which is doable; or come up to the very small room.

The bed was comfortable, the shower hot, and there was a free breakfast.\n\nThe hotel is a combo of Springhill Suites and Fairfield Inn.  I'm not sure how it it split up, there is a cost difference at the same address.  The breakfast was typical Springhill Suites\/Fairfield Inn, nothing amazing, it is free, what to expect.  I think the lobby is kind of cool, open and airy.  There breakfast is served on the 1st floor, and there is also a bar area, and a small snack area for purchase.  The location was safe, I'm a native New Yorker, and a deli was within a short walking distance in either 36th or 34th street and 9th avenue.  I did find the partner parking garage a bit odd.

In the new room the TV didn't work, we were told the cable box was broken and we could ask for a room the NEXT day, I wasn't planning to unpack all the baby stuff and then repack the day after to get another (a third) room. So we stayed in the room with no TV, and up to now, we haven't been compensated for this inconvenience.\nAlso, at time of check-in we were never told about the housekeeping policies and the fact that you don't get service until the 3rd day.

No hook in the bathroom to hang a robe or an item you might need to steam while in the shower.  No overhead lighting in the room except at the door.  Probably my #1 complaint is the mattress.  The reason I stay in Marriott hotels is for their mattress.  This hotel definitely did not have a Marriott-quality mattress.  Very, very uncomfortable.  And to reiterate other reviews, very shady street.  If I were not with my husband, I would not stay here as a woman travelling alone.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

It\u2019s clean and modern, but built inside the fa\u00e7ade of an old church adding some character.  Additionally, the staff is friendly and accommodating, the room has microwave and mini fridge and breakfast and wi-fi are included.\nBut there are some issues: the room is not a suite, half the very small room is carpeted and the other half has faux wood flooring, creating two \u2018spaces\u2019. The bathroom only has a shower and toilet, the vanity sink is in the living space, much like a roadside motel, and there is only one chair.  The small desk\/work space is hogged by the microwave.  The room has an iron, but no hair dryer, you have to request one, there is no light switch by the bed, you have to turn out the lights, then find your way to bed.  The cold breakfast is also of the roadside motel variety; like much of this property, below what you expect from a Marriott, at any price point.  But the deal breaker, for me, was the air conditioning couldn\u2019t be made to work in the second room either\u2026neither room ever got a cool as the outside temperature.  One of the engineers confided that he spends most of his time trying to coax the air conditioning to work.\nLastly, the hotel is on a pretty seedy side street\u2026not a criticism, in NYC you build where you can obtain a building site\u2026there are three other hotels on the block.  I didn\u2019t feel at risk, but it will intimidate some.\nAs the title says, it\u2019s your call\u2026you\u2019ll have to decide if the pros outweigh the cons.  At the right price, this could be a very good option, with precautions.  Request a hair dryer, when you check in, if you need one, and check out your room before you unpack\u2026if the air-conditioning doesn\u2019t work or you\u2019re uncomfortable with the location of the bathroom vanity\u2026it was less intrusive in my first room, request a new room\u2026the staff is accommodating.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

They attempted to check my husband and I in for a 4-night stay versus the 7-night resevration I booked.  As described in a review online, there are only two elevators for this hotel. There are two more elevators available in the hotel lobby, but they are actually allocated for the Fairfield hotel which happens to be in the same building, but in higher floors (14 and up).  One of the elevators was out of service for a portion of our stay, leaving us with long waits up and down.\n\nOur room was a king \"suite\", but this studio was small, just comfortable enough for two people. Unfortunately our A\/C was inoperable and, while visiting in NYC in July, this was truly a nightmare.  We called the front desk and were told that they would have someone check it on the outside... Hardly slept that night. The following morning we brought it up in person to the front desk and were told someone would come by our room while we were out... Nothing. My husband attempted to contact Marriot directly, by email and by telephone, but never heard back.  Another hot night. The following day my husband demanded a new room, which they provided, thankfully, but never any offer for a discount for the two nights we spent in a terribly hot room.\n\nOther than those problems, the room was average. The towels shed. The continental breakfast was tolerable. The temperature of the water in the shower worked. The surrounding area has been described as \"sketchy\" online, but it was typical New York in our eyes. Safe enough to walk, even alone as night. My husband and I never had any issue with any of the locals. While there is a lot of seemingly homeless persons around the area, they keep to themselves.

I was so pleasantly surprised that there was someone on the other end reading personal notes-having actual correspondence with each guest really highlights individual attention to each guest.

I did not partake in the hot meals but noticed there was another table lined with hot items like scrambled eggs, fresh cheeses to add to eggs, waffles, and other hot items. During the week breakfast is available 6:30-9:30am and on weekends from 7-10am so to accommodate early risers as well as those who choose to sleep a bit later . \nIf one has time to sit for breakfast there are plenty of tables, chairs and couches to sit at comfortably. Take your time dining or If you are on the go it\u2019s easy to choose items and be on your way quickly. \n\nThis generous breakfast feature seems like something that would be very beneficial to those traveling with family and  kids as there are plenty of options to choose from to make sure even pickiest child finds a few favorite choice items for breakfast and also allows time for family to sit together comfortably and enjoy breakfast before a day out in NYC! \nThank you for everything! \nJill ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

Es la octava vez consecutiva que vamos a Nueva York porque nos entusiasma la ciudad, y de hoteles americanos entendemos bastante debido a nuestra experiencia. En primer lugar hay que entender que estamos en Nueva York y por ende, las habitaciones son peque\u00f1as. He le\u00eddo opiniones negativas de este hotel alegando lo reducido que es el espacio y he entendido dichas opiniones cuando he visto la tipolog\u00eda de hu\u00e9sped que se alojaba. Entiendo que el hotel acaba de abrir y lo est\u00e1n promocionando a base de grupos numerosos de turistas, los cuales han estado muy poquito en tierras americanas.

No matter what I changed the thermostat to, the heat did not waiver in temperature(photo attached). I set the thermostat to 65 and the room NEVER got below 78. Due to the extreme heat in the room I had to jeopardize my privacy and safety by keeping my hotel room door propped open with a trash can. \n10. 5:05am I was awoken by doors slamming\/people showering . PERFECT. Who needs sleep right ? \n11. 6am I proceeded downstairs for coffee\/ talk with hotel management. 16 minutes to get to the lobby via elevator due to the mass influx of people. \n12. 620 arrive to front doors of the breakfast room (that opens at 630am). I politely poke my head in & ask the wait staff where might I be able to obtain a cup of coffee. I was then scorned at by the staff screaming at me \u201cwe are not open yet\u201d. \n13. 625am I speak with the hotel front desk. I inquire into why I was placed into Fairfield when I had booked SpringHill 2 weeks prior. The Ladie stated it was because there rooms are full. As a gold member I booked my hotel 2 weeks in advance and did  Mobile checkin 24hours prior to my arrival. Isn\u2019t this something you should inform your guests on? Furthermore, I booked AND PAID MORE FOR a room with a terrace, but I didn\u2019t receive such; in fact, I didn\u2019t even get the correct hotel I booked with. The Ladie stated she would speak with the hotel manager. I asked her to please inform the manager that my room also has a fridge full of old moldy food\/blood on bed sheets. Few minutes later she returned in which she stated the manager would be calling booking.com to see what happened . Well, I didn\u2019t book on booking.com. All she could offer me was 10,000 points on Marriott account. To me, this was an insult. I then asked if they have terrace rooms in which she replied \u201cno\u201d. I booked a suite with a terrace at a higher cost , but no rooms at said hotel have a terrace? - this is false advertising and representation!!! No refund for the higher cost of my non existent \u201cterrace room\u201d was provided or offered . Switching rooms also unavailable . The front desk ladie could offer me no more. I then asked her \u201cwell could I AT THE VERY LEAST get my moldy fridge cleaned and the BLOOD off my bed?\u201d In which she stated, \u201cyes I will send someone up right away\u201d. I kindly thanked her. \n14. 645am breakfast has a Good selection of food. Go early. Already about 100 people in breakfast area (photos attached) . \n15. After breakfast proceeded to my room . 24 minutes to get up to my floor . Finally got on an elevator and I was scrunched in between about 50 people. By the time I made it to my floor (25) I had 2 people cough in my face, 1 man pressed up directly on top of my buttocks, and 3 different individuals hair in my coffee . So much for my morning coffee I was so desperate for. \n16. 10am, I have now cleaned the fridge myself but still have human blood on my bed . No housekeeping as of yet .\n17. 4:30pm housekeeping knocks on my door asking if I need anything. I explain my requests put in at 6am. Housekeeper was not knowledgeable of this & apologized . Housekeeper stated the new linens are downstairs and some one will bring them right up. She also stated she informed the manager and I should expect a call from the manager within 15 minutes . I kindly thanked her .\n18. 4:45pm new housekeeper shows up . Hands me a new set of linen\/blankets & walks away. I guess the $500 I paid for my \u201cterrace\u201d room includes me making my own bed and removing blood stained sheets myself ?! Good thing I have medical gloves with me . \n19. Bartender downstairs was INCREDIBLE , I thank you !\n20. Next morning I check out. Never heard from a manager . \n21. This is my first and last time staying at a Fairfield Inn. \n22. I\u2019ve stayed at 29 different Marriott locations this year, I travel weekly for business , and I always attempt to book a Marriott before any other hotel. This stay has now made me re-consider my loyalty to this company !","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Placing this label on your property is an insult to the brand.  Not only an insult, but could be construed to be misleading and an injustice to those expecting even a slight resemblance to the standard SpringHill property.\n\nFurthermore, to combine this brand with a brand which is recognized as a lower level than SH is further evidence of misleading the public expecting a SH experience.  (This by both brands offering the same product under the same roof).\n\nMy room (two beds) was impossible to negotiate moving from the bed to the bathroom without hitting walls and banging your legs on the base of the beds.  One bed was impossible to get to without damage to a person's body.  The ultimate \"crime\" was the proximity of the bathroom to the beds made you feel you were sleeping in the bathroom.\n\nI don't think it necessary to describe any further.  As a member of the property's management team no one is more familiar with the problems.\n\nIn the least the SH brand name should be removed from the property as it damages Marriott's image as is DEFINITELY misleading.\n\nI ask your forgiveness in advance as I feel obligated to advise fellow Titanium  Elite members on  sites where I am a member.\n\nI am hopeful that some good will come from this communication so future guests one day will not be disappointed.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

All was going well, however during my stay I notice a $30 charge taken from my account under the hotel's name. Knowing I had not used any room service I was curious as to what this charge was for so I asked the staff at the main reception who weren't very happy to help with my query. They approached me like I was an idiot for not knowing the charge and the female staff member had an attitude who to me traveling alone for the first time I thought this was unprofessional and rude. They then said this additional charge 2 days after booking in was state tax . However this seemed odd I would be charged state tax half way through my stay and that it was no explained or mentioned to me whilst checking in. Having felt like I was annoying them I walked away unimpressed. A week after checking out I noticed I hadn't had my $60 deposit returned. I contacted the hotel and was told to forward certain details and they would investigate. I am still yet to hear back from them and it had been 10 since I checked out of this hotel and was told within two days my deposit was returned. I feel as though noone wants to help me out with chasing where my money has gone. The room was left how I found it and I like everyone else have bills to pay and every penny helps with doing so. I am disappointed I am being treated as though the company doesn't not care. I stayed at a hotel from the same company but in Dallas and had no issues.

The front desk staff is great and very friendly.

My room did not face the street but rather faced an inside air shaft, so even in the morning, I had to turn on all the lights because it was too dark.  The bed stands are tiny; one only had enough room for the phone and the other for the alarm clock, so I had to put the phone on the floor to have room for my CPAP.  There is barely enough room to walk around the bed.  The TV is huge, but you can't adjust it to watch it from the sofa.

There were 4 of us - mom + 3 teenagers.  I had some concerns going in after reading the reviews that mentioned that the rooms were very, very small and that the air conditioning was faulty.   Although I will agree that the room was small, I was very pleased that our room had 2 queen-sized beds (unusual for NY where many rooms had full-sized beds) and that the design of the room made good use of the available space.  If you have ever traveled in Europe, the room size is comparable to many of the European hotels that I have stayed in ..not much extra room aside from the beds.  That said, there was a small closet and a small desk.  We ended up using both to the hilt to unpack and store our things - I ended commandeering the ironing board which I put alongside one of the beds to put one of our suitcases on.  Another was placed on the small desk.  I unpacked and used the closet, which really left only one suitcase that was still \"floating\" in the room, so we were fine overall.\n\nOne nice feature were the generous outlets in the room -very helpful for teens with electronic devices!  There were USB-enabled outlets on each side of each bed, along with individual spotlights on each side of each bed.    \n\nThe bathroom was small but new and very clean.  One issue I did have was with respect to storage in the bathroom - there was only a single hook on the glass door to hang towels - not a towel bar anywhere, which made hanging wet towels difficult (especially since there were 4 of us and we were trying to be eco-conscious and re-use towels),  It would have been very helpful if there had been at least 2 more hooks to hang additional towels.  We ended up hanging towels over the desk chair and using one of our suitcases.  Not ideal, but not the end of the world either - we made it work. \n\nThe location was really great for exploring all of Manhattan - easy walking distance to Penn Station (where I had taken the train from Newark airport). Also nearby to 5th Avenue shopping, Empire State Bldg, Broadway theaters, and Rockefeller Center - all within a mile or so (and walkable).  \n\nHot breakfast was a nice start to our day each day and when you are traveling with 3 teens, having it included was a nice perk!  Ample seating in the breakfast area and surrounding lobby made it such that we never lacked a place to sit -even in the later morning when the breakfast was more crowded.\n\nOne other (probably less talked about) perk was the coin-op guest laundry in the basement.  It was very handy to be able to throw in a couple of loads of laundry while having our breakfast one morning.  Front desk provided quarters for change.  My teenage sons also appreciated the new and very well-appointed 24-hour gym, also located on the lower level near the laundry.   Also a shout-out to the small business center with guest-available computers with internet access and a printer - super handy for checking into our flights and printing our boarding passes.\n\nOverall, I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again, and would recommend it for anyone traveling in NYC.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

No lurking around town in traffic to get to the hotel. Parking deal with an icon parking two blocks away to save some money. Great hotel, amazing location, will recommand and visit again for sure!!

It is so hard when there are \"too many choices\" like in NYC! I settled on this one because it was walking distance from Penn Station, and we had a positive experience. I was put off by some reviews of other hotels which talked about mold, mildew, etc. so I wanted to find a hotel that did not have that problem - I picked this one because it was recently modernized.\n\nFirst off, the hotel is not easy to spot - it is on 36th between 8th and 9th, directly across from a DoubleTree which has a large sign\/portico. So look for the DoubleTree, then look across the street. Although the location is Times Square South, it is not directly on Times Square (several blocks away) so the street was quiet.\n\nThe elevators are a bit slow, and there are 2 separate banks of them, but we didn't experience any super long waits. It says in the elevator that you need to use your key, but we did not find this to be the case - however, I would have preferred if we had to use our key because I would have felt more secure.\n\nWe stayed in room 1012 - I am putting this room number down because we had no problems with the air conditioning or anything else in the room. There was a small desk, couch and table which we just used to put our stuff on.  It wasn't a huge room but we didn't feel overly cramped - it is NYC so I wasn't expecting a large hotel room like somewhere in the Midwest.  The shower was nice and modern with porcelain tiles up the shower walls - the bathroom was a bit small but clean - I would have appreciated more counter space around the sink, but could work around it because we had that extra space of the desk in the room. \n\nIf I were staying here for business and had to do some work the desk would have been just adequate, but since this was a personal trip it was fine. The wifi also worked and was not too slow.\n\nThe free breakfast was OK - there was a line each morning for the waffle machine, but we weren't using that so that didn't bother us. The scrambled eggs were very good, but the \"croissants\" were just bread in a croissant shape. The fruit was overripe (particularly the strawberries one day), but it was nice having fresh fruit available. There isn't any cold cereal that isn't sweetened - I would have preferred plain cornflakes or Cheerios instead of frosted flakes and Honey Nut Cheerios. And my daughter has a nut allergy so anything \"Nut\" is a problem.  They have Starbucks coffee. The milk machine is super slow so a lot of people were using the milk that was intended for the coffee on their cereal, so that meant the milk carafes ran out frequently. They also have water and coffee in the lobby. So all in all, breakfast is adequate and you can have better food later on in the day. If you want a bagel, there is a good bagel place less than a 5 min walk away (next to a \"Subway\" sandwich shop - I think it was Best Bagels on 35th - will look up and post the exact name later).\n\nThe bellhop who held our luggage was very friendly. I also got extra shampoo from a housekeeper who was also very friendly.\n\nOverall I would recommend it if you want to be in this part of the city.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This is a beautiful new (renovated) building in an awesome location! We booked Springhill because of the location, and made it very clear that we needed two rooms and wanted them to be side by side, or at least close, and was assured that could be accommodated. Mind you, we made reservations more than two months prior to our stay. Upon arrival, a couple of hours early for check in, we were told, \"we'll do the best we can, but we had a full house last night\". I somewhat understand, but what did \"last night\" have to do with a reservation made over two months ago??? Anyway, a very courteous bellhop took our bags to secure while we went out for a walk before checking in. Upon our return, rooms still not ready...at 4pm (check in time). We hang out in the lobby for awhile. It's 5pm or a little later before we are finally told our rooms are ready....one on each end of the building!!!!!!!!!! I guess we were expected to be happy they were on the same floor??? Cut to the chase, the A\/C units in this new facility flat sucks, and they know it! We were told three different times in the first 36 hours of our stay, that the one room having the problems was \"at the top of the list\" to be fixed. Never any follow up, and apparently what one staff person told us, never was told to anyone else, so they had no clue! After changing rooms 3 times we finally ended up with rooms on the same end of the building, for the final 4 nights of our stay. I rate this place a 3 because of it's location, very congenial staff, and nice \"looking\" facility. The line of communication among that nice staff, and the complete junk HVAC system deserves a 1 at best.  \nHopefully, they can get it together soon. If my wife and I return to NYC, and only need a single room for ourselves, we will likely give them another chance, but won't consider them again for a family vacation.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location is good, the hotel is new with a very nice lobby and attractive furnishings. A bellman helped us to our room and apologized about how small the room was. We have stayed in many NYC rooms and this was by far the smallest I have ever seen. As another reviewer wrote, we could not walk between the beds and the wall to the bathroom or the door out without bumping the tv. We are both small women and I cannot imagine how a large man would do. It is interesting to see that photos show some larger rooms, even though we were told by the desk staff that there were not. We tried to settle into the room, but there is virtually no place to put anything away and absolutely nowhere to put anything in the bathroom. We were considering finding another hotel the next morning. The air conditioner fan blew nonstop and that night it became clear the A\/C was not working. I called the desk after a mostly sleepless night and was asked if they could send someone to fix it. We went out and on our return, the engineer was in the room saying that we could not stay there because he could not fix it. He volunteered that there was a problem and that we should never have been put in that room. Trying to make a very long story short, we were moved to a Fairfield room in the building with no mention of the fact that those rooms are cheaper.  I also asked if any rooms were larger and was told that only handicap accessible would be, but in traveler photos it does look like there is some variation in room sizes. The  breakfast is fine,  but the staff seemed to be having problems and could not get the waffle machines working right. If you were one person in a single bedded room, this hotel might work out ok.

I was a Titanium Elite and had a late check-out at 4PM on the first hotel. However, I received a notification that my key was ready at this hotel around 11AM. Therefore, we decided to move to this hotel so we can go to Metlife Stadium for BTS concert earlier. This was the start of all the TROUBLES.\n\nWhen we got to this hotel, Karina was check us in. Of course, no status recognition or thank you being a loyal customers which was okay for me because they allowed us to check-in early. She cannot find my reservation and said it was cancelled. It was crazy because I even received the mobile key. I then gave her my confirmation\/reservation number and she found it. We were given room 1406. (The hotel itself was both Fairfield Floor 15 and above & Springhill Suites Floor 2 -14 combined at the same building). I was given the high floor as I was requested before check-in. The room was very small with 2 queens and no complimentary bottle waters which was fine for us. The room itself was clean. However, the AC was off and it was very hot like 74F same as outside temperature. We then turn on the AC and set it to 65F. After 30 minutes, the AC did not have any cool air flow instead it was a hot air flow. The temperature reach 79F and we have to open the door as we are sweating and too hot inside the room. I called the receptionist and she said that she will send technician to fix it now. We wait one hour in a hot room and sweating. We saw the Director of Front Office, Colllin Carroll while she was checking on other rooms and tolh her our concern. She then radio to send to have technician come to look at. After 30 minutes, still no technician. I decided to go downstairs and bring the technician with me. Sal, the technician look at the AC and decided that we need to move to another room as the AC is not working right and have to be pull out. He called the receptionist but no rooms available until 4PM. He let us know that the hotel should compensate us. We hauled our luggage back to lobby to store as we need to get ready to go to MetLife Stadium. We waste so much time just to wait for technician to look at the AC.\n\nI talked to Melissa, another receptionist and ask for compensation. She was agree and offer 5000 points. As we are about to leave, there is another girl who had the same concern and was offered full refund as she talked to the Director of Front Office, Collin Carroll. I then told her about our room too and she also gave us full refund (free stay) which was weird. She then check to see if there was a room available with 2 queens which was not. We told her that we had to leave now and we will get our room when we were back from the concert. She was okay and will get the key ready when we were back.\n\nWhen we were back around 11:30PM, Nema, the receptionist did not have the key and our room still 1406. I requested to talk to Joey, the overnight Manager. He helped us to get our room ready which is located at 1417. He also helped us with our luggage which was very nice of him. The room was located in the corner and have bigger room than 1406. Also, have two complimentary bottle waters. However, the room temperature was 75F and it was very hot. We then set the AC to 65. After couple hours, the room was not getting cold and the temperature raise to 78F again. At this times, it was 1:30AM already and we were sweating like crazy and not be able to sleep. We called receptionist and offer technician to look at the AC. We refused as this was the second time and request for another room. However, they were no longer have two queens. I requested to move to King room better than inside this hot room. The receptionist went up to our room 1417 and gave us the key. She also mentioned that their hotel had been had the A\/C issues.We were moved to Room 520. The room was spacious and have two complimentary waters also. When we entered the room, it was cool like 70F. It was better than previous two. However, as we slept, the temperature raise to 79F again and we cannot sleep and sweating all night.

We did not even enjoy the breakfast as we finally fell asleep in the morning for two hours before we were leaving to Newark Airport. We finally can sleep for two hours because I kept playing with the thermostat. I finally figured out if we set to 65F, it will give hot air instead of cool air. However, if we set to 77F, the AC will start and blow cool air. I assume they connected it the wrong way. However, this did not solve the problems because all the AC was locked in AUTO mode. If I set it to 77F, the temperature will drop from 79F to 75F. As the set point was at 77F, the AC will stop and no longer blowing until we adjust the set point again.

I didn't love hearing people chatting outside my door late at night and early in the morning.\nMy room was perfect for a solo business traveler for one night.  It would have been great for multiple nights.  But the room is SMALL.  I mean typical NYC small, but still it would be tight for 2 or 3 people.  The room has the layout of a typical Springhill Suite room just crammed in.  This actually made it hard to work at the desk, as I couldn't pull the desk chair out far enough to sit in it easily because it bumped against the couch!!  The room has a small closet with ironing board, iron, safe, and there were a couple of bottles of free water.  \nThere were plenty of outlets and USB charging spots everywhere, which was great, and the WiFi was free and very fast.  The TV was HUGE and had Marriott's internet TV with access to YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, etc....\nThe bed was clean, super comfortable, and the AC in the room worked great.  IN the morning the shower was hot and powerful and the bathroom had great lighting.  \nA great bonus for NYC is the free breakfast in the lobby. It's typical Springhill\/Fairfield breakfast, meaning simple eggs, bacon, cereals, yogurt, coffee, fruit, etc... Perfect to start the day and there were two main stations of food to help handle the crowds.  the breakfast staff was very friendly as well. \nOverall I really like this hotel.  I like the Springhill Brand for its business layout rooms and good value, and this hotel did not disappoint, even in NYC!","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was on the 12th floor (Springhill Suites are on the bottom half \/  Fairfield Inn on the top half) and heard no noise whatsoever. Though I had checked in with the mobile app, I thought there would be a separate Bonvoy Elite lane to pickup your keys. Instead, it was long line of guests and only one  staff was working  Saturday night. The breakfast room was huge, serving both Springhill & Fairfield guests. It was a very nice breakfast buffet \u2014 open till 11am, that\u2019s a first to me. Also a first was offering agave syrup and Chobani Greek yogurts, where I have not seen before at Springhill, Fairfield or even Residence Inns. Ivana, who assisted me the next day late check-out, was so professional and very understanding. I mentioned to her that I was supposed to receive a free drink voucher for the hotel bar, per the promotion stated when using mobile check-in. She understood the promotion and offered me the beverage, even though she said the hotel doesn\u2019t honor it. She said she will bring this promo up to management, as she has been approached by this promo before by other guests. Again, perhaps the hotel is still new. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my stay. Next time returning, I will book for the Fairfield Inn room above to test it out. ","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"NONE"}

The doormen won't let you touch the door and I had an employee actually run ahead of me to open a door to the basement for me.  I also saw staff walking around the lobby offering free bottles of water to people who were sitting there.  Excellent location, great employees, and a nice looking hotel at a decent price.

Not only was this hotel so centrally located (steps away from Penn Station and the new Hudson Yards) but it's brand new and absolutely beautiful. The lobby is spacious and modern with a great bar\/cocktail area. There is also a very large breakfast room that includes outdoor seating in the warmer weather. Just beautiful. Our room was well appointed with a very comfortable bed and modern bathroom and sitting\/desk area. The room was also very quiet which is not easy in midtown Manhattan. The breakfast was included and was wonderful. I have never had scrambled eggs that were this good at any other breakfast buffet. I had them every morning. The best part, though, was the extremely friendly and accommodating staff. They made us feel welcomed and comfortable from the moment we stepped in the hotel. I highly recommend this for business or leisure. We will definitely be back!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}
