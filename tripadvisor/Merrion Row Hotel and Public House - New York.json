{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":15115402,"title":"They just got everything right","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-05-16","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"First and really important: the location: steps from Times Square, like the CENTER of Times Square, not (like so many do) advertising Times Square but really next to Port Authority. If you're going to a Broadway Show and don't want to fight for a cab in the rain or try to find your Uber in the ocean of Ubers, this is the place. It is a 10 minute, brightly lit, sight-filled walk from every theater (and every great pre-dining restaurant) you could want to be close to. \nOR if you're dining in Midtown, going to Radio City, Rockefeller Center, shopping on Fifth Avenue? 10 minutes the other way. So the location is perfect for all things midtown east, west, and Times Square. Ideal.\nSecond, this place is NEW and really well-designed, so everything is up to date. The super-thick windows create an unbelievably quiet setting in the middle of everything (and I was on the third floor!) and the doors and walls are solid and safe. The bathroom fixtures are modern and sparkling, great pressure in the shower, the bed and linens are literally among of the best I've ever experienced (and I travel frequently for work). The heat\/AC is quiet and easy to use (no indecipherable buttons or weird clanging). The rooms are THOUGHTFULLY structured, with a logical flow from bed to desk to closet to bathroom (and some can be expanded to accommodate families). And the appointments are great - not flashy or overdone, just really nice, understated wood and fabric tones, with lights you can actually figure out how to use! Very easy on the eyes and ears after a stimulating night on the town. \nThird, you have a wide range of in-house dining options that surprise on the upside. Quick, casual pub food - a great burger or open-faced turkey sandwich in a fun, boisterous setting? Head right downstairs to Connolly's Pub (or upstairs to the incredible roof garden!). Want something a tad nicer and quieter? Maybe a shrimp risotto or fresh carbonara? The intimate and delightful restaurant on the ground floor is wonderful. All basically under the same roof and in each, a wide selection of spirits, wines and (of course) more beers on tap than you can even imagine. And in the morning, you can enjoy a full breakfast, coffee to go, or anything in between.\nLastly, and most importantly, the staff of the Merrion Row are warm, welcoming and gracious. This is a small-family-owned hotel literally in the \"middle of the middle\" of the highest energy zone in the world, but the team makes you feel like you're coming in from the rain to your own quiet country home. And the family has been managing hospitality in New York City for decades; they know how - and genuinely want - to make customers feel like guests.\nI live outside the city and frequently stay in town after late dinners or events. Merrion Row is now my go-to place to stay in NYC. Stay there once and it will become yours as well!","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

I have so many nice things to say about this small boutique hotel. The room was well appointed and very clean. I love the way the hotel was decorated. The sleeping area was small but the bathroom was big. Love the fixtures, the tiles and the bathroom amenities.  I usually don't sleep well but i did when we stayed here.  The bed was very comfortable. All the staff that we encountered were all so friendly. It was traffic on our way to NYC and got to the hotel later than planned. After checking in, we went to the Public House restaurant downstairs. It was a little past 7 pm and we told our server that we have a show to watch at 8 pm. He went to the kitchen to let them know and he said that's fine. Ordered a Lobster Bisque and Shepherd's Pie while my husband got the Petite New York Strip. The food came right away! It was the quickest dinner I've ever had but we liked the service and our compliments to the chef for the delicious food. They were so calm despite the time crunch and very accommodating. We made it in time for the 8 pm show. We were even early. It was only a 5 minute walk from Merrion Row Hotel. This is another advantage of this hotel,  the proximity to Times Square, the theaters, restaurants and to a lot of attractions in the city. Perfect location! We also had the complimentary breakfast the next day which was also good. This hotel was a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. You step inside and it's like you're not in the middle of Times Square. It's so calm and comforting inside. The friendly staff makes all the difference, too. We will be back here for sure. A place like this is rare. It checks all the boxes. Perfect location, friendly staff, very clean and comfortable rooms. You get your money's worth.

I stumbled across Merrion Row while trying to find a hotel convenient to the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade that would accommodate a member of my party who does not use elevators (often a struggle in city hotels).  Just half a block from the middle of Times Square and situated perfectly on the parade route, the location of the property is everything.  \n\nOnce inside, the level of calm on the first floor sharply contrasts all the happenings outside.  Something about it feels almost sacred - it\u2019s like coming back to a relative\u2019s house, rather than a hotel. The property is what you would never expect from a NYC hotel - charming, personable, and intimate.  Little touches, like playing Irish radio stations, made the property feel all the more authentic.  The first floor wasn\u2019t quite a lobby as much as it was a pub with a desk for check-in (which we loved).  The room was quite small (think cruise stateroom size) though the size wasn\u2019t surprising given the property\u2019s age \/ location.  The bathroom was very nicely designed and almost as large as the sleeping area itself.  \n\nOverall, customer service was good - one woman who worked the front desk was especially friendly and we adored the two guys who worked the bar (they had A+ energy and we would come back just to hang at the bar!).  We would definitely keep the property in mind for the future - Merrion Row is a place you don\u2019t want to tell people about so the secret doesn\u2019t get out, but it only feels fair to give the property the love it deserves.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Travelling alone I felt very safe and secure, also having such great local knowledge made my stay there that much more enjoyable. \n\nA standout was the mouthwatering breakfast, lunch and dinner. The chef uses fresh, local ingredients to create a delicious menu - the Irish staples are excellent and always enjoyed!\n\nI also valued how the staff and the hotel owners, Anne and Bernie both went out of their way to ensure my stay was perfect. They made my entire Marathon experience that much more fun and enjoyable. Their attention to detail is unparalleled.\n\nFor an outstanding NYC stay with genuinely five-star hospitality, I can't recommend the Merrion Row Hotel enough. It's now my only choice when I visit New York. \n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

This weekend, we traveled from Ohio to celebrate my wife\"s birthday and see some shows. From the moment we stepped through the door into Merrion Row Hotel, we left the hustle bustle of an exhausting travel day behind us - all to be greeted warmly by the hotel staff.  They really do make you feel like family!  Once inside, we felt the happy embrace of the most hospitable and peaceful hotel establishment you could possibly hope for anywhere in Manhattan.  \n\nThe hotel is superbly convenient to attend all the theaters, shops and activities in and around Times Square and Broadway. We walked everywhere! And after the wild meandering through Times Square crowds and traffic, it felt great to 'come home' to Merrion Row. \n\nThrough the years, we have stayed at other boutique hotels in cities around the country. Often 'boutique'  can imply cramped and stuffy. Nothing stuffy at Merrion Row! It is simply perfect in room design - and we felt comfortable and relaxed in the single queen room we selected. The design of our room was serene, efficient and beautiful.  Downstairs, the hotel  staff is like the surroundings - friendly, down-to-earth, cheerful and eager to make sure guests are comfortable. In the bar\/dining area, the food is tasty and the dining experience is excellent. The outer dining area is light filled and lovely thanks to the glass enclosed atrium. It is the perfect spot to enjoy a morning coffee or evening wine - or even your first shot of Irish Whiskey! We enjoyed several yummy breakfast choices throughout our stay. Plus you can also immerse yourself in a menu of Irish fare at Connolly's - the connecting Irish pub next door that offers a robust Irish\/American menu. \nMerrion Row Hotel has become our second home whenever we come to take in the sites, sounds and experiences of NYC.

The big plus is that it is relatively quiet for a Times Square location (although it's only 6 floors so you get full HVAC exposure). The room is ok, pretty small but acceptable, nothing fancy. The 3 stars come from the price tag ($850\/night with about one month advance booking) and cold reception, one guy on a stool tucked between a staircase and a laptop barely saying hi (I think the only thing he said is \" I need your credit card and ID\"). There is zero soul there, bar was empty, no lobby, nobody greeting you, a corridor, a grumpy guy at the \"reception\" and an old elevator to get you to your room.

My wife set us up for three nights at the Merrion Row, and it turned out to be a great place to stay. \n\nPlusses: There were many of these. The location is great, right off of Times Square. (And despite this, the place was dead quiet.) The bed was very comfy with nice pillows and bedding. The bathroom was a good size with a luxurious shower. Wifi connection was good - my wife did a Zoom webinar from the room. The hotel has a bar and restaurant onsite, and these are both good establishments. We had breakfast every morning in the restaurant and the quality of the food was high. There's an Irish theme, so they offer Irish brown bread, Irish bacon, and a couple of other items along those lines. Everything we had was excellent. The bar was great as well, with some very nice cocktails available. What really set this place apart, though, was the service. Everyone we encountered, from the night clerk to the manager to the waitstaff were very friendly and willing to go out of their way to help. Special shout out to Sebastian in the restaurant. Really a nice guy and a solid pro. \n\nMinuses: Nothing to speak of. The room was small and mostly taken up by the bed and desk, but that's par for the course for Manhattan hotels that don't cost $1000+ a night. \n\nSummary: Great location, good value, quiet comfy room, good bar\/restaurant, first-rate service.

From Shona to Dominic \u2026 no matter who I came in contact with, they were all helpful and kind\u2026friendly even.  \n\nBreakfast was delicious- the best avocado toast!  (I know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026 but yeah, avocado toast!).  During breakfast, a child of maybe 7 was running around (not a fan of the mother for allowing this) however Dominic was patient and spoke to the child\u2026. Even offered a tour of the place if the child sat down and ate his breakfast.  Then Shona came and spoke to the child with the same kindness.  I can appreciate that even if I didn\u2019t appreciate that the mother felt it was okay to let her son run wild.  (For all the parents out there\u2026 she\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s not okay to allow this).\n\nLocation Location Location!  Yes! Everything within walking distance.  And a great Irish pub connected for the most part- I\u2019ll review that place too!\n\nFinally, the rooms.  The place is built like every other old place with charm-  boutique, charming and small.  Bathrooms are large and well appointed-  loved the water fall shower head!  I\u2019m doing a remodel on my bathroom and had already ordered one\u2026 now I know it\u2019s a great choice!  Bed is comfy and so are the pillows- granted I always bring my own, for once, I didn\u2019t have to.  The best part about my room was upon arrival, I opened up the door and immediately was at the bed.  It took some shuffling of luggage and door to get in, however I thought I would look out the window.  Opened it up and it looked out upon - small inner square brick area\u2026 however my window also was close enough to see the window seats at the bar.  I was immediately waved at-  and made friends! LOL. I love that kinda stuff and can appreciate it.  Small, quaint, and friendly place.  How much time do you actually spend in the room after all.  The bathroom is large enough to make up for it.  \n\nWill stay here again for sure!!  Don\u2019t miss out on this gem!","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The staff were very nice. I was upgraded to a bigger king room. So that was nice. The location in midtown is convenient for getting around. However, the street the hotel is on (45th between 6th and 7th Ave.) is pretty nondescript and there is no view to speak of. Also there is a lot of construction going on around there at the moment. The facade of the hotel was covered in scaffolding as well. Obviously this is not the hotel's fault, but still.  When I  arrived in my room I saw that the area around the sink had not been cleaned properly as there was toothpaste in the shape of a toothbrush around the sink (yeah, first world problems I know). This put me off a bit because it indicates that the cleaning has not been very thorough. When I asked a cleaner to come up and clean the bathroom sink he just wiped it with some water and did not even use any cleaning fluid. If you are paying $450 to $500 a night you expect that the room will have been cleaned properly before you get there. Other than that, the room was clean. Bathroom was nice but water pressure was nothing to write home about. The bed was comfortable but the bed had 4 pillows which were all really thick, had no give and were uncomfortable. When I asked if they had any soft pillows for the second night they said \"oh you want down pillows, of course\" I am not not sure why they don't just put them in the room to begin with! This hotel is small and does not have a classic sized lobby. So if you are looking for a traditional large hotel with a big lobby this is probably not for you. The rooms are on the smaller size, even for NYC. Also the hotel is only 4 stories tall so you cannot get a high floor and escape the street noise. There is a lot of construction going on in the area at the moment and I was woken up by the sounds of generators and trucks with reverse alarms very early. Also, the walls are very very thin and you can hear everything in the next door rooms and the corridor outside the room. So when my neighbors stumbled in at 3AM I had to listen to them for the next 45 minutes. It was like I was sharing a room with them. Overall it was fine but I was not blown away, and the main problem was not getting decent sleep either night because of the thin walls. If you are traveling single or a couple it may be fine. A bit small for a family.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I saw positive reviews online for this hotel and based on the photos online and the positive reviews decided to reserve a room here.  The day before I arrived I phoned the hotel and told the staff that I needed to prepare for a meeting the following day so I would like a quiet room where I could work.  I was told that a room in the back of the hotel on the 6th floor (top floor) would be set aside for me.  When I arrived around 1:00 I was told that such a room in the back was unavailable but that if I waited for a couple of hours and came back after 3, I could get a room on the 6th floor.  So I walked around for a couple of hours and came back at which time a very rude man at the desk who said his name was Pedro told me that he had given someone else the last room on the sixth floor and there were no rooms in my category in the back of the hotel so he was putting me in a middle room towards the front on another floor.  When I complained, he suggested that I was lying when I told him that someone at the hotel promised me a room in the back on 6.  He asked for the name of the employee that I had spoken with.  I said I didn't know.  I told him that I was very disappointed as I had been promised a quiet room because of my need to work.  He suggested that he didn't care and that the policy of this hotel was that no specific rooms are reserved in advance.  He said if I paid another $200 he would find me a back room!  I asked his name and he said it was Pedro.  I said that I would report his rudeness and that this was not the behavior of a hotel that cares about its guests and hospitality.  He repeated that he didn't care.  He never apologized.  He then said that he was the General Manager and there was no one to report him to.  Shocked at his brazen rudeness, I told him I would make my experience known on the internet.  He said he didn't care, I should go ahead and do so.  If you want a positive hotel experience, skip this hotel.  Any hotel can have a single rogue employee, but making such a rude and unfriendly individual your general manager speaks volumes about this hotel--  Not to mention that the expensive room I was given was so small that it couldn't fit a desk or chair or closet!  I had to sit on the side of the bed to try to prepare for my meeting with street noise in the background! There are lots of hotels in New York,  avoid this one.

My queen room was great for me but would have been uncomfortable with my wife.  There was not even a sitting chair, so be advised to opt for a larger room if this is important to you.  I expect there are larger rooms better suited for 2 people.  \n\nWhen I needed to work I used either the common area on the first floor-either the front room that is set up for restaurant overflow or the actual restaurant.  By the way, the restaurant is great.  My room included food vouchers which worked well for breakfast. I'm not sure if all rooms include this. \n\nBTW, the restaurant or bar can be a good pre or post Broadway quiet oasis.  \n\nNote that there is no fitness room and no complimentary gym affiliations\n\nPlease don't misunderstand my comments.

Unfortunately, there is no seasoned management on premise and that is a big downfall.

And while we were waiting a gentleman sitting near us in the lounge asked if we were checking in to the hotel, we said that we were trying to ( it was approximately 2:30). He stated that he was part owner of the hotel, and instead of saying he would see what the delay was, he  began \"mansplaining\" that it takes time to clean various rooms, as if I wasn't aware of this?!  At three minutes to 3pm, the front desk person (without checking anything) said my room was ready. \nIf you are a light sleeper or late sleeper beware, the door slamming could wake the dead.

Loved how private it felt and even though the rooms were pretty small, I found them to be thoughtfully arranged, very clean, and well-decorated. The staff, especially at the restaurant were just wonderful! So pleasant and lovely. \n\nOkay now the bad and I hate to leave any negative comments but truly, as another reviewer mentioned, the sound insulation is pretty bad. Especially for a 4 star hotel. The walls are fine, clearly they\u2019ve had insulation added. But the source of all the noise is the doors!\nEvery morning I heard everything from the housekeeping, doors slamming and people talking in the hallways. Starting at 8:00 am on some days. Which made it pretty hard to sleep.  Now if you\u2019re a person\/family that wakes up at 7am anyway to start your day, it\u2019s probably fine. But anyone who plans to have any semblance of a \u201clate night\u201d in New York should probably look elsewhere. \n\nThe rest was wonderful though!

While there were some positives of my stay- entering the hotel does feel like a respite from the craziness outside, we enjoyed our dinner at the restaurant, and the rooms are attractive in design- unfortunately, the noise issue was one of the worst I\u2019ve ever experienced at a hotel. \n\nMy first room was adjoined to another and I could hear a family inside crystal clear through the door. I called down to ask to switch rooms and was moved to a more spacious room a floor up, which I appreciated. At first it seemed much quieter; however, later in the night, I started hearing music and voices from the room across the hall, and as soon as the couple in the connecting room returned home, I could hear every single thing going on in their room. It was even worse the next morning when housekeeping started cleaning. It made for an incredibly loud, stressful, and not restful stay. Based on other reviews, the hotel clearly must know this is an issue, and yet there is not even a white noise machine or earplugs provided. There is also an extra $25 fee charged for things that really should already be included (wifi, water) and an unimpressive continental breakfast not worth the cost. Ultimately, I just can't recommend a stay here.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

I was a little thrown by no closet but the standing wardrobe in the corner was perfect for both hanging my garments and it had hooks attached to hang both my handbags and carry on. Every spot in the room was utilized for both comfort and storage without being overwhelming. The bathroom is very nice sized and again space was utilized but very comfortable.\nNow let me get to the part that really put this spot over the top and that\u2019s the entire  staff.. both hotel staff and staff in the adjoining small  bar and restaurant. \nThe bar\/restaurant area was such a wonderful and welcoming spot to start my day with a latte followed by breakfast, have a latte after a day out and have a wine before I started my evening out\u2026 and I did all three more than once.

Rooms located on the back of the hotel would be quieter. \n\nThe complimentary continental breakfast was very good, orange juice, egg, a small croissant and a small bowl of fresh very fresh fruit - loved it. Other breakfast options are available at a reasonable price. The steel cut oatmeal and vegetarian omelet which I had were top notch. They also offer lunch and dinner. While we didn\u2019t have lunch at dinner at the hotel, but if it\u2019s anything like the breakfast offerings you won\u2019t be disappointed. \n\nHighly recommend this hotel. Would we stay again? In a heart beat. We will be back. This has become our place to stay in NYC.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our hope was to have a nice, local hotel close to most of our planned attractions. Merrion Row far exceeded expectations. \n\nThe atheistic, which I'll start with because that's what you notice first, is on point. From the entrance to the restaurant and your rooms, it feels comfortable, warm, and welcoming. Our room was towards the \"back\" and there was little to no NYC noise. I've slept in many a NYC room in which I awoke to street noise. Absolutely not the case here. \n\nThe staff are outstanding. You can tell they enjoy working here and are happy and helpful. I truly felt they cared and were making an effort to get to know us. The restaurant staff quickly remembered our coffee and beverage preferences. As a former food service employee, I valued this greatly. \n\n The food! The food is fantastic. We ate every breakfast here every morning (the salmon and scrambled eggs and the avocado toast are winners.). We also ate dinner here after a Michelin Star restaurant lunch and it was as exceptional. So exceptional in fact, that we ate all three meals here the next day. New York is full of great restaurants, and this is undoubtedly a hidden gem.\n\n I cannot recommend this hotel enough. I'm hesitant to write this as glowingly as I have, as I hope it stays a bit of a hidden gem, but my greatest hope is that they succeed and we can continue to come time and time again.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

I have stayed at RITZ CARLTON that can't deliver what this beautiful and cozy little welcoming joint can.\n\nAnd I wish I weren't gushing because if you all flock to it, and I can't find a room there, a block and some change from Time Square and everything theatre, I will have to go back and ruin my review to keep all you vultures hungry for a piece of GREATNESS cramping what has become my new digs in NYC on a theatre-date weekend. Location? CANT BE BEAT! \n\nI can't say enough about the people, the food, the ambiance, the room comfort. It's tiny, under 30 rooms. And with little nooks and crannies to enjoy a delightful cup of coffee and a perfect croissant. Or enjoy the Irish breakfast. Or those PERFECT, STUPID PERFECT BREAKFAST POTATOES I'm still craving. Something so simple yet so perfect. Fish and chips? Best you will have, seriously.\n\nGreat service is always a reflection of a great leader. Hug Reina for me. She deserves a high 150 for creating a staff that is as welcoming, caring and happy as the dwelling she oversees. I CAN'T STOP GUSHING! OH TRIP ADVISOR! WHAT DID YOU DO TO US?! No one can really compare to this place. THIS is a higher level of standard","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We were greeted in our room right after check in with a lovely plate of sweets that said Happy Anniversary Tim & Alicia. Delicious and so thoughtful. We then went downstairs for our welcome drink at the bar. The bartender, John,  was very attentive and sweet. He ended up waiting on us for dinner later that evening as well. Dinner was divine and we were sent a dessert on the house to celebrate our special occasion as well. Every appetizer and entree we had was very good, which is not always the case for hotels in Manhattan... They clearly care about their product and service, and it shows. Frank at the front desk was incredibly welcoming and helpful. The manager, Reina, came to personally greet us on our way out after our breakfast at their Irish pub next door to the hotel. We have decided to make this a yearly tradition on our anniversary to come back here and I will certainly recommend this to anyone visiting NYC for any occasion. Highly Recommend.

Won't be enough to hold most adults for a full morning of sightseeing.

It is pumped loudly into the tiny elevator (WHY?) On the first ride up to the 5th floor, we heard a couple of f-bombs, not sure what station or playlist was on at the time. We walked up and down 5 floors after that, mostly because the music was so loud it was assaultive, especially first thing in the morning. We stayed three nights. At breakfast, the music was either 80s dance tunes (such as Whitney Houston -- I Wanna Dance With Somebody), or country or talk radio tuned in from Ireland.

We were there for 5 days\/4 nights. The hotel was beautifully decorated, quaint, clean, cozy, it smelled nice, and the staff was extremely friendly, welcoming, and accommodating. We probably had the most interaction with Frank (front desk) over the course of our stay and he was wonderful. Very friendly and helpful and just a pleasure to interact with overall. \n\nI was equally as pleased with the food. I had the continental breakfast the first morning and really enjoyed it. The second morning I branched out though and tried the lemon ricotta pancakes and the American bacon. O. M. G. Those pancakes were FABULOUS!  I ate them for breakfast 3 days in a row. Ciera (not sure of spelling) was my server each morning and she was lovely.  The combination of the food, service, and cozy atmosphere was a great way to start each morning!\n\nAs for the room itself, it was beautiful and comfortable. I loved the view of the courtyard\/restaurant from our window. The room was also very well insulated from any street noise or noise from other guests other than the rare sound of a door closing next door. \n\nNow onto one of the most important factors for me: the bed was extremely comfortable!

We would absolutely recommend it. From the moment we walked in, Frank at the front desk was wonderful and accommodating, and this continued every day. He thoroughly explained the \u201cUrban Fee\u201d that we were going to be charged and what it covered ahead of time, so there were no surprises. The bar staff (specifically Ciera and Hugh) were super friendly and prompt. It\u2019s an Irish hotel, and many of the staff are from Ireland. \n\nThe mattresses were super comfortable. In fact, my sister (who has a stress fracture in her neck) said it was the best she had slept in a long time, and even asked for the name of it (Casper)!There was lots of lighting in the room, but blacked out for late sleeping, and we loved how quiet it was -no hall noise-and being able to look over the courtyard\/bar.\n\nI had never been in a wet room before and kept looking for a shower curtain or shower door - There\u2019s not one. There was no fan in the bathroom, which was our main issue -with no shower door or curtain and no ventilation, it stayed foggy and damp. It looks like there may be a place for one that just hasn\u2019t been put in yet. But the hot water and pressure were good (takes a while to warm up, but feels great). They brought us a mini-fridge for our ice packs and my daughter\u2019s milk. \nThe breakfast menu was delicious, but the continental breakfast (which is included in that Urban Fee) was a bit lacking. I don\u2019t eat boiled eggs, and that was the offering every day, along with fresh fruit and a pastry. It is a beautiful boutique hotel, so it needs to be simple, not a big buffet. It\u2019s not really kid friendly (which I\u2019m fine with -although Frank was very friendly to my daughter and gave her hotel chocolate all the time!). We easily went next door to Cranberry and got muffins and bagels and fruit, so it was really fine. I recommend this place wholeheartedly and will absolutely tell my friends and book it next time I am in NY. You can beat the location-1\/2 block off Times Square.

This year was my turn and I chose NYC for the location and tickets to \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" on Broadway.  I then did a search of hotels close to Broadway and came upon this little gem.  As my wife and I both LOVE Ireland this was an easy choice.  What a wonderful experience!  Tucked away less then 5 minutes walk from the Shubert theater and Time Square this cozy inn is a true taste of Ireland from the accommodating staff, to the menu in the restaurant, to the whiskeys in the bar, EVERYTHING reminds us of the hotels and inns in Ireland.  The rooms are tastefully done and extremely comfortable.  Now, that being said, they are small in size compared to what some people are used to but keep in mind, your in the heart of New York City!  And also, anyone who has traveled to Europe will tell you as well, the rooms in their hotels are smaller.  They do offer valet parking for a fee, however, be prepared for sticker shock if you drive in.  Do what we did, take Amtrak into Penn Station and grab a cab for the 10-15 minute ride to the hotel.  Food in the restaurant is top notch, AND AUTHENTIC!  Being a food snob I get tired of American Irish pubs trying to pass off \"Shepherd's pie\" using ground beef instead of lamb.  Not at the Public House.  A lovely presentation of traditonal Shepherd's Pie complete with ground lamb and all the traditional veggies and gravy, absolutely delicious.  Their take on a Traditional Irish Breakfast is spot on, though they also add baked beans to theirs, which is more of an English thing.  The white and black puddings are as good as any I have had over in Ireland.  I was introduced to a new Irish Whiskey in the bar that has become my instant favorite, \"Egans\".  Smooth with a slight sweet after taste.  Its the first whiskey I have been able to drink neat.  I can go on and on about how great this little 28 room hotel is but I think you get the idea.  The next time you're looking for a trip to NYC, visit Ireland in Time Square, it will become your new home in New York just as it has become ours.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I have no idea how she's employed in customer service and really hope our call was recorded and reviewed by her manager. I spoke to several people at the hotel who were also really rude and totally unhelpful. I was told they would call me back because they had to answer other calls and hung up on me. Shocker - they never called back. However, the reason why I'm not rating this with 1 star but 4 stars is solely due to 1 person: Joseph D Suarez. He gave me clear cut answers to what I thought were simple questions and in a very professional and courteous manner! He gave me his direct email and gave me confirmations of everything requested.

Rooms on Manhattan are generally small, so don\u00b4t expect any spacious monster suite. But expect a cozy, clean, functional and cool room that will do the job. Comfortable beds and large bathroom. The modern Irish touch, from the staff to the interior, is unmatched on this side of the Pond. I have stayed at many fancy, trendy hotels on Manhattan through the yeras (On Rivington, Bowery, Dream Downtown, Standard etc, and also lately Wythe and William Vale in Williamsburg).

We arrived at the hotel at the check-in time of 3pm and were told that our room wasn't ready but that it should be ready very soon. We were told to wait in the lobby and they would let us know as soon as the room was ready. We waited patiently for nearly an hour without any update from the hotel staff, during which time we saw 4 or 5 other people check in with no issues. I went back to the front desk to check on our room and was told that it was ready. It was a little upsetting to have sat around seemingly unnecessarily. We were really looking forward to getting to the room to have a chance to shower and relax for a few minutes, since we were on a tight schedule and had just spent about 14 hours traveling and going around the city. I tried to make it clear that I wasn't at all happy about having to wait around, but Frank didn't really seem to care. He gave us our keys, and we hiked up the stairs to the room, only to find that the keys didn't work. Someone else helped us get the keys fixed, but it was annoying to have to deal with this on top of the long wait.\n\nThe long wait to check in was especially frustrating because I had gone through the process of \"pre-checking in\" at the hotel's request, specifying the time I was planning to arrive, so that they could have the room ready.\n\nOur room was supposed to include WiFi, but we were never told the password and after the long wait to check in, we wouldn't have had time to use it anyway. Apparently the WiFi was included as part of a $25 \"Urban Fee\" that was tacked onto the room rate.\n\nThe room itself was as expected for the location. It was tiny, barely big enough to fit the bed, but was comfortable enough. There were no outward-facing windows, which made the room a little depressing.\n\nThe room was fine, but based on the awful experience with check-in, I don't think I'll be staying at the Merrion Row Hotel again. It's a shame, because I really wanted to like it.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The location (45th between 6th and 7th) is perfect for seeing all of the major sites in the city and you are a short walk from major subway lines that can take you all over the city.  Easy walk to Times Square, Bryant Park, NY Public Library, Rockefeller center, Empire State Building, Central park, St. Patricks\u2019 Cathedral, 5th avenue shopping, NBC productions, the Spy Museum, and the Plaza hotel to name a few.  The hotel is decorated nicely with high end finishes and furniture that reminds you of an upscale Irish home.  With only 28 rooms, you feel as though you are staying in a lovely, quiet, row house, when in fact you are in the middle of one of the busiest cities in the world.  Many of the staff are Irish and still speak with an accent, they play Irish music and news in the common areas.  The bar is a welcome respite from the bustling city streets to enjoy a pint of Guiness after a day of sightseeing or meetings.  A continental breakfast is included with the room, which is a huge plus (you can also use the voucher toward a full breakfast if you so desire).  The dining area has a glass ceiling which allows for natural light to make the restaurant even more inviting.   Dinner options are basic but tasty, portions are relatively large.  The staff make it a point to know your name and can help with anything you might need during your stay.  The common areas are comfortable and offer a sitting area with two couches and a large desk for small meetings or working solo.  The rooms are somewhat cozy but comfortable and consistent with the Irish row house theme.   The king studio features a pull-out couch bed, and the two queens are also murphy beds so you can put the beds away for more room during the day.  The windows are high quality so you don\u2019t hear the noises below.  We did occasionally hear noise from other guests inside the hotel, but nothing intolerable.  Bathrooms feature marble and traditional tile with gold\/brass fixtures.  I would definitely stay here again.   Connolly\u2019s pub (owned by same family) is right next door and features traditional Irish fare and a rooftop bar with live music on the weekends.

That was honestly the only failing of the hotel if you want to be very picky.\n\nThe upsides are a wonderful Irish themed hotel that make you feel like you are in Dublin (even the staff is largely Irish) and a great location if you are like we were seeing a show. Had breakfast twice and bar snacks and everything was just grand.  \n\nWouldn't  hesitate to recommend to a friend.\n\n","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Merion Row is many things including a cozy atmosphere, clean rooms, delicious food, and comfortable beds.

Because those who often visit NYC can confirm that it\u2019s really hard to find a hotel with good combination of location, service, cleanliness (!!) and comfortability. Especially if you are traveling with three children of different age, from 3 to 17. Combination of all of the above is the best at the Merrion Row hotel. Our next trip to  NYC we will definitely start with reservation at Merrion Row Hotel. Thank you Frank, Joseph and Genna for making our stay so much better.

Would work well for families visiting NY and wanting to be right next to Time Square. \n\nCons: \nLocation: the location on 45th street near Time Square really didn\u2019t work for me - street clogged with tour busses, vendors and pretty dirty street with water dripping down from air cons from above. If you want\/need to be Time Square, this would work for you but if you want any charm from the surrounding area, I\u2019d go elsewhere. \n\nNoise: all Studio King rooms have adjoining rooms (which I found out a few days before checking in), and means you can hear your neighbors quite well. I\u2019m a light sleeper, and I had to wear earplugs after waking up at night. Check before booking about which rooms do\/don\u2019t have adjoining rooms to avoid this if you\u2019re a light sleeper like myself.\n\nHousekeeping: not great. I stayed for four nights, and on the third day there was no bathrobe and no bath mat (staff promptly brought it up once I called), and on the fourth day, housekeeping hadn\u2019t cleaned the drained as pictured. Didn\u2019t see the general level of cleanliness I\u2019ve experienced in other hotels, like straightening stuff in the room properly.\n\nFood: had breakfast for three mornings and tried three different menus - all very very average, unfortunately. The oatmeal was runny, the bread for the avo toast wasn\u2019t toasted, and the omelette was fine. \n\nMattress, pillows and linen: it like the mattress was pretty lumpy (maybe it was the topper that got lumpy?), pillows were too fat and the bed linen (and bathrobe) all felt flimsy... maybe it\u2019s the hotel\u2019s style but it certainly didn\u2019t feel like I was slipping into a great bed going to sleep at night for me.\n\nReading others\u2019 great reviews, I was really looking forward to staying here, but it was truly underwhelming for me for the above reasons.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

However, the standard rooms are tiny, worth an upgrade to get a slightly larger room, for example with a couch which couldn\u2019t fit in the standard room.\n\nHowever, this hotel has a major problem and that is noise, no not street noise but internal noise. If you happen to be unfortunate to have a room with a connecting door prepare to feel like you are sleeping in a dorm with a stranger. You will hear every cough, every sink being turned on, every sneeze, every time they crumpled a plastic bag, everything.\n\nI would have rated the hotel even lower because of this if it weren\u2019t for beyond exceptional service. Always friendly and accommodating they went above and beyond to correct things and after this issue was highlighted they made arrangements so my neighbouring room wasn\u2019t occupied which I greatly appreciated.\n\nIt is very unlikely I will ever stay here again though due to the noise issues. It is unfortunate because this hotel has so much going for it. I really hope they can come up with a solution to their significant noise issues. It should be a high-end sanctuary regardless whether they are fully booked or not.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Being just off of Times Square you are in the middle of all the action and very close to all the theatres if you are planning to see shows as we did! The room was very clean and nicely decorated but for the price you pay and being a 4 star hotel, I think amenities could be better. The standard queen room is very small. It is strictly a room with a bed and nothing else. The bathroom is a moderately good size and nicely done. There is no closet in the room, no mini bar or small fridge and no room to set up an ironing board. While I was at the hotel I did not think there was a full length mirror, but apparently it\u2019s on the other side of the sliding door which we always kept open and so never saw it. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and I did like the decor in the room and of the hotel overall. However, I feel that for the price you\u2019re paying you can get a room with a bit more space and amenities in a similarly great location.

In the morning we had breakfast at The Public House, we ordered different items again. The lemon ricotta pancakes was served with warm maple syrup (heaven), fluffy omlette, avocado toast, thick yummy crisp bacon.. I could go on and on. I do want to add that the rooms were quiet and we could not hear outside noise which was a concern when booking.

We found Merrion Row at the last second when we found out our original hotel would not be turning on the AC for another week - and I'm very glad we did, as we loved our stay. The hotel is beautifully and thoughtfully designed. While the rooms are small (basically just big enough to fit a queen bed), that's not unusual for the area. They make good use of the space and the bathrooms are quite large.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the staff is wonderful. Hotels in midtown are usually just places to go rest up in between work or activities. However, we found ourselves looking forward to stepping back into the relative calm of the hotel and grabbing a pint in the nice pub from barman Karl. We also ordered breakfast from the full menu and it was very tasty. The welcome pints are a very nice touch, though the continental breakfast included in the property fee seemed a bit unnecessary. Just give me free coffee in the morning (there is no coffee maker in the rooms).\n\nThe only thing to be cautious about (and the reason I docked a star) is that the neighboring rooftop bar played loud club music on Saturday night until 2am. Maybe it was just our room's location - not everyone seems to have this problem - but it was quite loud and made it difficult for me to sleep until the party wound down.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend staying here if you need to be in midtown. It's a gem.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Merrion Row BLEW ME AWAY with our Accommodations.  From Check in to Check out we had an amazing stay.  The Rooms are Spacious.  We had (2) Oversized Queen beds... Floor to Ceiling Mirror for Changing, nice desk ... huge Flat Screen TV and a Walk in Shower\/2 shower heads ...gorgeous Bathroom.  Plenty of outlets for plug ins.  Charging devices.  The room was electronically controlled (lights and heating\/air).  The floors hardwood with rug under beds.  High Ceilings; fresh paint.  The air\/heat system silent.  It is a small intimate stay (meaning not many floors or rooms).  The stay felt more like a HOME than a Hotel.  You are just 2 blocks off Broadway and the room was QUIET... you are minutes away from Rockefeller Center; shopping, diamond district...etc.  Great Restaurants; Starbucks across the street..  \n\nWhat set this place apart from the other 2 I've stayed at this year was not only room size\/comfort but The People!  The staff was Amazing, friendly and helpful.  Joseph was instrumental w\/our check in process and getting our bags to room when it was ready.  The Bar\/Restaurant was excellent... lots of great Beers\/Drinks.  Breakfast in the morning was top notch and reasonably priced.  It rained on Sunday and they had large handled Umbrella's for Patron use.  The only slight problem was that I had to print something out and they did not have a business computer\/printer  ...however; the staff just had me send the document to the hotel email account and they printed it out for me while I stood at the front desk.

The staff are friendly, welcoming and were always helpful. Despite other comments we had no issues with noise in the hotel above what you would expect in any hotel. The street noise was also minimal on the 4th floor (we were overlooking 45th street) \n\nIf you are looking for something central, location wise this hotel is perfect. Right off Times Square and close to Subway stations, major attractions and restaurants. If you don\u2019t fancy going out too far the food at the hotel resturant was great and the bar is a nice place for a cocktail or evening meal.\n\nWhile I was happy with my stay, there were a few minor niggles I wanted to mention. The free continental breakfast (which is covered in the tax and service charge) is ok and enough to keep you going for a while, but there is a $3.00 service charge to pay the breakfast staff, so it\u2019s not really complimentary. The biggest criticism for me is the lack of tea\/coffee making facilities in the rooms. Coffee is available in the bar from 7am, but if your up early or, like us stuck on UK time there is no chance of a hot drink unless you leave the hotel (There is a great 24hr deli next door), but 1st thing in a morning you just want a hot drink! \n\nI would certainly stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting NYC.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The beds are so comfortable, we slept like babies, and the tv has a super large selection of channels \n\nFor the fact that you are right in Times Square and steps away from everything you literally cannot find anything better. We walked everywhere and were so so happy with the location, many subway stations right around the hotel. I would so highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay at a classy hotel and really enjoy everything NY has to offer.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We stayed here in December 2018 with 5 rooms on a 2 night business trip.  The staff was very friendly and kind, that's where the good stopped.  The hotel is very pretty and nicely renovated, sure they had a nice architect... but the builder was HORRIBLE!  The hotel infrastructure and facilities are terrible!  Here are the problems:\n1) the walls are paper thin.  You will hear EVERYTHING your neighbor says or does.  I was subjected to 5 hours of an extremely vulgar and offensive encounter with two people that just met on Tinder.  If you are here for business, 5 hours of this crap from 1AM-6AM is the LAST thing you want.  \n2) Anytime anyone takes a shower, in any room, it sounds like there is a motorcycle in the pipes\/walls.  \n3) the LED panel that controls the heating does not work and is also the size of a bright ipad pointed directly at the bed.  good luck sleeping with that pointed at your face. \n4) the \"Closet system\", which is a freestanding tower of wood and metal has the safe on the bottom drawer, but its not bolted down to the round.  I nearly toppled it in the small room, it would kill a small child if it fell.\n5) the beds have super sharp edges on the wood corners.  Tight room, night time, go to the bathroom, gash open your shin... awesome!\n6) Any person walking or talking in the hallway or in any room, get ready to hear and be part of their conversation.  Not one minute of peace!!  \n7) restaurant was closed due to some problem, we had to have breakfast at the Irish Pub next door.  Annoying. \nWe stay in dozes of business travel rooms a year, trust me I know.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Why not a stronger review, then?  Problems I had: housecleaning staff never made it to my room even though I had vacated it from 7:00 am through 4:00 pm. It was quite disappointing not to come back to a clean room after a long day of meetings. The \"complimentary\" breakfast was an insult or a joke, not sure which is the better word. Three stale, processed, supermarket-quality pieces of carbohydrates and sugar and shortening -- a pastry, a croissant, and a mini-muffin that was to my tastes inedible. Questionable \"resort fee\", allegedly covering the breakfast, a bottle of water, and a welcome pint for 2. Of course, I was only 1 person and the purchase price of those items would probably be no more than 5 or 10 dollars, if that, not the $50+ I was forced to pay. I would have liked an in-room coffee-maker, though I wouldn't subtract any stars for that alone. I think they have some wrinkles to iron out.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We loved everything about it. First off I am an interior designer based in Chicago so spaces are very important to me. I loved the boutique style this place had with the Irish charm. Almost all staff had an Irish accent so that\u2019s cool. The staff is all so nice, accommodating, and want to get to know you. The bartenders were fun, witty and made excellent cocktails. They made me feel extra special for my birthday and you could tell they were all excited about the opening. There was a slight hold up with the elevator because it was brand new and a mix up with which room was ours and they apologized profusely, but just sent us to the bar with 2 drinks on them so we had absolutely no complaints. It was the very first day for them, but they had it all covered. \n\nLocation is huge. It worried me to be so close to Times Square, but it was not a problem. You can easily walk in the other direction when you exit the hotel and avoid it completely. The hotel has great sound proofing as well. We were so close to 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Center, Bryant Park, Broadway shows, and not too far to Central Park. \n\nThe rooms itself were adorable and so comfortable. They paid a lot of attention to detail, which I appreciate. The bed was VERY comfortable. I wish I could get those sheets and pillows at home. Since we were celebrating my birthday and our recent marriage they upgraded us for free to a bigger room on the top floor :) A+ \n\nIf you are staying in New York and prefer a beautiful boutique hotel with a great location and a fun, Irish charm \u2014 STAY HERE. You will not regret it. And who doesn\u2019t love Irish accents?! \n","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}
