But beyond that the staff provided the ultimate experience in hospitality! We were greeted with friendly, smiles, and kind words every time we were coming and going.

I've had my eye on staying at this chain for some time now so it pains me to say that our stay was pretty subpar.  The room was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. Understanding that this hotel is located in the middle of NYC where everything is small, but this was shocking. Once we got past the size of the room, we were happy to see a decently sized shower and nice bathroom. Then we got to the beds. One was fine, the other one had such a severe dip in it that made it very uncomfortable, not exactly the 5-star bedding that I read about and was excited for.  To top everything off, the fire alarm went off the second night we were there, certainly not the hotels fault but frustrating nonetheless especially because it woke our 2year old up. On a positive note, the bar areas are very nice. So sad to have to write such a negative review, but this was my personal experience. Looks like many other people had wonderful stays, so still should consider this hotel if this is the area you are looking to stay in NYC.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

On the plus side, the reception staff was great, the bed was super comfortable, and the location was ideal. Unfortunately, sleep was elusive for 2 reasons: 1) The light in the bathroom goes on automatically which, given that it is literally 2 feet from the bed (the rooms are tiny!), meant that both the person using the facilities was forced to be fully awake the moment they entered and the person in bed was also woken up as the light flooded the room. Definitely a design flaw, especially for those of us who get up several times a night... 2) The HVAC was very noisy!!

We were wanting a boutique style hotel on a mid-range budget and this hotel ticked all the boxes. The check-in process was quick and reception were very friendly and always willing to help with directions or suggestions about local attractions. The room itself was small but the majority of hotel rooms in New York are. It had a wonderfully comfortable big bed and TV that was well situated which showed both American channels and a few international ones. The room offered a complimentary Nespresso machine and tea and coffee making facilities. This was a lovely touch and meant that you could have a good quality hot drink after exploring New York. The bathroom was spacious, modern and had a powerful shower too with luxury soaps and shower gel. The room also had numerous power sockets and fast free WiFi which was available and very handy too. \nWe never ate in the restaurant however in the morning they offered complimentary coffee, tea and hot chocolate in takeaway cups which was a lovely touch and set us up well for a cold December in New York. \n\nWe visited the Skybar once however was too busy and the outside area was closed due to bad weather so we didn\u2019t stay, The lobby bar downstairs was nice and we enjoyed a drink there once. \n\nI would return to this hotel as their central location and comfortable rooms means it makes it a great place to stay. There are plenty of restaurants near by and about 15 minutes\u2019 walk from Times Square. \n\nAlso this hotel is easy to get to from JFK Airport by public transport and a short 15 minute from Penn Station where you can connect to JFK which is a lot cheaper and faster than a taxi!","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We requested rooms near each other and were in rooms right next door to each other. The rooms were not \u201cbig\u201d, but had enough room. We had a view of the Empire State Building. The bathrooms were small but efficient - plenty of storage space. What amazed me was how clean the bathroom was. The hotel is 10 years old but it looked brand new.  Very cute black and white subway tile and marble. There was daily maid service and fresh towels everyday (even though we hung ours and would have used again). Since COVID most hotels have skipped daily cleaning. It was refreshing to have our room made up each day. They always left a treat - some caramels, chocolate, or cookies. The rooftop has a great view of the Empire State Bldg. The Spy Glass Bar was lovely - had a honey crisp margarita. Since it\u2019s a bar after 4 pm, no kids allowed, but our check in agent told us we could go up during the day and take pics - which we did. I used to live in NY (on this very block which is why I chose the hotel). It\u2019s a great location - walking distance to Macy\u2019s, Rockefeller Center, Bryant Park, Broadway, Times Square, Central Park, Madison Sq Garden, both Penn and Grand Central Stations and so close to several subway stations.

Ensuite facilities were spotless. \nOnly a couple of slight issues; the lighting could be improved as the further you get into the room you have to rely on two small, weak bedside lights for the whole area. The side of the bed nearest the window is v close to the window so no room for a bedside table to put anything on. Also seemed to be very few plug sockets! \nHotel staff were very helpful, friendly and polite.  We had a meal in the hotel which was also really nice. \nWould recommend and would stay again.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It had many very good reviews and for good reason.\nFrom my experience, I found the staff  very helpful, the rooms were extrememly clean and the location was quiet and  convienient to major attactions.  The Archer is in a business district so on the weekend there were hardly any people there. Even though, I would remind any travelers to be aware of their surroundings anyway, since this is NYC and in my opinion lyfts or taxis are the best way to get back home for safety late at night. \nIn terms of the hotel iteself, there was a restaruant downstairs, unlimited coffe, hot chocolate and water downstairs, room service and a rooftop bar. There were spots outside  to unload your luggage from your car and a parking garage nearby so  you didn't have to drive. NYC is very walkable. Our room had a stunning view of the empire state building which was lit up at night for the holiday season. \nWhatever we needed, the hotel staff was ready and willing to accommodate- an extra blanket at 11 pm, no problem:) A microwave to heat up some leftovers from the Italian dinner we ate and a fork and napkin? Granted. \nMore importnatly, after checkout, I had a disagreement with the final charge from the booking agency and the hotel manager spent a good amount of time rectifying the issue with me in a fair and professional way.\n\nExcellent hotel!

I booked a bit late and explained to the front desk of the reason of our visit and why this hotel but unfortunately there were no rooms available with such view, on arrival , Mr. Scott was not only able to accommodate us to a room with partial view of empire state building but also discreetly learned of our union celebration and gifted us a very nice surprised with a bottle of champagne and candy, this completed the night and stay for us.  Then, noticed through our 4 night stay how friendly and polite the rest of the staff was starting from the repair person encounter  on elevators, bell man, the young colombian waitress name Natalia who was super attentive every time we were at the restaurant to the front desk a.m\/ p.m crew very professional and all represent this hotel extremely well.

The decor is luxury, modern but not with the cold feeling some places can give off. Rooms are well appointed, comfortable, and QUIET! We heard NO noise ever from the street or the hallways in our 10th floor room.  If you use an accessible room for the roll-in shower, be VERY careful in the bathing areas - all the flooring was marble which is gorgeous but you can easily slip using the shower. I didn't let my elderly parent shower alone for that reason which provided us many laughs about reverse roles. \n\nThe service is wonderfully responsive. Our accessible, double bed room, didn't have any suitcase racks or extra blankets. And we couldn't figure out how to turn the AC to heating. Each time we had to call housekeeping the response was less than 5 minutes to deliver the needed items or support to our room. Be prepared that the closet may be one of those half-depth wardrobes with very limited hanging space, and none of it for long hang. But we had two spacious hooks behind the entry door where we used the hangers to put our coats and event gowns. \n\nWe picked the hotel in part for location but also multiple food options so my parent didn't have to travel to dine. There are two - the lobby dining space and the rooftop Spyglass indoor\/outdoor bar. We used both and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the attentive service. Be prepared, the costs are high but that's typical of this quality of hotel and the portions are good so I had no issue with the pricing.\n\nI loved our stay and will look for more Archer hotels in my travels.

I had to wait to check in about 10 minutes after the 3:00 check-in time (the room wasn't ready they said). The room was small but very nice for my four-night stay (no complaints there). The rooftop bar, also small, has a killer view of the Empire State Building. Check-in staff said hotel guests didn't need reservations. When I went up on a Sunday evening, there were no seats available except for a seat in the back corner against the brick wall. Resigned to that, I tried to order several different types of white wine, but they were out of virtually everything. I left and went to a pub across the street for food and a decent glass of wine.  The other night I tried to go up it was closed for a private event so I never got to experience this part of their hotel. The breakfast food was really good and fairly priced (compared to nearby diners). I hate the daily rate changes for being in the same room. They varied from $399 to $659 FOR THE SAME ROOM.  Mysterious algorithm surge pricing is the scourge of travel. It always leaves a lasting poor impression.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

They're friendly, helpful, and quick. I like that they give you a little treat everyday. It's a fun surprise to come back to after a long day. \nTimes Square was just a short walk away so we didn't need transportation to get to most of the things we did and we were far enough away to avoid all the street noise at night. \nThe main problem I had with the room was that we were given one with a connecting room which may have contributed to noise level. We can hear all the sounds in the hallway and we could clearly hear our neighboring room's business conference call in the morning. Also, the AC is a little loud whenever it kicks in. \nI don't like how the door to the bathroom is a sliding barn door. It leaves a slim gap along one slide when slid closed and the lock is a little hard to use. Also, the sink in the bathroom is poorly designed and water usually ends up going everywhere. The faucet is right at the edge of the sink on the side of the basin. The spout is so close to the edge that they had to add an adaptor onto it so the water can be directed into the sink. Our sink also drained slowly so it would fill up a little and we would have to wait for it to drain to continue using it.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Perhaps offer a spare room for guests to change before onward travel as opposed to simply pointing to the toilet and telling us to get changed in there.\nGeneral impression was staff were perfectly OK but not interested in improving our stay or being especially helpful. Room not being serviced was an unnecessary failure and annoying\nThe rooftop bar is fantastic with a wonderful view of the Empire State Building and as stated it is a great location - we tried to walk everywhere within an hour or so just to get a sense of the City. I suppose the real test is would we go back to The Archer...and we would...location, location, location (and the rooftop bar), but we would be tempted to look at other options first (we didn't on this occasion as it was recommended).","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Jonathan was ready with a warm welcome and to help with my bags, he is always on the go and manages to stay on top of it all while be friendly and helpful. Joseph at the front desk is an absolute delight, his professionalism and kindness shows in all his interactions. Salma, Gabby and Tracie are lovely, full of knowledge about what to do and where to go based on what you're looking for. Each staff member at the Archer made my stay memorable and fun. Always up for a chat and always there when you need something. While I interacted more with some staff than others (schedules) the entire team are lovely and the manager Scott is also fantastic. \n\nI was fortunate enough to get an early check in which given the smoke was settling over NY from the Canadian bushfires and I'm asthmatic was incredibly helpful. The hotel was relatively free of smoke during this time as well which was great. \n\nThe hotel is a good size, not too big not too small with a bar\/restaurant downstairs and a rooftop bar with a view of the empire state. The hotel is in a prime location with easy access to attractions and necessities. There's plenty of seating in the lobby and just outside if you need somewhere to relax before you start your day. \n\nThe rooms are clean and very well sized for NYC, full of natural light and a very functional bathroom as well. I love the bedding and want the pillows at home. The room has a coffee machine, fridge and locally sources treats daily which is very cute. There is plenty of storage. I stayed in an empire view king room and would highly recommend the view. \n\nI've stayed in quite a few Manhattan hotels now and this is my favourite. I absolutely adore the staff - do not hesitate to reach out to them if you need anything.

Friendly, relaxed, welcoming, helpful staff. A fantastic location just seconds from 5th Avenue or Broadway - perfect for sightseeing, walking around and plentiful, easy public transport links close by (subway at Bryant Park and the beautiful Grand Central very conveniently located just a few minutes away). The hotel is gorgeous - friends joined me for a drink in Spyglass and it was such an incredible treat - the staff were top-notch, welcoming and attentive, bar staff excellent, we had fabulous cocktails, and that view of the Empire State Building is unbelievable - what a classy and fun New York City experience that was! The Queen Room (my view overlooked a Garment District building full of dressmaker's dresses and was beautiful!) - the room was small but very comfortable and was ample for my needs as I was either sleeping our out all the time. Extremely comfy bed, nice fresh comfortable bedding, there was enough storage space for my 6 nights stay (look for extra little places to stow things..). Fridge in the room is handy to store some snacks and cold drinks from nearby shops. There is an iron & board, easy to use Nespresso machine. Robe and slippers were nice to have. The bathroom with tub was very spacious, tub was good for a short soak and the shower power was exactly what's needed after a busy day \/ before a night out on the town! The complimentary toiletries were very nice, and good to have the large containers rather than tiny individual portions. Hairdryer worked perfectly, and there were plenty sockets around the room (I kept discovering more storage space and sockets up until I was leaving!). The provision of all types of charge cable beside the bed was a very convenient and helpful touch. It felt like a luxurious, relaxed and fabulous place to stay, so convenient, but also just so energetic, positive and friendly. Sitting chilling with a glass of wine or chatting with friend over coffee in AKB was lovely and relaxing, felt at home. I didn't eat here but the food looked first class. My only issue was that the Spyglass bar was closed for private functions on 2 nights I had hoped to visit it again, so was bit disappointed. So check about opening \/ closed times if you are on a short stay and plan to visit the rooftop bar! I hope to come back another time - I would love another f those magnificent Manhattans while gazing dreamily at the legendary ESB! ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

I got a treat left for me every day after housekeeping had been around, Jonathan was really helpful after checkout looking after my bag and getting me a taxi. The only two  reason it's not 5 out of 5, the first it that one morning after a late night out housekeeping started knocking at the door at 8.30am. I learnt to put the Privacy sign out after that and was left alone, but that felt very early. The other was that I'd turned the air con unit off and one night it decided to turn itself back on at 1.30am, i managed to turn it off but was really freaked out for a while.

The hotel has a great location in Midtown, near amazing eats ( try Best Bagel--don't be intimated by the line, as well as this yummy French bakery:Aux Merveilleux de Fred) both recommended by Austin.  Clean modern rooms, wonderful bathroom with rain shower head. We had a two double beds and although it was crowded for three people (this is NY after all) we felt very cozy and comfortable. Heavenly beds and we loved the nightly treats and the Nespresso machine that was always fully stocked. There is a garage available for guests at a discounted rate. The only negative was that the fitness facility wasn't onsite.

You are consistently greeted by the front desk agents when you return to the hotel. The rooms are larger than most NYC hotels. However, the lighting in the rooms is a bit dim an the pillows are too soft and deflate completely. The comforter is thin as well and I don't think it's sanitary not having a mattress cover. My curtain liner had a hole in it and the shower head is missing one of the beads so the water sprays inconsistently. I don't like that they don't provide in room dining; that you have to go downstairs to get the food yourself. I did appreciate how most of the employees were masked. Everyone was kind though check in was kind of lackluster and the front desk agent I dealt with was a bit cold. Everyone else was great.

Its not a 5 star experience (those are impeccable and one of a kind) but its better than \"just a 4 star\" which implies that it was inherently fine. Its very, very good and I'd be happy to return.\n\nThe noteworthy pluses:\n\n-Yes the rooms are tiny, but they're thoughtfully laid out. At least mine was. There's storage, proper room darkening curtains, speedy wifi, strong water pressure and toiletries from Malin + Goetz in the restroom. Classiest small touch was the triangular shelf in the shower, about 6\" off the floor, ideal for resting your leg if you're shaving or for keeping whatever you're bringing in there off the floor. WHY is this not everywhere?\n\n-Very warm and accommodating front desk and service staff. Always pleasant and helpful and when we hit up the rooftop bar with a sizeable group without a reso, they made space for us without a peep.\n\n-Location if you're basing in midtown can't be beat. Situated between MSG\/Penn Station and Grand Central with easy access to Bryant Park\/Rockefeller and all the train lines.\n\nSmaller things that maybe aren't for everyone:\n\n-Towels weren't threadbare but also weren't fluffy. That stood out only because everything else was very cushy. Thoughtful black \"remove your makeup with me \" towel was on the sink day 1 and I happily used it. After housekeeping came the following morning, it was gone. Not a big deal but hate to use white towel for mascara.\n\n-No USB outlets (at least in my room) and only plugs near the bed were on top of the headboard in a very odd spot - if you want to rest the phone or charging electronics on the nightstand, a traditional USB cord is stretched to the max. Not a big deal, but if you're into small touches, searching for that ideal outlet (and coming up short) stands out.\n\n-The room doors slam. I forgot, and closed mine loudly a few times. I heard my neighbor's doors slamming shut. There's got to be a way around that? It woke me both mornings of my stay. Floor noise, however, was minimal. Grateful for that.\n\nBut those are little things. Pros greatly outweigh the cons (thus the want for 4.5 stars) and I'd happily return and recommend to those in search of a clean, convenient and overall very pleasant midtown stay.

The staff are great, really helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Our Empire State view room on the 17th floor had a fab view and was worth paying more for. The downside was the size of the room which even by New York\u2019s standards was tiny. There wasn\u2019t enough space to open a suitcase and the limited storage meant storing a lot of things on the floor. The hotel offered to remove some furniture but that was limited enough as it was so didn\u2019t want to make the room any worse in that respect. The shower room was however a good size but it had the brightest light so if you needed to use the toilet in the night you had to do so in the dark or risk waking your partner up. The door opened straight out onto the bed. \n\nWe visited the bar on the top floor once but all the seats with a view were reserved with no one sat at them. We asked a few people how we reserved a table but no one seemed to know so that was quite odd.

Tracie at the front desk answered all of our questions and was wonderful. There was always someone at the front desk to say hello, good morning, good night, and address our needs. And the lobby bar staff was awesome, too. I ordered food for our room on multiple occasions and I never had to wait to order. Nor did I have to wait long for the food. And that bar was busy! I can't say enough about the great, friendly staff. They are top notch.\n\nWe reserved a room with a king bed \/ Empire State Building view. The room did not disappoint either. I loved having an espresso machine in the room. It was so nice not to have to run down to the lobby for my caffeine fix. That said, I really appreciated the free coffee and water available in the lobby. It really is about the little things - and Archer gets this. \n\nOur room was clean and nice - and ready even though we arrived two hours before check in. It was cold and rainy when we arrived so we were grateful to get into our room. The bed was very comfortable and you can't beat that view. The bathroom was spacious for a Midtown hotel - a nice surprise. The storage underneath the bed was great because like almost all Manhattan hotel rooms it's on the small side - but it didn't feel too small thanks to the layout, storage, etc. \n\nFinally, if you want to be near everything in Midtown, Archer is a great choice. A ten minute walk from Penn Station, it's also two blocks from Bryant Park - which is great for holiday shopping at the outdoor market. It's also close to Broadway shows and Times Square. \n\nI have nothing negative to say about Archer New York. You can't go wrong staying here! \n\n","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was okay- the garage was not too far and they only give us attitude like one time due to needing the vehicle and it being \"parked in the back.\" As far as the actual hotel - It is understandable that it is tight and slim due to conserving space within the city. The hotel was tight, the room was a little tight - should have gotten adjacent rooms for more space but did not realize it would be needed. Room wise - the beds are super firm so not too beneficial for your back especially with the ultra flat pillows. Upon check-in we must have misunderstood as it was insinuated that the waters were complimentary but I did receive a bill for them after check-out. This should be explained a smidge better just for understanding. We did have to request more pillows, towels and blankets- due to a language barrier with some of the hotel staff we kept receiving slippers and robes instead of pillows and blankets. A little frustrating, but we did get it worked out. One of the beds did have a LARGE yellow stain that looked like a previous pee stain, and it did not look like it had been cleaned well as the color was still pretty deep in hue. The one wall was a large window and the cold burst of air coming from it was rather chilly, the window did also have a drastic amount of condensation coming from it - to the point of making the flooring wet next to it. Location wise, it was not badly located to surrounding areas.I don't believe we would be using this one again - but all in all it did the job and housed us for two nights stay.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

It\u2019s a great location - just 4 blocks from Times Square subway and 2 blocks from Bryant Park. Should you need it, there is a pharmacy a 2 minute walk away and lots of great restaurants and coffee shops are also nearby. The street is nice and quiet too.\n\nThe rooms are small (no smaller than rooms I\u2019ve stayed in in London mind you) but, they are very comfortable and have more than enough storage room. \n\nRooms are kept spotlessly clean and are serviced daily. The bed was the most comfortable I\u2019ve ever slept on in a hotel - easily as comfy as my own bed.\n\nThe bathroom is a lovely size with a large waterfall shower and very contemporary fittings; also kept spotlessly clean.\n\nThere are lovely personal touches; a little sweet treat   is left for you each day, for example, locally made blondies. You are provided with slippers (really thoughtful) and a bathrobe.\n\nThe hotel facilities are great. AKB Bar provides a high standard of food and the Spyglass Bar provides not only delicious cocktails, but also  amazing views of The Empire State Building.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, a huge amount of praise is due to each and every member of staff my Mum and I encountered at The Archer Hotel. It would be wrong to single anyone out because all were kind, courteous and unfailingly helpful.\n\nI would most definitely stay here again and would reccommend to anyone visiting. \n\nThanks for helping to make our trip so special.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

So for your patience, kindness and help I want to say thank you. \n\nI experienced a minor issue during my stay and when I expressed this to the hotel, the manager Scott very graciously and kindly responded and resolved it professionally and kindly. \n\nEvery staff member I was lucky enough to encounter was professional and kind.

This placed us on the 19th floor of the hotel with a magnificent view of the Empire State Building in all its glory.  Definitely worth the upgrade for that view.\n\nThe room we stayed in was compact, but had everything we needed, and was beautifully decorated throughout.  As a city hotel, we kind of expected there wouldn't be a lot of room, so be aware of this when booking!\n\nThe front desk staff, and manager, were always on hand, and always very helpful.  The manager on the day we arrived even took us up to the rooftop bar before it opened for a private viewing of the amazing view of the Empire State Building and to take photos.  We were here celebrating our anniversary, and son's birthday, which the hotel made sure was even more special with gifts of sparkling wine, sweets, and even an Archer cap for our boy!  Unexpected, and really appreciated.\n\nThe only downside we felt was that we had been told they had a complimentary continental breakfast available each morning, and were disappointed to find that it was only coffee, tea, and iced water, after being told there would be pastries available alongside these drinks.\n\nThankfully, this didn't take the shine off an otherwise excellent stay, and we would have no problem returning when we're next in NYC","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

And this is a long review, but I'm just so pleased with our time at the The Archer that I want to tell all the details! :)\n\nWe flew in from Pittsburgh and arrived at noon to the hotel, fully aware that check-in didn't happen until 3 p.m. We were immediately greeted by the hotel manager, Scott, and asked how he could help. We explained that we'd just arrived and that we knew we couldn't check in until 3 p.m. and wondered if maybe the hotel could just store our carry-ons until then while we went out and explored a bit. Scott immediately said he could check to see if our room was ready and that if it was, he'd be happy to check us in then. While he checked, he offered us water and invited us to sit in the beautiful seating area by the front desk. A moment later he confirmed that our room was basically ready and that he just wanted to send someone up one more time to make sure it's perfect. Less than 5 minutes later, we got to check in. We were thrilled!\n\nThe room was so, so clean, and it smelled so fresh. Yes, NYC hotel rooms are tiny, but space is really utilized in a pretty creative way in the rooms at The Archer. We got a room with a perfectly framed view of the Empire State Building and a king bed. It was divine. We even had custom sweets and bottle Fiji spring water waiting for us in our room. We were on the 21st floor, the top floor of rooms, and it was very quiet, too.\n\nI'd mentioned when I made our reservation that we were celebrating my husband's birthday, and about 10 minutes after we got to our room, Scott, the manager, knocked on our door, and when I opened it, he was holding a birthday card, two wine glasses, and a bottle of wine in a small chilling container with ice. The manager, you guys. Hand-delivered. Talk about classy.\n\nWe enjoyed our time so much that we decided to stay an extra day. We mentioned this to Scott and the front desk staff, and they said no problem. We knew we probably would have to move to a new room, and we were fine with that. Scott said that on our original day of check-out to just have all our bags packed and leave them in our room and that they'd move our belongings to our new room later that day. Sure enough, later that evening when we returned from a long day of fun, we stopped at the front desk, got our new room keys, and headed to our new room. It was equally as beautiful and clean, and our belongings were tucked neatly in the corner for us. We were so grateful.\n\nScott, thank you so much for treating us like family, for your warm smile, your joyful presence, and your extra special touches. You are definitely made to work in hospitality, as it is clearly a gift you have. On our way back to Pittsburgh, I told my husband, \"I totally want to be friends with Scott.\" And he was like, \"I know, right?\"\n\nTo the entire front desk staff, what a joy it was to see your faces each time we left and returned. Thank you for your smiles and friendly, helpful attention. Tracie, thank you for the great lunch recommendation of The Bryant Park Grill on our first day (this gluten-free vegetarian and her carnivore husband were quite pleased!). And Gabby, what a pleasant surprise it was when we casually set a stack of books we were going to mail home on the counter of the front desk as we checked on our room switch, and you raved about the book on the top of our stack - which led to a wonderful conversation about books! Which we LOVE.\n\nWe absolutely cannot wait to return to NYC and stay with you again. Thank you all for being such a wonderful home away from home!","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

When we got to the room se just swiped the card and the door automatically opened, and a push pad for coming out.\nWe had a tub room and the bathroom had enough room to turn easily, with the usual ADA grab rails by the toilet, plenty room to the left of the toilet not quite enough for a front transfer. A lowered sink and bath.\nDownside, the bedroom is 'compact', with 3 feet at one side and bottom of the bed, which was just enough to get by but no turning space. There was a half length wardrobe and one long shelf for clothes. The only place to put bags is under the raised platform bed, which makes the bed very high, around 30\/31 inches. This made it virtually impossible for me to get in unaided and dangerous as there wasn't enough room for my husband to help properly.\nThe staff were very good and tried their  best to find a suitable room for us but all the beds were too high. We had booked a  7 night stay but they waived the cancelation fee and Scott helped us find a suitable hotel and the front of house manager even helped us move our luggage.\nSo would I recommend this hotel, yes if you are able bodied and don't need much storage space but definitely not for a wheelchair user.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Coffee and tea available in the am.\n\nDrawbacks\n\u2014the room doors are very heavy and I heard other guests coming and going and the housekeepers in the hall one morning opening and closing doors, either for cleaning or for their supply closet.\n\u2014I paid a little extra for an Empire State bldg view, but the main view was the office building across the street. While I could see the Empire State Building in the distance, it wasn\u2019t worth an up-charge, at least not if you\u2019ve been to NY before.\n\u2014when we returned from the theater on a Saturday night we wanted to see the rooftop lounge, but it had already closed at 11 pm.\n\nI\u2019m amazed at a few of the negative reviews here, especially talking about room size and \u201clack of valet parking.\u201d I can only assume these people are not familiar with NYC, especially in early June.

The rooms are small, 1 wardrobe and space under the bed to keep your suitcase, other than that - not much storage space really.  The bathroom was a good size, with a nice shower and decent lighting (most hotels struggle to get the lighting right for women to do their makeup etc) lol \n\nThe beds have to be the comfiest I have ever slept on - they just moulded to your body without being hard like memory foam can be. \n\nThe staff were all so welcoming and warm, loving our British accent LOL \n\nWe ate at the rooftop bar on the first night, and for what we ate and drank, blimey - it's expensive - be warned. lol  For the 3 of us with drink (2 each) and 3 starter dishes and a Tuna dish - it was over $200 and we did have an issue with one of our cards being charged twice, which took almost two weeks to resolve - but it did get resolved in the end.  \n\nWe were left a bottle of prosecco with two glasses (had to ask for another glass and coffee cup as there were 3 of us in the room lol) - but such a lovely gesture. \n\nThe nespresso machine was a godsend first thing.  We were always awake really early so the coffee got us started and we were all out of the hotel by 7:30am most mornings - which worked out well as was much quieter and we were able to see some of the sights before the tourist rush hour :-) \n\nThe hotel is located a few blocks from Central Park (about 10-15 mins stroll) and we walked everywhere whilst we were there.

I really enjoyed staying in the Garment District and being close to everything. All the members of staff we encountered were very friendly and accommodating. The view from our Empire room was amazing and we loved the small treats left in our room each day. Lovely products in the bathroom too and nice touches like the slippers (although only one robe was provided)\nThe downside is that the room is very small - this is of course typical of NY and they have done their best to make the most of the space. However, for this reason I would really only recommend for short stays - it felt claustrophobic staying in there for a week as we did. I would also have preferred a full length mirror on the back of the main door to the room - whilst there are mirrors on the wardrobe and bathroom door, there is not enough space to step back from these and see yourself properly. The room was also quite dusty.\nWe visited the spyglass rooftop bar on one evening, and whilst the view is great we were told they couldn\u2019t serve outside and we couldn\u2019t drink outside which seemed strange and was disappointing. The downstairs bar is still closed due to Covid even now which is a shame. \nFinally, after seeing reviews on here I had made them aware that it was my partner\u2019s birthday during our stay. I noticed this written in our booking notes as we checked in, but nothing was done to mark this occasion which I found really disappointing - I understand completely that there is no obligation to do anything for this, but I would expect all paying guests to be treated the same. \nOverall I would highly recommend this hotel for a short stay only. I felt that we did overpay for this and could have got better value elsewhere.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Centralissimo a pochi passi dalla quinta strada: ha vicino la fermata del metro di Bryant park e in pochi passi si \u00e8 nella zona centrale della Mid town.\nLe camere non sono esagerate come grandezza, sono nello standard americano.noi eravamo in tre con due letti King size, che non sono enormi, ma adattabilissimi. \nNoi eravamo al 14\u00ba piano e dalla finestra si poteva vedere chiaramente l\u2019empire state building. \nIl bagno \u00e8 spazioso, con una doccia grande, e dotato di bagnoschiuma e Shampoo in quantit\u00e0 generose( non i soliti campioncini!). \nPulizia della stanza effettuata in modo corretto, anche il bagno pulito.

It ticked all the boxes: perfectly cleaned every day, attractive decor, comfortable beds with high-end bed linen, fast hot shower. I liked the complimentary coffee and croissants from 7am in the week, and at the weekend, there's Culture Espresso across the street. My room had a view of the Empire State Building which was beautiful. The service was excellent. The room was cleaned perfectly every day and the housekeeping staff left little treats  - like a cookie or a brownie. People like working there, and they go the extra mile. On my last day I overheard Evan, the front desk manager, thanking his team for a great job - clearly he values his team as well as his guests and that contributes to the great vibe. I did have to ask for a high room - twice, when I booked and again when I arrived - and without the view, the room would not have been special.  I did a lot of writing in that room and it made a difference. I also requested and got a late checkout. The room had two queen beds and I was on my own so it didn't feel particularly small. It was very cold out and the hotel felt cosy. There are a lot of boutique hotels in New York. What differentiated Archer Hotel was the vibe and the view. I would stay again, either on business or with my partner, but only in a room with a view.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We could not have asked for more. Jackie arranged for us to stay in a beautiful Empire Suite which had the most incredible views of the Empire state building. \n\nPro's:\n\nThe room had everything we needed, including details like charging leads next to the bed, gowns and slippers and even an an umbrella. There was plenty of storage for a city centre hotel room (with space under bed for our cases) and possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever stayed in. The bathroom was lovely and a very good size and everything was immaculately clean. \n\nThe location of this hotel is perfect for tourists. It's less than 10 minutes from Times Square, and the same from Macey's in the other direction and subway stations on every line in short walking distance.\n\nEvery member of staff we encountered were so helpful and friendly, it's that which really makes a difference to a trip - so thank you to the team at the Archer Hotel. \n\nCons:\n\nThere genuinely weren't any! The was a mix up with out food order in the Spytop Rooftop Bar on our first night which meant our food was delayed. It was a genuine mix up and the lovely waitress was very apologetic and arranged some free drinks while we waited. When the food arrived it was delicious, and reasonably priced for a hotel bar. \n\nI've already recommended this hotel to some clients & friends who are due to visit later in the year.

I didn\u2019t expect to have a room ready but they still offered to check before we checked our luggage with them. We already had plans to check out some spots so it was no issue to wait. When we got back mid-afternoon we were promptly checked in and when we arrived at our room, not only were the delicious caramels waiting for us, they also left a cupcake with a lovely personal note (we had told them we were visiting for my daughters birthday which was earlier in February). The room itself was designed very well, very clean. The bathroom was bigger than expected which was perfect for 2 adult women to have plenty of room to get ready. On the second night of our stay the staff left us another surprise treat in our room. That same evening the staff was super helpful getting us a last minute seat in the rooftop bar for dinner. Always accommodating, always a smile and a hello and never made us feel like a burden.  As we checked out the next morning, Jonathan was again at the door- he asked if we enjoyed the cupcake left for us, which just made me smile that he remembered. He then checked our bags for us while we explored some more of the city and when we arrived back to leave for our flight, there was a cab waiting and bottles of water for the trip. I have stayed in NYC several times but never have I had an experience like this one! We will definitely be back. Yes, staffing was a little short due to Covid so first floor bar was closed which was a bummer and yes, I have stayed in bigger hotel rooms but I promise you that NOTHING about their service is even remotely small.

No joke.  \n\nThe website indicates 197 sq feet yet none of the three rooms the warm and accommodating on-duty manager showed me got to that square footage.  They were all in the 150 -170 sq foot range.  Basically a large walk in closet.  Very small, even by NYC standards.  Apparently their largest room maxes out at 215sq feet.  \n\nAlso, many of the rooms face a dark indoor corridor facing commercial office buildings.  \n\nThe hotel marketing the rooms as \u201ccozy\u201d while promoting the under bed storage is disingenuous and frankly insulting. The rooms are uncomfortable. Especially if you are a couple and spending more than 1 night.  \n\nYes they have nice toiletries, though the one (only) Frette bathrobe in the room is so thin it can\u2019t possibly dry an adult size human. And, they do offer Nespresso coffee pods.   \n\nThe staff was pleasant and professional, and there is somewhat of a cool yet unwelcoming vibe to the overall hotel aesthetic.  \n\nThe breakfast consisted of pastries and coffee.  Only served Monday through Friday currently as their restaurant is still closed.  \n\nThe location is convenient.  \n\nOverall we regret choosing this hotel for our three night  stay. \n\nThe room was just too uncomfortable for two people, even though we spent most of our time out and about.  The extra amenities they offer didn\u2019t make up for this principle and critical flaw.  \n\nOne and done.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

To begin with, the hotel itself is beautiful, clean and in a great location. From the moment we walked in the lobby, the entire staff had genuine smiles on their faces, were personable, made eye contact while talking to us and went above and beyond anytime we needed anything. After finding out it was our first time in NYC they switched our room to one with the most amazing view of the Empire State Building. Each and every staff member would kindly greet us every single time we came in and out (which was a lot), I have traveled a lot and stayed in many incredibly nice hotels, but the staff at the Archer put all of the others to shame with their first-class service and attention to detail. They were invested in us--asking and genuinely caring about how our day was going and about the fashion shows and photo shoots my niece was involved in. They would remember and inquire about something after it occurred. We quickly became invested in them as well and tried to reciprocate the kindness we were shown because we greatly appreciated it. When we left we had made friends with a terrific group of people that we will never forget. If you are looking for a beautiful place to stay, located in a very great part of Manhattan where you will have the pleasure of encountering the nicest and most genuine staff you've ever met, make your reservations now for The Archer Hotel New York--you won't regret it!

If there is enough space to walk around all three sides of the bed(s) in your Manhattan hotel then you've done well. No negative marks from my perspective.

Zentral gelegen an der 38th \/ 6 Avenue\n\nEgal was man an Aktivit\u00e4ten in der geilsten Stadt der Welt vorhat, dieses Hotel ist der ideale Ausgangspunkt:\n\nGrand Central Station, Madison Square Garden, Macys, Time Square, Broadway, Port Authority und vieles andere - alles liegt sehr zentral!\n\nAlleine diese Tatsache hebt das Archer deutlich von vielen anderen Hotels in NYC ab.\n\nGewiss - Hotel kann heute fast jeder, gro\u00dfes Haus mit vielen Zimmern, zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig eingerichtet und sauber - ein Standard wie man in oft findet und eigentlich auch erwartet.\n\nAber hier trennt sich die Spreu vom Weizen, hier beginnt das Archer Hotel sich so wohltuend von der oftmals unpers\u00f6nlichen Konkurrenz abzuheben. Es sind die vielen Kleinigkeiten, die Aufmerksamkeiten, das immer zuvorkommende Personal im Haus. \n\nDie  Mitarbeiter im Archer verstehen es den Gast zu verw\u00f6hnen, ohne auch nur im Ansatz aufdringlich zu wirken!\n\nBeispiel: In 14 Tagen Urlaub immer wieder vergessen Briefmarken zu besorgen, die Leute am Frontdesk haben das zuf\u00e4llig mitbekommen. \n\nGib uns die Karten, wir erledigen das f\u00fcr dich. \n\nSendungen von Amazon wurden geliefert, ohne gro\u00dfe Worte wurde uns alles in Zimmer gelegt. \n\nJeden Tag irgendwelche Aufmerksamkeiten wie Kekse oder mal nen kleinen Kuchen aufs Zimmer bekommen. Wow - Spitzenklasse\n\nIch k\u00f6nnte die Liste wahrscheinlich noch um ein vielfaches erweitern, dies allerdings w\u00fcrde den Rahmen sprengen. Die Zimmer werden wie immer gr\u00fcndlich gereinigt, es ist einfach perfekt.\n\nAm letzten Tag bekamen wir dann vom Chef pers\u00f6nlich einen Extra Late Check-Out weil unser Taxi zum JFK Airport erst um 16.00Uhr abfuhr!\n\nDie kr\u00e4ftigen Jungs von der T\u00fcr \/ Security waren allesamt ein  Gewinn und trugen ebenso zur Wohlf\u00fchlatmosph\u00e4re bei! Schade dass die Tage immer so schnell vergehen!\n\nF\u00fcr mich steht abschlie\u00dfend fest: Archer Hotel NYC oder nichts!\n\nF\u00fcr mich dass Hotel in NYC!  \n\nIch hoffe Ihr bleibt gesund! ich freue mich schon wieder auf meine n\u00e4chsten Aufenthalte in 2022!

The room was a little smaller than we would have liked, but it had a comfortable bed and bedding, and nice finishes and amenities (nespresso coffee machine, robe, slippers, daily chocolate treats). For a midtown Manhattan room on the 19th floor the room was relatively quiet and dark at night. Most of the noise came from the elevator shaft (our room was next to the elevator), and the very LOUD AC unit. Luckily we were able to turn off the unit, because we were unable to control it on the wall thermostat. One cannot sleep with the AC noise or air blast hitting you in bed at night. The view of the Empire State was phenomenal and worth the extra charge. The Spyglass Rooftop Bar was also nice, but they do close at 11:00 pm so don\u2019t get there too late. We were never able to enjoy breakfast at the hotel because it was only served until 9:00 am and we were there on vacation.

As the bride and groom, choosing Archer Hotel for our hotel block was the BEST decision we made. Jackie was our point person throughout the process. We had one call and she immediately understood  my vision. I had 5 ladies (including me) getting hair and make up done by 2 stylists in the hotel room. Jackie informed me about the size of the room and suggested putting me in an additional room to give everyone more space. This was the best idea and I had more than enough room to do hair\/makeup and get dressed in the other room. \n\n When we arrived, Evan was at the front desk and was ready for me to arrive. He knew me by name and took every opportunity to provide the best service I\u2019ve ever had at ANY hospitality establishment!! We had too many things to bring over from New Jersey and had to make 2 trips. I left Evan with my wedding dress, the groom\u2019s suit, my mother and sister\u2019s dresses, our wedding favors, and welcome bags. He knew exactly what to do and had my welcome bags staged at the front desk while having all the other items brought to the room. When I got to my room, the gown was hung up perfectly, my mother\u2019s and sister\u2019s dresses were gently placed on the bed as to not get wrinkled in the dresser.  \n\nBy the end of the stay we new almost everyone\u2019s names.

I wanted two rooms connecting, and I had to make two separate reservation the agent wouldn\u2019t make two rooms in one name even though I was the person paying for both rooms. I called prior to arriving to confirm connecting rooms but when I arrived they told me there was a note in the file that I had called specifically not to have connecting rooms. That issue was sort it out. It was as if the hotel was trying to be a casual hip experience.  Also at check-in I had to check-in for each room again even though I was paying for both rooms and they were both in my name they insisted that I check in for each room individually. Then one of the front desk people said that\u2019s how they did it in Disney where she worked before.\n\nI won\u2019t recommend this hotel again even though it\u2019s in a good location. There are plenty of other options available at that price. Plus they must have told me three times the checkout time is 11 AM and then I had to be out of the room by that time. But never did they offer any option that I could extend my check out even if it cost more.\n\nWhen I made the reservation I asked specifically if there was room service in the hotel I was told yes, but  when I arrived I was told there was no food service but I could go to the rooftop bar and get some snacks or buy them from the snack bar in the lobby. \n\nThere was no sense of real service for what professes to be a four and five star hotel. It felt like everyone had just started their first week at the hotel in the service industry and wasn\u2019t quite sure how to treat people.\n\nWhile the rooftop bar is absolutely beautiful with the incredible view of the Empire State building, the food selection leaves a lot to be desired. Check out the menu before deciding if you want to go there. It was great for a drink but I wouldn\u2019t recommend the food. \n\nI checked out on Saturday more than 24 hours ago and I still don\u2019t have a copy of my bill. I called the hotel and asked for a copy of my bill and they told me it was a clerical error. Then they tried sending me the bill and it took three times for them to get the right bill to me.

NYC was just opening up during that period.  Relevant observations:  #1, The Staff is great -- helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, professional.  This includes the front desk, security, room cleaners and people working at the rooftop bar.  #2, Great location -- 2 blocks south of Bryant Park, 4 blocks north of the ESB, 2 blocks from Times Square.  We also walked north to Central Park, south to Union Square, and west to the Highline, all no problem.  Your walking range is, of course, personal preference.  We felt comfortable walking to many of the sights in midtown.  We took the ferry from the 34th St. pier down to Wall Street and cabbed elsewhere.  #3, the rooftop bar -- The Spyglass -- is outstanding.  great view south to the ESB.  There was always a line waiting to get in.  But, as a guest, you get in whenever you ask.  So that's an extra benefit.  #4, price appears to be below the average for the equivalent hotels in the area.  That's just my estimate based on surveying other options.  It seemed like we got a very reasonable rate.  I have one other comment that really shouldn't be construed as a criticism:  the rooms are not huge.  The rooms are clean and set up well.  Just not spacious.  But we were comfortable, and we were visiting NYC so we didn't spend much time in the room.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

While the rooms are small (I booked a King room, and the bed nearly touched both sides of the room), that isn't unexpected for NYC. I'll definitely stay at this hotel again next time I'm in New York, as long as it doesn't get too expensive.\n\nThe hotel was very clean, bed was soft and comfortable, and the AC worked without issue. Everything in the room worked and was in good repair, including the TV, phone, wifi internet, Nespresso machine, blinds, lights, etc. The room and hotel in general felt very well maintained and professionally run. I also appreciated they had a little fridge I could store drinks in, and the welcome note with candy was a nice touch.\n\nThe staff were both friendly and professional, and they offer a bag check in case your flight doesn't align well with the check-in\/check-out times. They have a rooftop bar called Spyglass or Spy something (I forgot the name). I noticed every night, a line forms outside of the lobby of people visiting the bar, so it's quite popular particularly since it has a perfect, unobstructed view of the Empire State building. I'm not sure if I broke the rules, but I went up there one night randomly, and the host graciously sat me without a reservation when I told him I was a hotel guest-- so it appears they give priority to hotel guests. The bartenders were friendly and knew what they were doing.\n\nBecause of COVID, I was disappointed that the downstairs lobby bar\/restaurant, room service, and daily housekeeping were all closed; however, I asked for housekeeping service on my second day since my trash was overflowing, and they came up and took care of it and quickly vacuumed for me\/got me fresh towels and shampoos\/soaps\/etc. I'm hoping when travel picks up, the hotel restores its daily housekeeping, opens the restaurant back up, and offers room service again.\n\nAgain, I had a very enjoyable stay-- my only regret is that I didn't stay at this hotel when I first arrived in New York (I had a bad experience at another nearby hotel and had to switch hotels).","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

We are staying out East between apartments during the pandemic so we need hotels when we visit the city. This our second such trip and we chose the Archer because our first hotel experience was subpar on every level and the Archer was very highly rated. \n\nThe reviews for the hotel stressed how amazing the service was, how clean the rooms were (a must have especially during a pandemic), how small the rooms were and how lovely the upper floor views were. Absolutely accurate. The staff was extremely thoughtful, friendly and accommodating during our stay (5 nights in two rooms). They remembered our names and always greeted us with a smile and asked if we needed anything. Despite the fact that most amenities were unavailable (but reopening soon) and we opted out of any housekeeping, we were still comfortable as we were provided with anything we needed. The rooms were indeed small but very well appointed and clean. There were quite a few nooks and crannies to put stuff in and you can store suitcases under the bed. We experienced several floors and the Empire State views from the top floors are wonderful. \n\n38th street is not the most exciting but the Archer and two nearby hotels have roof tops. Bryant Park is great and only two blocks away. Rockefeller Centre and Fifth Avenue shopping are also very close and Central Park, and Times Square\/Theatre District are also walkable. \n\nBy far though, the biggest plus was the service. The four of us are picky (and spoilt) and yet we all agreed that the Archer provided the best service we have experienced in NY in a very long time.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Of course the location of this hotel is prefect - in the heart of the City - blocks away from Times square. Of course any hotel stay right now during Covid is going to be unusual. The hotel did not have housekeeping. In order to get anything, you would have to call down and go pick it up. It was okay for us because we were only there for one night but if staying longer, it would be a drag not having anyone make up your bed with fresh linen or clean your bathroom. Also, their rooftop restaurant is closed because no dining inside allowed. Again, ok for us as we were only there for the night, and there is so much in the way of dining and bars very close by.  Bathroom and shower were great. Clean and modern. The bed was super comfy. Loved it. However, we didn't have a top sheet - just the fitted sheet and the comforter. Strange. Didn't like that.

The most important thing to me was cleanliness and on this, the Archer completely failed.  There were visible urine stains on the toilet, which were disgusting and completely creeped me out.  If the cleaners missed those, then they obviously didn\u2019t do a thorough or complete cleaning job, and that made me very nervous about the possible presence of Covid-19 both in the room and in the hotel more broadly.\n\nIn addition, there was no hot water in the first room I checked into due to a problem with the valve, and the second room only had lukewarm water.  I had hot water on the second night after I complained again.  That shouldn\u2019t have happened.  \n\nAlso, the neighborhood is not very good, and the restaurants the hotel recommended appeared to all be lower-class tourist traps.  If this is your first time to NYC and you\u2019ve visited to see Times Square and Broadway, then you might not mind and these places might be economical, practical choices, but given what wonderful food New York has, this was such a shame.  The hotel may know that their clientele prefers these type of restaurants, but I definitely don\u2019t.  Fortunately, I knew where to go for better food, but it\u2019s not to be found in the vicinity of the hotel. \n\nAnd finally, I checked out in person so that I could communicate these points, but the person who checked me out didn\u2019t bother to ask me about my stay.  She just brusquely informed me that I\u2019d receive my folio by email.  Par for the course.  It\u2019s a shame, because my room was large, quiet, and nicely designed.  But the hotel is a low-class establishment, and I won\u2019t be back.  \n\n","travelDate":"2020-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

I have the proper expectations as city hotels are generally old and very small, but even so, there are some that just do it better than others, and the Archer is one of them.  We had a Classic King room with a view of the Empire State Building.  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom quite well done.  The Archer's location also can't be beat.  We were within walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go.  By booking directly with the hotel, we received a small credit, which we could have applied to the room or other room charges.  Since it was during the holidays, the hotel was collecting donations for Toys for Tots and gave us the opportunity to put that credit toward the toy donation, which we found to be a very nice touch.  I would certainly stay here again if not for my innate curiosity of other hotels.  I will recommend to others.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

And when my car was brought back to the hotel the next day (I was told I should call for it 30-45 minutes prior to needing it), it came back much sooner and was left in front of the hotel with key inside- and no one collected my valet ticket or was around when I went outside for it.

It is close to Times Square (if that's your bag; it's not mine) so you can access the touristy stuff, but far away enough that it's not oppressive. It's close to Bryant Park, a short walk from Union Square, and doable to Soho if you like to stroll, which I do. Lots of great coffee shops located close by, and even though the hotel offers free visits to surrounding New York Sports Clubs, there is also a SoulCycle and a few yoga studios close by as well.\nThe staff are friendly and not fake. From the doormen to the front desk to the housekeeping, it seems that they are happy to host you. I handed out some customary tips, and people were super appreciative. Valet parking is simple and the cost is in line with other hotels in NYC. The rooms are small (like most hotels in NYC), but there is underbed storage which is nice if you want to unpack your stuff. The bathroom showers are big and super clean. Nice toiletries as well. Free water when you check in and out, and while I dislike plastic bottles, since NYC has not advanced to the level of many European cities with free water bottle filling stations, water bottles are a necessity. Oh, America. How much we waste. I digress.\n\nSpend the extra money for the city view. My kid was entranced watching the Empire State Building light up at night. \n\nAll in all, a lovely experience at the Archer.

Culture coffee across the street was perfect as was the steak house in the hotel. Well Done Archer. ","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Check in was very efficient, with very friendly staff.  Our room was nicely designed, nice bathroom.  The room was very clean upon our arrival, and the beds were comfortable.\n\nThis is a great boutique hotel, with a wonderful location that is close to many subway lines.  We were up on the 19th floor, and this is a very quiet hotel.  We didn\u2019t hear any noise from housekeeping banging around in the morning, traffic sounds, nor did we hear noisy neighbors.  \n\nThe slippers and local treats are a nice touch.  The Empire State view is really great \u2014 just like the pictures.  \n\nWe were very disappointed with the restaurant. We had room service from Charlie Palmer restaurant twice:  one of the breakfast items was incorrect, and we ordered a dinner where the salmon came up undercooked when I requested a specific temperature.  They did send up a second one.  My husband spoke with a manager who said they would take the salmon off the bill, but never did.  I thought the food at the restaurant was just ok. There is a real breakdown in communication when placing both orders; the girl I placed our orders with did not get either of our orders correct.  0\/2.\n\nThe size of the rooms have been an issue for many.  Read the print.  Expect your room to be roughly about the size of a cruise ship room.  We didn\u2019t have any problem with it and found it to be quite cozy.\n\nOne problem with the room:  we had a very hard time regulating the temperature in our room.  It would either be too hot, or become like an ice box.  It almost had a mind of it\u2019s own.\n\nThe price of the room is great for what you get.

The Epic Birthday Dinner for my wife that the staff arranged prior to check in? The spotless room, the swift checkin\/out with a smile?  Maybe the bellstand and concierge team that anticipated my every move? It's hard to pick one, but let's start with the hotel. \n\nPerfect location, very fairly priced for services you get! If you are new to Archer brand, shame on you, but you are now welcome. Hopefully after reading you will be a fan as well. \n\nGranted there are literally hundreds of hotels in NY to stay, but there are a few that truly get it right, at every turn. This hotel (as well as every other Archer brand in other cities I've stayed at) truly knows how to cater to their guests. They value you and not just your money. \n\nEx. Nathan at the desk and Jacob did not stop at helping us pick the perfect location for drinks and dessert one night. They must have called 15 locations to ensure there was not a private holiday party prior to us walking out their door. Most hotels would give you a name and send you on your way.\n\nMy wife loved the little carmels that you get in your room at check in. Though they sell them in the lobby, when my wife raved about them to the FD team, 10 minutes later a knock at the door with a bag filled with a few more just to say good night?! \n\nThe special birthday dinner we had in their restaurant was top notch! The steaks were perfectly cooked, and my wife is a tough critic when it comes to her filet, and it was perfect. The staff in the restaurant was awesome. I did not get all the names, but Precela? & Mario were fantastic! Kudos to the chef as well!\n\nI could go on and on with examples like this throughout our stay, but I think you get the point. If you stay somewhere else, you might be doing yourself a HUGE injustice.  \n\nIt's really difficult to beat what this hotel and team have to offer for your special NY visit.

I had messaged the hotel to inform them that it was my Husbands 50th birthday and we were met with a birthday greeting and champagne and cake in the room which was a lovely touch. \nThe room itself although small was very well planned out with plenty of under bed storage for cases meaning you don\u2019t have issues with the low amount of space around the bed. Again we opted for a room with a view and were certainly not disappointed. Being able to clearly see the Empire State Building from bed is amazing. We were on the 21st floor so we had uninterrupted views of the iconic landmark equal to what you have on the rooftop bar a floor above. \nThe Kingsize bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of sockets available for gadget charging etc. Great bathroom with a spacious shower and plenty of amenities available. The in room WiFi was good with no issues for speed etc. \nThe room was also reasonably quiet with the occasional noise from neighbours arriving with kids but no issue at all between rooms. Being a little further away from the lift is probably a worthwhile request as you do hear it if close although to be fair this stopped at a reasonable hour. \nHousekeeping and turn down services were all faultless and again helped to make our stay very comfortable.

We would like to say a special thank you to Eddy for looking after us, to absolutely lovely Brielle - still working on our cab hailing skills! - and to the Maestro behind the bar, Adam, who invents and mixes the most wonderful cocktails for the Archer! \n\nThis is an excellent hotel, and we will not hesitate to book again when we come back.

However, I have only given it 4 stars and not 5 because we had breakfast one morning in the hotel and I was not overly impressed with it.  I had Eggs Benedict, which was $13, a reasonable price for NY.  However, a cup of coffee was $6 and juice $5, and it was sub-standard.

Concierge took our cases, reception was very efficient and informative. Nothing was too much trouble and so friendly. We had asked for a room away from the lifts and we were put in room 709. It was tucked away in a very quiet corner as requested. Huge bed in a small room, beautifully decorated. There's not much in the way of cupboard space but \"enough\". Great bathroom and shower good quality accessories. Nice coffee machine with complimentary coffee & tea. The bed I have to say was just the most comfortable I think I have slept in anywhere, magnificent after a long day treading the New York streets! Now for breakfast - Mrs had continental beautiful selection all fresh and tasty with free tea and coffee. I opted for Avocado toast with 2 poached eggs simply lovely oh and a pot of tea $6!!! So we had breakfast in hotel each morning of our stay and it was beautiful. We also ate 2 nights at the hotel and again the food and service were wonderful. The Hotel is in a great location just a stones throw from most of the attractions and quiet enough to sit outside and enjoy a coffee. I cannot recommend this hotel enough it was perfect for our 5 night stay.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}
