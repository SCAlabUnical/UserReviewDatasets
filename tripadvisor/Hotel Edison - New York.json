This hotel is a New York classic set in the heart of Times Square. There is a lot to love about this one of a kind property- the location, the art deco decor, the restaurants-Friedman\u2019s, The Rum House, Bond 45- the rooms, the gym and the list goes on and on- but what really sets this hotel apart is their top notch hospitality. I live in NYC, but I send all of my out of town guests to stay at The Edison, because I KNOW they will be made to feel welcome in a city that can sometimes be unwelcoming. \nI have to call out one individual by name, who just always goes above and beyond to make guests feel welcome and handled- Rommel Gopez. Rommel is always making everyone feel special, whether remembering a name or sharing a friendly word- and I have to mention the Edison Wine Hour! The last time I had friends staying at the hotel, they had cast members from the Barry Manilow\u2019s Broadway Musical \u201cHARMONY\u201d performing! WOW!  \nNeedless to say I will continue to send my friends, family and colleagues to stay at The Hotel Edison! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

WiFi is one of the things included in the $40 extra per day package you are made to pay for, great if you can get it to work, very intermittent. Go to the Rumhouse for a drink, great atmosphere and the cocktails are amazing if you can get one. Felt so sorry for the lovely lady running around trying to serve everyone whilst her supervisor shuffled glasses around. She really tried her best.  Food was ok no major issues but nothing to get excited about. In summary don\u2019t let the hotel website fool you by its pictures and write up it is a low 3* hotel at best defo no where near a 4*","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location was actually perfect, but the hotel was terrible. Let's start with Valet -- guys are friendly and kind, but website states $85 for large vehicle (Large SUVs or trucks) -- when we got there, they charged us $95 because we were in a Ford F-150 and they said it was considered a larger than large vehicle -- I guess a large vehicle takes up 2 spaces rather than just 1 like every other parking lot in America (insert sarcasm here). We arrived in the morning and I just wanted to leave our bags with the bell captain since I knew check-in wasn't until 3pm. I went up to the rudest reception I've ever encountered. I've honestly never seen a ruder reception staff in my entire life and we travel a lot and globally. She told me that room wasn't ready, which I already figured, and that they would text me when it was ready. OK, no problem at all... we left at 11am and went on about our day. Came back at 4:30pm and I went up to the unfriendly reception area again and told another rude staff member that I had already checked in that morning, but never received a call or text that our room was ready. She was annoyed at me and HAD to see my license and credit card AGAIN and finally gave us our room keys. We went up to our room and it was just terrible. The bathroom was ridiculously small - again, this is a room for 4 adults. No counter space for anything. There was no mini fridge in the room -- my father is diabetic and needs to keep his insulin refrigerated! What hotel doesn't have a mini fridge -- even something tiny?? I couldn't even believe it. Then the darn air conditioner sounded like an old lawnmower that wouldn't crank every single time it went off. We literally were kept up all night with the noise!!! (Room 1635) How is this even possible when we paid almost $600 for one night????? THEN, I paid for the breakfast included rate only to find out that breakfast was ONLY grab and go and you'd be charged if you wanted to sit and eat AND even though I clearly booked a room for 4 adults, we were only allowed 2 breakfast items for 2 people.... WHAT??? How much can you seriously nickel and dime people? I didn't even bother with them anymore and went to Friedman's for breakfast with my family. Terrible birthday accommodations!!","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel location is perfect for catching shows on Broadway. The staff was nice and we enjoyed the evening wine hour on Friday. The room left a bit to be desired. We were in 1912 -- the 19th floor looked much more outdated than some of the floors we saw on the way up the elevator. Maybe it hasn't been renovated yet? The room itself (Standard King Suite) would have been fine but the pull out sofa bed (our two kids were sleeping on it) was missing a bunch of attachments holding the bed to the outside frame. We assumed it wouldn't be really comfortable (they never are) but didn't expect broken. Our bed (king) could have used a new mattress and quite a few of the drawer fronts on the bedroom dresser were held together with dark tape. The window screen was broken too -- sounds nitpicky, but when you take all of these odd \/ broken things together it feels a bit rundown. The price was reasonable for the area but not cheap.

(Room 223) It was nothing like the photo's that were advertised. It consisted of a tiny box room at the end of a long dingy corridor, with a bed that you could barely walk around and the smallest bathroom I've ever seen.   \nWe did speak to a man on reception (I wish I had got his name because he was excellent) who offered us an upgrade to a suite (Room 831).  We did have to pay an additional $229.50 for this but it was worth it as the room we were given was huge. It had a large bathroom, separate lounge with sofa, chairs, coffee table and tv, a huge bedroom with an enormous bed and tv, Air conditioning in both rooms, fridge, robes, coffee making facilities, hairdryer, extra pillows, safe etc.  It was absolutely lovely and made our stay extra special.  \nIt was just a shame that we had to pay twice for an upgrade. \n\nMy other gripe with Love Holidays is that on booking we had also paid extra for the 'Bed and Breakfast' option.  Once we reached the hotel, we discovered that we had to pay a daily 'Facility Fee' ($40 plus taxes) which included the Grab and Go breakfast.  So why Love Holidays offered us an upgrade to include breakfast (at additional cost) is beyond me.  We asked the staff about it and they too were baffled. \nThe grab and go breakfast was basically a coffee and a pastry (or $6.50pp to sit down and have breakfast with not much more choice on the menu) so we actually didn't use that at all anyway and headed to Juniors every morning.  \n\nBut this review is about Hotel Edison...\nOver all the Hotel was great.  Very old fashioned but that was to be expected with the theme of the place.  \n\nIt was clean, comfortable and the hotel staff were very good. \n\nThe location is amazing.  A stones throw from Times Square and just a short walk to Central Park.  Pretty much everything is in walking distance or a short train ride away.\n\nNB: there is no roof terrace (Again shown in the photos) :(\n\nWould we stay here again? Yes.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

First of all, this is not actually included in the booking formula formulated as \u201cbreakfast included\u201d.  This actually only gives access to a sit-down breakfast, the rest requires payment with little choice at a relatively high price.  With the exception of the waitress Alisson who was very good and attentive to her guests, all of the servers are not particularly well trained and act a little disorderly leading to waiting times and reformulations of  identical wishes to each of them.  Finally, it is not up to the standards of the hotel to make hotel guests wait in the corridor to get a table for breakfast when several tables are actually free.  Management and reception at this level need to be reviewed at least by distinguishing between hotel guests and external guests.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"NONE"}

The two restaurants, Friendman's and Bond 45, were nice surprises; recommend making reservations on OpenTable because they're always packed. \n\nNot all is perfect. We reserved a \"King Terrace\" room based on the description on their website and, sadly, reality did not match the picture nor the description. There is a terrace, but the door to it is locked and the room was really quite small (the one in the picture shows much more walking space in the room than we had). Since this was our first stay, I'm hoping that other forms of the terraced rooms are closer to the picture. Also, the picture shows three sets of windows - our room had two but one had an air-conditioner unit in it. There was a space-header to heat the room. \n\nIt that sounds a bit too much of a throw-back, there are modern amenities.

A couple of blocks from two main subway stations - 50th or 42nd - that take you anywhere (straight to LGA, downtown to Staten Island Ferry, etc.).   \n\nAirport travel:   From LGA, Q70 bus to Roosevelt Station and either the E or 7 train straight to the hotel area.   $3.25, safe and fast.   You can buy a single ride ticket at the station with cash or card.    Navigate with Google or Safari maps - no app needed.\n\nSafety:   Went with a group of women and we never felt unsafe.   Only saw a couple of homeless people the entire time we were in Manhattan.   If there is a drug, homeless or immigrant problem here - we didn't see it.\n\nValue:   There were 10 of us in 3 rooms (2 double queens with twin pull out and 1 double queen \/ King family room).    The rooms were clean and comfortable.    1525, 1510, 1511.   We got breakfast vouchers each morning to use downstairs for pickup breakfast (very good - fruit, egg \/cheese bagel  or parfait \/ coffee or juice) or use throughout the city at designated places.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Its proximity to the subway ensures easy connectivity to other parts of the city.\nThe rooms are spacious and clean, providing a comfortable retreat after a long day of exploring the city. However, the mattresses may be too firm for some guests' preferences. While the bathroom amenities were adequate, it's worth noting that they were not replenished during our five-day stay.\nFor the most part, the staff was friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately, there were instances where security staff exhibited unacceptable behavior, including shouting at guests, which left a negative impression. Additionally, management could improve by considering group breakfast packages for larger parties, as our request for 18 breakfasts over five days was not accommodated.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The downstairs of the hotel is also not like other hotels where you would expect somewhere to sit and relax or a hotel bar. There is a bar but it\u2019s not somewhere you would take kids. \n\nWe booked a family suite and it was excellent. The kids room had two queen beds and loads of space for them. The other room had a good sized bed and and the bathroom. Really good size for NYC. \n\nThe hotel is really well located, right on Times Square, which can get very very busy, so if you are looking for something a little less central and hectic then this wouldn\u2019t be the place for you. \n\nIf you book a rate that includes breakfast you are given vouchers for a couple of restaurants downstairs in the hotel. For the voucher you get a limited selection and coffee and juice. We only ate in the hotel once for breakfast and after that found some other options close by. \n\nHighlight of the hotel for me is Bobby the doorman! What a guy, so knowledgeable and also always happy to help. He also arranged a car to the airport for me, the family and luggage with 5 minutes notice. \n\nAll in all a good place to stay and it won\u2019t break the bank!!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

On arrival the staff were not friendly at all! Very abrupt and cold welcoming! When we got into our room, the air con was not working so we called up and 2 maintenance guys came. They were actually very friendly and chatty which was nice. They couldnt fix it so temporarily fitted an air con unit in the window. Unfortunately we had to call them up again shortly after they did this as the unit was just too loud. But again, they were very lovely about it so we gave them a tip to show our appreciation.  The breakfast was not nice at all. It was \"Grab and Go\" which was included OR you had to pay \u00a36.50 (US dollars) for a sit down breakfast which we tried one morning. Disgusting! Didnt have it again! The wait staff we had was quite nice but the food was not! \nWe also had to pay additional facilities fee or over 200 dollars. I dont even know what that was for to be honest! But again, not friendly at all in the slightest! \nEverytime we came in, we had to show our car key to go up to our room which I do understand but one 2 occasions our mum had gone up to the room earlier, so we did not have the key on us. They were really funny with us about the fact we did not have our key nor ID. Were hesitant to even ring up to the room to our mum for her to bring us the key! \nWe asked for a call to wake us up the morning we left, the lady was again, rude to us when we asked for this. Everything was like it was too much trouble and effort for them! The hotel is definitely not a 4 star either! I would say more 2 stay! Needs updating everywhere! \n\nHonestly, if it wasn't for the staff and how they were, the experience would not have been so bad!

What I liked most about this facility is that the staff goes over-the-top in hospitality- every single one!\n\nThere was one specific gentleman, Fehat, who is a Bellman at the hotel, who treated us like VIP\u2019s. When we got there before check-in, he did his best to make sure we were comfortable. He was going off shift but waited until he knew we were all set before he left. While we waited for our room, I noticed he was treating everyone with respect, asking how their day was, how their room was, and if they had any questions about the Big City.  Clearly, this is a profession he takes great pride in, as he seemed to genuinely care about the guests.\n\nAll I can say to anyone reading this review is that you won\u2019t be disappointed with the facility or the staff.

When we come together, we want to enjoy athe whole Broadway experience and to be able to walk to museums and to Central Park. We are never disappointed at Hotel Edison.\n\nWe miss the old caf\u00e9, but we enjoyed the two restaurants on site, although we found the singing at Friedman\u2019s a bit screechy. We much prefer the singing waiters and waitresses at nearby Ellen\u2018s Stardust Diner which we discovered many years ago before it became so famous. There were no lines, one just walked in! The Stardust servers don\u2019t screech, and they don\u2019t sing continuously; there are breaks in singing, and then happy interludes of merry song with the volume appropriate to people who are dining and talking. We would not go back to Friedmans\u2019s for a meal, it was not relaxing.\n\nWe had a lovely large room on the 17th floor in a corner so windows on two sides. The king-size bed was super comfortable and everything was very clean. The only negative is that the doors are very loud when they open and close and so in the corner area where we were we were woken  up by doors slamming as people went in and out of their respective rooms (they weren\u2019t intentionally slamming the doors, the doors are just loud per se). \n\nBut what stood out for us? This time it was the cheerful and knowledgable professionalism of the main concierge at the Edison, Rolando Pagan. I had spoken with Rolando on the phone from Canada before we arrived, more than once, the second time because we were much delayed at the Halifax International Airport. Rolando was very helpful in getting us squared away so that we could be sure to get the airport shuttle service that the Edison offers even though we were six hours late arriving at the Newark airport.\n\nOnce at the hotel, we found Rolando extremely helpful in terms of directions for getting around to a variety of locations. He also encouraged me, a jazz aficionada, to visit the Rum House ( live music every night) for a jazz experience on the Saturday  night we were at the hotel. It was delightful. The musicians were excellent, and the ambience was warm and the people assembled here were musically sophisticated. \n\nWe were sorry to miss the wine experience on Friday evening because of our late arrival, but we enjoyed chatting with people here and there\u2014 on the elevator, in the lovely art deco reception, area, and at the restaurants, bothFriedman\u2019s  and Bond 45. We had a pasta meal at Bond 45 before we attended the musical, and the cuisine was exquisite. \n\nThe grab and go breakfast worked pretty well. The coffee was spectacular.\n\nAll of the staff were pleasant and professional. As noted earlier, Rolando Pagan, the head concierge, represents the  jewell in the crown with regard to hotel staff. His able assistance at various times made the difference between a good stay and a superior stay.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We had read some reviews that made us nervous, but the hotel turned out to be lovely. Check-in and check-out were both quick thanks to the self-serve kiosks that kept us from having to wait in line at the desk. \n\nRoom keys had to be displayed before being allowed into the elevator bank (there was ALWAYS a guard on duty) and had to be swiped IN the elevator before a floor number could be pressed. This made us feel very safe and secure. Despite the amount of guests staying at the hotel, the elevators were fast and we never had to wait more than 30 seconds for an elevator to arrive. \n\nWe had a Signature 2 Queen Beds room on the 18th floor that met our needs. Yes, the bathroom is small but - it's New York. I was just happy it was clean and modern. Take note that there's not a fan in the bathroom so whomever you're rooming with will hear\/smell all your business, and vice versa. Also, the water pressure in the shower isn't great. I had to shower twice as long as usual because it took forever to wash the conditioner out of my hair. \n\nOur biggest issue with the room was the HVAC. The heat was on and set to 74 when we arrived, even though it was a warm day in NYC (62 degrees). We immediately turned off the heat and turned on the AC to cool down the room, but the AC would only run once and then shut off - never cooling down the room to the temperature we selected. This made for uncomfortable sleeping on most nights (we stayed 4 nights), since the bedding was so heavy\/warm. \n\nOur room had no view at all - the windows faced another section of the hotel - but given how close we were to Times Square, it helped minimize the noise. Since we were really only in the room in the evening\/ overnight, we didn't mind not having a view of the city. \n\nThe grab-and-go breakfast was decent although definitely on the cheap side. You get to select a piece of fruit OR a croissant, a breakfast sandwich OR a yogurt parfait, and then a beverage (juice, coffee, water). Also, note that if you check in at the self-service kiosk you will need to stop at the concierge to pick up your breakfast vouchers; the kiosk doesn't provide them.\n\nWe will definitely stay at the Hotel Edison again if we plan another Broadway-focused trip to NYC. This was a perfect location for catching multiple shows!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"NONE"}

You cannot beat being in the heart of Times Square in just a few steps. As I was visiting with my partner who has not been to NY before, I wanted somewhere in the thick of it and The Edison is the perfect location. Close to all main attractions \/ subway etc. \n\nOur room this time was MUCH better. We were on the 14th floor. Nice tidy room, comfortable bed, bathroom was a little on the small side but shower was great. No waiting for lifts either. Our room was serviced each day and bottled water replenished which was greatly appreciated. \n\nService throughout the duration of our stay was 10\/10. We were checked in by Marco who was very friendly and informative. Door staff \/ security \/ concierge were all friendly and professional. I like that there is 24 hour security and you have to show your room key to access the lifts. \n\nWe enjoyed the grab and go breakfast each morning also. \n\nI know this place is getting mixed reviews at the moment but our experience was great and we would 100% recommend and return.

The staff was quite friendly, and the rooms are good at blocking street noise for the most part. Additionally, I was impressed with the security (need to show room key to access elevators). However, I am not sure that I would stay here again. There was a lack of light in the room (two lamps and a dim hallway light in the main room were it) and there was dust on the wallpaper and the back of the bathroom door. The walls are quite thin and doors easily slam, so it was hard to get a restful night's sleep. Upon arrival, there were a few things lacking in my room that were listed as amenities on the website (robes, coffee machine, etc). There was also a letter addressed to another guest in the room, and the TV was addressed to yet another guest, giving me some concerns about privacy of guests. I have some dietary restrictions so I called prior to booking to ensure they would be able to accommodate these for the grab and go breakfast, and I was told they would be able to. However, the only part of the breakfast I could eat was the fruit. For these reasons, I 'm not sure that I would stay here in the future but if staff were receptive to feedback and improvements were made, I would consider staying here again. At present, I just don't feel that it is worth it for the price. ","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"NONE"}

I bet if we had been American we wouldn\u2019t have been in the 1 st nightmare of a room as they wouldn\u2019t put up with it. The hotel gave vouchers for breakfast either on site or a lovely cafe at the end of the same street, so that was a great plus point. We didn\u2019t find the staff here very friendly or accommodating at all. The cleaner on the 16 th floor however was lovely! Rooms were very clean! No heating in the bathrooms so they are a bit chilly but Air Con was much quieter in the room . Beware of the hidden tourist tax at $45 dollars a night as they tax the tax!!

Very rude management and poorly run establishment. Booked a stay and called the hotels front desk days earlier specifically to request an early check in. After giving my name and confirmation #, I was told we could be there for 8am check in. As we had a 2.5 hour ride in, this was great. We left the car at valet and went to desk. I was rudely told that my room will not be ready until 4pm. The manager - Tex- refused to be amicable and would not accept that we had made the call earlier in the week. He was accusing me of fabricating the entire story. While I do understand hotels have afternoon check ins, the fact that I called and confirmed an early check-in lulled me to a false sense of security. We had a family get together planned for noon, and when I asked would I be compensated for the hotel\u2019s error, I was told I\u2019d have to come back tomorrow and find the manager. \u201cTex\u201d did not know who, where or when the manager would be available. When I asked where the manager was right then, he said he didn\u2019t know, probably \u201cupstairs somewhere\u201d. Not sure what answer that is. As I look around the hotel lobby, I notice every single staff person staring at me. Made us feel like complete pariahs.\nNow mind you this is a busy Saturday. As I told \u201cTex\u201d that this was unacceptable, he said there was no way the room would or could be ready, never specified a time to return; just made me guess when until we landed on 4pm, and when I asked him to take down my phone number to call us when it would be ready he wouldn\u2019t even look at me. He said, \u201cwhoever told you that information was wrong, I have no record of that phone call, and I don\u2019t know who would say that, but they misspoke, and it was not correct information\u201d. He looked at me as if I was conning him or making things up. As I stood there @830 AM, from out of town, with no hotel reservation for 8 hours, he looked down at his computer ignoring me completely, and rolled his eyes when I asked him to call me when room was available. The phone call never occurred. Due to not being ready for the family get together, we decided to cancel the room reservation and find another hotel that suited our needs (which we were able to do at the Hampton Inn Times Square, highly\nrecommended).\nIt was in the 20\u2019s with wind this last weekend, so we were forced to haul our bags outside and walk .8 miles to the hotel which did accommodate us. \u201cTex\u201d never offered to call a cab or anything as he watched us walk outside. My car was already shuttled off to valet garage and would be 40 minutes before they could retrieve it. It was absolutely freezing and we were wearing casual driving clothes, not winter gear. Should have ordered Uber but we were flustered. The \u201ckind hearted\u201d souls at Edison would not refund the fee; so I was charged, in full, for their incompetence. Even made me pay for bag check while we assessed the situation!\nMy main goal was to enjoy our weekend so money wasn\u2019t my first priority, but this was a disgusting display of selfishness and cost me hundreds extra. Not a single apology once. Not even a free breakfast voucher\nVery predatory tactics for a tourist service business. I was never offered a discount, apology or even a place to sit while we waited. My wife and I decided to sit in the common lounge next to the bathrooms and search for other hotel rooms. We were able to find many. So I was lied to and suffered seemingly fraudulent charges due to their utter incompetence. Had I known the room would not be available I would not have booked it! We didn\u2019t know booking here could have ultimately cost us an entire weekend; and I\u2019d love to help someone else which is why I decided to write this dissertation on my experience.\nTo anyone that made it this far, we were very happy with our trip to New York City.

We chose the sit down breakfast every morning except one where we went for the grab and go option. The choice for both options was fantastic and really set us up for the day. The staff were absolutely amazing, so friendly and attentive, nothing was too much trouble. We had a minor issue with our room and they had it resolved in jig time no problems at all. Check out was smooth and they even held our luggage for us as our flight was in the evening.

The bathroom is in the wardrobe and the staff can\u2019t even crack a smile so not sure what the fees are that we now have pay on checkout. \n\nBed and breakfast option is also another way to stealthy grab money from guests. They advertise its bed and breakfast and then demand a $6.50 charge to sit down per person plus tax and gratuity on top. \n\nThe hotel is very dated and not in a great condition. However, all of those things could be overlooked had it not been the terrible service of the rude staff. \n\nOverall I would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel until the staff have received front of house training and lessons in basic manners and respect.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":93437,"title":"Well This Was Unexpected","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2024-01-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I usually stick with my usual suspect hotels when traveling for work in NYC but this time I was coming up for a big, live event and invited my family to join me. I'm fairly sure I scoured the entirety of available lodging for a suite with a separate bedroom so we could all hunker down together, but have the option of privacy and...well, it's NYC and the pickings are slim (and concepts like \"big\" and \"suite\" are relative). But I was intrigued and cautious to come across Hotel Edison. I would usually never consider Times Square but the rooms seemed to be exactly what I needed, size wise so I held my breath and took a chance. I'm so glad I did! The staff was so kind from check-in to check-out. Christina in particular, was attentive and after taking a look at my reservation and seeing there was a child traveling with me, kindly upgraded us to a suite with a terrace (which, lol, it was January so I figured it was just a nice gesture), and gave me some extra breakfast vouchers, too. So sweet! I loved that there was hotel security posted by the elevator and when I arrived, there was a live performer in the lobby singing Whitney Houston, which was a treat. The enormous terrace ended up being awesome to have after the snow fell, and my little one had a blast playing in her own little snow field (thanks, Christina!). Because of its location, this hotel is near everything you could ever ask for in regards to restaurants and entertainment and it was easy to navigate to\/from. The grab and go breakfast options (egg sandwiches, yogurt, fruit, coffee) are nothing to write home about, but they were good in a pinch, especially when we were literally on the go. The toiletries were really nice -- good quality by CO Bigelow -- and smelled great.\n\nThere are some downsides, though. The pull out sofa bed was painful after a couple of nights. There is a mini fridge but here's no microwave in the room, however you can rent one (~$30) for the duration of your stay. The TVs were odd and outdated. You couldn't cast to them and there was no streaming option and all the movies were only available for a fee (even funnier was that you could pay $10 to stream music for 24 hours, as if 99% of people don't have music on their phones). And the front desk redirected me to the (very expensive) gift shop in the lobby when we realized we needed a toothbrush ($5!!) so beware if you forget any toiletries...it's worth the walk to the nearest CVS. Finally, the shower was confusing, to say the least. The partition only reached a few inches and it was nearly impossible not to spray the bathroom with water while washing.\n\nAll in all, though, I have pretty low expectations of NYC hotels. Pricey, small with unremarkable customer service experiences, but Hotel Edison was a cut above and if you're traveling with kids, I recommend a look!","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We were unpacking and resting and it sounded like construction was going on above and next to us but we figured it was during the day so no big deal.

Didn\u2019t even offer to move our room. We came to realize our room was directly next to the elevators and every time they were used it was making waves into our room!

We were in the tenth floor and faced away from the street. \n\nI had been in contact with the hotel (Kezia) with a few questions as it was my first visit to NYC and she was great in coming back to me. \n\nUpon arrival she also knocked at the room with a couple of bars of chocolate and a Hotel Edison teddy for my daughter which she loved. Didn\u2019t expect this at all and was very appreciative. \n\nMy daughter had the do not disturb sign up on the door so after a couple of days one of the security came and knocked and said it was just to check everything is OK as we have it down as do not disturb for a few days. The guy was great and friendly and had a laugh for a few minutes. \n\nHad a slight issue with payment checking out but again Kezia was quick to respond (it wasn\u2019t actually the hotels fault I had just red it wrong) but the quick reply was great. \n\nConsidering it\u2019s the middle of Times Square too I expected a load of noise. Couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Perfect place.

The most significant issue was the constant noise in the bathroom that persisted throughout the night. Despite our efforts to shut the door, the noise was disruptive, leading to several sleepless nights for some of us.\n\nAdditionally, the room's air conditioning was unreliable, only functioning intermittently. This contributed to an overall feeling of discomfort and grogginess, further impacting our stay.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that the hotel staff were quite friendly and welcoming. Their demeanor was a positive aspect of our stay. However, the quality of the room and the issues we encountered were major drawbacks.\n\nConsidering the substantial amount we paid for our stay, we expected a much more comfortable and restful experience. Unfortunately, due to these issues, we were unable to fully enjoy our trip, missing out on planned visits to significant places like the 911 Museum and Central Park.\n\nIn conclusion, while the staff were  commendable for their hospitality, the room's condition and the noise issue significantly marred our stay. We hope this feedback helps in improving the experience for future guests.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Hotel Edison is in the perfect location being half a block from Times Square. The ratings were ok. Not stupendous but ok. And breakfast was included. Well, breakfast was not really included. We received a voucher for either grab and go or $5 meal at Bond 45. My sister and I wanted a good hot meal before hitting the streets on Sunday morning so we went to Bond 45. The voucher is very misleading. We assumed we'd give them the voucher, eat and head out. Nope. When the waiter said we had to pay $10.89 for the plate of fruit and bowl of oatmeal my sister and I shared, I literally laughed out loud. Seriously?!??! You said breakfast was included. Why did we have to pay??? You should update the voucher to read the grab and go is included but to sit down is not. We were very disappointed. The street vendors had much better food. As for cleanliness, all I have to say is eww, gross. When I found hair in the bathroom that did not belong to my sister and I (we both have red hair... it was brown), I thought I was going to vomit. My sister called to request that we be moved to a new room but we could not. The front desk said they would send the cleaning staff to wipe down the bathroom again. Instead, the housekeeping manager arrived, inspected the bathroom, picked up the hairs and flushed them in the toilet. No wipe down. No cleaning.

Right next to Times Square, and a plethora of great restaurants, theaters and sights. The staff is always very friendly, professional and helpful.  During this visit Hanniel stood out as someone we really appreciated (will explain below).  The doorman was very professional.  He came to us one time in the lobby to see if we needed anything, and later quickly flagged down two taxis for our group.\n\nThe Just Ok or Bad:  the hotel is a bit worn out as it is very old.  The hall carpet is really old.  The rooms have just the basics.  The bedding and beds were fine, and the TV was nice.  We went over Thanksgiving so we expected it to be expensive and it was.  When prompted I checked in via my mobile.  This is an expedited way to get your keys via a kiosk in the lobby.  When we got to the kiosk, the price was $613, vice the reservation price of $413 for one room.  So we cancelled the check-in at the kiosk and went to the front desk for help.  Hanniel was very helpful in explaining that $100 was for tax and fees, and the other $100 for a security deposit we would get back.  Again, not explained at the kiosk.  Also at first the records showed only one room and we had reserved two rooms (8 of us in our group).  Hanniel was able the find the other room with our reservation numbers, and although only one room was ready, he prepared both sets of room keys for us and instructed us to come right to him to get them once the second room was ready (therefore avoiding standing in line).

We had a two room suite with a terrace and an AMAZING view of the city! Even our housekeeper introduced herself by name and was with us the full 6 days calling ahead to check she could bring us anything! We felt like family! I also appreciated the level of security at the hotel - in order to access the elevators you must present a key. Kept me sleeping soundly at night with my daughter. Even the water filling stations and ice machines on each floor was a nice amenity I appreciated after trodding around the city all day. The showers had lots of water pressure and hot water and the view from our bed in the hotel provided robes and slippers each morning was the best way to enjoy my coffee! Cannot wait to return!!!

Had saved up for this trip for over a year and as soon as we arrived we were hit with an invoice for $321 for a six night stay.  I booked through love holidays and thought I had paid for my holiday in full but was told if I don\u2019t pay what they called a faculty charge I would not be getting to check in.  Staff at reception were rude and did not care if I stayed or not.  The invoice was paid and  we checked in after some debate.  Room was basic but had two clean beds and clean towels.   No view at all\u2026.in-fact, we looked out onto a wooden platform above the hotel Edison sign. \n\nGrab and go breakfast we were told  when we arrivedwhich was very basic and if you wanted to actually sit down and have some breakfast it would cost you $5 each plus tax for a limited menu.  Was also not aware of this when I booked my stay.  Restaurant staff very pleasant and efficient.  But again I had to pay out more money. For the privilege to sit down and eat my breakfast.  They also charged  an additional \u00a3800 to have a room with two beds because I wanted a twin room not a double as I was staying with a friend.   No option for two friends to have even a single bed each.  We were expected to sleep together or basically pay for an additional bed costing me \u00a3800.  Rooms are tired and carpets old and tatty as well as bed frames and furniture.  Coffee machine in room had mould in it and took staff two days to replace this.  Very limited tea\/coffee facilities, no milk and  very little tea so no room refreshments that were palatable except bottle of water each day .  \n\nNormally I would not ask for my room to be serviced every day but purely because I was expected to pay this facility fee I did.  Found staff to be thorough, leaving selection of clean towels daily. \n\nOverall this is a large hotel who have a high turnover.   They will get paid no matter what cause they know once we arrive we have limited options.  Reception staff are insincere and and rude and my initial interaction ruined my stay.  A good  hotel should make every guest feel like they are welcome and that their stay and experience is important to them.  Not the case here at all.  Despite central and good location would never stay again.  ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

As we'd prioritised location over other factors this was a perfect hotel for a first visit to NYC. The hotel has Times Square on the doorstep and many major attractions are within walking distance.\n\nI was disappointed to discover the hotel is one of the increasing number who adds a \"facility fee\" on arrival. We were charged around 45 dollars a night for this which listed \"Wi-Fi\" among the benefits. I could never give a 5 star review to any hotel who perpetuates this blatant cash-grab on top of what is already a significant cost for accommodation. The Wi-Fi in our room on the 17th floor was also so poor that I had better service from the free WiFi of a neighbouring hotel.\n\nI was a little disappointed that there was no acknowledgement that our stay was part of our honeymoon. The hotel were aware of this beforehand. A personal touch goes a long way, even if it's just a little note left in the room. My limited interaction with hotel staff felt cold and dispassionate, which is common with hotels of this size.\n\nThat said our room was clean and comfortable and we slept as well as anyone possibly can with the incessant honking of car horns and sirens outside.\n\nWhen I next visit New York I won't stay near Times Square. After you've taken a few pics you quickly realise it's not a pleasant place. But if you're visiting for the first time and your priority is seeing the major tourist attractions then this hotel is an ideal choice. ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Couldnt sleep it was that stuffy and couldnt breathe either.  Bathroom was just as bad it was like a suana aswell and it was no bigger than a cloakroom, with the room itsself no bigger than my room at home.

The term \"misrepresentation\" comes to mind. The pictures on TA show a completely different aspect to what was provided.\n\nThis must be the only 4* hotel without a consierge, bellhop, catering and room service and where they charge cash to leave luggage. \n\nAlso, they must have experience of unwanted\/registered individuals accessing the guest rooms as to access a bedroom guests must pass a security desk to check room keys and the elevators can only be enabled by use of the room pass key.\n\nThe room and common area decor provided is so tired it is almost dead, paintwork is chipped and cracked (a haven for micro organisms) and the wallpaper is peeling at the seams.\n\nThere are screws and holes in the walls where items and pictures have been removed, the carpets are not just threadbare but actually ripped causing a safety hazard and the bathroom has several rusty components along with unboxed piping which is probably lagged with blue asbestos. All in all, compliance with recommended safety and hygeine requirements is well below reasonable expectation. \n\nThe lighting is considerably less than adequate (one ceiling light in the entry area but nothing in the main bedroom, a single bedside table with clock and light and a small light on the desk (hardly suitable to light the room with a double bed!). The windows are sealed and the air-con ineffective because the thermostat control showed the need for battery replacement.\n\nThe electric wiring is superficial and encased in bursting conduit trunking. Hardly appealing or safe!\n\nThe warm musty smell in the common areas and room suggested airing had not been done for years!\n\nReception. An extremely noisy disorganized area where the staff seem gagged as to what they can say - not quite aggressive, but borderline.\n\nAnd the surcharge for facilities they don't even show you they offer - well!\n\nWho would pay an extra $40 to have a meal at a reduced price, have items printed or use the wifi (which is actually free). Laundry facilities are common to most hotels and there is expectation to pay for them? Why pay in advance when you are not going to use the facility? Why pay for a \"wine hour\" on Tuesdays and Thursdays when your stay is on Monday or Wednesday?\n\nInvoking a global surchage that offers a cost reduction on items that will knowingly cannot be used is .......  Saying it is available if you want it is an appalling business model! Be honest and include it within an all inclusive room rate.\n\nWas pleased to vacate.\n   \nIt is interesting that poor TA reviews cause Edison to respond with virtually the same text every time - they must be well prepared!\n\nWould I go to Edison Hotel again?\n\nAbsolutely NO!","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-10-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We've just returned from a short stay at the Edison, and it's a bit of a mixed review. We booked this hotel because online, the hotel looked very 'old school New York' - and in a lot of ways, it is. The art deco interior is attractive, and there are plenty of friendly, attentive staff around. \n\nCheck in was smooth, though we had requested a high floor and were allocated room 451 on the 4th floor. That's where the problems started. \n\nUpon entering the corridor, there was a strong smell of 'funny smoke' - the corridor looked decidely beaten up and really did need some attention. It got worse and worse the further along we went - until arriving at our room, where the paint was peeling off the door and at the very end of a particularly nasty corridor. The 'Queen' room was like a prison cell, nothing at all like we'd seen online. There was no 'marble bath', the bed was tiny, only one lamp worked, the horriblr wooden furniture was properly beaten up and chipped in about a million places. I've never done this before, but I didn't even take my coat off - went straight downstairs to request a new room.\n\nThe check in assistant told me that all of the 'Queen' rooms are similar(!) but I could upgrade for $50 per night plus taxes to a 'King' room, which have been fully refurbished. This was the best decision of the trip - we were allocated room 1722 on the 17th floor and it was much nicer - though to be fair, we had expected a room of this standard in the first place and to have to pay to upgrade was a real kick in the teeth.\n\nThe major gripe about this room was the air con unit, which seemingly has no way of being switched off at all - even when showing as 'off' on the wall - and was VERY loud. It blared all day and all night, every minute we were in the room. But, it's the price you pay I guess. \n\nWe only had the grab and go breakfast once from Bond 45 but were impressed with the selection and service, perfect if you just need a bite to eat before heading out to explore. \n\nLocation wise, well if you want to be close to Times Square, you really can't be much closer. It's about 20 seconds walk from the red TKTS booth on W47th St, you are very much in the heart of the action! \n\nOverall, would stay again but won't be in a rush to rebook - and if we do, we will be sure to upgrade to the King room.

I found it hugely expensive (especially with Canadian dollar being low) but apparently fairly reasonable for NYC and the location. Hotels are up in price everywhere.\n\nLocation was fantastic.

Close to subway station. \n\nStaff were friendly and helpful. \n\nRoom was small (to be expected in NYC) but comfortable and in great shape. Most importantly, the bed was very comfortable and the shower was strong. We had requested a mini-fridge (only $30 for the week) and found out when we arrived that because it was for medication, there was no charge at all (had to request the charge be reimbursed after check out but no problem whatsoever). \n\nLots of elevators so no long waits. Security seemed really strong but not intrusive. Lobby was nice.\n\nThe included breakfast was fabulous. I'd read negative reviews and thought it was going to be a problem. Not at all! We only used the coupon for grab and go once, but it was terrific. Ate out once (Bryant Park). The rest of the time we did the  $5 menu in Friedman's. Remarkably fast service. Simple menu - I think I had the two eggs, hash browns, and toast every day. My friend tried most of the options and they all seemed good. \n\nWe tried to go to the Rum House for a drink one night but there were no tables at the time. Looked quaint, comfortable, and \"jazzy\".

This gave us more time to explore the city luggage free on our last day. \n\nThe $100 refundable deposit was returned to me super fast - the day after I checked out it was back in my Monzo account although they do say it can take 15 + business days.\nWe ate in the Friedmans restaurant in the hotel which was nice, good food and service- they charge you $5 per person to sit in (this is what I was told on check in) so breakfast for 3 people would come to $90, before we added gratuity which meant it cost us about $110 just for breakfast. We ate here twice but for the rest of the trip had to eat at other diners (about $48-$56 for breakfast in diners) in order to maintain our budget. The bar had live music on and there was good ambience there and a good crowd during the night. We missed the singing service in the restaurant so that would have been fun to see. I think it's on every dinner service wed - sat.\n\nThe only two faults with the room was that the windows outside were quite dirty which meant we couldn't see much of the view. There was building works going on near the hotel outside which probably contributed to it. It also meant there was extra noise at night which made our weekday nights more noisy. The beds were very comfy so to be honest despite the noise we weren't long falling asleep as we were exhausted from exploring the city every day!\nThe second thing was the room felt quite dark. There was 1 bedside lamp in between the queen sized beds and a small desk lamp but neither helped bring much light to the window side of the room. An extra standing lamp would help give better lighting. Overall we did enjoy our stay and would return. ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We requested fresh towels and explained we were in a rush out to see a show. After 20mins, we ended up using our old towels to get ready. We told the staff member on our way out that we no longer needed the towels and he rolled his eyes. \n\n2) We requested fresh towels later that evening. After 45mins I called reception again. After a further 20mins the towels finally arrived.\n\n3) The property charges a random USD$35 per night \u201cFacility Fee\u201d for a range of \u201cbenefits\u201d which are fairly pointless. If they\u2019re going to invent fees for stuff they should just add this to the booking cost so you know how much the stay will cost. \n\n4) Rooms are small but does have a private bathroom which is nice, but also small.\n\n5) The property feels very dated which is charming in the lobby and hallways but not so charming in your room. Room decor and bathroom felt tired and just \u201cclean enough\u201d.  Rooms need a bit of a refresh. \n\n6) No fridge in the room was a real disappointment.

It reminds me of something you would see in the old, glamorous, black and white movies from the 1930s and '40s. From the minute we came into the lobby to check in, the staff was very helpful. They were there to assist at the self-check kiosk, and very thorough at the front desk when I went down later to get extra keys and our breakfast vouchers. Housekeeping came each day and was very good about cleaning the room and checking to see when would be a convenient time for us to have her come clean.  We booked a king suite through the hotel website since they were offering a special rate, and they had the cookies from Schmackary's and a custom Hershey's bar waiting for us, as part of our package.\n\nBreakfast vouchers were also included with our hotel suite reservation, which is a nice option.  My daughter had a breakfast sandwich from the Grab n Go breakfast at Bond 45. My husband and I used the ones for Friedman's (which is an extra $5\/person charge since they seat you there), where I enjoyed a granola and fruit parfait, and my husband had a bagel and cream cheese.  I've posted pictures of the menus for the voucher breakfast selections. I did not try out the free breakfast voucher for Carve, which is down the block on the corner.\n\nIt was nice having a suite, even though it was on the small side - but that's what you would expect in a big city hotel like New York. The rooms were clean. King bed was comfy. Sofa bed was typical sofabed - not great but can sleep on it if you have to. The only thing we really did not care for was that the bathroom door was just a frosted glass door. So it did not feel very private, since everybody in the bedroom could still see a hazy version of you and everything you were doing in there, and how much clothing you had or did not have on. It made our daughters very uncomfortable when they had to use it. Also, because it is a glass door, when you turn on the light in the bathroom at night, it  lights up the whole bedroom, too. And yes, the shower does not have a door on it either, but it's designed to be that way, with a partially open shower, and we had no trouble with it.\n\nThe location of the hotel is right in the heart of Times Square, so it is defnitely a busy and noisy area, but it was very convenient for us since we were going to dinner and seeing shows while there. It was great being able to walk back to our hotel after the shows. We also had dinner at Friedmans and definitely appreciate that almost everything on their menu is gluten free.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Edison, and if you plan to stay in Times Square, this is a wonderful historic hotel with excellent service.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

If your thing is the Broadway shows, this Hotel y a great option since you are right there, close to all the theatres. Metro and Bus stations are also close by. CVS and Walgreens are also close for water and snacks. The vending machine in the second floor did not accepted credit cards. Time Square is right around the corner, but is not much to do there really... This is a crowded Hotel. The lines, mattress and pillows are of very high quality and the cleanliness was good. The bathroom is to small and the shower pressure is not high. I was in 1502, so early in the morning the noise of kids waiting for the elevator wake me up sometimes. New York is constantly growing, so not be surprise if you hear some machinery noise overnight. The included breakfast is good, but you will be treated like a second-class person once you show the vouchers at Friedman's, the restaurant in the lobby. You will get the worst table and just a small sample of orange juice. Overall I think is a goos place to stay. ","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The bathroom was nice sized, with plenty of counter space and wide window sills that served as more storage room. Everything was clean and updated. Our room on the 19th floor was very quiet.

The view from the lower level rooms is a brick wall so if you want any type of street view request a higher level room.  We were traveling with a person who uses a wheelchair and requested an accessible room but they had none available for our dates.  I ended up reserving a king suite so that we would have enough room for her to move around and enough room for the chair.  We were put in a room with a narrow hallway leading from the entry door to the bathroom and the living room area.  So narrow the wheels of the chair were scraping against the walls to get it through.  I called and requested a room like the one that was in the picture on line when I reserved it and we were moved to a higher floor with a larger room that was similar to the picture online.  However the room was larger but the bathroom was extremely small which again was a problem when you have a person with a mobility disability.  Sadly, they allow people with no disabilities to rent ADA rooms and sadly people without disabilities request ADA rooms because they think they are getting a bigger room fo the same price of a smaller room.  These people are pieces of crap and if you are one of them stop doing it!  You are taking that room for a person who needs the extra space because they have a wheelchair and they need the accessible bathroom so they can shower safely.  I don't know whats wrong with society but you people are unbelievable.  \nAnyway, the king suite was nice once we were moved to the one that was advertised, but the King suite did not have a King bed.

The Edison is a grand old Art Deco hotel in a fabulous location in Times Square. \n\nThe location was great but what really stood out was the caliber of employees. Shkurte at the front desk handled a problem with my first room with aplomb and professionalism and a smile on her face. The doorman was incredibly pleasant and helpful on a number of occasions when I needed directions or information (don't recall his name but I won't forget his face - smiling, older, maybe a redhead in his younger days). Then I met Danny from Security and again, was left with a feeling of being with people you would want to be friends with. This is truly remarkable. In this day and age when people are not always friendly or helpful or kind, Hotel Edison is a stand out.\n\nI applaud the management of this hotel and wish other hotels had the opportunity to learn how they treat their guests so well.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

No in\/out privileges. Once you're in you stay.   You do get a discount if you have card stamped (again found out the hard way upon leaving... someone should have told us we needed to get that done).

For us the Edison was great for our fist stay in New York, being right in the heart of Broadway, Times Square and within walking distance of many points of interest. \nThe rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet enough to get a good nights sleep. As I understand it NYC hotel rooms can be on the small side with minimal storage and the Edison fits that description, however we found our King room adequate for the weeks stay. The numerous elevators (lifts) are very efficient with very little waiting about.\nThe included breakfast was a great benefit, however we did pay $5 each to convert from grab & go to a sit down breakfast in the restaurant. For us well worth it. The menu choices are limited at this price, but we found it good enough. Friedman's was our preference of the 2 possible restaurants. \nWe found the staff to be friendly and helpful.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":93437,"title":"Not the experience I wanted to experience.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-08-06","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"Hotel Edison is located in the heart of Time Square. It is a busy lively tourist area with plenty of shops, restaurants, theatres and other places of interest. It is also triangulated with nearby Time Sq, 50 St & Rockefeller Centre subways which makes it easy to hop on and off for exploring Manhattan. \n\nOur stay at the Hotel Edison was somewhat disappointing. It looked outdated but acceptable in its Art Deco styling. Our first room on the 2nd floor was ok but very dark and dingy and had a horrible musty smell. The noise outside was unbearable at night\/early hours. Noise from traffic, service and construction vehicles, and sirens from emergency vehicles were not great for a good night\u2019s sleep. It felt like we were sleeping outside on the pavement.\n\nWe woke up the next day very tired and headed to the reception desk to complain, one member of staff was cleaning his desk and kept nodding his head to go over to the other desk. No 'good morning' or 'how may I help', just a rude nodding. We spoke to the other staff who was helpful and concerned about us not having slept very much in a smelly room, he offered a room on the 3rd floor and asked us to go and take a look and see if it was any better.\nBefore moving we opted to have breakfast in the hotel at the Bond 45 Kitchen & Bar, we paid an additional $5 x 3 to sit and eat but the options were limited. My wife selected French toast and after some 5 minutes, the waiter told her they didn't have any. Slightly annoyed my wife requested toast and the waiter gave her an option of seeded bread. Tea & orange juice had been brought to our table when another waiter came to inform, us that they were unable to provide substitutions, so no seeded toast for my wife unless we paid extra. WOW!!!!\nNow in the UK (and take note Hotel Edison) customer service is paramount, in a situation like this, an eatery would have provided the choice offered to them to keep the customer happy. The fact that it was breakfast and French toast was on the menu I would expect it to be available and served. In the end, fed up and hungry we left. \nI really do not understand the logic, the restaurant LOST money with the tea and orange juice served to us whilst we waited for our breakfast. I'm guessing it was being prepared and would have had to be thrown away in the end. All this for a couple of slices of toast - unbelievable! We then headed for the complimentary 'grab & go' breakfast.\n\nOur second room was lovely and spacious, well-lit with the addition of a sofa and extra storage space. This felt like an upgrade. We unpacked and has a busy day of sightseeing. We returned back to the hotel late at night and in need of a good night\u2019s sleep, but the noise from outside was still bad. In the morning I discovered a ventilation gap, allowing noise to come through into our room. The windows had been secured meaning they could not open and therefore we could not \u2018resolve\u2019 the ventilation gap. \nAfter another start to the day of feeling tired, we headed for breakfast, this time at the hotel's Friedman's eatery, this was a pleasant experience to the one we had at Bond 45. My wife was still very annoyed with not having much sleep and found a very sympathetic manager Nowell. We\u2019d spoken to a couple earlier and asked them if the noise bothered them and said no as they were on the 23rd floor. So, Nowell offered us a room (now 3rd) on the 21st floor which would be ready in the afternoon. \nAgain, we packed our belongings into suitcases to be taken down and stored as the room has to be cleaned first. My daughter informed one member of staff Juan that some of her makeup solution was leaking in a small bag and if they would be kind enough to keep it upright. Juan informed a colleague (Patrick I think) and rudely said \u2018Can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019 and walked off. Uncomfortable, Juan promptly told us he\u2019ll take care of it and enjoy the rest of the day.\n\nWe returned later that afternoon and found Juan to collect our luggage, Juan joked that he stayed with the bag to avoid the makeup bottle from leaking. Nothing had leaked and that little joke from him brought a big smile to our faces. This showed that Juan cared even for those small and less important things. Things that Patrick dismissed and had no time!\n\nWe moved into our 3rd room and Nowell had left a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates for us. The room was sadly a downgrade from the others with no storage, cupboards or bedside units other than a couple of so small shelves. This meant that much of our clothing had to stay in our suitcases and anything we could hang went into the very small wardrobe. The shower screen for the walking shower was not long enough which caused the water to wet the floor and made me slip and hurt my ankle causing it to swell for several days. In the we had to put down towels to soak up the water, we were so fed up of these rooms there was no point complaining again and put up with this unpleasant experience. We did however have a restful noise free couple of nights' sleep. \n\nOverall, Hotel Edison fell short of our expectations. We found staff lacked courteous and professional customer service. Bond 45 needs to be flexible when THEY fail to accommodate customers and have a friendly manner towards them. To have customers walk out over some seeded toast is a joke!\nNowell and Juan were exceptional and praise them for their care and attention. They were both very helpful and genuinely made an effort to help us. I understand NYC is a busy city with a large flow of traffic, daily commuters and construction activity but the noise coming through the ventilation gap in the windows was far too loud for us, meaning it disrupted some much-needed rest. \n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Talking about the temperature, that was OK, but the noise was extremely annoying, it was impossible to sleep and no wake up at the middle of the night.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was tiny, big long corridor in the room then just a queen bed. Room was dark as was facing out to other buildings and couldn't leave blind up as would have no privacy. The bathroom was so small and toilet was literally 3ft from the bed. Toilet was so loud when flushed and also the noise of the pipe from other rooms above us when the toilets were flushed was so loud it would wake us at night. Bed was comfortable that was about it. Yes it was just a place to sleep and shower for us but I dont think it was worth the price as well as $160 extra we has to pay for resort fee for 4 nights. Paid a total of $300 at check in which included deposit which was returned few days after checking in. Check in process was so slow we waited atleast 20 minutes to be checked in and then spent another 10-15 minutes checking in. If you want to stay in heart of times square it's ideal. Personally wouldn't stay in times Square again as felt so sketchy outside the hotel at night. The included breakfast vouchers were grab and go breakfast from Bond 45 was tasteless and sit down breakfast in Friedmans for $5 was basically just any type of eggs, toast and disgusting hashbrown(more like boiled potatoes). We also wanted latte and that was $6pp more exclusive of tax and tips \ud83d\ude44.  I wouldn't stay here again or recommend it to family or friends.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is at a great location ! However my first observation was that the bathrooms do not lock ! I think coming from the Caribbean this is a strange thing for me. The WiFi was atrocious in my room and I constantly had to reload and disconnect and reconnect to the WiFi. The bathroom amenities were good however I found myself having to call as they were not replenished everyday. The bed was comfortable and the view was great. Staff was quite attentive and very nice. Anyone staying here should take advantage of the various offers they have in the lobby as the discounts are quite good ( especially the coupon book from the mall ).","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Small rooms that to be honest need upgrading a little. But what do you need in NYC other than a bed and a shower!! The staff are so friendly. Big shout out to the ladies working on the tenth floor. Beware of the run lunch served in the bar downstairs as it's lethal in a good aT folks. Meals, well two options. We ended using the game and go option as it set you up  for the day.
