Totally miscategorized on Google and TripAdvisor. Simply bc you have sexy interiors with dark colors, neon signs, and a taxidermy bear doesn\u2019t make you 4 stars. Don\u2019t get me wrong, was it barely an OK value cost-wise as we received a killer rate through our company? sure, but that was the only saving grace. Location is actually very great with good restaurants nearby. Tack on the \u2018destination\u2019 fee of $25 a day (check in staff did not explain what this fee can be used for) and I would rather spend slightly more for a much more comfortable experience elsewhere. \n\nWhile lots of companies get discounts here this hotel is not a conducive working place. Sure, throw on your noise canceling headphones since it\u2019s loud in the main area and forget about taking meetings in your margarita stained fabric chair. I had to take calls in the bball court!\n\nThis is an INCREDIBLY bare bones hotel, where you get towels, hand soap, a combo hair+body wash (never a good sign of quality) and conditioner. From traveling around the world, this was the first time I was given plastic cups for our bathroom (how is this 4-stars)? Rooms are TINY for 2 people, folding desk could barely fit a MacBook Pro and some notepads, highly uncomfortable folding chair for working, no closet. Forget about using the room as an office. Hotel room itself was generally clean, with some slight wear and tear. Bed was surprisingly comfortable, pillows not so great. King rooms are RV Kings (ya the ones you buy for a mobile home) they\u2019re 4 in. in width smaller than standard king. \n\nSure, is it cool place to grab drinks a few nights, play skeeball and basketball, ya, but it\u2019s really a club like atmosphere which seems more attractive to those looking to party than to work. Gym is bare bones, there\u2019s no bench for back\/chest exercises, no cable system but you do get Peleton and treadmills. \n\nHotel staff are actually more friendly than described in reviews and the way I see it is these poor souls are over worked and over stretched running around trying to mend the shortcomings from Marriott\/corporate under investing in this hotel. Example, right after jumping in the shower the fire alarm goes off and NYFD came. Smoke billowing through the small lobby. Turns out oil was spilling everywhere in the elevator engine room \u2014 complete negligence and shows how things like routine maintenance inspections are overlooked at this hotel. \n\nHotel seems like a selfie millennial money grab (ironically I\u2019m a millennial) that cuts corners to save money, you have to ask for turn down service, robs of basic amenities like a hot water kettle, no options for q-tips, shower caps, etc and moisturizer and no proper office desk, ignores core principles of hospitality and the focus is on maximizing capitalism and OpEx than comfort and business users.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Upon arrival, there was no one available to check me in, so I was asked to go upstairs and wait in the bar with my suitcase. It was after 9 pm on Sunday night and the bar was effectively a nightclub with DJ music. Once I was finally checked in, I called down about getting food. (I had traveled all day and was hungry.) The staff indicated I could order something online, but while I was in the midst of ordering, service shut down because it was 10 pm. The staff had not advised me that service would stop in a couple of minutes when I called.\n\nThe room was also extremely small - to work on the computer, I had to sit on the bed. There was no coffee available in the room. This is not an appropriate hotel for a business traveler. It appears to be designed for 20-somethings that want to party instead. If that is you, maybe you will like it.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I called them a week after the stay and was informed I would be receiving an updated email with the correction within 15 minutes. This never happens and this was also a week ago. \n\nThe other thing that happened was after I had checked into my room I called for a toothbrush. I was told it would be sent up right away. About an hour later I called back down to ask for the status. This time another person picked up and informed me I would need to come down to pick it up myself. I politely explained that is not a problem but would have been nice if someone told me that an hour ago so I wouldn\u2019t be waiting for it and it\u2019s now past midnight.

We enjoyed the decor and the bball court and skeball game in the lobby are a favorite for our kids ages 11 and 7.  The hotel is very close and easily walkable to all Sept 11th activities like the memorial and museum.  There are plenty of restaurants around for easy breakfasts and quick dinners.  I was surprised we weren\u2019t upgraded as hotel didn\u2019t seem to be at full capacity.  We were on 7th floor facing another building with no view whatsoever. The hotel includes two bottles of water in the room which was nice.  There is no coffee maker.  You can pay $ for coffee in the lobby or grab one outside the hotel.  The on-site shop is tiny with few snacks and nothing else.  As expected, most patrons were very young.  Room very tiny.  Again as expected.  Nicely furnished though.  I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to stay more than two nights in the space with two children though.  Cramped quarters led to many toe stubbings on furniture!

The hotel is located in a good location and it takes less than a minute to get onto the subway. It\u2019s also very close to Wall Street, China Town, Brooklyn Bridge and the World Trade Centre. The property was easy to find and it has a good selection of nearby stores and restaurants. \n\nThe hotel staff were mostly very good. The luggage porter was excellent and was definitely the most helpful and friendly member of the team. The hotel reception is rather small, but I guess it does the job. The colleague that checked us in was very pleasant and helpful. However, we did drop by the reception on one occasion and the woman behind the desk was very unhelpful, blunt and rather rude.\n\nThe decor and theme of the property was fitting and rather well done. However it\u2019s most definitely a property for the younger crowd and millennials. \n\nThe room was really rather small (but this is NYC) and it had a good view. However it did lack some of the amenities that we would have wanted at our fingertips e.g. coffee facilities, but that was most likely poor planning on our behalf. \n\nIn the room the fan was either on full or auto which is rather annoying, it would be nice to be able to select a continuous low fan. The bed was comfortable however the duvet is incredibly thin, it was much more of a blanket rather than that of a duvet. We did sleep well and on the whole we found the room quiet in a busy city. \n\nYou have to take two elevators to get between ground level and your room which is rather annoying and a feature of properties that we tend to dislike. It may sound trivial, but having to wait for two elevators in a busy hotel when all you need to do is quickly get to or from your room is pretty annoying. \n\nWe wouldn\u2019t stay here again but I can appreciate that it\u2019s (Moxy) just isn\u2019t a brand of Marriott for us. Between me and my partner we stay at Marriott hotels around 300 days per year. So we\u2019re very loyal to the brand however this just isn\u2019t for us.

However trendy in a world class city as New York may be prone to high expectations. It might be the price or the brand but, as a general rule, one pays for a hotel to be served; not to be treated as a high school friend. Call the hotel and the message answering is a : Hey! What's up? I should have known better. How in an establishment answers wassup? Then, at check in, they address you by your first name. I've noticed it is a thing nowadays. Hi Bob. Ok Julie. That's cool Rob... But when on Earth we made this a \"cool\" thing?  A lady 80 years old is nowadays \"Marie or Gene\" We all have a last name and Sir or Mam is polite enough. ... Unacceptable. Then goes the preposterous offer to not clean up the room every day. Then why pay for a hotel? Must I do my own bed? They try to sell it out under \"environment care\" Really? Then where's the concern when using plastic dishes,cutlery and hundreds of plastic cups? Rooms are little but fine. However they're ageing fast due to... Cleaning! Ambiance is fun but it isn't because you choose Moxy that you appreciate engaging with staff as if they were relatives. I do understand the US has a very relax attitude to social norms. Nonetheless, some deference is expected when you are the client.  Chewing gum, texting behind the counter or laughing out loud about the last talk show in front of clients isn't customer service.  And if you are a Marriott Bon Voy elite member just forget that you've stayed hundreds of nights to gain your status. Here in Millenial's paradise to be \"elite\" brings nothing. A coupon of 10U$ ro buy you a coffee, no breakfast no upgrades offered... Sorry Moxy but you've misunderstood trendiness with lousiness. Better to advertise as a \"trendy\" Youth Hostel than a member of the Marriott family.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

We were given keys to a room but when we entered the room it was already occupied. It was very embarrassing. We returned to the check in desk where no one seemed to know what to do and they were more concerned that someone was in that room than trying to find us an alternative. After half an hour we couldn\u2019t wait any longer for them to sort it as we has a dinner reservation and theatre tickets.  They eventually found our luggage we took what we needed and went out. Fast forward 7 hours and we returned to the Moxy only for the self same receptionist, Celine, (at least that\u2019s what her necklace said) to treat us as if she had never seen us before. When I asked \u2018have you managed to find us a room \u2018 she looked blankly, asked my name and we had to start from the beginning, she explained that she saw a lot of people in a day and didn\u2019t remember us.  Now I don\u2019t doubt she checked in lots of people yesterday, but people who are given an occupied room and that you spend 30 minutes with would stick out in your memory, unless it happens frequently, but when I relayed the whole of what had happened she was totally oblivious to any if it. However we duly got an empty room, but I would have thought that a slight upgrade or a bottle of wine, or a complimentary drink at the bar would have been a nice thing for them to do considering the stress and inconvenience they caused us, but no, which is why they are getting this poor review. If they had offered a serious apology then my rating  would have been higher to reflect their thoughtfulness, good customer service and attempts to make a horrible experience better. So the room is ok, but the fan is like a subway train approaching and the bed was made with the sheet on top of the blanket (is this a weird NY thing?) so I had to remake the bed. Celine had rattled off something about complimentary water and coffee but didn\u2019t elaborate and we can find nothing in the room clarifying it so a trip to reception will be required to find out what this deal is. Sorry moxy but you only  get one chance to make a first impression and your attempt was pretty poor.

Also s\/o to Noelle, Matt and Ralphy (probably spelling the names wrong here...) What a great team! My past experience with moxy was disappointing mainly because the staff were ignorant but I will sure come back for another staycation at Downtown!\nThe only thing I could \"complain\" about is the hardware of the room. It wasn't perfect. The water pressure of the shower was very weak, and the water temperature was low (and I have a low threshold for hot water...) There is a reading light completely missing.

A lot of games\/entertainment for entertainment. Definitely suitable for young couples. \n- Check-in was quick, checkout was easy. (Rachel and Destiny helped us).\n- The bellboy was very friendly and helpful. When we were leaving, he helped to hail down a cab for us from Broadway, which was about 100meters. \n- The shower and toilet was clean when we came in. The room was tastefully decorated (even though there was no wardrobe)\n- TV came with built-in HBO and some other movie streaming applications, though you need to login to your own Netflix account\n\nDownside\n- The room does not come with breakfast\n- There was one time that we had our room cleaned, but the housekeeping did not provide any replacement towels. When we called the housekeeping team to enquire, we were informed the towel delivery had not arrived for the day - and we should expect the new towels to come in only on the next morning. If they had known about the towel delivery issues earlier, they shouldn't have taken our used towels away.

Come on... I\u2019ve stayed at other \u201cgreen\u201d properties that can manage to figure that out. \n\nWent to the bar for a nightcap, stood there for several minutes because bar tender was too busy staring at her phone making faces then ever look up for those that want to spend money.

Everything I read suggested Moxy is a fun, funky place that would be a great place to stay with our grandchild.

Forget those pictures of a neat room with a swing chair...at least if you\u2019re booking a double room. Our room was a sorta double room....actually a one and a half room. Oh, there were two double beds but one was crammed into a corner. The room was dark....ambient light but a broken, absent reading lamp with light for only one side of one bed. Okay...not horrible..\nThen we turned on the television. Sadly it was not working. I mean really? A hotel engineer tried to fix it...even brought in a new television. Still nothing. Finally we were given a new room. So we packed up and moved out. Our new room was great in comparison. Two beds with access from both sides and 3 working reading lights and voila....the much publicized hanging chair. Our grandchild was delighted...and so were we.

First time here and my room was great, clean, and nicely decorated (updated, hip, modern design with some great added features that you won't find anywhere else).  So why the low rating???  They offer a free drink at check in so I went to the bar shortly after checking in (around 4 PM) and was one of 4-5 ppl at the bar at that time...took almost ten minutes for the bartender to come by and of course the free drinks are mostly undesirable (for example, only one beer choice and it's Miller High LIfe...really?  That's the best you can do beer-wise???  Okay, whatever it's free...can overlook that for the most part.  HOWEVER, not once after that did the bartender or any of the other two bar workers come by and ask if I wanted another drink.  Interesting considering it wasn't busy at all and you'd think the reason they offer a free drink is to encourage you to go there and order more in the first place!!!  Well, I grew tired of waiting after >30 minutes and ended up going around the corner to another bar where the service was better.  Came back to Moxy hotel bar around 6 PM to grab one last drink since their Happy Hour is 5-8 PM.  I sat down near the bar itself and after 15-20 minutes I had to literally flag down a server just to place an order.  Granted by this time it was getting busy but there were also more workers (2-3 bartenders and several servers working the floor).  There was a couple sitting next to me who ordered 5-10 minutes AFTER me yet they got their drinks ten minutes before mine came!  How is that?  I notice sitting next to me on the other side is a woman who seemed to be part of the management since I noticed several workers coming to her with questions, etc. so I asked if she was part of the bar management--she said she is the director of food and beverage there.  As a result, I explained to her that the service was lackluster and left a lot to be desired.  I mentioned that last time I came through NY I stayed at the W and their bar service was spot on, as a point of comparison.  I'm a Marriott Elite member so I have visited many Marriott properties in addition to many bars in general and the service at this bar ranks among the worst I've experienced.  Moreover, all the director of food and beverage had to offer was excuses (new staff, not properly trained, short staffed overall, blah, blah, blah)...NOT ONCE DID SHE OFFER ANY RESOLUTION OPTIONS OR ASK FOR SUGGESTIONS, offer to comp my drink, offer to escalate the complaint, etc, etc.  Instead she simply went back to working on her laptop and texting on her phone and completely ignored me the rest of the time I remained there.  Unbelievable!  I'm a business owner myself and if one of my manager-position employees was this inept at handling customer complaints\/issues I would most likely replace them.  The fact is, the reason the service sucks so much at the bar is because she obviously sucks at training and sucks at doing her job in the first place.  Hence, I cannot fully blame the workers.  Won't be back here though, that much I do know.  Plenty of other venues that appreciate their customers and offer superior customer service accordingly.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I love being immersed in this beautiful, historic section of downtown with all the old architecture and cobblestone streets. There are so many views and angles here to photograph, and the Brooklyn Bridge is a short walk, or an even shorter subway or Lyft ride over to the skyline views at Brooklyn Bridge Park. These are the reasons I love this location. As for the The Moxy, it is now my hands-down favorite and top choice hotel in the Financial District! Our room was so adorable and comfortable, modern, sleek \u2013 all the nice things. Of course the rooms are small, but so is every single hotel room I've ever stayed in in NYC. The biggest perk of staying here didn't dawn on me until after we moved out of the Moxy and into another hotel in Midtown. We really missed the warm atmosphere of the Moxy Lounge, where we spent a lot of time during our stay due to lots of rain and bad weather. We also travel with our small dog, and we felt comfortable and welcome in the lounge. No one ever gave us the stink-eye, or asked us to leave when we had our pug with us in the morning over coffee, or in the evening during the cocktail hour. The lounge was so comfortable and the vibe was very welcoming and relaxed, and we really missed that once we moved on to a more cold and sterile environment in Midtown. While that Midtown hotel we moved to was nice, we felt trapped in our tiny room during the bad weather, with nowhere to hang out and relax (with or without or dog), and we wished had just booked out entire trip at the Moxy. Will definitely stay here again, it was awesome!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I have never stayed at a Moxy before, but from the street my first impression of the hotel was very positive.  The check-in station on the main level was a little small and could only handle one check-in at a time.  Luckily, we were checking in after midnight so it was not too busy.  Since I am a Gold Elite Marriott Bonvoy member, I had asked about getting a room on a high floor as I initially requested in my reservation.  There were four of us in my party, so we had reserved a room with two queen beds.  I was told that the two queen bedded rooms were only on the lower floors and I knew that was a lie, but it was too late for me to argue.  They assigned us a room on the 6th floor out of 29.  You then have to take an elevator to the 3rd floor and go through the lounge to access the room elevators.  You need to use your room keys to access these elevators get to your room floor.  We had several occasions during our stay where we had to go all the way back downstairs to have our keys re-activated.  Another issue was trying to get my mobile key to activate.  I can\u2019t count the times I tried, but after the last time I gave up.  I could never get the elevator to acknowledge my mobile key.  It would work on the room door, but not in the elevator.  When we arrived at our room, we freshened up quickly so we could get a late-night bite out.  Our sink was draining very slowly and we alerted the front desk when we went out to eat.  We knew that it would not get fixed that evening, but they told us that it would be taken care of in the morning.  When we left for breakfast we inquired again at the front desk about our sink and they said they knew nothing about it, but it would be fixed while we were out.  When we came back in the afternoon it was still not fixed.  They said it was on the maintenance list.  Again after we came back from dinner we inquired at the front desk before we went up to the room and the manager, Enoch, said that maintenance had been up there but was unable to fix the sink and they would be returning to fix it shortly.  In the meantime before we headed up to the room, I displayed my frustration with Enoch and asked about moving to a room on a higher floor as I had initially requested if they could not fix our sink.  He told me that those rooms on the higher floors were in \u201chigh demand\u201d, but he would see about moving us if they could not fix the sink.  I then confirmed with him that there were two queen bedded rooms on the higher floors.  When we arrived at our room the maintenance technician had just arrived as well.  I asked him about trying to fix the sink earlier and he told us that this was the first time he had been told about our issue and it was the first time that he came up to our room.  This was another lie from the front desk.  As it turned out, he was able to fix our sink and we had no additional issues with it during our stay.  I had requested extra towels and pillows in the Marriott App prior to our arrival, but the request went unanswered.  We called and asked for four extra pillows and two extra set of towels.  The attendant came after some time and brought two towels and only one pillow.  We asked for three additional pillows, but the attendant never came back so we went to bed.  Five out of the seven days that we stayed we had problems getting four sets of towels since there were four of us staying in the room.  On two different days they actually gave us four bath towels (I\u2019m not sure how that happened), but we never got four of everything without asking and waiting.  There was one day where we finally got four washcloths delivered just as we were leaving for the day, but we didn\u2019t have a chance to use them and they were all clean and folded on the shelf above the toilet and when we returned from dinner, they had all been taken.  I\u2019m not sure what is going on with housekeeping at this hotel.  Do they not know how many people are registered in the room?  There were no complaints about the room itself.  We knew it would be small and there would be limited storage, but at least it would have been nice if each bed had two drawers underneath.  They only had one each.  And they only gave us three hangers???  We made do though and lived mainly out of our suitcases.  The oversized shower was very nice.  The \u201cliving room\u201d was nice and we played skee ball on several nights.  That was lots of fun.  The hours that the living room bar were open were quite sporadic.  I can understand if there is no one there and they want to close early, but on two occasions there were many people still there and we were told that the bar was closed.  They do not have a business center or even a computer that you can use to access the Internet and print a page out.  I found that out at the front desk.  At about 7:30 one morning I asked if I could somehow print an email that I needed, but their printer was apparently broken.  They said the only thing I could do was wait for their administrative office to open at 8:30.  Luckily there is a Staples store nearby and I was able to do that there, but it took me at least fifteen extra minutes of my time that I did not have.  The customer service at the front desk leaves a lot to be desired.  In my opinion they need much more training on handling issues and the ones that we had were simple ones.  This is not a cheap hotel to stay at and I have had better customer service at Fairfield Inns.  The location of the hotel is excellent.  It\u2019s just a few blocks from the World Trade Center and close to several subway stations.  There is an urgent care behind the hotel (that we had to use and it was excellent) as well as two Starbucks nearby and it\u2019s close to many eating establishments.  Overall our stay was just average and very disappointing.  Had it not been for the lack of communication with housekeeping and maintenance and the spotty customer service at the front desk, we would have rated this hotel very good to excellent as the hotel itself is very unique.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

You\u2019re no more than 20 mins from anywhere in the city. There are plenty of cool spots for coffee and breakfast as well a short walks to some good restaurants and bars as well as shopping. You also are a short walk to freedom tower and the 9\/11 museum. Now for the hotel. From the time we walked up, we were met with super friendly staff who opened the door for us and took good care as they quickly checked us in. The lobby has an awesome bar with plenty of place to sit and chill or play games. (They have tons). The food and beverage program is done by the bar \u201chappiest hour\u201d. Whoever decorated the lobby did an amazing job. Now for the rooms. They were small but very well designed. No space was wasted. The bathroom was very modern and spacious. Nice tv and other amenities. The hotel was also super quiet unlike some that have paper thin walls. We slept very soundly and the bed was super comfortable. Finally when we checked out, the friendly bellman offered to arrange a car service for us to get to the airport. He took care of everything.

For starters no one was answering the phones when we dialed the operator. There was only one person in the first lobby on the first floor and throughout the evening there was NO ONE at the Bonvoy desk in the Recreation bar area. Why have a desk there if there wont be anyone there on arguably the busiest night of the week? Smh. That was not all. We had an ordeal in retrieving water as part of our gold membership. The person downstairs (the one who wouldn't answer the operator line) complained that he was busy helping guests. Why was he alone on such a busy night ? Beyond that  he was rude and nonchalant. Offered us some kind of tokens to take upstairs to claim our water. When we got upstairs we were very rudely informed by recreation staff that the two are different entities and they dont honor requests by hotel guests.

Quick to everywhere from Fulton Street metro stop. The room is clean and efficient. The lighting great. A drink token given at check in a nice touch to have a cool drink in the third floor lounge area.  The lounge area in general is an inviting space. \nCons:  Is a little bar of soap too much to ask for?  I\u2019m on board with shampoo dispensers instead of little plastic bottles\u2014for environmental reasons (although I kind of miss them).  But not even a measly little bar of soap wrapped in paper? Marriott\/Moxy has gone to far here.  Washing with shampoo\/\u201cbody wash\u201d not for everyone.  The lack of any surface area, not even for a pair of glasses or cup of coffee, in the room ( the folding table was seriously in the way when unfolded. Also while all the pegs for hanging whatever was handy, only three hangers were provided.  (There is no closet.) The hanging chair, so very trendy, was not at all comfortable\u2014 so basically other than bed, there is nowhere to comfortably sit.  There is no refrigerator\u2014 so common now, that I forgot to check beforehand.  The coffee provided in lounge is awful. Ghastly bitter mud when we tried it a few months ago\u2014 this time just weak and bitter.  The front desk people are very engaging and trying very hard, but the check in area\u2014 industrial chic\u2014 is very cramped.  And unfortunately one had the feeling that the folks working at the bar in lounge were very very very tired of honoring the nice free drink tokens given at check in.   Their begrudging attitude was such a contrast with the friendly front desk people.  While having a half basket ball court off the lounge seems so cool\u2014 it\u2019s not really when you are trying to \u201cchill\u201d in the lounge and there\u2019s the constant thump thump thump....

I heard great things and in theory, it seemed fun with the arcade and rooftop. Unfortunately, I was immensely disappointed. When checking in, Noel was sweet. She informed me where everything was of course. I told her my boyfriend will be coming to meet me in a couple of hours. She took his name down and assured he was accounted for. A few hours later, I receive a phone call from my boyfriend saying he is having a hard time at the desk. He's asking if I have the reservation confirmation number. I hear two associates in the back laughing and giggling--what's the joke? I'm unsure. I tell him to tell them to call the room. I'm not really clear what the problem can be as I left your name with them. I hear David, the associate, say \"Ohhhh why didn't you say she was in the room?\" HUH? My boyfriend finally comes up and tells me that they were searching for the reservation and couldn't find it, although it clearly wasn't under his name. When he was trying to explain, they weren't listening. This is when the female associate, my boyfriend didn't get her name, began to laugh and cover her face with a sheet a paper to conceal the laughter. I called downstairs to gain clarity and David informed me \"she wasn't laughing at him. she was laughing at me because I didn't know what I was doing.\" THAT'S what you tell guests? Listen, I've been to many hotels around NYC, but this level of unprofessionalism put the worst taste in my mouth. I was so turned off by this behavior. ALSO- before check out time, we received two bangs on the door from the housekeeper asking me \"is it time for me to clean\". I said excuse me? She goes \"You checked out yet?\" CLEARLY not. It's not check out time and I'm still in the room. This was such a disruptive experience in total. The idea of this hotel is cool and modern, but please teach your desk a thing or two about the importance of good customer service. This is my first and last time staying here.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was either the Moxy of the aLoft down the street.  I have stayed at my share of aLofts.  I wanted to try this one + it is newer and a little closer to Broadway.  I was kind of worried since this hotel is not for my age group :-)  \n\nThe location of the hotel is very convenient - just off Broadway and 1.5 blocks from the Fulton Center Subway + 3ish blocks from the WTC\/PATH and a little more from the East \/Hudson River ferries.  There is food near by - whether convenient\/drug stores, fast food, fast casual or real restaurant.  \n\nThere are 2 check-in positions on the first floor's tiny and often crowded \"lobby\".  There is also a desk on the 3rd floor bar area.  The gym is on the 2nd floor - small but works.  Water fountain does not work too well there.\n\nThe 3rd floor is cool - has a small basketball court, some games and a big bar.  Not sure what food is served (but it does serve some food).  Saturday night there was noisy and full of people.  It is a beautiful and interesting space.  I guess different people will find different uses\/lack of benefit for the space.\n\nReserved a King room and got one facing the south (i.e. no bridge view).  However, it was on a higher floor (I am a Marriott Titanium) so the view was good.\n\nI was concerned with the size of the room.  However, since I travelled light on this trip, did not even bring a computer and was there only 1 night, it was OK.  For longer trips, I think the biggest problem for me would be the lack of desk\/counter top space.  The fold-up desk is small, the small nightstand does not even have a clock, etc.  \n\nThere was also no decent chair if you were going to work on that little desk.  I think the concept is you go downstairs to work on the computer but that space is noisy, not designed for working on the computer and no privacy.  \n\nThe bathroom is great.  Nice sized shower with both on-the-wall and handheld shower heads, nice thick towels and even came with hand-washing liquid soap!  Dispensers for dual use shower\/hair soap and hair conditioner.  No lotion provided.  Tiny ironing board and safe under the bed.  No sign of any ice bucket.\n\nLighting and blind controls are cool.  Bed was comfortable.  Staff is friendly.\n\nSo, I was happy with my stay and would definitely stay here again on quick non-business trips.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

There are only 2 elevators to service the rooms(there are actually 3 but 1 is a service elevator).

Many reviews complain about the size, it is small but the pictures are accurate. The bathroom is a good size. The halls were warm & dark. I am not sure if the halls are air-conditioned. I know that they are going for a nightclub vibe type hotel but (IMO) it's weird and they should light the hallways for safety purposes. The biggest reason for the Poor review is that the air conditioning unit was EXTREMELY LOUD. So loud that I had to turn it off for my daughter to fall asleep but then I had to turn it back on because it's July in NYC & you need air conditioning!  Even when the one in your room turns off you can hear the noise for ones in other rooms. Ridiculous! I called the front desk around midnight asking for earplug & got them about 45 minutes later. That was disappointing. They helped some. They need to address the air conditioning issue. Also, the lobby smelled. I could not figure out if it was just from cleaning products & no AC in the lobby or what the smell was but it smelled. Gross. The internet & TV were out for our 24-hour stay & a previous poster said the same. I have never stayed in a hotel that cable was not working.  I called and asked & they said that it was being worked on all night & said it should be working but then called & said ...no it's not working yet. It could have helped w tuning out the AC noise or the noise from the street. I know its NYC but on the 22nd floor you don't expect much noise but there was night construction going on & when the AC turned off I had to hear the construction. I asked for a quiet room.

I found the rooms to be like glorified college dorm rooms, or a fancy hostel masquerading as a hotel. There\u2019s self check in, which I started to use only because both front desk staff were busy. But then I wasn\u2019t making any progress, a desk agent became available, and instead of offering to check me in, she just shouted instructions to me from across the lobby. \n\nThe room is small, which is no surprise because it\u2019s New York, but it\u2019s not super functional - corners are cut where they don\u2019t need to be. For example, there is a a wall full of hooks upon entering, and chairs and a luggage holder are hanging from them. There are empty hooks, but no ironing board. The ironing board is under the bed, folded in half. Oh, and it\u2019s a tabletop ironing board, which I\u2019ve not used since college. The table hangs on the walls, you pick it up, and a kickstand drops to hold the tabletop up. It\u2019s a little complicated when an ironing board would fit in the room. \n\nNoise in the hallways was a mild issue depending on volume of traffic. There\u2019s no carpet to dampen noise. The city was performing some sort of sewer maintenance until 1 or 2am each night, which for a street-facing room was unacceptable. It felt like I was inside a subwoofer. \n\nNone of the items I plugged in at night charged, either by USB or regular AC plug. That was a huge inconvenience, but since I wasn\u2019t sleeping well due to street noise, I didn\u2019t oversleep. \n\nAfter one night, I changed rooms. \n\nThere\u2019s no alarm clock, no apparent guide to the area or the hotel amenities (if they even exist). Nobody said if there was a gym where it was.\n\nI\u2019ve never stayed in a hostel, but this is what I\u2019d imagine. The room decor will not age well.

We called the front desk when we got home for the evening and were told they would send an engineer up right away. After 40 minutes, no one had come- so we called down again and were told the engineer had left for the night, then the front desk person put my husband on hold for another 15 minutes.

Hotel staff attempted to steal our luggage!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-06-11","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Moxy downtown for our wedding anniversary this past weekend for 3 nights.  While we knew that we were not going to get exceptional service from a hotel of this category, we certainly never expected to have the staff attempt to steal our luggage! Our flight yesterday was not until the evening and the hotel could only grant us a late check out until 3pm, so at this time we packed our bags and left them with the front desk clerk to store while we walked around for 1.5 hours to kill time before our flight. We each left a large suitcase and a carry-on bag.  Included in the carry-on bags were two designer handbags and a laptop.  When my husband and I arrived back at the hotel only an hour and a half later to pick up our bags and head to the airport, we were in for a real surprise. We waited for about 20 minutes for the front desk clerk to return with our bags before we began asking where she had gone as we were going to miss the airline\u2019s checked bag cut-off if she did not hurry up with our bags. We were told at this point that they \u201ccould not find\u201d our bags. We grew more and more frantic at this point, largely because we did not want to miss our flight. My husband asked to go down to the luggage room with the staff in order to look for the bags. He searched through both of the two luggage rooms and he did not see them. During this time, the staff kept coming out of the luggage room with suitcases belonging to other hotel guests. Everyone was getting their bags except for us. Knowing that we both had a lot of expensive items in our bags we became extremely suspicious and began getting very angry. We kept asking where our bags were but all the staff would say was \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d and they did not seem all that concerned to be honest. The assistant manager on duty then came out and went down to the luggage room to help look for the bags. When she did not come back up for another 20+ minutes, my husband asked to go back down to the luggage room again to find out what was going on. They said no, which made us more suspicious. We asked if there was any video surveillance that we could see and were told that the only video would be from the lobby and not in the luggage room itself. This would, however, at least allow us to see if our luggage had come out to the lobby and been provided to another guest (which we already knew was not possible as we had a claim ticket with a claim number and also I don\u2019t think another hotel guest would just take off with 4 pieces of luggage not belonging to them!). Meanwhile, the front desk clerk who I had given the luggage tags to in order to retrieve our bags in the first place never came back up once and was not seen again during the entire ordeal. She also happened to be the employee who checked our bags in the first place. It is our opinion that this employee, whether acting alone or with other employees, intended on stealing our luggage (or specific items contained in our luggage). It was not until my husband became very angry and actually made it known he was on the phone with the police that our bags miraculously appeared, about an hour after we first provided the claim ticket to the front desk clerk. The assistant manager claims the bags were found in a \u201cthird luggage room\u201d (they had only ever mentioned there were two luggage rooms during the entire ordeal) and said the bell man must have put them there because there was \u201cno room\u201d in the other two rooms. If this was the case, I highly doubt that they would not have searched this room at the start and I also highly assume that ours would not be the only pieces of luggage in this room. We firmly believe that an employee hid the luggage in this random room with the intention of going through the bags later in the day and taking items of value. The bags would then randomly appear back in the luggage room and the hotel would phone us to let us know they \u201cfound\u201d our bags. And when they were returned back to us back in Toronto that is when we would discover our valuable items were missing. The assistant manager even tried to get us to leave to the airport while they continued to \u201csearch\u201d for the luggage indicating she would contact us if they were found. She indicated the hotel would cover any costs to us for missing our flight, but our biggest issue was losing our luggage, not the flight. These were our personal items, many with important personal significance and these things cannot be replaced. It seems odd she would even consider this option. We were not leaving there without our luggage! We were very fortunate that our flight ended up being delayed by about 25 minutes. We actually missed the baggage cut-off even with the flight delay and we luckily were able to convince the airline attendant to put our bags through after much negotiation. We have never experienced anything like this in all our years of travelling. I should also mention that another hotel guest I encountered in the lobby during the ordeal told me that her necklace had been stolen from her room. So evidently theft is a common occurrence in this hotel. We certainly will never return. We are extremely disappointed in the way the assistant manager and the other employees handled this situation - they had no concern at all and did not even attempt to show remorse or be helpful. We will be contacting the manager and also intent to escalate things to Marriott. If you are considering staying at this hotel I highly suggest you find another hotel - there are plenty of other great options in the city. This place was nothing but a nightmare come true!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our bed had reading lights too. Hot shower, with hand held shower wand, a nice touch. Nice towels. Good supply of quality shower gel & hair conditioner in pumps - much better for the environment than those smaller bottles that other hotels give away. \nShower had a peep hole - a window that you could cover - which was fun, but it\u2019s not for everyone. \nWe didn\u2019t mind the hanging system, you have to take the stool off the wall to sit on it - for example  (also no closet - just hang your clothes on the wall) but we have older relatives who would not liked any of it. It might also be a pain if you have toddlers and you were tired after a long day of travel, but I guess it depends on your level of energy. The mini table folded on to the wall to get out of the way. Rooms are small - as others have said - but we didn\u2019t mind, it was designed well, so it\u2019s functional. Our room had a window that opens to get free air which is rare in hotels and can be a godsend if your room smells bad from food or whatever.  I think many of the rooms had windows that open. \nOur teen loved this hotel. It was hipster heaven. The staff was very nice and overall the hotel had good value.\nWiFi in room was not strong. \nFree coffee in the mornings in Recreation bar\/hangout on the third level. Recreation bar had drag races one night, a DJ, and a comedy night. We got 2 complimentary drink vouchers when we arrived. \nAs others have mentioned - to get to your room you go up one set of elevators then walk across bar\/Recreation then wait for another elevator. \nOnly 2 of the 3 elevators were working but it never was a problem for us. \nOnce you get the second elevator you have to swipe your room key to get to your floor - great for security but sometimes hard to do if you\u2019re holding food etc. \nFor those and other reasons I would say it\u2019s not a great place to stay if you\u2019re older, or if you\u2019re high maintenance, or have mobility issues. Like some of my relatives.  They wouldn\u2019t have been able to get out of the hanging chair. But we did see older people there so if you\u2019re spry it\u2019s certainly possible. The hotel might have wheelchair and limited mobility rooms with a different design - we didn\u2019t ask.  The main hotel entrance and elevator was wheelchair-friendly. \nStaff was awesome - helped us print boarding pass, got us car service to airport, all of them were friendly and very knowledgeable.  \nIf you\u2019re hungry you must try the Pusilli Panini place - very close to Moxy, giant Italian sandwiches. Read the reviews.\nClose to Fulton Street subway, 24 Hour CVS, and plenty of restaurants.  \nThanks so much for everything Jhirette, Noelle, James & Ralph. \nWe would love to stay here again if it doesn\u2019t become too pricy as word gets out - it\u2019s a new hotel, less than a year old.

Other than that lobby- bar area is a really nice hub and great for having food, chilling or working and the bar staff was friendly there. The customer service overall was a big let down, I had to change rooms as I found lots of hair in my bed from the previous guest . I found that the staff had a bit of an attitude and didnt say sorry for the incident and making me move in my night gown ready to go the bed after long travel. Trendy, good location, but lacks cleanliness and customer service. ","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was an across the board indifference from everyone we spoke with. There is no coffee in the hotel room, so one day I went down to the lobby, got a coffee and then went to the bar to pay for it (cost twice what they charge at the Starbucks BTW). The bartender grumbled at me and said \"next time get coffee there\", he pointed across the room and walked away. I never saw another place to get coffee  and still have no idea what he was pointing at. Literally I could detail 5 different experiences that were just like that. I wish I could say there was one person who was kind or hospitable, but from the check in process to them storing our bags on the way out it was one cranky person after another. Add that to the cramped, excessively minimalist rooms and it definitely isn't a hotel I'd go back to.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We came in after dinner on Friday night and the DJ was blasting Backstreet Boys. I loved it, my fianc\u00e9 said in the elevator, \"I am officially too old for this hotel.\"\n\nRoom is small, but I knew what we were signing up for. I LOVED the media system on the TV and how you can either manually sign out of all your services or you'll be signed out at checkout. I mean, loved. I could connect my Spotify to the TV via Bluetooth, watch my Hulu, Netflix, all of it. Well done, Moxy.\n\nLoved the location. Easy to catch the subway to everything. There was a Shake Shack just around the corner, along with a Zara. Ubers and Lyfts had a pretty hard time finding us because their GPS kept wanting to drop us off on the opposite side of the block from the hotel entrance (there's only one, on Ann St., but GPS wanted to drop us off on Fulton St.), but I figured out the best way to direct drivers by the 3rd or 4th pickup. It was COOOOLD and windy, but that's to be expected in early February. Loved Brookfield Place a few blocks away!\n\nThe shower had fine water pressure. Water didn't get nearly hot enough for me, but I also take boiling lava-temperature showers, so few hotels meet this standard. Didn't mind the hooks instead of a closet, was just kind of tough to find places to set our luggage that wasn't the floor. Loved the cool cage chair. Would have liked a nightstand on both sides of the bed, there was only one. I took that one so I could use my CPAP machine.\n\nI was so excited to listen to the bedtime stories, but our phone did not work! Couldn't even reach the front desk. Totally dead.

The front desk staff was very polite. John, the engineering on the night shift, is AMAZING and, honestly, saved my opinion of the hotel.\nThe Neutral: The hotel is definitely geared toward a younger crowd. \nThe Bad: The TV and streaming services need work and the WiFi needs to be secure. The hotel is fairly new and the staff seem to need some additional training on the protocols specific to the hotel (like how to get ice). Also, it needs to be much easier to get ice.\n\nLonger review:\nI stayed here for a few days last weekend. I was in town for my best friend's 30th birthday weekend, so we had this whole weekend planned to take the most advantage of our limited time. \n\nCheck-In: The check-in process was a breeze for me. There was someone else in the lobby who was having issues checking in because of the credit card on file (it was a work trip) and, though he was trying to keep it together, was clearly starting to fray at the edges. The front desk staff didn't falter at all and kept a very pleasant demeanor and tried to fix the problem without adding to the customer's stress.\n\nGetting up to the room was tricky (you have to take the elevator in the lobby to the third floor, walk around the edge of the loud and crowded bar\/rec area, then take another elevator up to your floor). \n\nThe room: The room was small, but it's NYC, so that's what I expected. I thought they used the space well. Another reviewer mentioned that there's no iron or board, but I found it in the drawer under the bed.\n\nThe TV: \nThis was a CHALLENGE. My best friend lives in Canada and he's been waiting to see the new season of the Magicians, which isn't available for streaming in Canada. So, I checked on the hotel website to ensure that I could stream Hulu at the hotel, and it said I could. When I got into my room I could watch Hulu, but I couldn\u2019t use any of the premium features (like Live TV or watch certain shows like the Magicians). I contacted Hulu support and they said it was for one of two reasons: 1. The TV was made before 2016, or 2. The hotel needed to update the Hulu app. And thus, began a many-houred saga of trying to fix this issue.\n\nI called down to the front desk. They said that, since the hotel is only around 6 months old, the TV was new, so they would send up an engineer to look at it. The engineer from the night shift (a man named John with the patience of a saint and excellent customer service) came up and, after hearing the issue, informed me that they contract with an outside company for TV software and app maintenance. Long story short, hours later, he had had that company reset and update my TV 3 times with no luck. We tried Chrome Casting to the TV from my laptop, but there was a HUGE lag between the image and the sound. In the end, I just ended up buying the episodes from YouTube and watching it on the YouTube app on the TV, but I shouldn't have had to. I also should not have had to go through the saga to begin with. I know this is a new place and they're still ironing out the kinks, so I'm giving them a bit of a pass on not knowing about this, but I hope they are more aware in the future.\n\nThe ICE: As John and I spent a while together trying to fix my TV, we chatted. So, he found out I had just had a minor outpatient ortho procedure earlier in the day. He asked if I wanted some ice. I had honestly been so distracted by trying to get things set up for my friend's bday celebration, I hadn't even noticed how much pain I was in, or that there were no ice buckets in the room. I let him know I would go get it from the machine. Apparently, you have to ORDER ice at this hotel. There is not an ice machine on the floor or one accessible to guests. John, again, cannot say enough good things about him, got me some ice and told me that if I needed more tomorrow or later in my stay I should contact the front desk.\n\nThe next day, I needed more ice. I called the front desk and they told me I needed to go down to the bar, which I did. I then stood there for a while without being helped, despite trying to wave someone down. I guess it was my mistake wearing my PJs down to the bar instead of something more hip *sigh*. I finally got someone's attention and he told me that I needed to call the front desk, which I told him I had, and that they should have sent some up to my room. He got me ice anyway, but, seriously, getting a bag of ice should not be this hard.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

It was our first experience and there were pro's & con's from our stay. First, the con's: 1. The hotel is located on Ann Street which is very narrow road. The hotel does not have even one designated parking spot in front of the entrance for off-loading your luggage so the choices are to either double park & hold up traffic or drive around the block a few times. 2. You have to take the elevator up to the third floor and then switch to another elevator bank which takes you to your floor. This appears to be set up this way so that you have to walk through the bar & arcade area. It's inconvenient. 3. We were given two tokens when we checked in and were told that each token could be used for a special hotel cocktail at the third floor bar. My wife ordered the special hotel cocktail at the bar and when she presented the token to the bartender, she (the bartender) said the token was only for the smaller version of the drink, not the size she made and that we would have to pay for the drink. I informed her that no one at the front desk told us this and that she should have told us their policy before serving the cocktail. I refused to pay for the drink and the bartender got angry and informed my wife and I that \"she doesn't make the rules\". I didn't pay for the drink. 4. If you are in the mood for a cocktail that is not on their cocktail menu, it will cost you $21.00!!! 5. They serve coffee but no decaf. 6. They spent a lot of money on fancy furnishings in the rooms and other areas however, we had very poor water pressure in our room which made for a disappointing shower. 7. Even though we were on an upper floor (11), the noise level from the Saturday over night construction activities and garbage pickup was high. 8. There is only one thin pillow provided per person. Now, the Pro's: 1. Great location-only a block from the World Trade Center, Trinity Church & City Hall. 2. Great flat screen TV in our room with a good selection of channels. 3. Our room & the hotel was very clean. 4. The service (except for the bartender) was very good.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As such it does its job very well.  Those who gave low reviews for lack of pampering and attention are a bit unfair because it doesn't claim to be a JW Marriott.  We are at least 10 years away from passing for millenials but really enjoyed this place.  The rooms are well designed, innovative and fun.  Certainly minimalist and on the small side consistent with NYC and then some.  We had the deluxe king, assumedly the largest room in the place and I would say it was barely 150-160 s.f. including the tiny box bathroom.  Not a problem for us but if you are a family or if that bothers you, look elsewhere.  The fit and finish of the room was not bad, nice beds and bedding, fun swing (though a tight squeeze if you are tall), good TV and sound, electric blinds, folding chairs, and cork flooring, something I've never seen in a hotel.  Lights fairly impossible to figure out, as with many new hotels.  HVAC too loud. Bathroom is tight but functional.  Bar got loud at times and as noted you do have to traverse it to switch elevators.  One elevator was broken while were there, causing annoying delays on the other two. We enjoyed the games and the free signature drink there though and would definitely hang out there more if we were bar people.  Breakfast was decent and appreciate the free coffee and interesting herbal teas, though I would suggest that for fourteen bucks they could serve more than one single slice of avocado toast in an order.  They gave us the appropriate Marriott status benefits, though limited at Moxy brand.  Location is great if you want to be downtown.   Staff was friendly and fairly efficient and we experienced none of the checkin or service problems others mentioned.  Overall I would say this is a very solid choice, if you are youngish at heart and don't need to be fussed over, don't mind smallish rooms and taking some time to figure out the way things work, and if you can get it for a good price like we did.  It is an interesting brand and marketing, and based on the crowds of millenials there, it looks like it is working.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is quite invisible on the street level as there is just a sign and a small lobby where you can check in using ipad kiosks or with an agent. Elevator takes you three floor up to the real lobby which was more like a hip and trendy club on this Friday evening. From there up to the 19th floor to my upgraded city view room. The room was small as expected and as typical in New York, but it was extremely sleek and modern with all the basics. Clean and nice bathroom with peeking window to the room, excellent bed and electric blinds. When checking in, I received a chip which I could use for free drink in the lounge. I took their signature drink which was great. Lots of restaurants, bars and shops close by and only five minutes walk to South Street Seaport.

When we returned, it took almost 10 minutes for the bell to bring the luggage up. Seemed to be understaffed. Because of what I assume was big turnover the night before, our room didn't have the Marriott room preferences like extra pillows. I used the app to request extra pillows. 6 hours later, no extra pillows, but the task was marked \"complete.\" I asked on the app again, and did not receive a reply until after I had checked-out, over 12 hours later asking what they could do.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":14095381,"title":"Definitely for  Millennials","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-03-12","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Before I launch off into my review, let me preface this with the following.  I am a long-term Marriott business traveler who has used many of their different lines for service.  For those of you not aware, the Moxy line of hotels is NOT targeted towards business travelers, but my schedule forced me to book this last minute.  It is a line that is targeted for millennials, fun and simplicity.  Those of you with 5 star, frequent traveler expectations need not stay here.  That goes the same for families.  Please curb your expectations if you fall into one of these two categories as your bad reviews are a little undeserved.  I get that the price point is phenomenal.  But, this is meant to be a high end hostel replacement.  It\u2019s a place meant for fun, not a high end stay.  With that said, here are my thoughts.  The pros:  The hotel is clean and conveniently located to what seems like every subway line to get uptown (2 blocks away).  The lobby is hip and fun with lots to do and a decent tasty food service.  It turns into a club vibe by happy hour complete with a DJ, flashy lighting and fun games.  I noticed this place was very clean.  It looks like they fixed a lot of the \u201cnew hotel\u201d kinks where cleaning wasn\u2019t up to par.  Both the public spaces (including restrooms), the hallways and the rooms were clean.  I was upgraded to a room with a beautiful view.  Now for the room, it\u2019s simple, but works.  The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom has cute details such as a window in the shower (yes, you can close it).  There is free HBO and access to your online accounts such as Netflix on the TV.  The toiletries were nice.  I did not use the gym.  I did, however, go down to the bar and the bartenders were nice and helpful to everyone (one even gave the group next to me better recommendations to fine tune their bill).  The cons:  As mentioned, this isn\u2019t the best hotel for business travelers or families.  I noticed a few kids.  Don\u2019t bring them here.  The downstairs is not appropriate for them, even with the skeeball.  It\u2019s basically a club.  Working downstairs is great, until Happy Hour when the beat gets pumping.  The room has no dresser or closet.  KNOW THAT!  You will be keeping all your belongings in your suitcase.  Not a huge issue as I was done with meetings.  But, some may hate it.  They provide 2 hangers that attach to the wall.  So, you do have a spot for your coat.  While the swing is cool, there is just one other foldable chair provided which no one above 120lbs will be able to use.  They do not provide lotion.  So, bring some.  Now for the worst part.  The headboard has these attached lamps for reading, night light etc.  They are horrible!  They are situated so that you will konk your head on them when you sit up.  Trust me.  You will also smack your face into them when you reach to get your phone if you are trying to charge using the outlets next to the bed.  There is no nightstand.  So, you\u2019re forced to lay it on the swing or the floor.  Floor = hit your head\/face.  I suffered this injury, unfortunately.  I have now tried to file an incident report twice, which leads me to the staff.  They have staffed this place with millennials with no attention to customer service.  Are they hip and cool looking?  Yes.  Do they want to HELP you?  Depends on when they are done looking at their phone.  The front desk is a small stand at the entrance with young individuals.  Check-in was painless, but check-out was a melee with two \u201cworkers\u201d unprepared to service both incoming and outgoing at once.  I called to file an incident report and even then, no one really wanted to help me with the poor front desk guy admitting \u201cI have no clue how to even service a complaint.\u201d  After a bit of a hold, the Director did not even want to hear the details of my complaint.  She cut me off with the \u201cplease email me\u201d response.  In conclusion, my stay was fine and I managed to keep my expectations in check knowing who this line is targeting.  However, I feel the need to call them out on their customer service.  Being hip does not mean you have to forget you are still a Marriott and that customer service is important, no matter who the guest may be.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We had reservations for the Chelsea location but construction was delayed so we switched our reservation to this location. I had some hesitation about staying downtown but it was a great location. It\u2019s only a block away from the Fulton Street station and two blocks from the Freedom Tower. CVS and Starbucks are right around the corner. There\u2019s a Zara at the end of the block. Banks are close as is the Apple Gourmet deli which has great breakfast sandwiches. If you\u2019re easily creeped out by the city you might feel a little unsafe but I\u2019m a native New Yorker and I felt fine walking the streets at night with my friends. Not a sketchy or unsafe area. You also have Aloft hotel one block over and many bars and restaurants within walking distance. We took Lyft to Morton\u2019s Steahouse because it wa Restaurant Wee. The food is incredible but the service horrendous. Our room was a decent size. It\u2019s what I expect every year we visit the city. I love the concept of pegs on the wall and minimal furniture. If you open the drawer under the bed you\u2019ll find an iron and foldable ironing board. There\u2019s a robe in the room as well. There\u2019s only one pillow so request more right away If that\u2019s a problem for you. Housekeeping service may be slow when you call down. Bring your streaming device if you want to watch your shows or simply sign in on the tv and you have the option to erase your private data before you check out. The entry to the hotel is nothing spectacular unfortunately. The Times Square location is more impressive. But the staff are very friendly and welcoming and helpful. You go up the elevator to the third floor then go right and make a left to go to the next set of elevators that take you to your room. Very simple but I know some may complain. The basketball court is so cool and was well used by our husbands. The bar Recreation is a cool concept but during our stay there very boring and quiet. Even the DJ didn\u2019t play great music to encourage dancing. That was disappointing. We got a free drink token and had the signature drink. It had some grapefruit flavor. It wasn\u2019t bad at all. Don\u2019t come to this hotel expecting your typical Marriott stay. It doesn\u2019t have room service, closets, free breakfast, etc. but it was more than sufficient for us to stay and have a great time. Beds are comfy and view was great.

From the Moxy Advertisement that pops up on the TV at blasting volume when turned on, it seems the Moxy is being offered as a place to LET LOOSE!, BE CRAZY!, PARTY! Sounds like they are asking for the rooms to get trashed. Maybe that's why the rooms look like they are decorated on a budget.   In the trend of Ian Schrager hotels, the room has a very small footprint with hyper-stylized but poorly functioning or ill considered furnishings. The bed is comfortable enough, but the clearance between the foot of the bed and the wall is about 1.5 feet. In this space, against the wall is a folding table. This table is essentially useless. You can't sit at it, it's hard to eat off of, if it's down you can't get past the bed. I tried to iron a shirt, but could not find a board or iron. The front desk informed me that it's tucked under the bed. Unfolded, the ironing board fits nowhere in the room where it's possible to easily iron something, certainly not on the fold out table. I was also puzzled by some wooden objects hanging on the same wall which turned out to be folded stools. Didn't bother trying to sit on one, as there was little space to put it. There is no closet, not dresser or any type of drawer for clothes, oh, and no hangers, only hooks on the wall. There is one mod iron basket like chair hanging on a chain next to the bed. Not comfortable, but maybe the designers thought creative people could use it as a sling, I mean a swing?\nThere is also no room service and no restaurant in the hotel. There is a large 3rd floor space called, RECREATION, where you can play chess, skee ball, get a drink at the bar, or sit and ignore people while you work on your laptop. When enter the hotel, you are going to ask where you check in. It's that little desk to the right where one or two dispassionate staff might be stationed. If you don't want to deal with them, you can do the work and check yourself in at the little computer pads against the window. The most remarkable thing in the 'lobby' is a giant video screen over the elevators that you have to crane your neck up to see, meaning, you can't back up far for a better view, the 'lobby' is very narrow.\nThere are some newish technology features in the room, like recessed LED lighting, an electronic shade, and a bluetooth capable TV, but there is also no ON DEMAND service on the TV. The bathroom is fine.\nLook, if you are a tourist and plan on spending minimal time in the room, I suppose it's fine. If you are planning on hanging out in the room, I'd suggest somewhere that offers furnishings less reminiscent of IKEA. ","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"NONE"}

There were kiosk to check-in and even a virtual key you could use through your Marriott app.  The bar was really cool with Ski-ball, shuffleboard, and a great lounge area.  The room was one of the coolest we've probably stayed in.  The only downsides were the amount of storage space is very small, but for our weekend stay it wasn't a problem.  And the water pressure was a little lacking, other than that we really enjoyed our stay.  My only advise would be to do a little research before you book.

I asked for late checkout and was given late checkout at 5.30pm (There was a 5th night free deal but I do not need that and instead asked for early evening checkout). However, on the day that I was suppose to check out, the reception started calling my room at 4+pm, almost every 10 to 15mins and sending people to knock my room door.

It was the cheapest I could get with my Starwood points, and happened to relatively close to the subway I needed for my conference in Brooklyn (I wound up taking a Lyft, but that was fine, too, since the Moxy is far enough downtown that it made crossing to Brooklyn relatively painless). \n\nMy spouse and I are SPG Gold, but we were placed in a room on the 7th floor, meaning they didn't seem to care about our status (first world problems, I know, but what's the point of having status if it's not going to be honored?). My spouse checked in before me, and he let me know via text that teenagers were running the front desk. When I arrived several hours later, I found that to be accurate. Picking up a key from the front desk after my spouse left my name and his room number wasn't an ordeal, but was definitely not the seamless process it would have been at other SPG hotels. (I don't have a ton of experience with Marriott, so maybe it would have been.)\n\nThe room itself was fine, very minimalist with hooks instead of closets, no safe, etc. The shade in our room was broken, but we told someone about it the next day, and they sort of fixed it--instead of not being able to go down at all, it went down all the way but only came up half way. \n\nWhen I walked into the bathroom, I knew the Moxy was made with white Millennials in mind--there is no lotion. I've stayed at the Aloft and other \"no frills\" hotels, but there's always lotion. Ask any person of color (especially an African-American), and I guarantee you they will say they use lotion every day. This hotel had none, which means they were not thinking about people of color when they created it. Luckily, I bring my own, but it would have been really annoying to have had to go buy some because my hotel was only thinking of white people when they created it. \n\nThe gym was minimalist, but fine, with some weights and nice, new treadmills and ellipticals, and fitness bands. There's some floor space, so as long as it's not crowded, you can do floor work fairly easily. And there's wipes to sanitize the equipment after you use it, but no trashcan. And there are towels, but no bin for used towels... No frills is one thing, but these things just seemed to be lack of attention to detail. There is a bathroom, so you can throw things away there, but it's unmarked, just a random door, which I didn't know was a bathroom until a worker went in and came out. \n\nOh, and the elevators kept going out. My best guess is someone, maybe a cleaning person, would hold elevator around the 8th floor, thereby sticking it so no one else could use it. There are three elevators for ~30 floors, so each one is needed. \n\nAlso, when you arrive on the 3rd floor bar\/lobby, you'll see a sign to the right that says \"Rooms\" with an arrow pointing to the right. Go in the opposite direction to get to the elevators. In daylight, you'll see that on the other side of that \"Rooms\" sign is the word \"Rest.\" I and so many others made the mistake of walking around the floor, only to find the elevators in the opposite direction. For the love of God, Moxy, please change that.\n\nDriving home the white Millennial thing, the decor in the bar area is very 80s nostalgic, and the music on weekend nights corresponds, reminding these white 30somethings of their childhood. Lotion aside, I am a Black Millennial who felt pretty out of place as a result, so I'm not inclined to stay at the Moxy again. But I'm sure my white friends would love it, so I'll recommend it to them.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
