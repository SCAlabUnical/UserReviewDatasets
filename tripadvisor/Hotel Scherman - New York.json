If you are looking for a big, steel and glass hotel, this is not it. It is very much a European style boutique hotel. Located right in Hells Kitchen area,  it is surrounded by jazz clubs and restaurants. Even though it is just 2 blocks from the theatres and Times Square, the hotel rooms are extremely quiet, very unusual for NYC! There is no lobby, but the rooms are large and yet cozy, and the bathroom and walk in shower have lots of room to move around in. A very large continental breakfast is provided each morning on the charming mezzanine with lots of choices of breads, fruits, cereals and hard boiled eggs. We had some unexpected issues with the plumbing and the manager quickly moved us to a new room and provided a nights refund. We would definitely choose this lovely hotel again for its comfort and great location for attending the theatre and great restaurants!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was immaculately clean and well presented. \nEXTREMELY comfortable beds with crisply laundered sheets. \nKitchenette well equipped with cutlery, crockery, fridge (well stocked with complementary water on our arrival), microwave and coffee machine. \nTasteful decor and absolute luxury to have a balcony with a skyline view. It was lovely to be able to sit outside at the end of a busy day of sightseeing and relax with these views.\nDespite the hotel\u2019s superbly central location (very short walk of 1.5 blocks to Times Square, and on restaurant row - too many fantastic restaurants to chose from), our room was completely quiet at all times except for the hum of the air conditioning. We didn\u2019t need the ear plugs we\u2019d brought and slept fantastically well with no disturbance at all. This was a really pleasant surprise. \nThe bar downstairs is great - we were able to leave the teens in our room and go downstairs for a drink in the evening, which was a big treat. We also had some Mexican food in there one night, which was delicious. \nFantastic breakfast included in room rate - really plentiful, continental style. Sets you up for the day ahead. \nFront desk was manned at all times, which is reassuring and helpful in case of needing advice or assistance. \nWe felt safe when coming and going from the hotel both day and evening. \nWe paid around \u00a3630 per night, which included breakfast. We thought this was exceptionally good value for the experience, having researched a lot of other hotels in the city.

A good choice of croissants, toast, bagels with a variety of spreads and cream cheese amongst other things. The breakfast space was cheery and bright. The locality is fab. Easy reach of lots of places you\u2019ll want to see including all the main theatres. I\u2019m not a big fan of Times Square but if you like it\u2019s hustle and bustle then is just round the corner.

It's just feet away from tons of restaurants, including Sicily, a brand new Italian restaurant that we went back to repeatedly to taste the whole delicious menu.\n\nWe had a suite on the 4th floor, facing away from Restaurant Row, and it was unbelievably quiet! You couldn't hear a thing! We didn't even know there were small kids in the room next door until we met them at the elevator. And you couldn't hear any of the restaurants around blasting music until you opened the front door downstairs. \n\nThe entire staff was lovely. The front desk remembered what shows we were seeing and asked us how we liked them. Breakfast staff and housekeeping were also kind and friendly. \n\nThe 2 bedroom suite was great.

The elevator jolted and then got stuck between two floors and the buttons stopped working. We pressed the \u201chelp\u201d button numerous times, called out loudly for help several times, banged on the door, and called the front desk by phone several times with no response.\u00a0 We had to seek help from another guest that we knew who was staying at the hotel who walked down the stairs to the front desk to alert the associate. At that point, an unmasked front desk associate was able to get us out but acted extremely unapologetic about the situation.\u00a0 We were very upset by this experience, mainly because we could not get in touch with a staff member and we had no idea when we were going to get let out. I do want to add that it was a 90+ degree day. \n\nI am fully aware that the owner\/general manager of this hotel will give a snarky and unprofessional reply to this review, as he has done with several other poor reviews, and that he will make it seem as though my group was was \u201cchallenging\u201d and therefore they didn\u2019t owe us the common decency of a sincere apology or any form of reparation for this traumatic event that happened under their roof.

The hotel's top priority is the safety and health of guests and staff, and they do the best they can at balancing these concerns with creating a pleasant stay.\n\nHotel Scherman is a great choice, particularly for travelers without children. The location couldn't be better, right on Restaurant Row, which is lined with restaurants and bars to match any taste. To facilitate outdoor dining, the street is closed to vehicular traffic, which makes for a fun vibe (lots of drinking and carousing, so not really \"kid friendly\"). \n\nBe aware that the location is VERY noisy during evening hours (particularly on weekend nights) as you get to enjoy (?) the music and conversation from the restaurants on the block. If it's 9 pm, and you want some relaxation and quiet, you won't get it. New York City now has a curfew, so the noise ends promptly at 11 pm.\n\nThe room was nice, recently renovated and relatively large for a New York hotel. The refrigerator and sink are greatly appreciated. A downside for me is that some locations in the hotel are rather dark and have no view. My room had no direct sunlight, which was a downer.\n\nThere is a REALLY nice roof deck that would be divine in good weather. Spectacular view, lots of seating.\n\nAs with most hotels in the city right now, rates at the Hotel Scherman are a steal. Check online booking sites before paying full price.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Reception area is a bit small, which made me wonder how it will be like during peak season when there are tons of people booking a room. The room is what made me say hey, this is not a bad place! Room is very clean, & the vintage touch added to the distinct experience. The following day we had our breakfast, which is mostly bread and fruits, plus drinks, although I prefer having bacon, but I guess they just want to stay true to the French experience. We decided to check out early to watch Macy'sparade since we didn't know if we can be back before the 11 AM checkout time. However, we found the Macy's parade too crowded, so we went back to the hotel.  That's around 9 AM. Now, this is where the 5 stars became 4 stars. We asked the staff if it's possible to go back to the room so we can rest. The staff just said \"No, you already checked out, we already stripped the room\". That's it. Yes, we know we checked out, but no options given? If I am a staff there I would probably say, \"I'm sorry your room is no longer available, however, if you want to rest you can stay at our bar. You'll enjoy it there, and you can even try our wine. For a fee of course\". We would have probably really tried it. Or the customer service stops once the guests already checked out? Makes me wonder. Still, it's a great place, I wouldn't deny that. But probably not recommend it to friends.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":1415127,"title":"Amazingly horrible experience with this hotel","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-09-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"My fiance actually booked this hotel for an all girls trip because of the great reviews it had received, the hotel's location to the Theater District, and the hotel's website description of the rooms and amenities.  My daughters (ages 26, 22, and 12) and I were really excited about spending five days in Manhattan together before school began in mid-August.  Unfortunately, we left this hotel after only one night due to the extremely poor customer service we experienced by the night clerk and the owner\/manager of the property. \n\nWhen we asked for bottled water (which is listed as a service offered by the hotel on its website), we were told 'to drink out of the tap\" by the night clerk.  He did not offer us any assistance in finding any nearby stores which sold bottled water either.  While my older daughters went out to find bottled water, my youngest daughter and I went up to the room.  I noticed there were only two sets of towels in there for four of us, so I went downstairs to ask the night clerk for more towels.  He was busy chatting up two young ladies who were explaining how far they had to walk to find grapes in the city at this time of night.  I finally had to excuse myself for interrupting their conversation, and asked for extra towels for the room.  I offered to take them now if the towels were on hand so as to not interrupt his conversation further.  The night clerk explained that he would have to go up to the fourth floor to get them and would bring them to the room.  He did so in a relatively timely manner.\n\nThe air conditioning thermostat in our room could not be lowered past 70 degrees.  I have a difficult time sleeping in temperatures above 68 degrees.  I went downstairs to ask about the temperature setting, and the night clerk told me he would have to manually adjust the temperature in our room.  He was watching a movie on his laptop, and let me know that it was okay to use the telephone in the room to call him instead of coming downstairs to speak with him directly.  This was sometime around 3 a.m.  Exhausted from a long day of travel, I finally fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning after breakfast, I decided to let senior management know of the rude treatment I had received from the night clerk.   This led me to speaking with the Owner\/ Manager, Eric Ord.  Eric told me there was no customer service issue, and that he had received complaints about me from other guests on how I treated the night clerk.  Further, he told me that his hotel does not supply bottled water because New York has spent an ENORMOUS amount of money to have the best tap water in the world.  He also told me the night clerk was correct in asking me to use the telephone instead of coming downstairs to speak with him.  Finally, he said that I owed him extra money for the two additional guests in my room who were not on the initial reservation and for whom towels were not supplied.  I had to show him a copy of my prepaid Expedia reservation which listed FOUR people as hotel guests.  This was the only apology I received, but it was made clear that this was Expedia's fault -- not the hotel's.\n\nBeing thoroughly insulted, I did the one thing that any person with a modicum of self-respect would so:  we found other accommodations and left.  When I informed Eric of our intent to leave, he said it was fine with him but our reservation was non-refundable.  He told us, \"Good luck\" as we handed in our three room keys and left.\n\nIt would seem that our experience is completely out of character with that of others' experiences with this hotel given the overall ratings.  However, if one reads other reviews posted on this and other business review websites about French Quarters NYC, one will see first-hand the way this hotel's staff interacts with its guests.  If you say there weren't enough hangers in the closet, Eric will kindly tell you it's because you didn't ask for more.  If you had a problem with your room, Eric will tell you it could be easily remedied by lowering your expectations for they are a modest, but chic boutique hotel.  If you had a less than stellar encounter with staff, it's basically YOUR problem.\n\nI really hesitated leaving such a negative review, but my experience with this hotel was so horrible that I feel it necessary to warn others.  My fiance and I thought it was over when we successfully reversed the unused portion of the hotel reservation with our credit card company.  But, alas...no, it isn't.  We found out yesterday that French Quarters NYC has charged the remaining balance on my daughter's credit card which was put up for room incidentals at check-in.  She and her husband are active military and stationed at Ft. Meade in Maryland.  \nMy daughter was told, \"You ladies behaved so appallingly at our front desk, abusing staff, that other guests came to me afterwards to complain about your conduct. ...We are a small elegant old world Boutique B&B, not a flashy party hotel with mini-bar and room service.  Thanks, Eric\"  Not quite sure how a mother and her 3 daughters (including one minor child) could be characterized as \"party girls\" for asking for bottled water and a little a\/c in NYC during the summertime....but, okay....\n\nLet this review serve as a prime example of exactly what kind of people one is doing business with when staying at the French Quarter NYC.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel we typically stay in is closed and appears to be undergoing reservations.  We were looking for a room with a bedroom and a living area with a sleep sofa and found The French Quarters to have the perfect room.  We always include shows in our trips and wanted something near the theaters.  The French Quarters was perfect.  We loved the location and the personal touches.  Our particular room, though right across from the elevator, was so quiet.  We had a wonderful night\u2019s sleep.  The sleep sofa was the most comfortable I have ever slept on and the AC was perfect.  The breakfast was great and in such a cute setting.  With the background music we felt like we were at a French bistro.    We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  They called us to let us know when our room was ready and even lent us 2 umbrellas when it was storming.  They set up a car for our ride to the airport.  It was a nice comfortable minivan.  The driver was great and handled the terrible LGA traffic perfectly.  The only issue was that he only took cash so make sure you have plenty of cash if you are going to LGA as the traffic has been awful lately. This will definitely become our go to hotel for our NYC trips.  We are already trying to decide when that will be.  We saw Moulin Rouge this time which I highly recommend and it is right around the corner from The French Quarters.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}
{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":1415127,"title":"Good and bad, but I wouldn't return,","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-08-19","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"My husband and I and two of our kids (20 and 18) recently stayed 3 nights in a 2 bedroom suite.  Initially, there was a mix up in the room we booked.  The hotel has 2 bedroom suites with 1 bathroom and 2 bedroom suites with 2 bathrooms.  My husband called the hotel and asked which room he had to book to get the 2 bathrooms and was told the luxury suite.  In fact, that turned out to be the suite with only 1 bathroom and the 2 bath suite was not available during our stay.  We weren't thrilled with 4 \"adults\" getting ready in 1 bathroom, but the location of the hotel was so great (we were in town to see 3 shows and the hotel is very close to the theaters) so we decided to just make the best of it.  The reception staff was not rude but not terribly apologetic about the mix up.  The suite itself was comfortable (although the bathroom could use more storage) albeit a bit dark.  The first issue occurred on the first morning when my husband attempted to bring one bagel back to the room for my daughter.  The continental breakfast is laid out from 7-9am and with 4 of us using one bathroom, we weren't all ready to go down.  Eric, the manager, stopped my husband and told him food was not allowed in the room because of \"vermin\" issues.  My husband explained that my daughter had not had time to come down to breakfast and asked if food was not allowed, why was there a kitchenette in the room?  Clearly, Eric did not want \"extra\" food to be taken back to the room, but given that there were 4 of us, we did not take more than a typical amount of food for breakfast (only 2 of us went down for breakfast).  Eric's statement that food was not allowed in the room was disingenuous and his rude manner was not the welcoming attitude I'd hoped for from this small establishment.  He seemed to think we had an \"extra\" person in the room and rudely inquired about this although they'd taken all of our driver's licenses when we checked in so they knew who was in the room and that room is for up to 6 people.  The next issue occurred because we left our Do Not Disturb sign out for 2 days.  We are environmentally conscious and prefer to reuse our towels and we emptied our own trash.  Also, my kids did not want the sofa bed to be remade and put away, so we thought we'd be doing the cleaning staff a favor by not having them clean our room.  Apparently, Eric did not think so.  He knocked at our door on the second day and said in an accusatory tone of voice that we'd had the Do Not Disturb sign out for 2 days and insisted that New York state law mandated that he physically inspect the room.  Now whether that's true or not is not my issue.  My issue is his accusatory and offensive attitude.  I have traveled all over the world, stayed in many very nice hotels, and I understand that security is heightened these days.  That said, I really felt like he was accusing us of doing something improper or illegal in the room.  My husband invited him into the room, but he just poked his head around the door and abruptly left.  In all of our travels, I have never been treated that rudely by management.  My family and I are courteous guests and during our hotel (and airbnb) stays we act as if we are guests in someone's home.  We left for a show shortly after this encounter with Eric and I couldn't even pay attention to the first several songs in the show because I was so incensed by Eric's attitude.  I'd stopped at the front desk on my way out and told the staff member what had happened and that Eric was more than welcome to enter our room and inspect it should he feel the need.  Even the second day at breakfast, he never said good morning or smiled.  So despite the great location and the comfort of the suite, I would not return to this establishment because of Eric's ungracious and offensive attitude.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

We arrived to find that our room was not only nowhere near the others, but not really in the same building. We had to go outside, down a fairly steep set of stairs, make a U turn up a steeper flight of stairs, open a door into a vestibule, unlock another door and enter. Proceed down a narrow hall, start up a very narrow staircase, another U turn to the top and our room was at the end on the right. We were 2 ladies in our seventies and did not appreciate this. Once inside, the room was very small, had only 1 chair, and the windows were extremely drafty. Breezy actually. The curtains on one did not meet. We finally overlapped them and pushed the chair against them to keep the bottom half closed.  The window 6\" from my bed not only had curtains that did not meet, both ends were hanging off the rod and there was no way to reattach them. There was very little room between walls and bed. The bathroom was tiny but okay how mush time does one spend in the bathroom. It took 5 minutes minimum to get hot water, the heat was from a space heater. One had to be very careful not to get burned (not much room to maneuver. The toilet paper holder was on the wall across from the toilet and I, who am fairly tall, had trouble reaching it. My friend felt as though she would fall off trying to reach. Back to the stairs-no elevator. We washed up and retraced our steps to meet our friends. We stopped at the desk to voice all our concerns and was told by the gal at the desk that there was nothing she could do. We told her we had booked our rooms at the time our friends had and expected to be at least in the same building and   were told we should have called ahead to check (we have NEVER had to do this before, anywhere). She told us we could be moved down to the first floor. This would have been inside the @ door entry. No one else would be there as I believe that was the only room there as ours was on the second floor. She was no help. Surprising as the young man we spoke to Upon our arrival was wonderful. We had arrived early, but stopped to let them know we were in NY and drop our luggage  with part of our party who had arrived the night before. So off we go for the day. Return to go to our room (which we had not yet seen) and found this mess. So we prepared for bed and found the dead lock on the door could not be locked. It didn't even match up with the hole, I don't believe there was a plate. There was a chain which was not very reassuring. Then we saw our friends room. One couple had been upgraded to a suite, the other room was wonderful and we were not even in the same building! No one on duty there so if something happened we would have delayed help. I would recommend if you stay here you call and ask lots of questions about where you are staying.The main part of the French Quarter was quite quaint and charming, request that you stay there. I do want to congratulate the young man in charge of breakfast in the morning. He was great. Very personable,helpful and went out of his way to meet your needs.

The hotel itself is situated very close to the theatres and excellent choice of restaurants (B side pizzeria, Pure Thai Cookhouse, Amy's bread).  The two bedroom suite was perfect for our family of 4.  It was in good shape. There was a balcony. Best of all we had two bathrooms (apparently some of the 2 BR have one bath and some have two). We could all stretch out and not be on top of each other. The two double bedroom was a tight squeeze for four of us and the floor seemed sticky and more heavily used than the the suite.  We tried the breakfast once - it was served in the restaurant, more than adequate, but nothing special. We didn't eat there the other two mornings because we had to get an early start before breakfast was served.  We will probably not go back unless we can get the 2 bedroom suite.

We'd never stayed in NY before and were aware of small rooms - not this place though. Quite spacious in fact.\n\nAs we entered the room it stretched out ahead, revealing 2 double beds (1 each) which were amazingly comfortable, a very nice bathroom and a little kitchenette with fridge, a couple of hobs and a great pod style coffee machine (25 complimentary pods supplied which are re-filled each day -- coffee, de-caf coffee, hot choc, hot cider and tea). The flat screen TV was positioned opposite and central to both beds so we could lie on each our beds with all the 4 pillows stacked up behind to watch the very bad American adverts, with occasional programmes!\n\nBeing a sucker for hotel buffet breakfasts this place did not disappoint me. Not as sophisticated and extensive as some hotels, but this place has more of a homely feeling, less of a hotel feeling. Something for everyone though. 14 types of cereal in those little boxes to start! Little bags of oats, bagels, cream cheese, jams, fresh fruit, yogs, eggs and most importantly the coffee was good!\nA very friendly chap called Kevin was in charge of breakfast and I must say he couldn't have been more helpful and obliging. Absolutely nothing was a problem. We'd chat every morning about all sorts.\n\nA nice couple of touches was a daily sheet (things to do, weather etc) slid under the door at 6 a.m. ish as well as a 'New York Post' outside the door every morning too.\n\nBreakfast was taken on the mezzanine level above the French brasserie below. Huge TVs everywhere so you get the news while you eat. The hotel and brasserie are sort of intertwined strangely. The various stairs are a bit confusing. No matter.\nAfter a day slogging around town, we'd return to the front door, greet the alternating faces at the tiny desk and take the lift up to the 2nd floor to the welcoming room. Aaah!\n\nTo conclude then;\nAll positive basically. Miss the bed!!\n\nOnly one small niggle which I pointed out to a friend of the owner. There are no little lamps by the side of the beds for reading. A huge lamp sits on a chest inbetween the beds and there are ceiling lights. Some work to do on the bedside lighting.\n\nWe were in room 203 with the window facing the street. The piano bar opposite can be quite noisy at weekends until past midnight. Also the usual NY night sounds seep in occasionally if you sleep lightly, but overall pretty quite for being almost in central Manhattan.\n\nWe didn't visit any of the restaurants nearby in the street as we ate out during the day and hit the sack early, but there are lots to choose from.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

All of the people at the front desk are so friendly and accommodating - they will keep your luggage for you after you check out and offer tips about parking or whatever you need to know. The room (so much bigger than a typical NY hotel room) was beautiful, with exposed brick, an amazing bathroom and a king size bed that was so comfortable. There were tons of k-cups of every kind for the Keurig. Great to have a fridge in the room too, to put our leftovers from dinner. Speaking of dinner, we ate at Bourbon Street Bar & Grille (in the hotel) and it was delicious - and they had the best Christmas decorations; I think there are photos posted somewhere so check it out. Special shoutout to our waiter, Connor, who was really friendly and accommodating and made our dinner so much fun. Also, what a nice bonus that a free breakfast, on the 2nd floor of Bourbon Street, is included with your stay, which is really a nice treat since you know how pricey breakfast can be in NY. It was so relaxing to just chill out and have coffee and a bagel and some fruit just a few steps away from our room. And the location -- you couldn't ask for a better location! So close to everything -- the theaters, Rockefeller Center, and amazing restaurants and bars up and down the street. It's just perfect!  I almost don't want to tell anyone about this since it's not very big and I am worried that if too many people know about it, I won't get a room when I need one. Now that I've stayed here, I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I'm in New York. In case it's not obvious, highly recommend this place!","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I once sat on the one in the French Quarters and accidentally dipped my bits in but I'm starting to veer off course.\n\nAnyway, breakfast was nice but sinfully wasteful in its various tiny packagings. We did have an uninvited guest come into our room while we slept and rummage around in the bathroom but it turned out to be a UK teenage girl who, once she roused from her sleepwalking, realised she was on the wrong floor and fled in terror. We got all that sorted afterwards. I believe I may not have closed the door properly behind me so she was able to walk in. Pro tip: close your doors.

Located only 2 minutes walk from Times Square the hotel is situated down a side street that is termed \"Restaurant row\" as there are a great mix of places to eat right on the door step. It is really easy to explore the city as only a few minutes walk takes you to either 42nd or 50th subway entrances, about 15\/20 minutes walk gets you to Central Park.\n\nThe rooms are cosy and could benefit from a set of drawers for storage but the beds are large and really comfy. The bathrooms are fantastic and always kept spotlessly clean but I have to say has the worst designed shower ever, you have no choice but to stand under the water whilst its heating up which is not fun! The room benefits from a fridge, hot plate and coffee machine which was perfect for us.All of the standard rooms are located at the front of the building overlooking the street so if you are a light sleeper this may be the time to pay a bit more for a room at the rear. However,  It is always going to be noisy in New York! \n\nI have to say the continental breakfast was fantastic with lots of choice of cereals, pastries and bagels, the only downside is that the room it is served in is very cold in the mornings so lots of people were taking the food into the bar area next door, this didn't really bother us. \n\nStaff were all really friendly and took the time to chat anytime we passed through reception, it was a lovely experience and I would recommend the hotel to anyone planning a visit to NYC that wants to be in the heart of the city!","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel's website is very upfront that this type of room can be loud late at night due to music being played at the bar.  We arrived a little early but were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready and we had been upgraded from a queen room to a king room.  Monica, at the front desk, was incredible helpful!  She showed up to our room.  She also showed up where we could take the stairs to the breakfast area and the stairs to outside.  The continental breakfast was just that - a continental breakfast - juice, coffee, milk, cereal, pastries, yogurt and the like.  It was set up nicely and a good way to start a busy day of sightseeing.  The location of the hotel is excellent!  Its on Restaurant Row - between 8th & 9th Avenues.  Its a short walk to Times Square and lots of other tourist sights.  Back to that noise warning about rooms over the bar - yes, we could hear some music.  No, it did not impair our sleeping in the slightest.  This hotel is quite the hidden gem!  I would definitely book again in the future.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We arrived on a Saturday evening and quickly checked in. Very friendly lady on reception explained the basics (breakfast, door lock times, 24hr reception) and showed us to our room. \nWe were in the townhouse next door to the main hotel block. You access it up a few steps and is seconds away from reception. Our room was 107 and overlooked the main street. The room was large with beautiful high ceilings which added to the spacious feel. There was a lovely fireplace which came in handy for us putting up cards and keeping stuff close to hand. There was also a comfy chair and table in the window overlooking the street. The bed on first inspection seemed small but this must have been my eyes deceiving me as once you were in it there was plenty room. We'd read reports that it was noisy on the lower floors\/overlooking the street. We didn't have any issues with noise during our stay.\nThe fridge was full size and the coffee maker was handy and always well stocked with the 'pods' and sugar, milk, sweetener etc. There was an iron and a small board as well as a hair dryer. The T.V was huge and the list of channels was handily supplied on a menu-type card. The bathroom was quite spacious with a very large shower and lovely toiletries. The towels were plentiful and fluffy. \nBreakfast is served on the mezzanine floor of the restaurant next door, to get there from our room we had to go out of the townhouse, past reception and to the lift but this was not a problem as it is literally 45 seconds away. The guy behind the bar at breakfast was really friendly and always took time to ask how we were, what we'd got planned and how we'd enjoyed the day before. He was also great for weather reports. We found the breakfast to be plentiful and tasty, bagels, breads, cereals, fruit, croissants, cakes, yogurts, jams and spreads with plenty juice, water and hot drinks. There is a toaster and we enjoyed toasted bagels every day. \nThe hotel manager often popped by at breakfast time and was also friendly and able to offer advice and recommendations. \nWe really loved this hotel and it's location cannot be faulted. It's basically at the end of Times Square at one side and Hells Kitchen at the other. There's loads going on on the street and surrounding streets. Easy to get to subway stops. We travelled to the hotel via the air train from JFK and then the LIRR to Penn Station. The hotel arranged our transfer back to the airport which was excellent, a bit more expensive than a cab but very comfortable and a professional driver with bottle of water and mints provided. \nWe loved every minute of our stay here and would certainly recommend\/return.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Subway terminals are close so you can take the train and go to Ground Zero, see the Statue of Liberty or cross Brooklyn Bridge. We had a great experience and The French Quarter added to it. Additionally they are right next to a great place to eat called Bourbon Street Grill.  The only thing a little disappointing is the complimentary breakfast. Scones and muffins are dry and there are no hot choices. It is complimentary however. If you want some fruit, yogurt or a piece of toast with coffee or juice to start your day this is it.

They invited me to stay with them for the night and I accepted because the hotel is 10 minutes from my office. \n\nIf you're looking to spend most of your time in the Midtown\/Times Square area this is a perfect location. Great place for first timers vising the city because it's right by all of the touristy stuff you want to see (Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, Bryant Park). It's between 8th & 9th Avenues so it's just far enough away from the noise of Times Square but close enough to walk to everything in that area. I've seen a few comments about the noise levels overnight and it's not that bad. Your typical NYC street noise and sirens however, I've lived here for 4 years so I'm a bit used to it. The hotel is quite small so the noise is unavoidable on any of the floors because you won't be high enough to escape. \n\nNYC hotels always worry me, especially in this area (bedbugs!) but the hotel is perfectly clean and very cute. Definitely a boutique style. The bathroom was the best part, all tile and very French New Orleans styled. \n\nThe beds were nothing to write home about but were fine for one night. My parents checked out the free breakfast in the AM and said it was nice and that the attendant was very friendly. \n\nThis hotel would be best suited for 1) First time NYC visitors 2) A quick overnight stay 3) If you're attending a Broadway show because all of theaters are within 10 minutes walking distance. \n\nDon't stay here if 1) You've been to New York several times and want a more authentic and less touristy area 2) You hate Times Square\n\nOverall, great for one night and would stay again if I somehow ever get locked out of my apartment.

As a family of 4, with older children who prefer to sleep in separate bedrooms to their parents, this suited us much better, than typical hotel rooms with a couple of double beds. Twin beds in the 2nd bedroom would have been even better (brother and sister really don't like sharing) but otherwise, it's ideal for a family. Be warned that the lift is very slow though!\n\nThe accommodation is very clean and comfortable and we welcomed the extra space of having a suite after exhausting days of exploring the city. Our room was well serviced each day - and our favourite complimentary coffee and hot chocolate pods were observed and replenished. The bathroom is small but perfectly functional.\n\nAll the staff were very pleasant and the manager made a point of chatting with guests over breakfast one morning. The complimentary continental breakfast gets the day off to a good start with plenty of choice of yoghurts, cereals, breads and pastries, and hard boiled eggs.\n\nThe outstanding feature of this property though is location, location, location. You can walk to so many places from here, and so easily. And if the subway is more your thing, it's right between 42nd and 50th St subway stations. It's particularly well located for accessing the theatre district including the many restaurants in the area, and we felt very safe wandering around the area at night.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to return.

All as advertised. We stayed in one of the units above the bar\/restaurant area and we did not have any significant problem with the noise as previous reviewers have noted. Of course, we found that if you close the bar down you never have to worry about the noise! Regardless, this is one amazing guest apartment. While our unit #106 was a slightly smaller room, the amenities were outstanding. The bedding was perfect and shower\/toiletries were equally as nice. An in-room safe, Keurig coffee maker, small electric stove, refrigerator and a flat screen TV rounded out the room's features. We stayed only one night but found it to be very comfortable. The morning continental breakfast was generous and we received a visit from the G.M., Colin while there. He asked about our stay and inquired about our travel plans. \nThe most impressive thing I can mention though is what separates this establishment from any other I've ever stayed. The next morning we were heading out on a week long cruise and inadvertently left an iPad. We were unaware of this until I received a call from John at the front desk while we were almost at the pier. He offered to bring it to us or mail it to our home and as we had another iPad available we asked him to ship it to our home which was there before we returned. One can argue that you might find a hotel with better sheets or a bigger TV but you will never find one with a staff with more integrity and devotion to there patrons than the French Quarters. We will never stay anywhere else on return visits and I give the highest recommendations for this fine property. It just doesn't get any better than this.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We spoke to various staff on reception during our week, but the manager, Colin, made a point of coming and introducing himself to us one morning, as we'd not yet met him.  A lovely man, as were all the staff.   A handwritten card welcomed us to our room and on my daughter's birthday they kindly left a bottle of Prosecco in the fridge for her. I notice that someone else who has reviewed this hotel says there is no lift, which is incorrect, as we used it a couple of times!\n\nBreakfast was taken in the adjoining Bourbon Street bar, where we also had a couple of delicious meals.  Ideal for the first night when you arrive tired and don't want to venture far, although the hotel is in the Hell's Kitchen area of the city, famed for all of it's restaurants, so there's plenty of choice. We were looked after at breakfast by a very pleasant and genuine young man called Kevin.  Nothing was too much trouble for him.  The food was the usual continental style, with cereal, pastries, bagels, fruit and yogurts and was plenty to set us up for the day.\n\nOur room, 301, was small but comfy with a large bathroom and coffee\/ tea machine.  It also had a mini kitchen area with a hob, sink and fridge but this space would have been better used to extend the tiny wardrobe.  The wardrobe was about a foot wide, with not enough hangers and a shelf half way down that made hanging dresses impossible, but you can always find a way around these things. There was a lovely old fashioned free standing coat rack, so I hung dresses off that. The double bed was comfy, although due to it being in a small room, it was pushed against the wall, which may have been an issue for someone less agile. I recommend that anyone wanting to use a hairdryer uses the one that the hotel provides in each room.  I used my own on the first day, but due to American voltage being half of ours in the UK mine was extremely slow even on top speed.  I switched to theirs and it was great. A daily sheet of 'what's on in the area' was left outside our room each day along with a free paper.\n\nThe only real negative about this hotel was the noise from the street.  I know it's a big city and you must expect noise, but when it stops you from sleeping it can make your day long and hard.  The bar downstairs is open till 4am but I don't think the noise was from there.  There are a couple of all-night bars opposite, one called Don't Tell Mama, and they have karaoke and 'singing' waiters, but the singing was too loud and awful.  There's also the constant noise of deliveries being made by refrigerated vans to restaurants in the street, sirens and bin men.  When we visited NY 2 years ago and stayed in a bigger hotel, we were able to move rooms to one higher up and at the back of the hotel, where it was really quite.  That wasn't possible here as it's a tiny hotel.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my stay here.  If I'm ever in New York again I would use this hotel, but only if I could be sure of a room away from the street.  From what I could see once there, some of the suites on the top two floors were at the back, so may be worth the extra cost for some decent sleep.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were greeted by the very friendly staff on reception and shown to our rooms.  We found a hand written card in our room welcoming us to the hotel. If you need transfers from the airport contact the hotel prior to your arrival, they sorted a pick up for us and orgaised a trip back to the airport at the end of our stay.\n\nRoom 201 is quite small but adequate for our needs. It's only downside is the lack of storage for clothes, the wardrobe is tiny so I put some of my clothes on the coat rack. The room has a desk and chair, TV, ironing board, iron, hairdryer, umbrella, L'Occitane toiletries and a coffee machine. There was also a fridge with milks and a bottle of water in it. The room was very clean and very nicely decorated. There were plenty of towels in the bathroom. The rooms all have air con.\n\nI found the curtains were quite thick so kept the light out well, although the hotel is on a well shaded street so there was no sunlight coming in to wake us anyway. \n\nThe first night, a Saturday, we didn't sleep very well as there is a cabaret bar directly opposite which had loud music going well into the early hours. That was the only issue with noise, apart from that first night I slept well for the rest of the week. \n\nThe breakfast is continental with a range of pastries, cereals, bagels, jams and toast. It was refreshing to find somewhere that came with breakfast as many hotels we looked at don't. Al the breakfast staff we met, Mano, Jason and Kevin, were very chatty and friendly and couldn't do enough to help you. \n\nEach morning  we woke to a copy of the local paper and a sheet prepared by the staff detailing the weather and local places to visit and events going on which was a lovely touch. \n\nDuring our stay I celebrated my 30th birthday. It was a lovely surprise to find a bottle of Prosecco in the fridge from the staff, thank you again for this! We were greeted by Colin, the hotel manager, on my birthday at breakfast, it was lovely to meet him.\n\nThe hotel itself is in a fantastic situation, just a 2 minute walk away from Times Square. The Intrepid air and space museum is on the same street as the hotel. There is a subway on W42nd street at Times Square, or if you want to avoid all the crowds in that area head up to W50th street to get the one from there instead. \n\nI cannot recommend this hotel enough, it's location and staff was perfect. I'd definitely stay here again.\n\nI've written several reviews of the places we visited and various restaurants which I've listed just below if you're looking for some ideas.\n\nAttractions:\nIntrepid air and space museum \nCentral Park\nStatue of Liberty\nOne World Observatory\n9\/11 memorial museum\nBrooklyn Bridge\nCircle Line Cruises\n\nTo escape the city for a while you could visit Far Rockaway beach (Take the A train, change at Rockaway Boulevard and get on the express train S. Takes around an hour and a half) or take a train upstate to Cold Spring, a beautiful town on the river Hudson. You can get there by taking a train from Grand Central Station and it takes around an hour. \n\nSmorgasburg in Williamsburg, Brooklyn is worth a visit. It's held every Saturday and features over 100 food vendors. I highly recommend trying a maple lemonade, it is really refreshing and delicious. \n\nFood and Drink:\nBourbon Bar Street and Grill (next to hotel)\nBareburger (A few doors down from the hotel, head left out of the hotel)\nRice Cream Shop (Bleecker Street)\nMotorino pizza (E12th Street)\nMax - Italian restaurant on Duane Street (Not far from World Trade Center)\nRadegast Hall (3rd Street, Brooklyn)\nMoo Moo's Creamery (Ice cream parlous at Cold Spring)\nThe Depot (Delicious food, Cold Spring)","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The 2 x double room worked well for us and was clean, comfortable and surprisingly spacious for a Manhattan hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful and having the continental breakfast included in the price saved a fortune. This self-service breakfast included cereals, toast, bagels, yoghurt etc., and was fine to get you off to a good start for the day. We enjoyed stopping here and can recommend to others.

Times Square was just down the end of the street.  Complimentary mineral water and a wide choice of coffee (and tea) for the coffee machine.  Great size apartment with very comfortable large beds kept very clean and serviced thoroughly each day by very attentive staff.  Without exception all the staff were helpful, friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  Wide range of choice from the continental breakfast in the roof terrace bar superbly managed by Kevin each morning.

Great continental breakfast in the atrium level.  Very fresh pastries, yogurt, bagels, crossaints, fresh fruit, just delicious.

The room had a keurig coffee machine with around 25 separate coffee pods as well as a kitchen area with a fridge, hob and a sink. The bed was huge and we were left with a bottle of Prosecco as it was our honeymoon.\nIn comparison with New York standards the hotel is tiny and is situated directly above a bar. The bar is where the breakfast is served in the morning which is Continental. We did not try a breakfast even though it is included in the price as we are regular visitors to New York and we have our favourite diner - Westway Diner just round the corner on 614 9th avenue near 44th street. You'll always see cops in there!!\nWhen we booked the hotel through booking.com we were advised that the room was above the bar. Any hotel room below the 13th level will be loud as New York City never sleeps. We were prepared for this however and we did have earplugs. Having said that the music wasn't a problem when we went to bed, it was more when we were woken up at 1:30 am with the vibrations. We would however stay in the hotel again as it wasn't really an issue for us. The hotel is in excellent, safe and leafy location within a few blocks of Times Square. It is also in a road called restaurant row where there are many different restaurants catering for everyone. Every morning we had a newspaper waiting for us outside the front door together with an information sheet as to what was going on in the city which was a nice touch. \nWhen coming from the airport you can either get a yellow taxi by waiting in line. There is a standard charge per taxi of around $55 which will include any tolls. Do not be tempted to talk to any other person touting around the line as they will charge you double or triple the price given half the chance and they are not licensed. The journey took quite a while due to usual heavy traffic. I think the journey took around an hour and a half. Alternatively if you are short on cash you can get the air train directly from JFK airport and you can stop at (E train) 50th Street. Price of this is approximately seven dollars per person. We will definitely stay in this hotel again. The rooms are beautifully decorated and clean although some may find them on the small side but again to us this wasn't an issue.\n","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I especially liked the bathroom layout which had a large shower and really good water pressure in the shower. The daily newsletter under our door letting us know what was going on in the area daily is a nice personal touch. Continental breakfast is included in the price of the room and there were good options with cereal, coffee, bagels,scones, fruit and juices. You can't beat free (included in the price) in NYC. The staff were great. I'd advise having ear plugs, you are in the city and they have no control over music playing across the street at night which you can hear. It is in the theater district.

Card key was used to access street door and room no reception or hotel employees in that building just rooms, would not feel safe if I was on my own or with children.  Not good for seniors, etc. in terms of stairs.\n--My husband and daughter felt the hall and room were dirty, not vacuumed, and they both thought the sheets smelled bad.  The housekeeping is limited to sheets being changed every third day of your stay, but they felt like the ones on our bed when we arrived smelled musty not fresh.  My husband said the bed was \"tossed back together\" in terms of housekeeping.  The grouting in the bathroom was a little moldy.\n--The continental breakfast was plentiful in that there were hard boiled eggs, fruit, cereal, rolls, oatmeal packettes, muffins but the quality was not high-- the bagels and muffins were not tempting at all, like what you would buy in a grocery store.  I would skip this and got to Amy's breads around the corner for a delicious breakfast sandwich and pastry.\n--No common areas at all to spend time, just a narrow hall with reception tucked in a corner in the main building.\n--Weirdly the toilet paper holder was well out of reach of the toilet and the toilet was squished in so that you couldn't sit straight on it without hitting the shower door.  Very little room in the bathroom to put any toiletries, no wide sink, etc.\n--Overall the decor was quite dark and a bit dreary.","travelDate":"2016-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We arrived extremely jet lagged (from Japan) and were greeted kindly by the hotel manager Colin.

It was stunning - huge super king beds in both rooms - although we only needed one, 2 massive bathrooms stocked with beautiful L'Occtane products and a long balcony  looking over the city. Colin then offered to give us advice on a restaurant for lunch which we gladly accepted. He was so kind, so helpful, genuinely wanted to give you the best experience. I couldn't talk more highly of him. He sent us to an Amazing Mexican joint which we absolutely loved!

Saying it was the least they could do (As if the hadn't done enough by upgrading us to the penthouse!) how thoughtful! \ud83d\udc9f It was my first time in NYC so Hells Kitchen is a great location to see all the sites- Central Park, Times Square, Empire State, Grand Central Statikn etc... and a short subway ride from the cooler downtown areas for dinners and shopping, or uptown to the museums.

The maid came every day including Christmas day and topped up the complimentary tea and coffee and replaced the towels etc. The staff at the hotel were so friendly and could not do enough for the guests. Finally the bar below (Bourbon bar & Grille) the staff were extremely friendly and informative, it had a great atmosphere, excellent food and great place to unwind before retiring for the night.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The New York Times was left outside the door every morning as well as an info sheet letting us know the weather for the day and events that were going on that day.\n\nThe room itself was a decent size, clean, kitchenette equipped with coffee machine and fridge. The bed was massive, with numerous cushions and very comfy to sleep in. \n\nThe bathroom was beautiful and immaculate, many towels and L'occtaine toiletries were provided. The shower itself was a power shower and was very welcome after a busy day.\n\nContinental breakfast was self serve but Kevin served cold drinks. Kevin was so friendly and always put a smile on our face, even letting us take some extras for snacks for the day. \n\nThe one downside which did let it down was being right above the bar, it was incredibly noisy into evenings making it very difficulty to sleep.

This in no way spoil d our enjoyment of our stay at the French Quarters. Breakfast was included in the price of our room - a wide variety of cereals, milks, fruit juice, bagels, butter, preserves, boiled eggs, fresh fruit, croissants, toast, mini kuffins as well as tea and coffee from pump flasks. After the first day, the waiter knew my friend like her tea hotter than the water from the flasks and would quickly appear with a mug of boiling water for her. The personal tiuch was further enhanced by the manager visiting the dining area every morning to check with each party that everything was ok as well as offering advice about attractions etc. All in all, this establishment offers a far more personal service than the large hotel chains and we definitely plan to return.  It is very centrally situated just off 8th avenue and within a ten minute walk of Times Square. Thoroughly recommended in all respects.","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

All the staff were pleasant and extremely helpful, especially the staff we met at breakfast. I think we met somebody different everyday at Breakfast, but all were equally helpful.\nMy wife and I stayed in a room rather than apartments and it was more than adequate for our needs, and had everything expected. What was especially pleasing was the fact that there was loads of coffee, tea, drinking chocolate provided, so it was impossible to run out. Another great feature was the fact that they issued a daily update sheet which told you what the weather forecast was for the day, and next, and gave suggestions as to what you could do, and was on.\nWe eat at the attached Bourbon Street Grille on two occassions, and had great meals in a great location, all done up for Christmas.\nLocation wise it could not be better as although it was only a block and a half from Time square, it was relatively quiet, especially during the day. Got a little busy with Traffic in the evening, but a lot quieter than just round the corner on 8th Avenue. As it was so close to Broadway and the theatres we ended up going to three shows in a four night stay. When it was only 5 minutes to a theatre it seemed foolish not to.

Apparentemente non ci sarebbe nulla di particolarmente sorprendente nella descrizione se non avessi poi alloggiato in altro albergo di New York , un boutique hotel, in cui non c'era spazio neanche per 2 valigie e il concetto di armadio era limitato al possibile ingombro di 3 grucce, il tutto in una stanza occupata da 4 persone.\nDevo dire che la situazione non era certamente diversa a Boston, dove le stanze erano molto piccole e decisamente pi\u00f9 costose del French Quarters .Per cui ritengo che questo albergo sia una valida eccezione.\nAggiungo che il valore di questa soluzione sia senza pari per altri due motivi: il primo la posizione. Si \u00e8 vicini a Times Square ma lontani dal suo caos perenne, la zona  \u00e8 pienissima di ristoranti per tutti i gusti e tasche. Il secondo  motivo \u00e8  la colazione inclusa, evento  peraltro molto raro negli hotel di New York .Si tratta di una colazione continentale con latte, caff\u00e8, succo d'arancia, frutta, toast, bagels,  croissant, muffins, youghurt vari,marmellata, burro, e varie soluzioni dolci e salate. Personalmente in  pieno luglio non so se avremmo retto un  vero breakfast americano. Nel caso in cui la si  poi la si voglia sperimentare ugualmente, non mancano i locali nei dintorni che possono soddisfare la voglia.\nLo staff \u00e8 veramente gentile  e pronto per ogni richiesta. Pur avendo  la finestra che si affacciava sotto la terrazza del ristorante attiguo, non abbiamo mai avuto problemi per il rumore o il brusio delle persone che cenavano e bevevano a partire dalle 17 pomeridiane fino a notte.\nCi siamo sentiti per tutta la durata del nostro soggiorno come felici possessori di una piccola casa a New York, in un bellissimo quartiere dove tutto \u00e8 raggiungibile per la vicinanza delle stazioni della metropolitana, e questo ha reso ancora pi\u00f9 speciale il nostro soggiorno in una citt\u00e0, New York, che, quando ti prende il cuore, non lo molla pi\u00f9","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Firstly, I should say that the hotel is very nice, the staff were fantastic, really helpful and friendly and the hotel is perfectly positioned next to Times Square if that's where you need to be. We did have an issue on arrival. We booked a standard room which, when we saw it in reality, was VERY small. This was our mistake. We just didn't anticipate the standard room being as small as it was. On a normal holiday, this wouldn't really have been an issue for us, but we had a wedding photographer arriving to take pictures of my wife getting ready in the room and, in all seriousness, the 3 of us would not have fitted in the room at the same time. That said, we mentioned this to the manager and they very kindly moved us to a Kingsize room. This was a great touch from the management as, like I said, this was our mistake as we did not check the room sizes before we booked. Their reaction to our problem was classy. \n\nElsewhere, the breakfast is simple, but very nice.

A very enjoyable experience. The room was inviting and quite large for downtown NYC. King size bed was comfy with a down (or down-like) comforter and bathroom and shower were clean and well appointed. I had to set up a traveling office (laptop, printer, scanner) for my profession so the free wired - and wireless wifi - came in very handy. The hotel is located near Times Square so the outside streets are bustling with eateries and there is some noise coming off the street. The noise was not bad at all, we kept our window open at night for some fresh air (as fresh as you can get in midtown NYC) and slept soundly.

On my hotel hunt I was aiming for a good location in Midtown, mainly on Hells Kitchen and I found The French Quarters, with very high praises and good reviews. One person even said that she felt a bit sorry about sharing this very well kept secret with the world and risking have it always booked. Well, after staying there I know how she feels. But the French Quarters manager and staff deserve all the praises they can get.\nI was travelling with my parents and we shared a double double room, which was excellent, very spacious, clean and well lit. The beds were super comfortable and big. The adjoint bathroom was also huge and beautiful, complete with L'Occitane amenities and towels aplenty. We had a small kitchen inside our unity, which was very convenient - a counter with a sink, a small cooktop and fridge, cupboards, glasses, mugs, corkscrews and coffee maker machine.\nBreakfasts were another great affair. The area reserved for it was simply charming and there was always a feast of scones, muffins, croissants and other goodies waiting for us. But the highlight, I have to say, was the service. There was this great lad waiting on the guests, and he would always make us hot chocolate mugs and bring them to our table with a friendly smile and conversation.\nEveryday I would open the door and find a newspaper and a sheet prepared by the staff with the weather forecast for the day and tips on what do to and how to spend the day around town.\nWhat can I say? I felt pampered and taken care of, which is unheard of in New York. My folks and I all agree that most places in town are celebrated for their cold luxury of marble halls and Central Park views, with efficient (if somewhat robotic) staff. And here we found this beautiful and quaint place, where the luxury provided is of another kind. It's all about the small details, the quality of products and the warmth of the staff.\nThe bar and restaurant downstairs is delicious and always full. The music can be a little loud if your room faces the outdoor section of the bar, like mine did, but it really wasn't a problem.\nAlso the neighborhood is packed with restaurants, small markets and great eating options.\nI highly recommend it and will becoming back for sure!","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The French Quarters is very nicely presented and furnished in a French Colonial style. It is modest and welcoming without being pretentious. Our room had no view (unless you like looking at air conditioning units) and while I note other reviews mention excess noise from the bar we found our unit very quiet. I had requested a room away from the bar and we were accommodated by way of a lower level double room next door to the bar back from the street. While the room was equipped with two double beds rather than a queen or king we actually didn\u2019t mind too much as it provided for a peaceful sleep after a lot of walking each day. A small down side was the bathroom in our apartment was so compact the shower door knocked the toilet as you opened and closed it and the wash basin is quite awkward for brushing teeth etc. with a shelf positioned too close above it. We managed!\nAdjoining the hotel is the French Quarter Bar & Grill that hosts the ample hotel continental breakfast and of an evening is well patronised by tourists and locals. Additionally you are spoiled for choice among the many restaurants and bars literally outside the door. Time Square, theatres, theatres and more theatres, hop on hop off bus access, subway and flagship stores are a mere few minutes from the hotel. The Rockefeller Centre, Central Park, St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and much more can be reached in around a 15 minute walk.\nAll the staff, especially the General Manager Colin, are very friendly and helpful. The only exception was a young man with an Irish accent on the reception desk who was rather nonchalant.

We went to speak to the night staff who were very unhelpful and we actually had to go and speak to the workmen to find out what was going on. After a night with no sleep, we went to speak to the reception staff who were slightly more helpful and agreed to refund us for the night but we really had to push to get them to change our room. Our suggestion was to phone the local council to see if the work was going to continue that night but they didn't seem that keen. The lift had also broken the previous day and we overheard a very heated discussion between the manager and lift company so I don't think they were having a good day! \n\nEventually we got moved to a lovely room but it was over the bar so again as we tried to sleep all we could hear was pounding music and people's voices.

The room was surprisingly spacious for New York and comprised of two double beds, nice sized bathroom with L'Occitane products, large TV with around 20 channels, safe, fridge stocked with a bottle of water & two energy drinks, a great coffee machine that had 5 pods each for coffees, tea, hot chocolate, apple brew, hair dryer, ironing board and also a portable electric heater as well as the rooms own air conditioning\/heater. Even though the weather had reached record lows our room was warm and also the hall outside.\nThe location was perfect, just a 5 minute walk from Times Square and on restaurant row. Our room was at the back so no view but it was very quiet, there was some noise on one of the nights from the bar next door that was having a Mari Gras night but nothing that would stop you from sleeping.\nThe breakfast was very nice and included, bagels, croissants, scones, bread, fruit, tea, coffee, orange juice, cereal, porridge, yogurt. The breakfast staff were very friendly and the eating area was upstairs of the bar. There was a nice mezzanine where the breakfast was served but it was a bit cold to sit out there at the time. Every morning around 6am a copy of the New York Post was left at our door along with a nice information sheet on events that were happening in New York that day. There were also maps in our room as well at the reception.\nWe had a great stay and would highly recommend this hotel, the only regret that we had was not visiting the bar and restaurant next door and also not getting to try enough restaurants on the street.\nAlso if travelling to New York in winter make sure to be prepared for the cold, we thought we were but I think you definitely need an extra under layer of thermals when walking around outside! Also make sure to make reservations at most restaurants or else you could be waiting a while to get a table.","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had originally been booked into another hotel by our tour company but the hotel they had chosen was off the beaten track and totally unsuitable for our needs. I did a lot of research before I chose The French Quarters as we knew our time in new York was going to be limited and we wanted to be within walking distance of Times Square.  This Hotel had such superb reviews I decided to book it.  When I started the booking process we were offered a room over the bar. The only room available at the time of booking and a great special offer price.   The Hotel was totally honest and did say that it could be noisy.  This did worry us somewhat but as the hotel was in such a good location for us we decided to risk it.  I am so pleased we did as we thoroughly enjoyed our night at the hotel.  I have to say the Staff there were amazing.  Nothing was too much trouble.  I emailed lots of questions before we arrived and because we had also been let down with transfers by our rotten Travel Company. they came to our rescue and booked a transfer to the Port for us too.  We arrived at the hotel VERY late in the evening as our transfer had not arrived at JFK to pick us up.  One travel Agent is well and truly crossed off our list! This is one customer who wont be using a Travel bag again if you get my drift!  We had a great welcome even though we were late and were taken to our room and shown how everything worked.  The Keurig coffee machine was a Godsend as we were able to have a quick drink before we went off to explore. The hotel are so generous. We had ample sachets of coffee etc a bottle of water and some juice for the morning.I particularly enjoyed the hot apple cider drink.  The room we had was quite adequate and had everything we needed. It was very nicely decorated and our view was out across the street  which was really sparkling with all the Christmas decorations.  We particularly loved the bathroom with all the lovely Occitane toiletries. Please don't be afraid to book this room if like us you don't worry about a bit of  music and like a 'Happy lively atmosphere'  The noise was minimal.  It didn't spoil our time there at all.  Breakfast was great.  We particularly liked sitting on the balcony overlooking the bar. \nWe had a chat with Colin the manager over breakfast.  He really cares about his guests and we could see him talking to everyone in turn.  He did smile when I started quizzing him about Mardi Gras beads!!!  For some reason we had been asked to wear them for meeting up with people on our Cruise ship. He must have wondered what sort of cruise we were going on!  I think it was Kevin who looked after us all so well over breakfast.  We were a bit confused at first and couldn't find things but he was a great help and had a smile for everyone.  We had a very leisurely breakfast and I couldn't resist taking photos of the bar below us as it was so beautifully decorated.  To sum up.  This hotel is in a great position near lots of bars and restaurants and within a few minutes walking distance from Times Square.  We felt very safe walking around at night and enjoyed seeing all the people out enjoying their Christmas parties etc. I must admit the bar at the hotel was really lively but we didn't get a chance to go there for a drink.  We will have to save that for next time.  The highlight of our trip came right at the end.  We had booked a town cab to take us to the Port but were transported in Style in a stretch Limo.  It was such a treat for us and we smiled all the way to the Port.  It was such a great start to our holiday Cruise.  We will definitely return to New York at some point and will most definitely choose the French Quarters again.  I just wish more hotels looked after their customers so well.  Thanks to everyone who helped made our stay so memorable.  We particularly enjoyed chatting to the people at the Reception Desk who gave us loads of interesting information about the Hotel and New York.  Just one more little thing.  We got a great newsletter posted under our door in the morning to tell us all the things going on in the neighbourhood.","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

L'hotel, pur trovandosi in pieno centro a Manhattan, \u00e8 situato in una via molto carina, famosa per i teatri ed i ristorantini. Non \u00e8 economicissimo ma vista la posizione e la qualit\u00e0 dell'hotel direi che  non ci si pu\u00f2 proprio lamentare... All'arrivo ci hanno accolti con il sorriso anche se eravamo notevolmente in anticipo rispetto all'orario previsto per il check in. Si sono scusati perch\u00e9 la camera non era pronta e dopo poco tempo ci hanno contattato telefonicamente per informarci che erano riusciti a farla preparare. La nostra stanza era forse un po' rumorosa dato che si trovava sopra il pub...ma ci avevano avvisati di questo problema ed inoltre proprio per questo motivo costava meno...quindi sarebbe scorretto lamentarsi! Inoltre il Pub sottostante, sempre di propriet\u00e0 dei gestori dell'hotel, molto bello e sempre affollatissimo, \u00e8 l'ideale per una bella birra o un pasto veloce. La camera era piccolina ma bellissima, praticamente nuova e pulitissima, con letto alla francese e tendaggi e tessuti di pregio. Oltre alla TV c'erano anche un frigobar (bevande gratis) ed un microonde. Il bagno, anch'esso carinissimo, era spazioso e con un'enorme doccia. Un tocco di classe in pi\u00f9: I prodotti di cortesia erano de \"l'occitane\"!!!! La colazione ottima ed abbondante servita al pub sottostante (sempre di propriet\u00e0 dei gestori dell'hotel). La mattina inoltre giornale in camera con aggiunta di informazioni meteo da parte della direzione. Ci hanno tenuto in deposito il bagaglio per un giorno intero gratuitamente e non hanno neppure voluto che gli pagassimo il francobollo per spedire una cartolina in Italia...

The cleaning service can be a little slow, on a few days our room was not ready until after 3pm, but if you are out all day then that shouldn't really matter. The free wifi is also helpful.

Myself, my husband and our 6 month old daughter stayed 10 nights at the French Quarters on recommendation from friends who'd stayed there and we were certainly not disappointed. I booked directly with the hotel which was a very easy process and a reasonable rate. Hotel is in a great spot surrounded by restaurants and walking distance to Times Square and the Theatres. From the minute we arrived John was very helpful and our room already had the baby crib set up. John was also able to obtain us a microwave to use during our stay (for baby bottles). The room has a small kitchenette which they will stock with crockery\/cutlery as requested. Bed very comfortable, room very clean and lovely bathroom with the l'occitane products. We stayed in a room on the first floor closest to the street and yes there was noise but nothing that didn't keep us or our baby from sleeping. Infact it was quite lovely hearing the music from the Jazz club across the road most nights. Breakfast was delicious and ample, such a bonus to have it included for free. Wifi is also free. We had our laundry sent out a number of times and it was always promptly brought back and placed in our room. The fee for this service was minimal, especially given how difficult it can be to have your clothes cleaned whilst on holidays. Towards the end of our stay we had a very unfortunate issue arise with our travel money cards from our bank back home where we were essentially left with no money due to no fault of our own. John and Collin couldn't help us enough with regards to this. If we were staying in a larger hotel I am certain we wouldn't have had the support and assistance that they offered to get the matter sorted. We appreciated their assistance so much and it made dealing with the issue so much easier. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone and we would love to be able to stay there again when we're next in NYC. ","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"NONE"}

There was also water and a funny 'hangover drink' provided in the fridge.\n\nThe staff were really helpful. The location was fantastic, about two minute walk to the heart of Times Square!

(It probably helps that we loved everything about our visit to NYC!)\nWe had big a room overlooking West 46th Street on the 1st\/2nd floor? in the separate apartment building part.  Yes, there was a set of narrow stairs to negotiate with bags but luckily John? (lovely Irishman on reception when we checked in and out) helped my husband with our bags.  We also appreciated his recommendation for the Hop on\/Hop off tour provider as this backed up our decision to use the same company as we had in San Fran (Big Bus)\nStarting with the location - it is super handy to restaurants, theatres, Times Square, Intrepid Sea and Air Museum and subways.\nLoved the daily newsletter that appeared under the door early each morning, the L'Occitane products in the bathroom, and the daily breakfast (reasonably basic, but I was especially grateful for the hard boiled eggs and my husband loved the yoghurts). \nWe had a couple of quiet nights here and a couple of very noisy ones, which we were kind of expecting with it being NYC.  The street was generally pretty quiet, the worse night was when one of the restaurants across the road had what sounded like a Karaoke competition going on.  Totally out of the French Quarters control, and luckily I had earplugs from our San Fran hotel to use!\nTo be honest, we spent very little time in our room since we were out exploring beyond midnight most evenings, but it was always lovely to come back to the apartment and the whole complex has a lovely boutique-y feel about it.\nIf we could, we would go back to New York and stay at the French Quarters again in a heartbeat.  Such a beautiful city.\nOh and to cap it all off, we booked a town car for our early morning flight to LA via Reception and a stretch limo turned up...we spent the whole trip to the airport laughing our heads off at the back of the limo in the traffic because we couldn't quite believe it!","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This will be a go-to for future NYC trips to come. Highlights below:\n\nRoom:\n- Nice comfy bed, fluffy pillows, and french decor.\n-The room was just as described- cozy, warm, comfortable, and had nice quality touches (e.g. L'Occitane soap and hair products, Keurig coffee pods).\n-We ended up booking the room above the bar, as it was half the cost, and we knew we would be out most of the night so the concern about the noise level at night didn't deter us from booking.\n-The website and reviews were implicit about booking that particular room and the bar music\/noise, so there were no surprises there. I appreciated the detail the hotel took in making sure we were 100% aware of this prior to booking. \n- Clean and loved having the street facing room so we could people watch as well.\n\nStaff:\n- Friendly, kind, and polite staff. We noticed there was not one moment where someone was not sitting at the front desk or didn't answer the phone.\n- First night we were there, we got back late and asked for a recommendation for pizza delivery. Front desk guy called the number for us and even came to get us in the adjoining when it arrived. Pizza was killer BTW... great recommendation!\n- Staff always said hello and greeted us with a smile when we came in and out. \n\nOverall, wonderful experience.

We were in the apartment building next to the main property. The room was quite delightful in terms of decor and I really liked it. The bed was huge and comfortable, with soft fresh linen. We could see the lights of Times Square from the window. We had no issues with noise. The air con worked well. The bathroom was spotless. \n\nThere were a few minor issues. Cleaning of the rooms did not happen until very late. We stayed for five nights and it was always 3pm before the room was done. One day it was gone 4pm. In fairness we told the manager, a friendly Irish guy, and he apologised and stood us a drink in the bar next door while we waited. If you like a nap before hitting the nightspots, this may not be for you. I'm a bit of a tidy freak so the open rail and no drawers didn't work for me. The iron was good but no place to put the table top board without the cord crossing the bathroom door - dangerous.\n\nBreakfast, well it is a bit of an afterthought when it could be a really great selling point for small outlay (a commercial toaster, tongs for the bread, presentation platters). \n\nHaving said all that, have to say it was a lovely property, perfect for our needs and we would recommend it to others.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I had read that the rooms were small, but being New York I didn't expect any different.  When I was making my booking I mentioned that my husband is tall and if they could accommodate us in a bigger room we would appreciate it.  The welcome from Colin at the front desk was excellent.   He introduced himself, shook our hands and asked us about our trip and where we were from etc. He assured us of their full attention during our stay, which was a lovely welcome. Colin then told us that we'd been upgraded to a superior room, which was the icing on the cake.  When we saw the room we were thrilled.  It was gorgeous.  We've been to New Orleans and the room with balcony brought us back to heady nights in Bourbon Street. The bed was so comfortable, the shower room was immaculate with L'Occitane toiletries and snow white fluffy towels and plenty of them.  We really couldn't have asked for more. The breakfast was perfect, a lovely selection of cereal, fresh fruit, croissants, scones, bread, preserves, yoghurt etc, served in the lovely mezzanine floor above the bar.  The bar itself, attached to the suites, was fantastic also.  We ate here just once but the Creole Fish stew was delicious.  And finally, the location.  Well, if you want great restaurants, Jazz\/Blues clubs\/Bars, and a short walk to Times square then this is the place for you. You are in the middle of Hells Kitchen so if you are looking for a tranquil retreat then go further out of town.  We were with 6 friends from Denmark who were staying at a large chain hotel close by but when they came and saw where we were they we so jealous.

This a great manhattan hotel and this is coming from someone who travels to NYC regularly and has stayed at several different hotels.  The location is great. A block and a half from Times Square.  That being said, you are not in the middle of the chaos of Time Square which was mandatory for me.   We booked one of the two bedroom suites which is perfect for a family. Two rooms, one shared living room with a sofa bed and one bathroom.  Here are the pros\/cons:\n\nPros: Location is amazing.  A couple of blocks to almost any subway line in the city. Any foodies out there? You will love this place. On restaurant row in Hell's Kitchen.    The rooms were very clean which is always the most important thing to me.  I mean really, really clean.  Very large balcony with a great view of the city.  The beds were comfy and the free continental breakfast was good.  The room was spacious as far as Manhattan goes.  The staff overall was extremely attentive.  See more in cons regarding a few issues we had.\n\nCons:  Saturday night we could hear a bit of the noise from the bars.  Not the hotel's fault, but something to consider. The rest of the nights we didn't hear much.  We had a few other odd issues here and there 1) none of the remote controls worked initially in our room, but as soon as we told the front desk they come up with new ones 2) only one t.v. out of the three had all the cable channels advertised in the list of channels provided by the hotel.  We reported this issue, but it was never resolved. 3) we had a strange noise coming from the pipes behind our restroom. This issue was resolved by the front desk and the staff was very apologetic and accommodating.  John at the front desk is great!\n\nOverall, our stay was great and we will definitely be back!!!

The reception has a good selection of NY themed DVDs which they are happy to borrow you. We also got fresh newspapers and local tips each morning delivered to our room. Upon arrival we got immediately upgraded to a better type of room (king suite I believe it was) simply because it was available (certainly free of charge). Oh, and the breakfast was also fresh and a wide selection each day!\nCons: I was certainly also wondering, what could be the problem with this hotel then? The only issue that we found was the fact that it is located right on the top of a bar&restaurant (called Bourbon). This would mainly affect the rooms on the first floor, looking to the street  - so I would suggest you to avoid threse rooms. The hotel has 3 floors, and on the first floor the following ones will be the good ones: 104, 105, 106 (these are still above the bar but not looking on the bar entrance on the street).

Arriving early I was welcomed warmly.  Monica at the front desk was very friendly and extremely helpful.  I was escorted to my room once I'd checked in, shown the conveniences in my room then shown around the small...boutique style hotel.  My particular room was \"over the bar\" and had a queen sized bed, TV, kitchenette which included a Keurig and an assortment of coffees, a built in hotplate and a small refrigerator and sink.  The refrigerator had free bottled water and a couple of drinks which were supposed to be magic hangover potions haha.  The room also had an ironing board, iron and blow dryer.  The personal products provided were L'occitain.  This location is about a block and a half from Times Square....close enough to walk yet far enough away from the constant crowds.  Located in the heart of Restaurant Row, there were plenty of places to enjoy dinner.  Kinky Boots theater is around the corner on 45th and Wicked was just a couple of blocks away.  This location is absolutely perfect!  I will say though, I was concerned about being over the bar and noise but didn't see anything on TA about that...if you are booking this particular room be aware that you will hear the music (especially over the weekend) from Bourbon St until about 3AM.  I was so tired when I got in each night that it really didn't bother me but I thought this might be helpful information to you.  \n\nLastly, since I flew in to JFK to save money, a taxi to mid-town this location is about $50+.  The day I left Monica (at the front desk) wrote out step by step directions on how to take the subway and Air Trans to JFK which ended up costing me $7.50 rather than the $50+.  She went over the directions a couple of times, then wrote them down and made sure I had her business card with telephone number in case I had any questions ....

We booked a small suite on the first floor but were upgraded to a bigger one which was a pleasant surpirse! We were aware that we could experience some noise from the bar on the ground floor (which by the way has an excellent atmosphere and stays open until very late if you fancy a last drink before going to bed - we did not eat there, though) but this did not bother us much. Do go for a high floor if absolut quietness is a must! The details as regards service indeed make the difference (newspaper and daily tips - including weather forecast for the day - on your doorstep every morning, l'occitane products, complimentary water and coffee machine). Overall, it was lovely and the location is excellent to explore midtown and the south of Manhattan. The continental breakfast is very simple and it could be improved with some ham and cheese, for example. One final thing that was a concern is that we asked reception to book a car to go to the airport very early in the morning and the driver was 15min late! As we had time, it was not an issue for us and the receptionist did point out to the driver that he was late. I hope they take serious measures as regards their car services to ensure this does not happen with other guests.","travelDate":"2014-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The continental breakfast offering that comes with the room is generous, with plenty of variety and good quality basic offerings.

I had heard some (horror) stories about NYC, about price gouging, tiny dogboxes of rooms, rude people ... so I spent some time researching and finally decided on the French Quarters, mainly because of its reviews. I still had my fingers crossed as we arrived in the taxi; initial impressions of W46th Street weren't great, with rubbish piled on the footpaths ... err, sidewalks ... and overflowing onto the road. This was somewhat compounded by the front desk -- a telephone box-sized area at the end of a long narrow passage.\n\nHowever, within a few minutes I knew I had chosen well ... the young bloke who checked us in couldn't have been more helpful or friendlier, check-in was a breeze, and we were soon in our room. My first impression was a feeling of comfort. This was no impersonal big hotel with cookie cutter rooms; this room had been designed and furnished by humans to make the guest feel comfortable. And it worked a treat. We had a separate bathroom (large!) with L'Occitane en Provence accessories, a pod coffee maker, a microwave ... everything we needed. Our bed was large and even my crook back had no complaints. \n\nWe later met the manager, Colin, who was a gracious and accommodating host. When I was unable to get a nightcap one night for my wife and me, he unhesitatingly handed over a bottle of his own 12-year-old Irish whisky, saying, 'Just leave what's left in the room'!! Amazing. He was happy to advise us and answer our endless questions about places to go, things to see, places to eat and hop-on, hop-off buses. Nothing seemed too much trouble for him.\n\nAs for location -- it's perfect. It's an easy 5 or 10 minute stroll (literally) to Times Square and only half a block to a major stop for hop-on, hop-off buses. At no time did we feel unsafe, even walking back to our room very late at night. On our last day, we weren't being picked up for the airport until 3.00 pm. I asked Colin if he could look after our luggage for us. 'Just keep your room until then', he said. I can't see that happening at too many hotels!!\n\nI think we would have had a very different -- lesser -- stay in NYC had we chosen a different hotel. We would go back there in a heartbeat, and i can only heartily recommend it to anyone who's even contemplating a visit.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The retro-tiled bath is dramatically lit, stylish and functional with a large glass walk-in shower. The linens are lush and bed is uber-comfortable with plenty of pillows and blankets.

It\u2019s a pretty small hotel of only 27 rooms so the staff is minimal. We were checked in by Colin; he was great.  He took us to our room, made sure everything was working, even adjusted the temperature in the room for us. The next day he was ok with us having a later check out. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the room does resemble that of an old New Orleans Hotel.  The Armoire, the end tables, the small table by the door, even the tile in the bathroom all have the \u201cold world feeling\u201d.  We stayed in room 202, which is a studio; there was a small kitchenette that had a small refrigerator, Keurig coffee maker, and even a small stove.  There is a restaurant \/Bar attached to the hotel called Bourbon Street Bar and Grill, all set up as if it were Mardi Gras.  We did have a problem with lunch the next day due to a gigantic group of patrons coming in, insufficient staff and not much available in the kitchen. We wound up leaving, but upon check out, we were met by the GM and the Executive Chef who could not apologize enough for their mistakes and offered us free lunch right then and there; since we had already eaten we declined but they sent us a \u201ccomp\u201d to our e-mail anytime we wanted it.  That was very unexpected and very nice and very nice to see someone taking ownership.  \nWe would definitely stay here again next time we are in New York.  \n\nA few tips: \nThe Hotel is on 46th Street, the parking garage that is contracted with the hotel is on 45th street.  Parking is $40 per 24 hour period.\nThe hotel is right in the heart of restaurant row and bars in New York stay open until 4am.  Any noise from the street did not bug us at all. \nYou are within walking distance to most of the shows on Broadway and one block from the subway.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We spent the weekend (Sat & Sun) in early December '13 to do some sightseeing, take in the sights and sounds of NY city at Christmastime, and to see the Rockettes Show. We arrived around 11:30am (3.5 hours before check-in), but were met with a clean room that was ready for an early check-in. The manager on duty walked notified us that we were being upgraded to a room with a King size bed at no charge, and took us up to our room and showed us around. He was very nice. The room was very nicely decorated and inviting. The room had a kitchenette (mini-fridge, 2 burner ceramic top stove, sink, and microwave), a very spacious and nicely decorated bathroom, and a king sized bed. There is a bar attached to the hotel, that is accessible through the elevator in the lobby, and is key controlled, so that only guests can use the elevator to go to the rooms. The lobby is also key controlled after 8pm. There are several parking garages close to the hotel offering good rates for parking. The walk to times square and the theater district is an easy one. It's basically a straight line to the heart of times square. There was a continental breakfast  being offered until 10am, and checkout was at 11am. I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel, and will, and will, gladly stay here again.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The Quarters' prime asset is the location quickly followed by the quality of the rooms and the intimate feel, it has only 27 rooms.  ( For readers of a certain age, the area reminded me of the video of the Rolling Stones' 'Waiting on a friend' ). We were only a short walk from the hustle & bustle of Times Square and as New York is a walker's city we found ourselves within striking distance of everything we wished to see.  The marvel of the Quarters is though you are in the midst of the action, above a lively bar (Bourbon Street Bar and Grille), with the sights and sounds of NYC on your doorstep, as soon as the windows are closed you are immediately cocooned in a peaceful, luxurious space of your own.  We took a 2 bedroom suite ( room 401 ) which to my very great surprise had a private balcony from which we could view NY's mid-town and 'restaurant row' (W46 street) below, featuring a good part of the world's cuisine in a single street.   The fridge was stocked for our arrival with water and an interesting herbal drink in plentiful supply.  Each day we received a free copy of the local newspaper and a 'What's happening today' fact sheet giving ideas of what to do and a guide to the weather.  This was a nice touch and typical of the manager's approach to looking after his guests.  \n\nThe King Size bed was fit for Henry VIII and the en-suite bathroom and main bathroom were exceptionally well designed and spotless every day.  A modest lounge and kitchenette separated the bedrooms though bizarrely the kitchen was stocked with neither crockery nor cutlery which suggested to us we were not really encouraged to eat in.  Frankly this was never an issue as eating out in NY has to rank as one of life's great pleasures.  Most days we would return to the Quarters tired and happy with our bellies full.  The layout of the Quarters is interesting , 2 sets of stairs only one of which will lead you to the mezzanine level for breakfast the other to the street.\n\nThere have been many comments on this site about the good quality of the buffet continental breakfasts.  We found the breakfast to be of variable quality (coffee in urns, limited choice of breakfast food) with mostly apathetic service, I lost count of the number of times I asked for hot water to make tea, and in the end we skipped in-house breakfast altogether in favour of proper coffee and tea from one of the hundreds of Starbucks throughout NYC.  Interestingly when Colin, the manager appeared I noticed the breakfast service upped its game considerably.  Similarly the approach and attentiveness of reception staff varied hugely. Still, this is New York I told myself and it's hard to impress a New Yorker with your plans for the day.\n\nWe had one negative experience.  I must stress I do NOT hold the Quarters responsible for this but I need to share this to alert other foreign visitors to NY.  One evening my wife suffered a severe allergic reaction, we suspect to sea-food eaten an hour earlier.  We rushed back to the Quarters.  The reception staff were on the ball and very attentive and called a 24 hour emergency doctor on my behalf.  The agency supplying the doctor needed my credit card details and promised to send a doctor within 30 mins.  The estimated cost given was $800.  The reception staff thought this was 'ridiculous' and suggested i took my wife to hospital.  On balance i decided to have the emergency doctor examine my wife first then take appropriate action.  One hour later the doctor arrived.  His first question was : 'may i please see your insurance documentation?'. I supplied and he read to his satisfaction.  He then turned his attention to the patient who by this time was sleeping and having taken a couple of anti-histamines appeared to be fine.  The doctor spent 5 mins examining my wife and announced she was fine and that the anti-histamines had done the job.  This was the reassurance i was looking for and i breathed a sigh of relief.  Next the doctor invited me to handover my credit card and complete AND SIGN a form which i did gladly, he then completed section 2 of the same form which included an itemisation of the costs.  The total was a staggering $3,700 !!!  When i challenged him that this was $2,900 higher than the estimate and that he'd spent only 5 mins and prescribed nothing his response was a shrug and 'the insurance will pay'.  When pressed he showed me a sheaf of a dozen or more identical forms the majority of which showed the same charge $3,700!  Having signed the form BEFORE the costs were itemised i had fallen into the trap.  The doctor, genial and friendly though he was had massively over-charged for his service.  This is a scam and well engineered to exploit people in a vulnerable state, so please, fellow travellers beware of this and never sign anything until you're clear on the total costs.  My credit card was debited the very next day with the full amount $3,700.\n\nI alerted Colin the manager to what had happened and he was furious and called the Doctor 24 agency immediately.  This particular case will continue for some time.\n\nHowever, aside from this unfortunate experience we all loved NYC and the French Quarters and I recommend it highly but please keep your eyes open and your wits about you.","travelDate":"2013-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}
