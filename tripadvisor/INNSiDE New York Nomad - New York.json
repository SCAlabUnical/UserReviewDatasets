Each one went above and beyond to ensure our stay was exemplary.\nFrom the Four Seasons to The Holiday Inn express and in between, this property is my favorite. \n \nOther important features of the property:\nLarge CLEAN rooms.\nGreat water pressure hot and cold!\nPowerful toilet.\nComfortable beds.\nSafe Safe Safe neighborhood-not too crowded nor noisy.\nRoom is quiet.\nAC works well even on higher floors!  Heat rises, but the AC meets the challenge. Eco friendly as well.\nWindows and natural light are excellent with blackout curtain if needed, but who wants to sleep in NYC during the day?? \nWindow opens, but only with a small space for safety purposes. \nEndless amounts of boxed water & the coffee is delicious with the machine in the room. The machine can be tricky, but the staff will help 24\/7.\nRoom rates at great price point. (Affordable!) \nThe staff & housekeeping will come 24\/7 to take care of any issue you may have. They are timely in their response and always come with a smile.\nI cannot name one negative issue with this hotel.\nRestaurant has delicious food and room service is fabulous.\nEveryone is hardworking and each person I encountered had such a giving spirit. \nI have tried to cover items which are important to me as a traveler who wants to feel the comforts of home. \nThere is nothing I should should warn you about.  My only warning is do not choose any other property! This is the best choice.\n\nRhonda \"Cookie\" Davis Stoner\nCookie\n","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was walkable to lots of places. The subway isn\u2019t too far, coffee shops and restaurants. \nThe water restock everyday was much appreciated. \n\nCons:\nWe checked in and when we entered our room it hadn\u2019t been cleaned. After a short wait, we were given the same room on a different floor. \n\nThe rooms are small with no real storage for your clothes. A room which was for 4 people was lacking hangers, robes and slippers. Our chromecast wasn\u2019t working, a phone that didn\u2019t work and a squeaky bed. After speaking to the front desk, we were told that the tv couldn\u2019t be fixed. We were given 30 minutes to be \u2018upgraded\u2019 to a \u2018suite\u2019. I shouldn\u2019t have to pack a whole room in 30 minutes because the room was not fit for purpose. \n\nThe suite had a living area. But was a sofa bed and a king bed. So not ideal for a family of four for a week stay. The room again didn\u2019t have enough towels, hangers or storage. There wasn\u2019t even bedding for the sofa bed. The room has several outlets that don\u2019t work and we had two lamps malfunction as well as the coffee maker.\n\nRoom service is basic. Food is sent to you in to go boxes. Plates seem to be a thing of the past. If you are paying a premium for a service you expect to get the basics. \n\nI don\u2019t think this hotel is worth the money. There are many other hotels in the area for this price which are better appointed. \n\nThe hotel needs work in terms of quality control. I\u2019ve never stayed in a hotel where so many things were broken. It was exhausting and put a huge dampener on what should have been a fun vacation.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Rack rates are surprisingly reasonable and you\u2019re close enough to walk to many sights. I even headed to Chelsea Market \/ Meatpacking and back (about 20+ mins.)

The king bed was very comfortable and clean. The bathroom had all natural peppermint & eucalyptus products which were refreshing with a double shower head. To have a minibar complimentary is a rarity. Of course it was unique in the sense it was waters and GUS sodas, but they were unlimited and always available. The room includes a nespresso machine which is a must for me every morning! Room service just about anywhere would typically have 20% or high surcharge, and here you simply pay whatever the menu price is and it\u2019s brought right up to your room when it\u2019s ready in a bag. Nothing fancy or elegant but fabulous to have standard menu pricing! The views of Freedom Tower with the Empire State Building reflecting off a building were stunning to watch sunsets, snowy skies and to wake up to each. Location wise it\u2019s accessible to Penn Station walking distance, herald square shops, Times Square is a longer walk but doable, and it\u2019s about a 20ish min walk down to the Chelsea Market area. The 1 train is right at the corner of hotel block which is convenient. At night I don\u2019t recommend walking alone though as the area changes from daytime to night. Overall it was a wonderful stay!

First of all she booked the wrong time and then we realised that she had also booked wrong size car and wrong airport - luckily we noticed this and we ended organising our own taxi via booking.com as it was cheaper and we knew correct.\n\nSlow service at the bar - sat there for at least 10 minutes before someone came to server us even though there were at least 3 members of staff around the area and no other customers.\n\nSometimes the room wasn't cleaned until after 4 pm which was generally the time we would go back after a day exploring.\n\nOn checkout the reception confirmed that everything has been paid and nothing else was needed l, however 5 minutes after we left and were sitting having our breakfast a payment of 250 dollars was taken out the account without prior warning or authorisation and we received no receipt. Eventually we had to email the hotel for clarification of what this was (resort fee but we assumed it was already as part of the hotel fee as it was taken on check in as other customers had who were infront of us)\n\nAlso the \"resort fee\" or 40 dollars is obscene for basically what equated to 2 bottles of water a day.\n\nAlso 5 business days since we checked out and still no deposit has been returned as stated would be by receptionist in 3-5 working days","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I appreciate this because I can't say this about all hotels. And that is why I spend more than at other hotels.\n\nHowever, there are several fees which are NOT easily seen upon booking. Firstly, there is a tax that is paid upon arrival (in addition to what you pay when booking). Mine was $49.50 for ONE night (I think this is new; I've stayed here 3 times prior and don't remember seeing this). This is in addition to the \"resort\" fee of $35. There are other hotel chains that charge this fee so it is not unique to Melia and it is usually buried or in small print when booking. I think these practice should be illegal, but I'm sure some lobbyist has convinced politicians this is acceptable and ethical, which it is not.\n\nThe restaurant did not provide the best service when I was there. Firstly, my latte arrived after my meal was delivered. And when the meal was delivered, there was no question about needing anything else. There was no salt on the table, for example.

Our room though was of good size with decent storage and a lovely shower. We were given water on demand at reception, although you do have to pay a resort fee for services like this and for the top floor gym which we didn't use.\nWe were given vouchers for breakfast in the Wilson restaurant which included OJ and coffee plus a choice of main dish (we'll leave a photo) which were all very nice. We also enjoyed an evening meal in the Wilson which was well presented and enjoyable.\nHotel is well located with easy access to tourist sites, the subway, restaurants, shopping (eg Macy's) and Madison Square Garden but in a relatively quiet neighbourhood. \nStaff in both the hotel and restaurant were helpful and friendly.

It is basically 2 connecting rooms, which was a bit different than expected, but worked well for us and gave our family a bit of privacy while also ensuring the kids were safe and secure. The rooms were nice, clean and we appreciated the lux vinyl flooring over carpet. The clientele was absolutely European and we heard many languages being spoken. It would have been nice if there was more \"lobby\" space to hang out and if the bar had been open later into the evening. The available common space was in a glass greenhouse-type space with overhead heaters, with hard plastic\/wood tables and chairs. There were a couple of couches right at the entrance but not very conducive to hanging out. We played cards one night in the glass area after sightseeing and the manager kindly turned the heaters on for us when requested. We had purchased the breakfast upgrade at the Wilson restaurant onsite and would probably not do so again. The food and options were very good, but the service was not and the host\/manager was not friendly at all. We definitely felt that those of us with the breakfast vouchers were not looked upon and treated as well as customers coming in without vouchers. If INNside is partnering with\/housing the Wilson onsite, it would be good if they aligned with the same level of service we received from the hotel staff, which were kind, welcoming and attentive.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"NONE"}

If there is an issue in your room, you have to wait until maintenance staff get in at 9:30 am - which is ridiculous if you have a schedule to maintain. This is the second of my two stays that have had serious maintenance issues (A\/C and shower this time), and they have been unable to help because they don't have 24\/7 maintenance, and they wouldn't change my room to a working one. The first time I stayed I was locked out of my room because the battery in the card reader failed, and they refused to call an emergency maintenance person even though I had medication I needed to take before bed. Instead they gave me a different room to sleep in, but I had nothing to sleep in except my work clothes, no toiletries, etc. Not to mention the security guard accused me of just being drunk and not knowing how to use a keycard, but later had to apologize when his own card wouldn't work and they discovered what the issue was. They also only supply one sheet on the bed. It felt creepy and unsanitary to only be separated by the mattress by a single flat sheet, and not have an additional sheet between you and the comforter. Lastly, the gym is kind of gross - they have a spot for cleaning wipes but it is always out (despite asking the front desk every day to have someone replace them), so if you want to disinfect your machine from someone else's sweat, you'll have to bring your own.  And of course you try to get help every single day that you're there only to be told every day that they'll put an order in, they're working on it, etc., but really they're just waiting for you to leave.

One more time, I want to say that I love this hotel. It is home away from home! This is the way how we are received there. This Meli\u00e1 is always evolving for good, the rooms, amenities, and much more. The extraordinary team is committed to deliver the very best. I want to mention breakfast; is very good. I truly recommend it if it is within your budget. Prices of the rooms are reasonable and of course one has to check from time to time if they change or if it is peak season, etc. Reserving through the webpage of the hotel is highly recommended. The hotel is located in a very strategic place where one can go walking anywhere. There is very good public transportation in NYC. The Meatpacking District is only a few blocks away from the hotel. I love walking to that area where the High Line is & Hudson Yards. Most importantly is to mention the people who make this hotel so special: the staff, mangers and general manager. They are professional and very attentive. In my case, as a Meli\u00e1 member, they try to offer me the very best within the possibilities and as some of them know us already, they know what are our preferences. We have celebrated there birthdays, anniversaries and much more. There is always a wonderful surprise waiting for us. Even if you are not a Meli\u00e1 member and you let them know what you need, they will go out of their way to make you feel special and happy. I have to thank once again all the people who work there and make this place so unique. Last year we were there when the Queen of Spain stayed for a few days and everything was well organized and peaceful. It was the week of United Nations. Manhattan is packed at that time. I want to give a shout out once again to Mr. Mauricio P. (G M), to Mr. Robert H.(one of the founders if I have to describe how much he means to us), Mr. Alex who is amazing, Ms. Christina who provides excellent customer service, Mr. Justin, who delivers excellency and all the rest of the team. Forgive me for the ones I did not mention but I have a limit to write. The Wilson, the restaurant of the hotel is very good. The food is delicious and drinks are well prepared. Also, the staff is professional and attentive. However, it will be nice to add to the menu some charcuterie as a small bite\/appetizer. Thank you for everything to ALL, and we look forward to our next visit. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MELIA in NYC. ","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room I considered adequately sized by NYC standards, but asethetically the room needed better attention to trim and condition, with more marks on the walls and doors than I expect for a hotel in this price range.  Cleanliness was adequate but underwhelming for the price.  The in-room frig with complimentary water and soda was a nice touch, but this merely takes some of the sting out of the $40\/day daily resort fee added on to the bill.  One of the most critical features, the bed, was surprisingly poor quality, squeaky, cheap frame, cheap unsupportive mattress, poor quality pillows, noisy.  I have recently stayed in a 2.5 star chain hotel with a far superior mattress, for example.  Poor bed quality translated to so-so sleep which is a dealbreaker for any hotel stay.  The TV had a surrounding frame with HDMI and USB ports to connect, for instance, a streaming device I brought, but the port did not work, a minor disappointment.  While the hotel excels at small touches to provide a charming personal touch, it fails in the most fundamental services  a guest needs for an enjoyable stay.  Ultimately I would not stay there again next time I visit NYC.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

At first, my company's dedicated travel agency made the reservations for me, but later on, I made the bookings myself for personal trips. I have visited New York more than ten times, and I will continue to stay at this hotel in the future. The advantage of this hotel is that the staff is veary friendly. Everyone tries to help me and solve any problems I have. Especially the manager, Akhlima, and the staff member, Christina, make me want to stay at this hotel just by meeting them. I visited the hotel for the first time this summer since last fall, and they recognized me at a glance. The closeness with the staff unexpectedly makes the trip enjoyable. Of course, all the staff members made an effort to assist me (really!), and I felt their dedication to resolving any requests. I want to express my gratitude through this comment.\n\nLet me share a practical story. The hotel is clean, and the bedding condition is really excellent. I recommend having breakfast here instead of going out to eat (depending on your plan). The sodas in the fridge are also really tasty. I tried to find a similar taste outside but couldn't. The only downside is that it can be a bit noisy in the early morning. The garbage truck dumps on 27th Street, and it was a bit loud. However, this is a common issue with all hotels in New York City. They lend bicycles in the lobby (it might be a bit risky if you're not familiar with New York roads), so I recommend trying it instead of renting a Citi Bike.  Anyway, I will visit here again. I usually don't write reviews or comments (cause it's very labor intense), but I wanted to write one for this hotel.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

Although it was inconvenient, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world as we literally only slept there for several hours before checking out.

It has now been more than 2 months and my deposit has not been returned. I have opened a dispute with my bank  for this charge as it seems as though I won\u2019t have my funds returned otherwise. I have read various reviews by other travellers in the same situation re: security deposit at Innside Melia NoMad. Unfortunately, as a result of this, I cannot recommend this hotel.

I highly recommend it. \nIt is located Midtown in the Chelsea\/Nomad area on 27th between 6th and 7th Avenues. It\u2019s right down the street from the Fashion Institute, an easy walk to PennStation and around the corner from MadisonSquare Park. I\u2019m a woman almost 80 years old and I felt safe walking everywhere, even late in the evening, and especially safe since the elevator access was with my room key. \nThere were always friendly and accommodating staff in the lobby. Leslie and Kima were especially kind and thoughtful. They offered me perks\u2026a free breakfast\u2026and an upgrade for my next stay. There was a frig in the room that\u2019s stocked with water and juices that were free and refilled as needed. Also, when I arrived I called down to request a tea pot, robe and slippers.  I\u2019m not a coffee drinker but there was full coffee service in the room. I left the room immediately to go out and was met at the elevator with these items already heading for my room. \nI loved the decor.  It was simple and smart. the room was bright and white with great natural light\u2026calming with hip retro touches. There was no carpet so it felt very clean but the floors were soft and warm. There was an excellent multi-head shower. \nThe outside spaces were perfect.  There was a Rose Garden for lounging and enjoying refreshments. It had a wall of roses and a swing for selfies and there were colorful umbrellas overhead!  There was also a courtyard at the entrance perfect for relaxing, socializing or people watching.  \nFinally, the restaurant had seating inside and outside. It was very comfortable and the food was excellent. They went above and beyond even letting me talk to the chef who told me how to make his unique and delicious breakfast potatoes. On the second morning as soon as I sat down for breakfast the waiter came right over with the tea I\u2019d had the day before. \nI couldn\u2019t have had a more perfect stay and look forward to my next visit!","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

Incredibly nice person and it set the tone for the rest of our stay. My Wife and I walked away that night already astounded by how nice he was.

We did NOT have views of Manhattan similar to the pictures on their website.  They also charge a daily \"resort fee,\" which many hotels do now, but there was nothing on the property remotely related to a resort\n*Low quality execution - the property felt like it was put together with the cheapest materials possible.

Ninguna de nuestras peticiones solicitadas con antelaci\u00f3n y con respuesta por parte del hotel que estar\u00edan todas preparadas, ninguna estaba y nadie sab\u00eda nada y tampoco nos dieron soluci\u00f3n para ello.\n\nViaj\u00e1bamos 3 adultos y el espacio de la habitaci\u00f3n era m\u00e1s que minimalista. Se supone que ten\u00edamos una cama de matrimonio y un sof\u00e1 cama convertible.\n\nLa cama de matrimonio era s\u00faper blanda, inc\u00f3moda para dormir.\n\nEl sof\u00e1 cama no estaba hecho y tuvimos que reclamar que nos lo hicieran. Cuando era s\u00faper tarde y ven\u00edamos exhaustos del viaje y del control de pasaportes de m\u00e1s de 3 horas.\n\nEl sof\u00e0 cama, al abrirlo, la habitaci\u00f3n a\u00fan era m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a, inc\u00f3moda, si cabe. Era indormible dormir all\u00ed para un adulto.\n\nDeb\u00e9is de tener en cuenta que era una suite con terraza y que pagamos un dineral por ella diariamente.\n\nLa habitaci\u00f3n estaba preparada s\u00f3lo para dos personas, en cuanto a enseres, tuvimos que reclamar, casi a diario, que \u00e9ramos 3 adultos  en la habitaci\u00f3n.\n\nIntent\u00e9 hablar con la persona que me hab\u00eda escrito los emails con mis peticiones y que me hab\u00eda dado la confirmaci\u00f3n. Pr\u00e1cticamente no abri\u00f3 la boca ni se disculp\u00f3 y los otros dos empleados de recepci\u00f3n se re\u00edan, creo que de m\u00ed.\n\nNo ten\u00edamos los adaptadores de corriente solicitados. Nos dijeron que se les hab\u00eda acabado. Tuvimos que reclamarlos a diario y al tercer d\u00eda nos los trajeron.\n\nHab\u00edamos pedido tambi\u00e9n un microondas, que hasta el tercer o cuarto d\u00eda de reclamar no nos lo trajeron.\n\nEstuvimos como indigentes en esa habitaci\u00f3n. Sin espacio en el armario ni en el ba\u00f1o. Ten\u00edamos que tener las maletas abiertas en el suelo y con mucha dificultad para movernos dentro de la habitaci\u00f3n.\n\nNo os fieis de las fotos son tremendamente enga\u00f1osas.\n\nLa pica del lavabo estaba medio obstruida, tragaba con dificultad, hasta q\tue en 2 o 3 d\u00edas que qued\u00f3 embozada completamente. Hasta 2 veces tuve que llamar a recepci\u00f3n para que subiera alguien a arreglarla, pues imposible de lavarse, una guarrer\u00eda.\n\nLa informaci\u00f3n que nos dieron las distintas personas que atienden en recepci\u00f3n fueron equ\u00edvocas e inexactas. Suerte de google maps y de espabilarnos por nuestra cuenta. Tanto en tema de desplazamientos como de cualquier cosa en general.\n\nLa limpieza de la habitaci\u00f3n aunque pongas el \u201cno molestar\u201d, pasan s\u00faper pronto, como a las 8h de la ma\u00f1ana, te dejan un papel bajo la puerta, que con el caos de la habitaci\u00f3n ni lo ves, diciendo que ya han pasado y no la han podido hacer. Si no das aviso en recepci\u00f3n cuando te vas, no vuelven a pasar, inaudito!!\n\nMuchos d\u00edas ten\u00edamos que reclamar, tazas, toallas, caf\u00e9, leche\u2026etc ...cuando me hab\u00edan dicho por escrito que diariamente repondrian y que pod\u00eda pedir la cantidad que quisiese.\n\nEl primer d\u00eda pedimos desayuno en el Wilson, tardaron mucho en traerlo. Se ve que subieron dos veces y que no les abrimos la puerta. Lo l\u00f3gico hubiera sido que nos llamasen por tel\u00e9fono desde recepci\u00f3n, y nada. Viendo que pasaba mucho rato llamamos de nuevo y nos dijeron que estaba abajo para recoger. Nuestra sorpresa a\u00fan fue mayor, cuando vimos que lo que pedimos estaba incompleto, faltaba el huevo por encima que deb\u00eda llevar.\n\nEs un hotel que no est\u00e1 a la altura en nada. Es muy de postureo. Lo \u00fanico que tiene de bueno es que est\u00e1 bien situado.\n\nQueridos viajeros de Tripadvisor\u2026 buscaros cualquier otro hotel.\n\nHab\u00edamos estado en otros Meli\u00e1 y la verdad, este hotel decepcionante!!!!\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room size is decent for the price I paid. The room has a window which when opened triggers the AC off. The WiFi in the hotel is decent. The room has plugs everywhere. The front staff seems nice. The mini bar is free and they stock it for you if ask so free water. \n\n The bad: you get no reception in the rooms. You get no view. They send you a form to fill out when chek-ing in online, don't bother filling it out as they don't read it or care about it. The beds squeak and make noise as you move. The shower area is really tiny so if you are a little big you might not be able to get inside from the door or you might hurt yourself trying. The water pressure in the room is not that great but is decent. \nI asked for no room service for the three nights I spent at the hotel and to my surprise my request was not respected. I don't know if housekeeping is paid per room they clean or what but I don't appreciate having my things touched when I explicitly told them verbally I don't want my room serviced and had my door on do not disturb sign. I'm glad I put some of my stuff in the safe cause not sure if they stole anything. I know it's a big accusation and I am paranoid but this is why I don't like my room serviced.  What's annoying even more is that their bed sheets have stains so it's not like the housekeeping team is doing a great job either. I find it really annoying and disrespectful to my melia status that my request is not respected. Finally the room is never pitch black so if that's a problem for you when you sleep then try to stay somewhere else or ask for a darker room.\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

Our experience was the exact opposite of everything I\u2019ve read. We booked this hotel based on these reviews and the fact we\u2019d always wanted to stay at a Melia hotel. My husband brought me and my 1 1\/2 year old to celebrate our anniversary as a treat. He had emailed in advance to tell them this and also to ask if we could have a bath and crib for our baby. They offered this, then went silent when my husband emailed back accepting. We turned up after a long flight from London only to find out they didn\u2019t have any record of this. Fine. The room they eventually sorted out for us had a bath plug that didn\u2019t work, was very dirty (hairs in the bath, on the floor, literal dirt I cleaned myself to try to bathe my son, and even strange things like a toothpaste cap left by the sink). They had downgraded us at this stage due to what type of room was available- or so we were told. When another manager arrived, he told us he could move us to the original room we had booked. We were confused but went with it. This next room didn\u2019t even HAVE a plug. By now, this was our second night. We rang down to ask for one. 2 hours later (and 2 calls later) still nothing. I had to shower my son whilst he shrieked in the end. No one ever brought one up- this is really basic. The next morning my husband and I heard the most enormous bang. The crib they had provided and assembled collapsed with my son inside it. He was caught half in and half out of the crib. I have attached photos below. We insisted on leaving shortly after this and on getting our money back. The hotel seem unaffected and not concerned by their negligence and disgustingly no one seemed the slightest bit concerned whether my son was injured or not. I am incredibly thankful he is okay but I urge anyone with younge babies and toddlers not to risk this. The shock and distress this hotel caused my family was traumatic. \n\nTo be clear about the hotel\u2019s response\u2014 they gave us a breakfast voucher to \u201cgo and calm down\u201d which could have been something, had my husband not found a hair in his food, had crumbs all over the \u2018clean\u2019 napkin he was given and my son never receiving a piece of toast we asked for for him. Again, these things are so basic that it is astounding such a well know hotel can\u2019t get them right. Lastly, my husband said very clearly he would not be willing to fit the bill for our taxi to the new hotel seeing as we\u2019d already incurred so many costs (taxi to them, phones calls to Expedia reporting the issues etc) due to their faults not ours. The manager accepted this, went off to a meeting and then denied what had been agreed so the lady at reception attempted to make us pay for the taxi! Our son had just fallen through one of their collapsed cribs! They still have yet to even reply to my husbands complaint which was sent to them and their CEO over 4 days ago now. We moved to the LUMA hotel which was wonderful. They were horrified at what had happened to us and could not do enough for us. I have yet to tell one person this who hasn\u2019t been completely horrified. I will not ever stay here again for fear of my son being unsafe and having a \u2018one problem after another\u2019 kind of stay. ","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was the perfect \"base camp\" for a trip like this. Innside is modern, well-designed and well-run. Its location near Penn Station and several subway stops made it ideal for someone who prefers to get around NYC without a car or taxi.\n\nMy room was small - it's New York city, after all - but very clean, functional and suitably furnished. It did not face the street, so it was extremely quiet, like sleeping in a womb. The HVAC worked great and I didn't need it at night, contributing to the quiet. The room also lacked the bright, often flashing LEDs that are a real pain in other places. The bathroom featured a shower (no tub), basic toiletries and great lighting. Just large enough to feel comfortable. The internet connected quickly as was reliable throughout. I never turned on the TV, so I can't evaluate it.\n\nInnside has a nice fitness room on the top floor that looks out on the Empire State Building, an inspirational view while working out. There is also a decent restaurant on the ground floor, but if that doesn't suit you there are multiple other restaurants offering a wide variety of cuisine types and price points nearby. There are also many retail establishments nearby, include groceries and pharmacies. In short, when you stay there you feel like you could live in that neighborhood comfortably.\n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, especially Jestin X, who helped me get a burnt-out lightbulb quickly fixed and also delivered a quick check-out while getting me a cab. I appreciate that the hotel allowed my to decline daily housekeeping, as I was in and out of the room at odd times throughout the day and didn't want to run into a housekeeper.\n\nMy only recommendation for Innside would be to improve its \"green\" features. There was no visible recycling infrastructure in the room or other suggestions on how to minimize waste and save energy and water while staying at the hotel. I was also surprised to find complimentary containers of drinking water in the room. New York has some of the best quality tap water in the world, so when a hotel puts containerized water in the room it suggests that the staff don't know what the water situation is and are actually dissing their own city's water system. I used tap water exclusively and it was fine.\n\nSome of my friends thought it odd that I would choose a hotel near Penn Station. They thought the neighborhood was bad. The neighborhood is fine! It's walkable and convenient no matter which direction you want to head. I was out walking at various times between dawn and midnight, and always felt safe. If you're comfortable in an urban setting you will love it here. I know I did, and I'll come back the next time I'm in NYC.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Jestin, Leslie, Christina, and the great crew at the front desk are warm and welcoming, and always provide great recommendations on things to do or places to eat.

I honestly prefer this area coz its not as loud and as crowded\/touristy than staying close to the Time Square. \n2nd- The hotel is close to a subway. It\u2019ll save you some steps from the hotel to the subway especially if it's freezingly cold or toasty during the summer (i bet). \n3rd- has a restaurant inside the hotel and it has a nespresso machine inside your room which sold me and my hubby. \n4th- the hotel is more modern than the other ones we saw that costco offers but room is just smaller. \n5th- staffs are very friendly and helps you with directions.

We stayed for 3 days and 4 nights. Our package included flight and hotel. Because we booked through JetBlue, we also got some goodies like a $25 uber credit and our resort fees paid for. From the moment we checked in, the gentleman who helped us (didn't get his name but he had blonde hair) was very kind to us. Once we got to our room, he gave us a call to confirm everything was great. No one ever does that anymore so thank you!!! That evening, we went out to explore bars and came back around 1 am. Jose at the front desk greeted us and asked us how our experience is so far. We let him know it was great and couldn't believe our resort fees were covered. He then told us because we booked through jetblue, we also would receive an uber credit. That was such a nice surprise! The following day, we noticed our shower was leaking water into our room. We informed the young lady at the desk working the night shift, and she arranged for it to get looked at and also gave us free breakfast for the inconvenience. I also didn't get her name but she was lovely and had a very soft voice. I was pleasantly surprised that every employee had the same mannerism when dealing with guests. I've stayed at other hotels where staff kind of just see this as a job versus aiming to give incredible service.

They all need a raise! \nHuge perk for us is that this hotel is rated LGBTQ friendly. We felt right at home.\nThe Wilson restaurant is right across from the hotel check in desk. We purchased hot drinks as soon as we checked in as we were freezing. Two lattes were $18 so pay attention to price tag if you are new to buying in NYC.\nWe booked a king suite with a city view. Our view was straight into some apartments in a building across the street. Not exactly the romantic view we had anticipated but we survived. The water got hot right away, which we loved. Being on the 14th floor, you would expect some delay. The pillows are very soft and squishy, if you are a firm pillow person this might not work for you. The TV was easy to navigate; we primarily used the Chromecast feature. There's nothing in the room to give direction or suggestions for meals, sights, etc. I would have preferred a 'staff recommended\" booklet\/print out of places within walking distance besides The Wilson.\n\nPlaces we found within 1-2 blocks-= Gregory's Coffee and Nangman BBQ (6th Street). The BBQ place is Korean food and so delicious! There's also a Duane Reade pharmacy right around the corner for any toiletries or other needs. \n\nThe hotel is able to hold your luggage after checkout..

He kept putting things on the house for us which helped me grieve France's loss in the World Cup! :)    They just reminded me why we stay there every time.  I recommend Melia to everyone traveling to NYC.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Well - that's not entirely true; our team did give me the option to stay at a different spot, but since all of our special guests were being put up here, it made sense for me to be here, as well.\n\nThe hotel was decent for the three nights I was here, but it's not something I would choose for myself. It was comfortable enough, and the location was good for our purposes (the event space was just over a mile away, easily walkable for our group.)\n\nMy room was much larger than I'd expected, but I did notice a faint odor when I first walked in. It was quite sewer-y, but it was close. The odor never quite faded over the course of my stay. \n\nThere was a small table in the corner near the windows where I was able to plug in to work the one day I had to skip the event. The bed was okay, a bit too thin and crickety for my preference. I didn't get great sleep while I was there, not sure if that was due to stress, the bed and thin pillows or something else altogether.\n\nThe bathroom featured my favorite thing about the room: that shower! Two shower heads with incredible water pressure, it definitely helped soothe the stress in my shoulders and prep me for the hectic days ahead. There was hardly any counter space to speak of, so if you're one who travels with skin, hair and tooth tools galore, be prepared to get creative.\n\nThey did offer a few free drinks within the room itself, which was a nice bonus. There were still water options as well as a couple of \"grown up sodas\", whatever that means. \n\nI'm removing a star because on my second night, I noticed that the deadbolt stopped working. It slid through if the door wasn't closed, but once I keyed in and closed the door behind me, I wasn't able to get the deadbolt to click through. I called to ask for help, and they told me it'd be taken care of. But it never was. I stopped by the front desk the next morning to follow up, but again nothing came of it. \n\nThe lobby was a hub of activity and people. On my first night there, they had a DJ set up in the corner. My friend, who happened to be in town at the same time, had come to my hotel to meet me for dinner and while she was waiting in the lobby for me to come down (you need a keycard to work the elevators in both directions), she texted \"you're staying in a party hotel!\"\n\nThe lobby restaurant is called \"The Wilson\", and if you're on the street looking for hotel signage, you'll likely see the restaurant's sign before anything else. I did have my last meal there, hosting a handful of the guests that were still in town; that'll be a separate review.\n\nOverall it wasn't a terrible experience, but the odor and the broken deadbolt did leave a bad taste in my mouth. I do know our guests were at least comfortable in their rooms scattered throughout the hotel, and that's the most important piece to me.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

They have everything else you need including hairdryer, iron, tv and small desk. These rooms don\u2019t have a view but the floor to ceiling windows are a nice touch. If I went again I would certainly pay the extra for a slightly bigger room with a view as the location is spot on if you want to be close enough to Mid town but be in a nice quiet area and I think the views are of the Empire State which is lovely. I would also pay the additional to have breakfast included as the prices are very high for very small portions although I don\u2019t think the avocado eggs were freshly cooked which was a shame given how expensive it was but other items looked nice and it\u2019s a cool restaurant and bar. My mini bar in the room was only stocked with water and low calorie sodas I\u2019ve never heard of, I\u2019m mentioning this as they seem to have this free mini bar as a selling point but there\u2019s no food or alcohol so don\u2019t get too excited. Still, was grateful for the fridge and two small bottles of water a day. There is a coffee machine but you only get two pods a day and some long life coffee mate milk.

Front desk crew of Jestin, Maggie & Leslie were so friendly and accommodating. So friendly is not always an adjective for people working in NYC, but they were great! Even the engineer that came up to help with a safe problem was so kind and helpful. \n\nWhen booking hotels it is important to have realistic expectations. I stayed at the plaza a couple of months ago. This is not the plaza. It was also probably 10 x less money! \n\nThe hotel is clean, modern, bright and fresh. Elevators are fast and efficient. We had a room on the 20th floor with a view of the city across from a very nice gym. \n\nBe forewarned\u2026 THE ROOMS ARE SMALL! \nNYC real estate is expensive. Hotel rooms can be oddly small. They have done a good job with limited space. The room had builtins a tiny desk and chair. Closet cabinet and we had a king size bed. This was perfectly fine. The bathroom is reminiscent of an airplane bathroom with a shower. Perhaps a little bigger, but not much. I prefer more space, but we made it work! The shower had good water pressure, the bathroom had good lighting. The toilet flushed with plenty of water. All good things. \n\nLocation can not be beat. Super close to so much! Close to train station and Hudson Yards and so much more. Easy to get an Uber within minutes. Right by FIT. \n\nThey have places to eat and drink inside that looked great. We did not have the opportunity to eat there, but totally would have. They also have 12pm checkout which is perfect! \n\nThe pandemic changed so much and the city is not as it use to be.  So many hotels have become dated, dark and just unappealing. We drove by a similar priced hotel up the street and the plants outside were dead and scraggly. Not welcoming. When we went outside our hotel to pick up a car, there was a man literally scraping something off the sidewalk to make it clean. I was impressed. \n\nAs a Melia rewards member I was treated so well and saw my room assignment on the app before I even got there.  \n\nHotel was a good value with lovely staff clean little rooms with good air conditioning and water pressure. Don\u2019t think twice. Stay here. You won\u2019t be sorry. \n\nAnd if you need bottled water or bandaids, just ask those nice people at the front desk.

It\u2019s such a cute, grown and sexy vibe! The decor and rooms were really nice and the space was used well - NY has small hotel rooms, but they were designed nice and well thought out. When we checked out we decided to grab a bite to eat at the restaurant \u201cThe Wilson\u201d and the staff was so accommodating.

When looking for a hotel, we are looking for a centrally-located hotel that provides a nice-sized room and with decent customer service.  In the search, I narrowed our search to Chelsea as that was centrally located to many restaurants and transportation including Penn Station, subway and other aspects.  Within Chelsea, we found Innside NOMAD by Melia Hotels.  I have stayed at Melia before but it was an all-inclusive in Punta Cana at the Melia Caribe Tropical but that was my first experience at a Melia hotel.  That experience was nice so when I noticed the InnsidebyMelia, decided to try out this hotel.\n\nThe hotel is located in Chelsea and is in walking distance to many shops, restaurants, and transportation access.  The hotel is 6 blocks from 34th Street and Herald Square, is 6 blocks away from Penn Station, and is close to Madison Square Garden as well as many subway stops.  The hotel itself is located on 27th Street between 6th and 7th Avenue; location on the side streets is very nice as it is away from some of the noise and hustle so you get a more restful sleep.  There are two main doors to the hotel - the outer door leads you into the covered patio for the restaurant and lounge and you walk straight through to the other door which leads you into the general lobby.  It is New York so everything is small including the lobby; in the middle of the lobby is a small sitting area while on the right is the restaurant and to the left are the check-in desks.  Because the lobby is a bit narrow, it can get crowded during peak check-in and check-out times.  Check-in is generally very quick and efficient and you get your key as well as bottles of water - bottles of water are available at the check-in desk and can be requested at any time. \n\nWe received our key and proceeded to the elevator.  The elevator was located in the back of the lobby and you needed your key to access guest rooms.  My review of the hotel is based on 3 different stays and each stay there were different rooms, all basically the same but the only difference is one room was bigger in size but amenities were the same.  When you get off the elevator and go down the hallway to your room, there is a full-length mirror next to each  room number and that was a nice feature of the hotel; to have a last look of yourself and outfit before proceeding out.  As you enter into the room, on one side was the restroom.  The restroom had a sliding door and contained a shower, a toilet and a sink.  The sink had a huge drawer underneath which contained all the towels plus the hairdryer.  There were refillable bottles with handsoap and lotion next to the sink and body wash and shampoo in the shower; the smells were really nice and it was very nice quality and options for the toiletries.  There was not a lot of storage space in the drawer but there was some; there was more storage space underneath the drawer.  As in all New York hotels, space is limited to the bathroom space is compact. \n\nOn the opposite side of the bathroom, in the entrance hallway was the open closet.  The closet contained a small iron and ironing board, a rack to hang clothes on, drawers underneath, shelves on top, and an umbrella in the closet.  Next to the open closet were open shelves and those contained the mini-fridge, the safe, and the coffee maker.  Next to the open closet was a landing where you could store your wallet and phones and along the closet was a ledge where you could store your phone.  Next to the closet mounted on the wall was the TV and at the end of the wall was the small table and chair.  There was a nice window that provided a lot of light and views of the city and there was a chair next to the window.  The beds were located along the wall across from the TV and I generally booked a room with 2 double beds - the beds were spaced out with a nightstand in the middle.  The nightstand had a phone on it and above were 2 small individual reading lights.  The beds themselves were comfortable and provided a good enough sleep; the beds were big enough to sleep 2 people comfortably.  \n\nAs I said, the review was based on multiple stays and 2 stays were in the same room type while a 3rd stay was in the bigger room.  The typical room type was spacious enough and was a standard hotel size so 2 people could comfortably fit; it was definitely more spacious than some of the other NYC hotels I have stayed at.  The bigger room had the same amenities but was more spacious - there was definitely more space in the bathroom and in the bedrooms which meant that 4 individuals could comfortably fit into that room.\n\nAmenities in the hotel included wifi, bottles of water, a fitness center, a restaurant, and meeting rooms.  There is a $35 daily resort fee to cover all the costs of these amenities which to me is just another excuse to get more money because I doubt these amenities cost that amount nor is there enough demand on all the facilities to justify that costs.  The bottles are water are limitless so you can go to the front desk multiple times a day to get bottles of water; the wifi was fast and you can load as many devices as you want so both of these were nice.  Because I was usually on there for a weekend I never had time to access the fitness center (and when I did try and check it out it was closed due to COVID restrictions).\n\nOverall, it is a nice centrally located hotel in Chelsea.  The location is perfect with easy transportation and walking access to many shops and restaurants.  The room itself is not squashed and is a decent size, the supply of water (which is important when travelling) and the multiple devices on wifi make this a nice hotel in New York City.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel restaurant (The Wilson) was constantly booked when I was there, with dinners sometimes spilling into the lobby (with their plates of food).  And the restaurant did not appear to be open on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nThe room was small, as per usual in NYC, although it did not feel cramped.  There were some technical glitches - several major  broadcast channels on the flat-screen TV were simply bank (NBC, Fox, etc.).  The bathroom shower controls require you tot and in the shower to turn it on - be prepared for a blast of cold water.  Also, I really had to slam the door shut to make sure it locked.

The front desk held my luggage until my room was ready. I had a balcony room and it was worth the money.  My room was clean and I opted for daily housecleaning. Due to covid, you may have to ask for certain amenities, like slippers, robes, blow-dryer, iron + ironing board, etc. My room had a small fridge which was perfect to store beverages in. Also, you can request complimentary water bottles, which is a plus. I enjoyed the Nespresso coffee maker in the room; the coffee mugs were cute too. The rainfall shower was very nice, but if you don't want to get your hair wet, you don't have to use the rainfall shower. They have liquid soap and 2-in-1 shampoo\/conditioner. I didn't use their shampoo\/conditioner as I brought my own. Soap smelled nice as did the hand lotion in the bathroom. The AC in the room works really well. I prefer a cold room and I had it on the lowest setting. I only used the black out curtain once because I preferred waking up to the city views. The bed and pillows were comfortable.  I didn't use the gym, but the gym provides amazing views of the city. A nice little perk was the view of the One World Trade Center as you wait for the elevators to come up to your floor. The view never got old and elevators are fast and uniquely decorated.  The Wilson is the adjoining restaurant. They were friendly there too. I went for brunch and it was packed.  Reservations are highly recommended and they will seat you when all of your party has arrived.

I told her I prepaid for my stay so what fees would be charged to my account when the computers came back up.. She advised she couldn't confirm what i'd paid until the system was back up. She offered me 2 waters. I asked if they were free, she playfully stated she would not offer it they weren't free.  She told me I would be notified when charges are made. I checked in on Thursday and by Saturday I had not been notified. I asked another front desk staff about my account.. she never looked it up but said i would receive my charges etc on check out. I asked again, if I prepaid what charges would be on my account. She explained that there is a $100 deposit that's charged to my card and a $35 per day resort fee.  The deposit will be refunded. I inquired as to the purpose of the $35, she stated it's for the amenities. I asked what the amenities were. She stated, unlimited water, expresso machine, work out facility (i believe on the 20th floor), and free bike rental. I was actually at front desk to get cups for the water we purchased at a convenient store. I advised her coffee and water water accessed off premises because I was unaware that they were amenities. She apologized, offered to send up expresso machine and offered me water (i had a gallon of my own). She advised the manager would be available in the morning.. HERE IS WHERE IT ALL CHANGED.. I met with Alexander  Martinez. He actively listened to my complaint, looked up my account, explained to me when I purchased online it also stated I would be charged a $35 fee by the hotel. He continued by confirming that we received our expresso machine and advised I could have as much water as I needed (i don't have to take 2 at a time). He reiterated the amenities that they have available. He then offered to remove the resort fee for 2 days . I of course had to pay the fee for the days I was made aware of the fee and amenities, which was fair.  In the middle of the night, just hours before my flight departure, my flight was cancelled. NO flights for the day. I called front desk and they suggested I call after 8am. When I called at 8am, I asked for Alex; I was told he would be in at 10. I explained to him my dilemma. At this point, i had to pay an additional $238 to fly home (don't ask). I asked for a fair rate for the additional night as I might have to go to another hotel if he couldn't provide. He offered a fair rate for the unexpected stay.  He could have tried to monopolize on my desperate situation, but he didn't. THANK YOU ALEX.  Yes there were hiccups at the hotel, but ALEX worked to rectify it all. I don't expect perfection, but I do expect to be treated like a valued customer. Alex did just that.

We took the Acela into NYC and the Innside was about a 10 minute walk and very easy to find. We arrived around 11:30 AM and asked to have our baggage stored but the hotel was able to check us in early which was really nice! \n\nThe hotel lobby is small and has some seating but it is very clean and there is an outside lounge area which was highly utilized and very comfortable. \n\nOur room was on the 16th floor and faced the front of the building. There wasn't a spectacular view - if you are looking for a view you may want a higher floor or possibly the other side of the building may provide one. \n\nThe room and bathroom aren't huge (which we didn't expect as it is a city hotel) but provided plenty of storage, a small refrigerator and served our needs. If we had wanted a coffee maker we could have requested one be brought up. We didn't experience any noise while in the room - either from the outside or from other guests. We actually didn't see any other guests on our floor. One night we did want an extra blanket and housekeeping brought it up to our room very quickly. The room itself is very minimal and modern (think white walls, glass walled shower, small table and chair, etc.). There were some dings around the bed frame and along the bottom of the wall but it was normal wear and tear and what I would expect. We found that the room and bathroom were very clean as well as the common areas (halls, elevators, lobby, common area bathroom).  \n\nWhen we checked out we still had several hours before our train was departing. The hotel was able to store our baggage for us and retrieved it in a timely fashion when we returned. \n\nAs a side note: this is an especially good location if you have a student attending or interested in attending FIT as it is at the end of the street. We went to the FIT museum and while it wasn't huge there was a nice exhibition and a nice way to spend an hour. \n\nEveryone at the hotel was attentive and checked with us on how our stay was going as well as if there was anything they could do better.\n\nThere is a restaurant on site. We didn't try it but it was very popular and does offer breakfast on most days.\n\nI would stay at the Innside again based on the location as well as the attitude of the staff and overall care of the building.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

They offered us a room on the 15th floor, and late checkout as compensation..... Not worth the up-charge we paid.  Full disclosure we booked through a third party- COSTCO TRAVEL, so maybe they give the less desirable rooms to these travel partners.

The reviews here are 100% accurate.  The Nomad is a beautiful hotel located in the flower district just a very short walk to Penn Station.  The hotel is impeccably clean.  It feels cleaner than a hospital and one has no doubt that they take cleanliness very seriously.  The hotel is also very secure with security always present in the lobby and needing your key to access the elevator.  The rooms themselves are very modern and large with lots of space to store your things.  I stayed in a king room alone but this room could easily accommodate a couple for a week long trip or more.  The bed is also very comfortable.  And the room is very bright with floor to ceiling windows.  However, what makes this hotel truly exceptional is the the staff.  The staff from the front desk to housekeeping and maintenance to management are exceedingly attentive to every need.  They respond almost immediately and always leave you with the sense that they are genuinely happy to assist you and very appreciative for your business.  It is difficult to find good hotels these days and almost impossible to find exceptional hotels like this especially in New York and especially at these prices.  This is an absolute must and where I will be staying from now on when I travel to New York.  Highly recommend to all types of travelers.  You will be just a pleasantly surprised as I was.","travelDate":"2021-04","tripType":"NONE"}

We have driven past almost everyday for years. \n\nWhen I discovered the hotel online and saw rooms and they had terraces, I was sold. I booked a few nights and the rest is history!\n\nFrom our first step through the door, we were greeted warmly. The woman (front desk manager at night) was lovely and accommodating and made us feel at ease. \n\nI said to my husband after she checked us in, do you think the hotel will be as nice as she says... She did not disappoint. So much so that we kept extending our stay. \n\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention Alex. The daytime front desk manager. Every time we walked in or out he greeted us. He even asked about our puppy when she wasn\u2019t coming back one night. \n\nThis is a luxury hotel with heart and soul. The staff is gracious and kind and makes guests feel welcome. \n\nThis is a 300 plus room hotel and we felt like the only ones there.

The excellent customer service from Alex, Whitney, and the rest of the staff downstairs has been instrumental in why I've come back. I could choose to stay anywhere but I choose Innside because of the extraordinary experience here. Alex in particular goes above and beyond to make sure all my needs are taken care of.  From extra card keys, using the gym upstairs or suggesting places to go or see, I'm very appreciative for his upbeat attitude to genuine nature. It's so difficult to find hotels with exemplary customer service but I have never felt that while staying here. That is so important to me and I always feel like I'm right at home here. I will continue to say nothing but beautiful things about  Innside because I feel like I have a family away from home. It's been so great getting to know the staff here. Thankful to know Alex and couldn't imagine coming here and not seeing his lovely face. To me coming to Innside is not an ordinary experience. It's an international hotel located in the FIT area.  It's as if you're in Brazil or Paris but you're actually in New York. It's wonderful seeing people of all walks of life and ages come and stay here. I hope you'll decide to give Innside a chance.

From the moment that I checked in, the Director of Rooms, Robert Hughes came to the rescue! I was clearly upset about the rain, but he put me at ease. He upgraded my room, and made sure I was all set with the accommodations. I noticed that there was an indoor\/outdoor garden attached to the lobby, and inquired about possibly using it for my ceremony instead. To my surprise, Robert advised that I was able to use the garden with no problem! I was so thankful, because I did not have a plan B for the outdoor wedding. In short, the ceremony was absolutely exquisite! The garden lights, the sound of the rain - everything was just perfect. Hotel employees Angel, Jose and Alex all helped me with reservation changes, and any other requests that I needed while I was there. I would totally recommend having your ceremony or other special event onsite at the Melia Nomad hotel. The friendly and knowledgeable staff, the hip, cool property and the incredible, sweeping city views are all reasons to stay here. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in helping to make my day as special and as beautiful as it was. Robert especially, went above and beyond to help make our stay and wedding absolutely spectacular. The most important part, in my opinion, the photos, were simply stunning!

We had one of the Townhouse Suites on the 20th floor (room 2006). The suite's design was so off, that I was very surprised as I know that Melia prides itself with being modern and designed well while being very functional. It felt like they tried to furnish a suite with exactly the pieces of furniture that go into a single room, hence it felt empty. There was nothing on the walls either (including no hooks for towels in the bathroom), not a single picture. The A\/C was so loud and constantly running that we had to shut it off all together. When we took a shower, the bathroom floor was flooded. Also, you entered the suite into what could be described as a living space. From that room, you could enter the bedroom to the right or the bathroom to the left. There was no direct way to get from the bedroom to the bathroom. The breakfast was ok, but very basic and not as spectacular as it was advertised. The hotel seems to make extra income on the side and has rented out a part of what was formerly the breakfast room to \"Kettlespace\" a co-working chain in New York City. Extension cords all over the place to provide extra outlets, it didn't look safe. I hope our experience for this one night stay was unique, but there are better options for $450\/night (incl. breakfast). We won't return.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Pros: Room was quiet, clean, beds comfortable, and everything worked. Cons: Room was small, not enough hooks in the bathroom to hang towels, beverage center was useless bc you could only make one size coffee since only the smaller espresso cup could fit under the spout. These are small \"cons,\" but after a few days, they would become annoying. The major negative at this place is the $40 daily service fee. They tell you this will cover all the juice, tea and coffee you would like.  However, they only carry one type of tea and coffee, so if you would like something different, say herbal, you have to go to the restaurant and pay $5 for the tea. Seems that they should carry at least a few extra varieties for the $40 surcharge. My advice to the hotel: Skip the surcharge and add a few $ to the overall price, or actually make people feel like they are getting something extra. All in all, it was a fine stay.

The disturbing trend in hospitality is this \"resort fee\" where hotels (many hotels, not just this one) tack on extra per-day charges for things like \"free\" wifi (which, by the way, in 2019 is like saying \"free electricity in your room!\"), \"full access\" to the mini bar (which included one fancy box of water -- about 16oz -- and 3 cans of soda which we don't drink), and \"full access to all the hotel amenities\" (meaning, you're allowed in all areas but you still have to pay for anything done in those areas). I wish they'd just increase the price of the room and have the per-night fee the only thing you get charged at checkout (except, of course, if you order room service in or have your laundry done). This fee is especially bothersome when there's nowhere to hang a hand towel or facecloth, there's a crack on the back of the door near the lock making us wonder about safety (maybe this could be fixed before you rent the room?), and only about 4 channels on the TV worked for us (eventually we called down and it was fixed). I have no complaints about the hotel staff who were all lovely, warm, friendly, hard-working people and would highly recommend this hotel when it's undersold and not at the peak of the season as I'm not sure it would be as great of a value at a higher price point.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Algu\u00e9m tirou enquanto dorm\u00edamos.\n\nTeve um dia que chegamos ao quarto e a porta estava apenas encostada (e n\u00e3o completamente fechada), ou seja, qualquer um poderia entrar em nosso quarto.\n\nOs recepcionistas s\u00e3o terr\u00edveis. Eles n\u00e3o d\u00e3o UM sorriso. N\u00e3o te olham nos olhos. Parecem rob\u00f4s. Quando cheguei (check-in) nem me deram oi. Me falaram que a taxa de facilidade (que eu teria que pagar ap\u00f3s o check-in) era o dobro do que constava em minha confirma\u00e7\u00e3o de reserva (que no check-out, com muito custo, consegui que ajustassem de acordo com a confirma\u00e7\u00e3o - mas se \u00e9 algu\u00e9m que n\u00e3o fala o ingl\u00eas t\u00e3o bem j\u00e1 fica no preju\u00edzo aqui). Quando eu ligava para pedir o relatado acima (para repor toalhas, etc) a recepcionista at\u00e9 bufava. Horrivel. Me sentia incomodando o staff, sendo que eu estava pagando bem caro para estar ali - que n\u00e3o entrega nem 30% do pre\u00e7o que cobram.\n\nRecebi alguns pacotes durante a minha viagem e TODAS as vezes, sem exce\u00e7\u00e3o, eles n\u00e3o achavam meus pacotes. Eu tinha que ir na Recep\u00e7\u00e3o 2 ou 3x por dia para que eles conseguissem achar. Teve pacote que chegou em um dia e eles me entregaram somente 4 ou 5 dias depois, sendo que eu perguntava todos os dias. Qual a dificuldade? Por qual motivo n\u00e3o queriam entregar os meus pacotes? Isso me causou bastante transtorno pois muitas vezes eu tive que contatar os vendedores que ficavam desesperados pois j\u00e1 haviam entregado os pacotes h\u00e1 dias. S\u00f3 me fez perder tempo e ter dor de cabe\u00e7a. No \u00faltimo pacote que procurei, um dia antes do meu check-out, a recepcionista me disse que n\u00e3o haviam entregado e nem entregariam mais at\u00e9 2a feira (isso foi na 6a feira e meu check-out era no s\u00e1bado). Este mesmo pacote havia sido entregue na 5a feira ao 12h02. Por qual motivo esta recepcionista fez isso?\n\nV\u00e1rias vezes quando eu ligava na recep\u00e7\u00e3o (por qualquer um dos motivos acima) o staff me dizia que o hotel estava muito cheio e n\u00e3o conseguiriam me atender naquele momento e me retornariam em 15 minutos. Estou esperando at\u00e9 agora.\n\nTeve teste de alarme de inc\u00eancio sem aviso aos h\u00f3spedes. Acho isso uma falta de educa\u00e7\u00e3o, pois a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 horr\u00edvel e, mais uma vez, se \u00e9 algu\u00e9m que n\u00e3o fala ingl\u00eas para entender o que est\u00e3o anunciando no viva voz dos quartos, ficar\u00e1 desesperado, ainda mais diantes desta situa\u00e7\u00e3o de terror.\n\nMe emprestaram um guarda chuva, sem custo, por 2 dias. \nE o restaurante, o \u00fanico do hotel, embora fechado no per\u00edodo do jantar por dois dias seguidos da minha estada - sem aviso pr\u00e9vio - \u00e9 muito bom! N\u00e3o tem muita variedade, mas os itens que tem s\u00e3o maravilhosos e muito bem feitos. O staff do restaurante \u00e9 agrad\u00e1vel e solicito.\n\nEach evening, when we got tired back to the hotel, we had to call Reception and ask for replacement of towels and coffee caps because the maid did not replace these items in our room.\nIn addition, there were days when they did not remove the trash from the bathroom and \/ or did not replace toilet paper.\n\nThe bed is very comfortable, but super badly made up - the person who makes the bed doesn't even hold the sheets, so if you lift the pillow you already see the mattress.\n\nOne day we woke up and the \"do not disturb\" sign was no longer on our door. Someone took it while we slept.\n\nOne day we got to the room and the door was just slammed (not completely closed), meaning anyone could enter our room.\n\nThe receptionists are terrible. They do not give a smile. They do not look you into your eyes. They look like robots. When I arrived (check in) they didn't even say hi. They said that the facility fee (which I would have to pay after check-in) was double what was on my booking confirmation (which at check-out costly I managed to adjust according to the confirmation - but if you are someone who does not speak English so well you are already at a loss here). When I called to ask for the above (to replace towels, etc.) the receptionist even snorted. Horrible. I was bothering the staff, and I was paying dearly to be there - that does not deliver even 30% of the price they charge.\n\nI received some packages during my trip and EVERY time, without exception, they did not find my packages. I had to go to Reception 2 or 3x a day so they could find it. There was a package that arrived in one day and they only delivered it to me 4 or 5 days later, and I asked every day. What is the difficulty? Why didn't they want to deliver my packages? This caused me a lot of trouble because many times I had to contact the sellers who were desperate because they had delivered the packages for days. It just wasted my time and got a headache. In the last package I looked for, the day before my checkout, the receptionist told me they had not delivered and would not deliver until Monday (this was on Friday and my check-out was on Saturday). This same package had been delivered on Thursday at 12:02 pm. Why did this receptionist do this?\n\nSeveral times when I called the front desk (for any of the above reasons) the staff would tell me that the hotel was too busy and could not answer me at that time and would return to me in 15 minutes. I'm waiting till now.\n\nOn the last day also had a fire alarm test without warning to guests. I think this is impolite, because the feeling is horrible and, once again, if you are someone who does not speak English to understand what they are announcing in the room voice, you will be desperate, even more in the face of this terror situation.\n\nThey lent me an umbrella, free of charge, for 2 days.\nAnd the restaurant, the only one in the hotel, although closed at dinner for two straight days of my stay - unannounced - is very nice! It doesn't have much variety, but the items it has are wonderful and very well made. The restaurant staff is nice and solicitous.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Reception staff were super friendly and efficient and we were given good tips on how to get to JFK on the subway and AirTrain - good to know especially if you're leaving during evening rush hour on a Friday.

Nomad, Bleeker Street, the Prix Fix lunch at Scarpetta- all great. The Innside- not so much. The issue is not the service or location, but rather the misleading advertising that will leave you with that feeling of disappointment the minute you open your door and walk into the room. On October 23,2019 I stayed in the Innside Queen Guestroom, featuring, according to the chain's website,  \"Modern, contemporary design and spacious rooms measuring 230 sq. feet.\" . Much to my surprise, like your typical 2 star NYC hotel, the space was small and cramped, you could touch all 4 walls from the bed! Turns out these are end rooms behind the staircase, which lops off a chunk of room space, and creates the need for a 100 sq. foot hallway to access your actual room. You might say \"you get what you pay for\", but at $1000 for 2 nights, not at this hotel!
