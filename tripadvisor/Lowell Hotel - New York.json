My Deluxe Junior Suite was very accommodating with seating space and a ivy laced landscaped terrace. Fresh flowers, curated art work, hardwood floors, desk and armchair rendered a residential feel to the environment. Classic casement windows that opened, provided natural light, fresh air and cityscape views. A wood burning fireplace elevated the coziness of the space. A marbleized bath was outfitted with separate soaking tub and shower, dual basins and heated floor. The Lowell is endowed with an array of eating and drinking venues. The Majorelle is a restaurant offering a menu of French classics fused with Moroccan influences. The decor of the Majorelle is \"well dressed\" with beautiful floral arrangements and table settings. Luxurious dishes from the menu include: Snails in Puff Pastry, Grilled Branzino, Roast rack of Lamb, Duck Breast and Pistachio Souffle (the house specialty). I tried the Lobster Risotto....excellent.......and I didn't pass on dessert.....Mille Feuille.....a gem of a sweet. Seasonal bar bites and coveted cocktails can be had at Jacques Bar with a decor inspired by the beautiful Majorelle Garden of Marrakesh (I loved the Moroccan Mint Tea). The Club Room is an absolutely sumptuous communal place where one can enjoy a drink and\/or a small bites menu. The Pembrooke Room is a renowned European emporium available for daily breakfast, brunch and afternoon tea.\nSo, if you want the intimacy of a small luxury hotel with beautiful surroundings coupled to impeccable service................then try the Lowell Hotel............................\n.............a gem of a hotel.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Front desk could not move us into a better room and also would not reduce the price of the room given that there was no terrace, no kitchenette and it was not a bright corner room.  Very dishonest.  Also the heat was not working properly in our room so the suggestion by the bellman was to turn the heat up to 80 degrees.  Still cold and we were charged for the firewood and the log tax for our stay.  Hidden costs and quite frankly appaling given that our room was freezing.

They earned it and totally lived up to their expectation during our most recent stay.  The property is stunningly gorgeous.  The Club room is one of the most tastefully appointed public spaces I've ever seen in any hotel. Kudos to the decorator who was able to achieve such an intimate and charming ambiance in a fairly large space.  We tried to lounge there as often as we could.  We didn't get a chance to eat at their Michelin Star-rated fine dining restaurant La Majorelle, named after the beautiful Majorelle Gardens of Marrakesh that we had the pleasure and fortune of visiting just a few months prior, but their other food outlet the Bar Jacques did not disappoint.  I think their crab cakes and that goat cheese salad I had were the best I've ever tasted in my life.  Who knew you could get such great-tasting crab cakes outside of Maryland lol! These put them to shame.  And the green pea risotto was to die for.  Everything just tasted so refined and curated using the highest quality ingredients and attention to detail.  As for the rooms, we got upgraded to the junior suite thanks to the generosity and graciousness of the Front Desk Manager - I do not remember his name - but wow were we floored by that last-minute change to our room.  They actually checked us into one of their standard rooms as per our booking but then surprised us within mere minutes of arrival to tell us they were transferring all our luggage to the Junior Suite which was just the best birthday gift ever!  Even the standard rooms are gorgeous, spacious, and impeccably decorated with a wood-burning fireplace, marble bathrooms, etc but the Junior suite is a feast for the eyes complete with a kitchenette that came in handy as we needed to prepare our dog's meals in there and a bathroom the size of a mini football field lol, also with marble from head to toe.  The other really unique and special amenity of this hotel is they are so uber generous with their towels.  I counted something like 20 towels in all sizes and all perfectly folded and all embroidered with the hotel's very regal-looking insignia.  With all that said, what sets this hotel apart from the rest, and probably why it earns first place every year by the most reputable and credible travel magazines, is its service.   The staff are just the friendliest most down to earth most eager to help staff on the planet.  From the doorman Pedro to the check-in people like Hugo and that other super lovely African American lady, again I forgot her name (sorry), and also the incredibly helpful and knowledgeable concierge - we were always in the most capable hands.  We brought our dog with us on this trip and each and every staff member just doted on her making her feel like the most pampered and loved guest.  Irina our cleaning lady who is super dog friendly being a dog parent herself was just the nicest ever.  She came in each evening to turn down our room despite the doggie being there and asked us her name from the onset of our trip so that she could call her by her name when commanding her to sit or stay so that she could get on with her work.  I thought that was super clever and really appreciated these little touches that make you feel right at home.  The company's mission statement is to make the hotel feel like your home away from home.  They have achieved that unequivocally, wholeheartedly, and most sincerely as well.

He too fell in love with the hotel. It was FABULOUS in every way and we are British hoteliers with 4 of our own. \n\nThey made our son feel special with a cake and sparkling wine in his room. I had a bit of a nightmare trying to find decorations\/balloons to decorate his room as a surprise with not much help from concierge and nothing to buy in any nearby shops, compared to England where they sell this stuff everywhere but we did the best job we could at short notice.\n\nAll the staff were fabulous. Although I would say, my son being overwhelmed and exhausted, on checking out, forgot to pack some expensive champagne - Veuve Cliquot - and beautiful macarons we bought him at great expense and a giant bag of Red Vines candy. Within 3 hrs of leaving the room they had disappeared, even though we hadn\u2019t officially left the hotel, they still had all our bags whilst we went shopping. I just think housekeeping should be meticulous at handing things in, to be held for say 48hrs rather than taking the stuff. The hotel were very kind and let us have some of their frozen macarons and a different bottle of champagne, but the staff should be trained to hand in ANYTHING found in the rooms when you\u2019re paying this much to stay in a boutique hotel. \n\nSpecial mention must go to the receptionists, breakfast staff and doormen, they really made our trip.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It's a hop-skip-and-jump from the fashion houses of Madison Avenue, a few steps from 5th Avenue, Central Park and NYC's most notable museums.\n\nI appreciated my spacious, luxuriously designed Lowell room with oak floors, fresh flowers and decor in pale blue and neutral colours. It emanated a residential feel with custom headboards, antique oriental rugs, unique furniture and desk. The massive marbleized bath featured a separate tub and shower.\n\nThe Lowell has a fleet of dining options. The Majorelle is a Mediterranean inspired eatery couched in a Chateau-like dining room with a petite skylit garden. The menu displayed exciting food fare like Sea scallops with parsnips to Loin of Venison. I selected Snails (in puff pastry), Rack of lamb and a dessert of Chocolate Mousse......a delicious ensemble. Jacques Bar serves light fare and inventive cocktails while the Club Room, a quaint facility, is open to hotel guests only during the day hours serving off a small menu. The Pembroke Room serves a traditional breakfast for guests only. Service is supreme here.......catering to every guest's whim. A spacious in-house fitness centre allowed me to follow my exercise regime on the road.\n\nSo, if you would like over-the-top accommodations, top-notch dining and a near perfect attraction location.....then try the ........Lowell.........An Elegant Jewel Box.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

While the room was rather small the bathroom facilities and comfort were exceptional. We were disappointed that there was no coffee machine in the bedroom, only sachets of coffee granules and no fresh milk. We found the breakfast service to be slow and inefficient and the breakfast itself of only average quality. The Majorelle restaurant and adjacent bar were excellent but rather overpriced, even for a 5.star hotel. In terms of service, we fellt that the hotel fell short of other 5 star hotels we have stayed in. While the front desk staff were polite and generally efficient we felt that for 1300 dollars a night, other services which we paid for, such as tea in the lounge, charged at 40 dollars for 2, could have been complimentary. We did not receive the bill as requested by email and had to ring three times to find someone who could deal with this  after being transferred twice to an answer machine. All in all we did not find the service as welcoming and caring as one would expect from this level of hotel.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Nevertheless, upon arrival, tired from a long flight, we were immediately hustled to a grim room unworthy of Rikers.  No visible sky, windows facing only claustrophobic walls.  Horrible.  We politely let the front desk know how upset and disappointed we felt. We had heard nice things about the Lowell and had been looking forward to our stay.  \n\nNaturally, we spent more money for a euphemistically called \u201cclassic suite\u201d, still barely acceptable accommodations. A guest relations person graciously offered to send us a fruit basket, which, alas, after our 3 night stay, never arrived.  Despite assurances that she would \u201clook after us\u201d and be \u201cavailable,\u201d we never saw her again.\n\nThe checkout experience with Eric at the front desk, was reminiscent of a strict boarding school:  Barbara and I were treated to a chastising , threatening lecture on how to treat front desk staff!  Ironically, 2 hotel workers confidentially volunteered to us that THEY had difficulties getting along with certain front desk staff!  However, the maids, waiters, etc were very competent and nice.\n\nFinally, and I hope you\u2019re reading this, Amex Platinum:  front desk clerk Eric concluded his lecture by advising us to first contact the Lowell directly in the future to secure our room preferences, as their regular guests do.  Does this not suggest  an end run around Amex Platinum? And that reserving through Amex Platinum directly guarantees only the dregs?","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's still very good, though not among the best in the world I've stayed at (none are in NY, why is that?). This feels like a luxury apartment building with good service and food. The staff try very hard to satisfy and impress and it mostly hits the mark. Upgraded to large and cozy one bedroom suite 16A that's elegantly decorated in an understated way (the lobby and public rooms are glitzier and seem more luxurious than the actual rooms). The redesigned bathroom was beautiful with white marble, the best lighting I've ever experienced in a hotel bathroom, and heated floors but why not two sinks in a suite? Majorelle is very good in a stunning setting but be prepared for super-traditional, heavy French. Breakfasts are disappointing and exceedingly expensive for what you get (why are all breakfasts $200 for 2 in NY? It's outrageous). My one major complaint was an exceedingly noisy mini-fridge in the room which churned loudly intermittently at night. I complained but it was never fixed. When I video'ed the noise and presented, they took care of many items on my bill, which was classy. The personnel are all very nice. This is a discreet, old-school NY luxury.

My wife was the primary guest, but I also was there most of the time. After quite a few stays, we decided that this just was  not the hotel for us. There were just too many issues. Originally, I did not plan to do a trip advisor review as it would not be a good one and most all reviews are positive. But when the sales manager wrote to my wife wanting to know why we cancelled all of our remaining reservations for 2019, and we received absolutely no reply, I felt that they really did not care ,and I would go ahead with the review. I will say that the people were very nice as expected, especially the bell staff, breakfast dining room staff and doormen. All of these complaints were for the same room on different stays.\n\nHere are some edited excerpts from the email to the sales manager on reasons we decided to not return These are edited as the email was to and from my wife, so the tense is basically changed with a few changes in wording.\n\nThe bathroom did not have double sinks. When both of us were guests, this is an inconvenience. We had trouble with the sink having very little water coming out. We complained but it wasn\u2019t until after writing directly to GM, and saying that I thought it needed a new aerator was it finally fixed. The shower had the cartridge replaced as it too did not have good pressure. In a hotel of your caliber, these are things that should be checked before a guest arrives, and not fixed upon a complaint after several days.\n\nI was never able to get the heat working properly even after complaining several times. It never worked right.\n\nOn my last visit, my wife\u2019s clothes got locked in a closet when the door knob was just turning. I was able to mess with it and put her clothes in the other closet until it was fixed.\u00a0\n\nAlso, we were never happy climbing into the bed. My wife is short, and the bed was very high. The living room furniture was not comfortable, so we constantly had to move from couch to chair to the bedroom. And at times, the room would get a smoky smell from the fireplace.\u00a0\n\nOn the last visit, they were painting the stairways, and the door was open letting the smell seep into the hallway and into our room. My wife called down to have them close the door, and when it was not done, I went and untied the cord. \u00a0My wife is very allergic, and made everyone aware of this saying she didn\u2019t want maids who wear perfume to clean the room. This was followed in most cases, but not always.\n\nAll in all, I think we prefer a hotel that is more contemporary, with larger rooms.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":93585,"title":"So close but yet so far","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-03-28","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"It all started out fine. I arrived on a Friday evening. I checked in to a lovely suite, put down my things, and went to dinner. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying Mid-town hotels since the Four Seasons 57th Street changes its bar and put Beanie Babies all over the lobby - a Bridge too far. I even talked to the manager. I tried the Pierre. Never again. Then I saw a list that rated the Lowell No. 1 in Manhattan. The list had a downtown hotel I like very much in the top 10. So I figured it was trustworthy. And New York friends confirmed that view. \n\nAnd that first night I thought I had found my Mix-town home. The first two days I had late breakfast in my room and found they do real butter croissants, the kind that are so light they flake apart at the touch. Awesome. I finally got to the breakfast room on Monday, and there, too, the food and service were great. That Monday an odd coincidence occurred. At a table close to me a rating reviewer who had stayed over the weekend was meeting with the two top managers. Having once owned a four diamond AAA hotel, I recognized the lingo. Mostly she was positive but there were a few hiccups in service here and there. \n\nIt was on Tuesday things started going a bit off the rails. First, I had asked for the housekeepers to leave my toiletries as I arranged them on the bathroom counter and not to put little towels under them. Over the weekend and through Monday, all was well. On Tuesday the little towels appeared. I said something. No towels in the evening, but back they were on Wednesday. A minor thing, hardly the end of the world given the state of the world. \n\nBut then there was the laundry bag problem. I had come from another city so I arrived with both laundry and dry cleaning to do. Fine. All went well. But the laundry bags and forms were never replaced. Tuesday morning I asked for some to be put in my room that day. At 11:30 that night, tired and just wanting to put out some laundry and find laundry I had sent that day and wanted for the next day that had not been returned, I called the desk. Fifteen minutes later the laundry arrived. Then came laundry bags but no forms. Exhausted with a fairly early morning ahead of me, I gave up. In the morning the forms were there, slid under the door. So, OK, housekeeping is erratic. \n\nMeanwhile I had had a lovely dinner with a friend at Marjorelle, the hotel\u2019s restaurant. Excellent service. Great food. A short but rich wine list. Lovely. \n\nThen came the checkout. I had breakfast with a friend, also lovely. I had two hours to pack, plenty of time. I finished with 15 minutes to spare and, just as I was about to call for the bellman, the woman on the front desk called to ask when I was leaving. Great timing. She said she\u2019d send the bellman. I waited. 10 minutes. I called the desk. A matter of minutes, she said. I waited five. Getting concerned because it was now past my time set to leave for JFK, I took the luggage, one large bag, a toiletries bag, book bag and purse for the plane, down myself. \n\nIn the lobby, there was no one to help me. I had several FedExes to be sent and dropped them at the desk with a gratuity for the service. I then took my luggage to the front door where I asked the bellman if he could help - you gave to go up several stairs to get out of the hotel. He said, I have to help someone check in. I said: Do you help people checking out?? I know; I was getting snarky. Bad. I rolled and bumped my book bag and purse up the stairs and out. The bellman then did get my large bag. With the help of my driver, we got it all in the car.\n\nI know I am fortunate. I can afford to stay at the Lowell and have a driver take me to the airport. I am thankful. But, it seems to me that these breaches in service aren\u2019t quite what I am paying for. I might try the hotel again. It is lovely, cozy, discreet, and walking distance to the places I need to go in Mid-town. Other than that last bellman, the staff was uniformly friendly and helpful. But, the exit left a bad feeling. We\u2019ll see. ","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I've stayed here 4 or 5 times.  It's in a very busy area, near the park, but jussst far enough away that it feels quiet.

There's a fine line between traditional and archaic, and the Lowell feels like old school New York vibes with nuanced attention to the current times.  The rooms are really nice, especially the suites(duh but like REALLY nice.)  Narcisso and Jean Marc, the concierges, are great guys and easy to deal with\/communicate with.  Sometimes at fancy hotels I feel ashamed asking the concierges questions and have to give myself a 10 minute peptalk to feel important enough to get my way lol.  Not the case at the Lowell.

Raid your bank account and upgrade to a deluxe junior suite. We were upgraded to a 1-bedroom on our last visit, and it reminded me a bit of the Carlyle's suites. It was enormous, with a super comfy, yet sophisticated vibe, dark chevron wood flooring, luxurious fabrics and sturdy, repro furniture. It also has a minute galley \"kitchen\", and lots of closets, making it feel more like an apartment than a hotel room. \nWe entertained friends one night in the living area, and staff lit our wood burning fireplace (not very eco friendly of us, but hey, we were on vacation).  While the bathroom's brass fixtures felt a bit Gordon Gekko-ish, it was still comfortable. The bed is uber supportive, in a good way, and once again we enjoyed every single meal we ordered from room service.\nMost of the staff seemingly pride themselves on making guests feel as if they're coming back to a cosseting residence; cheerful greeting upon check-in, a bartender that remembers your cocktail of choice, and the bell staff welcomes you back as he cheerfully grabs the door for you. Housekeeping is flawless. The folks who work here seem to love their town and want you to love it too. It's fabulous. The hotel has few peers in NYC.

I only wish I'd have had more time to enjoy this wonderful property. \n\nThe Lowell was recently refurbished by renowned designer Michael Smith and the thoughtful updates really show. I work professionally with Michael often and many of his signature design cues seem to have imbued the Lowell  with a real sense of comfort and intimacy. It's like being in someone's elegant Upper East Side townhouse  rather than a hotel. \n\nCheck-in was a breeze and very personal. I was offered Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts benefits even though I had booked my room through hotel tonight. That was very nice as I received complementary breakfast and a credit to use in the hotel. I was also offered a glass of champagne (although it never arrived). I did however receive a complementary bottle of mineral water and bowl of fruit delivered to my room shortly after arrival. \n\nThe room was very comfortable and afforded all luxuries one expects in a 5 star hotel. The bathroom was very large with a huge shower and tub and plenty of fluffy towels and toiletries. The one small complaint I have is although the washstand looks beautiful it doesn't provide a lot of counter top space. Also, while running the hot water in the sink for more than 30 seconds the sink would make a terrible sound. I tried it a few times and it wouldn't stop, sounded like a booster pump or something running. Otherwise, my room experience was excellent. \n\nThe breakfast in the Pembroke room was also lovely and service extremely professional. I really appreciated the complementary breakfast. They provided very nice Wilkin & Sons jams and jellies on the table, which is always a nice touch. The coffee could have been a bit better, but otherwise I had great experience before departure. \n\nI only wish I would have had more time to enjoy the lovely public rooms on the first floor and to dine in the beautiful Majorelle restaurant or have a drink in the chic Jacques bar.

Let\u2019s start by saying this is an expensive venue, even by NYC standards. We occupied a \u201cjunior suite\u201d which is relatively generous in size, about 600 square feet. It cost over $1400 a night, not counting the usual taxes, etc. Our room included a generously proportioned sitting area, and a large mini bar that included plates and cutlery should we have wanted to eat in the room. The bed was comfortable but not the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever experienced. The decor was lovely, although I think it showed some signs of wear and there were subtle stains in a couple of locations on the carpet. The marble bathroom was large, included a tub and separate walk in shower. We were in a corner location on the 8th floor with windows on 2 sides, both facing other buildings across a narrow alley. No view, for sure.\nHaving looked at the online photos of other more expensive rooms in the hotel, I think I can safely say that we occupied a room that has not been recently renovated. That is not to say that it was not comfortable and very tasteful, because it was.\nDuring our stay, we had several breakfasts in the small Pembroke Room on the second floor. The room is very genteel and a little on the fussy side. This is not a place for millenials. However, the food was beautifully prepared and served, albeit at a price.\nWe also ate in what is essentially a clubby library and at the bar, both lovely rooms and a quiet oasis in NYC. Cocktails were excellent, even at $21 a pop. \nOne can not fail to mention the housekeeping at this hotel, which is superb. They are fastidious, quiet and always appear when you have vacated the room. The doorman John deserves particular mention for his friendly and engaging manner.\nThis is not the first time we have stayed at the Lowell, and it is an excellent choice on the UES. It needs a few touch-ups here and there, but it is extremely comfortable and well located, and if it is in your budget, you will not be disappointed.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The fresh fragrance of a large bouquet of lilies greeted us as soon as we opened the door. Without saying anything, the front desk immediately knew who we were and welcomed us by name. We were so impressed! We were celebrating my husband's birthday. The front desk staff were genuinely friendly and sincerely interested in ensuring that my husband's birthday would be forever memorable. We had requested early check in and a very quiet room and they happily accommodated both. They sent champagne to our room as soon as we arrived. We left to go for a short walk in central park and when we arrived we found two cupcakes decorated with sprinkles and a bottle of champagne waiting for us! \n\nThe bathtub and all of the bath products are sublime. We loved the floor to ceiling white marble in the bathrooms. The room was also quite spacious. \n\nAfter resting we relaxed in the club room, which is one of the most beautiful, intimate hotel lounges I have ever stayed in (ranked among the Sujan Rajmahal Palace in Jaipur, and the Jefferson Hotel in Washington, DC). We came back and slept so well all night. In the morning we had a lovely breakfast in the Pembroke room. It was painful to leave. The hotel was so serene, enchanting, and beautiful we didn't want to leave! We have stayed at a number of leading hotels in NYC including the Crosby Street Hotel and the Lowell is easily #1 for the intimacy of the staff (very personal service, treated like royalty from the moment we stepped in), the serenity, and the mesmerizing interior design. \n\nI will not plan to stay anywhere other than the Lowell next time we return to NYC.

I\u2019ve stayed in several larger chain and neighborhood hotels from Uptown to the Lower East Side over the years, but I wanted to balance the city\u2019s adventure this trip in a smaller, quieter hotel. The hotel struck every high note: comfortable, clean, tastefully appointed rooms and public spaces (eg, gorgeous flowers everywhere), delicious food created with the freshest ingredients and ample, healthier options (the Chef welcomed me on the first night with three luscious high season nectarines and a bottle of spring water); spectacular service from arrival to departure and everywhere in between; and what I\u2019m most grateful for - a genuinely friendly and professional staff. Given that the Lowell is located fewer than a five-minute trip on foot to Central Park (yet I didn\u2019t hear the traffic on 5th from inside), I took daily, rejuventating morning walks there. In nice weather you might loose track of the fact that you\u2019ve walked 10-15+ blocks to the nearest museums further uptown on Museum Mile, as I did one day to see the Giacometti exhibit at the Guggenheim.

{"helpfulVotes":6,"locationId":93585,"title":"Impressive Improvements","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-06-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We have stayed at The Lowell occasionally over many years. It\u2019s our \u2018go-to\u2019 hotel in NYC. \n\nIt\u2019s always been a secret gem. Now that they have done extensive renovations and made it even better, I\u2019m sure it will be more popular (sigh). The one thing the hotel needed was a good public space to sit in. The answer to this problem: the new Club Room. It is beautiful, comfortable, and spacious \u2013 a much-appreciated place to sit, relax, socialize, or gather leisurely before a meal. (Apparently, it\u2019s where the Post House Restaurant kitchen was). The architectural style offers rich details \u2013 coffered ceilings, dental molding, recessed lighting above, high ceilings, and a fireplace. (Unfortunately, it also has a large screen TV that seems out of place given the d\u00e9cor and atmosphere).   \n\nWe availed ourselves of The Club Room the first day there. Service was fine \u2013 pleasant, attentive, and professional. We had small plates of charcuterie and a grilled cheese sandwich (with brie as the cheese). All was delicious. \n\nOn the second floor, by The Pembroke Room, they opened up a wall to create a refined anteroom and access to the new patio\/deck area. That\u2019s a plus as well \u2013 the water fountain and patio furniture are inviting. Should be a lovely spot for an afternoon drink before dinner.   \n\nThe doormen are great. They are on their game from the minute you arrive to when you leave. One frustration with having the hotel on a residential block is getting a cab. They try but it doesn\u2019t always work. Be prepared to walk over to Madison or Park to hail one. \n\nThe only negative experience was in the Pembroke Room on our second morning there. The first day we had a familiar waiter who\u2019s been there a long time and was very pleasant. The second day we were seated by the ma\u00eetre\u2019d and had a different waiter. We asked for a different table than first offered (the room was less than half full and we don't like sitting in the middle of the room). After seating us, he didn\u2019t take a coffee or juice order which was unusual. We waited ten minutes while others were offered coffee and finally had to ask. When it arrived, I mentioned to the waiter we were ready to order, fearing he might disappear. When he brought the food, he put it down and walked away without even asking if there was anything else we needed. He was not pleasant or helpful.  \n\nLater, when we checked out, I mentioned our uncomfortable experience at breakfast. The front desk staff was apologetic and immediately comped the meal (which I didn\u2019t ask for but appreciated). Problems can occur and it\u2019s how the hotel responds that matters. I give The Lowell high marks \u2013 not just for their response to that but for overall professionalism, courtesy, and quality.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms did not have coffee makers and the supplies of tea bags were not replenished each day and there was no milk in the minibar. The bar is quite stylish and the location is excellent for designer shops and Central Park. The hotel does not compare to other leading hotels we have stayed in around the world.

This hotel (and I hesitate to call it that because it's more like your rich aunt's townhouse) and it's management appear to cater to well healed m&a types or international travelers who insist on a quiet place to rest, check emails or entertain clients. The public rooms are  touched with someone's exquisite design taste and budget. There are numerous alcoves with cushy seating and subdued lighting, where you can either grab a drink or just hang and read one of the many coffee table books stacked in 90* angles nearby. My guess is that it's a great place for professionals to stay on business, not having to worry about unwelcome chitty-chat or stranger's attention. The restaurant, although we didn't eat there, looked inviting, albeit budget busting. Room service offered some of the best pomme frites around and every meal we ordered was delicious and on time. There's a dark paneled cubby disguised as an exercise room that has all you need to get in a quick treadmill run. The breakfast room was packed with travelers when we dropped in, but the staff quickly pulled together a table and had us nourished and on our merry way within 30 minutes. The concierge greeted us with a smile and appeared to welcome any challenge. We booked a jr. suite, and our room was described by the front desk staff as an upgrade, although I'm not sure what that meant. The room was not ready when we arrived at 4PM, and although we were giving a conciliatory cocktail in the lounge, they forgot about us, so we eventually had to beg for rest after 1.5 hours. As a matter of record, anytime something happened during our stay that was not perfect, a staff member recognized it. It's hard to get upset when someone is apologizing. Hotel floors are high enough above it's neighboring buildings to afford excellent light and voyeuristic views into gentrified neighbors' apartments, and although we faced the street, the room was very quiet. The room was decorated in chocolate and taupe tones, with lush bedding and well thought out guest controls. There are plenty of USB\/electrical sockets on the desk, which for some reason, has always been a missing amenity in upper end hotels in which I've stayed. The bathroom was gynormous, and adorned in polished nickel and slabs of white marble. An elegant boutique in a prime location with attentive service..what more can you ask for?

It has been our favorite hotel for at least the past 10 years.  We were just there from for five nights in December, and had reserved a Deluxe Junior Suite which according to pictures on The Lowell website and accompanying floor plan is appointed with a sofa, fabric chairs, coffee table, desk, some with terraces, etc.  We have stayed in these lovely, spacious suites on previous occasions. \n\nWe were therefore surprised when we were escorted to 12C.   While it has a fireplace, there is no true seating area but only one fabric arm chair and one desk with two side chairs.  We then asked to be moved to another suite and were told in the entire hotel only 12D was available.  It appeared larger with definitely more closet space which we needed; however, it also had only one fabric arm chair, a desk and its requisite two chairs.   Since this was the only other option, we accepted the room, which by the way should be refreshed (frayed drapes, wallcovering with visible and multiple black marks, scarred furniture).\n\nWe love The Lowell and its wonderfully attentive staff and assumed that because we were loyal guests and had reserved a Deluxe Junior Suite, our accommodations would meet or perhaps even exceed our expectations.  Unfortunately this was not the case.   We are quick to praise the hotel; however, this is first time we have no choice but to express our heartfelt disappointment.    \n\nI would be remiss if I did not mention that during our stay cold air was escaping from one of the heating units at the far end of the Pembroke Room.  We and other guests at breakfast had to move to the middle of the room or next to an inside wall for warmth.  The problem should have been remedied immediately  but the situation continued all the mornings we were there.\n\nSent similar message by private email to the General Manager with no reply\n\n","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Along with it a bottle of Evian water. Perfect! \nAround 730Pm we went down to the bar, to enjoy a cocktail before dinner at Majorelle.  The bar Jacques, Moroccan style is the perfect setting for an intimate drink.  Superb. Dinner at Majorelle was fantastic.  Can't say enough about the service, the informed and most attentive staff. I had the oysters, lamb tagine and the chocolate soufle and my hubby the mushroom risotto, veal and pistachio soufle. \nAll fantastic. \nWe came back to our room, and called the butler to light the fire.  Our suite had a wonderful fireplace (real).  Although the logs and the service are extra, for $32 it really's worth it! Specially since outside was so nasty.  Our window showed a whirlwind of tree leaves flying about.  Inside, we were warm and cozy in front of the fire. \nThe entire property has a grandiose amount of fresh flowers.

My visit got off to a rocky start as I was put into an un-renovated junior suite that did not fit the online photos or description including a new bathroom.  They then \"upgraded\" me to a smaller room with the Michael Smith remodel.  However, I couldn't understand how a smaller room was an upgrade and have never seen a junior suite without a couch. I felt like I was being played a bit.   Dissatisfied, I just upgraded myself and paid for a Garden Suite which was truly lovely but expensive.  I felt like I was in my own pied a tierre replete with terraces and full kitchen.  I loved the room, but was certainly paying a pretty penny.\n\nThis hotel feels like old wealthy New York from the roaring 20's or art deco 30's.  It's really a lovely feeling.  The lobby is gorgeous and smells of lilies (where may I buy that scent?).  The Club Lounge is intimately elegant and beautifully furnished and they serve an excellent iced latte (note the lattes served in the room are not nearly as good).   Other parts of the hotel are a bit creaky like the Pembroke Room (feels too dated), the ceiling in the lobby in the elevator bay is unfinished and the hotel's halls have seen better days.  It's time to spruce it all up!\n\nRoom service was fast and the food is excellent.  I complained about a few things along the way and they are very quick to apologize with a long note, and usually sent me a little gift of some kind to make up for it (bottle of wine, fruit, a handkerchief).  The staff seem to have worked there a very long time which adds to the very retro ambiance. It's kind of like they expect themselves not to be totally perfect and are sweetly responsive to suggestion when they are not. I also feel like they treat those in more expensive rooms or returning guests better than those in the cheaper rooms.  Once I upgraded, I was treated royally, but before they seemed unsure how to take me because I had randomly booked online.  Just a sense. \n\nI would stay here again because the location is ideal, the (remodeled) rooms are beautiful but pricey, the food is good and it's away from the hum drum. But, if you are expecting seamless service without any bumps, a spa (sorely missed), and the little oddities of an independently run boutique go to a bigger place like the Four Seasons or Peninsula. I didn't mind them and expect to give a five star review next time.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

While my stay was good, I didn't get any of the fine luxury touches I would have expected for $1000+ per night at such a highly regarded property. \n\nI booked via a members-only luxury travel partner that confers certain benefits and recognition, and offered approximately 10% off the public rate. \n\nThe hotel did not reach out to me in advance of my arrival to see if there is anything they could assist with. More and more 5-star properties are doing this, and certainly 100% of the leading properties do it. It was extremely disappointing that The Lowell didn't reach out to me. \n\nUpon check-in I was told I was upgraded 1 category from a Deluxe Junior Suite to a One Bedroom Suite. Normally this would be good news, but the Deluxe Junior Suite is actually a far more practical room for a solo business traveler and comes with a balcony. After inspecting my 1 bedroom suite I went back down to ask if I could be \"downgraded\" back to my original room category. I was told no; the hotel had already sold that category out. I then asked if I could be upgraded to the next category up since I really didn't like my room. They offered to do it...for an extra $900 per night.\n\nThe hard product itself is high quality, but incredibly dated. It looked as though my room hadn't been PIP'd (remodeled) in nearly 20 years. \n\nService downstairs was professional and efficient, but somewhat cold. The concierge couldn't help with the one and only request I had (helping to snag a difficult reservation), but I suppose I shouldn't hold that against the hotel. \n\nI'd recommend this property for wealthy travelers over age 55, as I think anyone younger would simply find it too dated to be relevant. \n\nN.B. The hotel apparently spent $20M+ remodeling the public spaces, and those are incredible. It's just the rooms I found disappointing.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

At breakfast we raised this medical condition, and asked the staff to be extraordinary careful. Our family member with this medical condition ordered only a cappuccino. The cappuccino came with a cookie with nuts on the side and when we raised the issue with the staff, the staff just removed it with his bare hands leaving a lot of debris on the cup, with possibly some falling in the cup. This is unacceptable. \n\n- we asked for a late check out (around 1:30 PM-2PM). We were denied the late check out and asked to leave by 12:30. We then asked if we could stay until 2 PM in the bar or in the ground floor (our flight out of NY was at 18:00). As we have a small dog with us, we were told that they were no area where we could wait. Our departure day was a very rainy day in New York. \nAs a result, we reorganized all of our plans, including our car pick up and then about half an hour before we left our room the staff called us to tell us that we could stay until 2PM. Why this was not shared with us when we made that request early in the morning? All our plans were changed and by then our limo was waiting downstairs already. Too late to inform your guests. \n\n- we asked for a non smoking floor. Each time we walked out of the room there was a very strong cigarette smell. \n\n- at arrival, it took more than 30mm to have    the luggage delivered to our rooms. \n\n- at departure, after 40mm, the luggage in one of the room were not brought downstairs and we had to carry them ourself. \n\n- last, upon departure at checkout, no one bothered to ask us how was our stay. A surprise for a hotel of this price. \n\n","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I researched and found The Lowell.  It's one of those Hotels that makes you feel you might be arriving at a friends grand family home for a weekend stay. Small and welcoming, organised and orderly and accommodating with friendly staff making you feel at home immediately.  I had booked a room with a view of New York City and was delighted to be offered an upgrade upon checking in, which I was delighted to accept. So of course I was very impressed with my view and accommodation !  The interior of my suite was very spacious, clean, thoughtfully decorated and was very workable. I immediately wished I could have been staying longer than one night !! Nothing seemed too much to ask for and everything from room service to the porter came very promptly.   I met some other guests who both told me they always stayed there every time they came to NY and I always find that sort of information from other guests interesting and pleasing to know about... We had invited some friends of ours to come and have breakfast with us the following morning ( which was delicious ) and we were very pleased to note that the waitering staff did not show any signs of frustration nor concern when our friends turned up with their 10 month old baby. All went smoothly and the baby was taken care of as well as we were, even though he made much more mess of the table cloth that we did. !! All in all, I'm sure I will stay at The Lowell upon my next visit to New York. My only wish these days, without the guest having to request anything in advance is ( and please take into account this mention is in general MOST of the Hotels, not ALL but MOST I have stayed stay in ) and that is.. could Hotels start to include, in their \"in room fridges\", some better and healthier ORGANIC options of herbal teas and snacks for those who don't drink pesticide laden coffee and nonorganic normal tea and eat sugar dosed cakes and candies ! Really so many people have dietary issues these days and are careful with what they eat, so it would be wonderful for hotels to include, in their thinking of what to offer a guest in their in room fridges, a way to make it easier for guests to have healthier options within their rooms. When your paying top prices for your room or suite this is what should be taken into account as far as I am concerned. Overall we had a pleasant stay and as I said I would have liked to have been able to have stayed a little longer.  Next time hopefully. Bels King-Harman","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel was sold out. Maybe I should have known something was up at The Pierre when the person at their in house reservations was kind of clueless. It is always a bit disconcerting when you stay at one hotel a few times every year for the past 15 years and the reservationist can't find your history on the computer. Maybe The Pierre is slipping. Maybe the new reservationist shouldn't be taking reservations. After finally admitting that she had misspelled my name for the past half hour, I kind of gave up. I went on TripAdvisor and found The Lowell. Man, did I get lucky. I called The Lowell and spoke with Nori. I told her my saga with The Pierre: no rooms and no clue. She was only too happy to take my reservation swiftly and accurately. She upgraded us to a suite with a fireplace. Let me be more precise. She upgraded us to suite 16c that is truly fit for royalty. Well furnished. Huge bathroom. Modern kitchen. Perfect bedroom. A real wood fire burning fireplace! However, what makes The Lowell the finest hotel I have ever been in is the staff. Doormen are warm and friendly. Housekeeping staff is uniformly fast and thorough and sweet. The Pembroke Room has perfect breakfast and High Tea. What a hidden oasis of elegance, warmth and serenity. Not to mention, Marty, who brings in his own home made jams that really need to be brought to Shark Tank. There is also a man who is seemingly everywhere in a jiffy to start our fireplace and bring our bags. He may be a ninja. The concierge was perfect. As a native New Yorker, I haven't lived in NYC in 20 years. He sent us to places for meals that were new and cool and perfect for our sons in their twenties to join us. However, the spotlight needs to go the staff at the front desk. I wish I could remember all of their names but they really need to be cloned. Sweet, warm, calm, clairvoyant, professional and personable. Maria, Ms. R., Angelique to name a few. I was going to write down all of their names but that would look too weird. It is hard to leave the front desk when you just enjoy their company! But in all candor, it starts with a reservation. And it started with Nori stating, \"well I'll bet you will like us better.\" She was wrong. I like The Lowell BEST!\n\nStay here. Treat yourself to the finest experience in NYC.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I had not previously heard of it, but I was super impressed and loved my stay there. It's a completely different experience to other large NY hotels. It's more intimate and you instantly are made to feel at home - staff all seemed to know my name, nothing was too much trouble, the room was spectacular and very spacious (unusual in New York), and the location is unbelievable - uber prime Manhattan real estate one block from central park. \n\nIt's the staff and service that make this hotel unique. A minor mix up at check-in was followed up with a handwritten note of apology - very classy. A brief introductory conversation with the friendly marketing head in the elevator was similarly followed up with a hand written note and offer of assistance. I don't even remember mentioning my surname, but somehow she knew who I was and made the effort to reach out personally. These little touches make all the difference in my opinion. Returning from a days business meetings, you are greeted personally and with a smile from the staff at reception. The concierge was great, booked me into Le Bilboquet for a very fun night, and helped me with the best train route to JFK to avoid gridlock during UN week. \n\nThe breakfast is excellent and the again the service is faultless. The gym is well equipped and local gyms are also available for classes (SoulCycle, or Equinox). \n\nI honestly didn't want to leave ! Highly recommended (although would prefer to keep this gem to myself). Definitely staying here in NY from now on.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The front desk and the manager were very kind and friendly. They made sure our room was ready ahead of time and that it was quiet on an upper floor. (They are currently renovating of one of their restaurants called The Pembroke Room on the first floor but the construction was minimal for the holiday weekend- we didn't hear a thing.) We enjoyed breakfast on the 2nd floor and loved the French style ambiance. We took advantage of our AMEX Platinum breakfast every morning. The gym was also on the 2nd floor and was large as well- a few treadmills, an elliptical, and  free weights, bosu ball, and weight machines. Fresh water and Gatorade in the fridge. Fresh towels and a tv. I utilized the gym one morning and it was pretty quiet. The Lowell bedroom we stayed at was impeccably clean and modern. We had approximately a 400 sq ft room with a king size bed. Very soft and comfortable! (And large for NYC standards!) The bathroom was large and marbled in grey and white. The only negative on the whole experience was the concierge who gave us names of cafes and restaurants that were chain restaurants. We wanted unique and gourmet.

Rooms generally do not have anything in the way of a view. But it is relatively quiet and peaceful for the city centre.

We were celebrating my sister's birthday and asked the concierge if we could have lunch there and bring cupcakes.  We arrived and waited 10-15 minutes before I finally called the concierge and asked why no one was helping us.  There were other tables and tables that came in after us and had immediate service.  He came up and literally a minute before he got there a waiter came over to offer water.  25 minutes after we arrived we finally got to order.

There are orchids in each room and a gorgeous bouquet of white roses always arrives on the first day of our stay. The staff is warm and welcoming and the Concierge, John Mark Hopkins is a joy. He secured a reservation at the coveted Polo Bar on our last visit at Christmas. The new general manager, Mr. Heiko Kuenstle has personally greeted upon arrival each visit this past year. He is truly passionate about the Lowell and his accomplishments are evident. Upon arrival, if your suite is available, it's yours. This past visit we arrived at 10:30 a.m. We were checked in immediately! A gift of an extra day!  This hotel also does its best to upgrade your room reservation. Last year, December  2014, we reserved a two bedroom suite, as our daughter was coming in from out of town.

The hotel room is fine, but compared to the pricing of other hotels in NYC it is incredibly overpriced for what one gets.  The suite was small, the price extraordinarily high, the service eh.  The best service people at the hotel were housekeeping and the bell staff, they were excellent.  I did not eat there so I have no idea about that part.  The front desk staff was a little cold (perhaps because they are all European) and the room service staff screwed up our order on the morning of the funeral so some in our party were starving through a funeral and burial service that went into the mid-afternoon.  The hotel knew this was the case, but room service basically gave a \"too bad\" type response when they received a call asking for the food that morning.  Additionally, the hotel manager wrote an unsatisfactory response by email.  \n\nAlso, we looked out on apartment buildings which allowed no light into the rooms and the hallways and lobby were old and small.  Not inviting at all. Not an ounce of anything that felt modern.  With the European staff you would think they would learn something from some of European hotels I assume a few of them have worked in that would hopefully be of the caliber that this hotel would like to be in.\n\nThere are plenty of small hotels who would have gotten this right considering the circumstances.

We researched the Lowell and thought it looked like a good place to stay for a couple of nights. We reserved a two bedroom suite as one of us snores! My husband arrived before I did and checked into our $3000.00 per night suite expecting a lovely, well appointed room which was cheerful in d\u00e9cor. We were both disappointed in the rooms as the colors were in muted shades of brown and beige with little relief from this dreary color scheme Though the hotel claims to have recently redecorated the rooms, we didn't think they were as nice as we had hoped. As a matter of fact, one of the bedrooms had a picture on the wall that was so disturbing I had to cover it with a towel. The ominous face depicted in the painting was enough for any normal person to suffer nightmares.\nWe ordered room service for dinner as it was late and we were tired. The dinner was inedible as the chicken breast I had ordered was so tough I had to ask for help in cutting it and the salad was dry and wilted. My husband's steak was also sub par.\nI decided the only thing that would make me feel better would be a lovely hot bath but this was not to be so as the tub would not function properly. I find this is the case in many older hotel rooms and it is a pet peeve of mine. The bath tub drain doesn't work and therefore one is unable to fill the tub. As it was midnight I didn't want to trouble the staff so I made a makeshift stopper which barely worked though it did make me laugh. $3000.00 a night and no bath!\nIn the morning both my husband and I asked the front desk staff to have the situation rectified. My husband was working in the room that morning and a repairman arrived stating he was there to fix the toilet. After informing him that the toilet was fine and that the bath tub drain was the problem, he went to work. After ten minutes he stated he had taken care of the problem. My husband showed him there was still a problem and he stated that it would be fixed. \nLater that day when I returned happily expecting to have a pleasant bath before we went out for the evening, I found the problem still existed. We called the front desk and yet another person was sent to do the repairs. This time he fixed it.\nThe hotel room had a small closet type kitchen off the living room which was supposed to be equipped with coffee and creamer. We had to ask for the coffee on our second day and were told the hotel had run out. Luckily we had a very energetic room service waiter who took some from an unoccupied room.\nThe hotel seems to not understand the idea of preparedness for its guests and seems to be cutting corners in odd places. For example: at night the turn down staff(which arrived the second night at our door at 10:30PM) bring bottled water for the bedside. Beware! if you don't drink the water it is removed by the daytime maids. \nOne of our rooms had a working thermostat but the other remained at a frigid temperature despite many attempts to alter it.\nWe were very disappointed in our stay at the Lowell and will not be returning. For the price, the service, rooms and atmosphere did not live up to our expectations.","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's classic elegance. The hotel is decorated in such a way it makes you feel like you have been there for a while-except its pristine clean. It feels like a sumptuous home away from home. \n\nMy husband and I had originally booked a standard Lowell King room through Jetsetter but we were upgraded to a Specialty Suite simply because we expressed we'd hoped to have a fireplace. Since the staff member, Maria, sincerely wanted to ensure our satisfaction, they gave us the upgrade at no extra charge. We had the Hollywood Suite which has two bathrooms, 1 king size bedroom, a kitchenette, conference room(or dining room\/sitting room if you will), a living room and multiple closets. It was the only fireplace room available. Maria wanted us to be happy- and so it was. That to me is exceptional service. \n\nWe were greeted with an enthusiastic smile by the front desk attendant upon arrival. I think Laura was her name. She was so sweet. When we entered our room we were happy to find the complimentary champagne, water, wine, cheese and fruit plate waiting for us. One attendant took to showing us around (we loved all of the doors) while another lit our fire.  The attendant who gave the tour told us the wood costs $30 dollars(more on this later).  Then they quickly took their leave after bidding us goodnight. \n\nThe views from the 13th floor were amazing. The fireplace was amazing There was no smoke -which was shocking considering the depth of it and we had more than enough wood. There were 3 TV's, several shelves of books and we brought our Chrome Cast to hook up to the Flat screen to watch our own movies. We were both SO pleased... Until the next evening -when hours after check out they charged us an additional 90 or so dollars for the use of the firewood!That kind of left us both with a bitter taste after an otherwise lovely experience. We are far from wealthy and had made this reservation on a strict budget. It was a special night for us as in two days my husband, who is battling cancer, would be going through his last round of chemo before seeing the results. While grateful for the upgrade and all that came with it, we had not been expecting the additional charge since we were told it cost $30 to use the wood with no further specifics given. Had we known we would have used less. A silly upset, I know, after the wonderful upgrade. I really am grateful for that. I just feel people should be aware.\n\nFor out of towners... If you want quiet luxury and have the money to spare, You will love this hotel. It's a block away from Central Park and also close enough to shopping and museums(but not amidst the loud hustle and bustle of Columbus Circle on the west side). They also serve up delicious afternoon tea with sophistication (That is super expensive as well. We couldn't afford it). \n\nThis visit was very special to us to begin with but the staff here knocked it out of the park with the upgrade. I am so happy we chose to make the Lowell hotel our \"staycation spot\" this Valentine's day.","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I mention this because it's about 20 blocks from mid-town, so if you're planning a theatre trip (as we did) or expect to spend most of your time in that part of town, be prepared for a 25 to 30 minute walk each way. I found that I couldn't do it without ducking into a couple stores along the way to avoid hypothermia.\n\nThat said, I have no problem walking and would have found the stroll quite enjoyable during warmer months. The location is very quiet and in a very upscale neighborhood two blocks off the park. In fact the closest \"tourist\" attraction is the Central Park Zoo just a short walk away, and I chose to visit for the first time. The view is unremarkable. The only thing we could see from our window was the work-in-progress they call the Icon.\n\nThe front desk staff are extremely warm and friendly, especially Jesus at the front door. I'd forgotten to print theatre tickets and boarding passes, and they were happy to do so for me.\n\nWe stayed in a Lowell Room, which was just right for us. Neutral browns and dark hardwood floors gave the room a sophisticated, masculine atmosphere (in fact, the hotel overall has a masculine feel to it). The thermostat was easy to operate and actually worked. The room had the largest \"mini\" bar of any hotel I've stayed in (pictures included). The bedding and linens were extremely comfortable and I slept perfectly all three nights. \n\nThe bathroom fantastic: heated white marble floors and walls, enormous tub, equally large separate shower. \n\nRoom service is 24 hours, and we took advantage of it one late night when we both got the munchies. :-) The Pembroke Room was, if anything, a bit too precious. I hate to say it, but it reminded me more of a funeral parlor than anything else. Very little natural light, decked out in Victorian excess with the dulcet, over-sentimental tones of Tchaikovsky and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k piped through the speakers. I could see how it would appeal to some people, but it is more a tea room than a proper restaurant, and is limited in its offering. I will say that the brunch we sat down to was delicious: the eggs benedict with black truffle was knockout.\n\nAdditionally, this hotel does not have a bar. So keep that in mind if you're the sort (we are) who like to come back to the hotel after a long night and have a drink or two before retiring to the room. You're left to the luxurious minibar which is, predictably, quite expensive ($8 for Dean & DeLuca gummi bears). We ended up at the Pierre for a nightcap.\n\nAll in all, this is a very classy establishment and I recommend it highly for people who want elegance and luxury away from the crowds and noise of mid-town.","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Despite my having booked a smaller suite, they kindly upgraded us to a larger one, worked with me to find the room with best lighting for photos, and extended the check out to ensure we had plenty of time to get ready. All staff members were informed of our names and greeted us so whenever we encountered them. Little touches like greeting us with complementary juices & champagne upon arrival and a truly heartfelt, handwritten note with congratulations and best wishes, accompanied by additional snacks made all the difference in calming nerves and preparing us for what was a crazy but joyful occasion. My only regret is not having enough time to thank the entire team at the Hotel and take everything in more fully. My husband and I will surely be returning for a staycation. \n\nOther notes: the lobby is small but inviting. The rooms on the other hand are surprisingly spacious and elegantly decorated. The beds are one of the best I've ever slept on. Further, the Lowell Hotel is part of the Leading Hotels of the World collection.

Not that I did. Buttermilk pancakes with ripe strawberries, maple syrup and bacon! Really nice coffee. Showed that they put their heart to serving you.\n\nLocation wise - I booked this place for their proximity to Hermes on Madison. So near!!! 2 min stroll round the corner!! So happy. I was really lucky to have gotten a Hermes Kelly in etoupe. I can't believe it. This is my good luck hotel.\n\nHotel has assisted in shipping over-shopped items back to London for me. No hassles. Very pleasant. \n\nI have nothing to complain about except perhaps if you want to know where to go for well Halloween decorated streets and neighbourhoods, ask the doorman not the concierge.\nDoorman said : W69th street party.

My room seemed fine but I always carefully check the cleanliness of the bed in any hotel I stay and here my bed failed that test miserably, when I swiped my finger next to the mattress my finger got covered with dust. I called the front desk who sent housekeeping who straight away agreed that this wasn't acceptable and they suggested that I move to another room. I went to the gym and asked that they sort out my move in the mean time and 1 hour later I changed rooms. When I was going to bed I was going to plug in my phone charger behind the night table and as I touched the floor my entire hand was covered with filth, I went down to the front desk to show them and they were shocked when they saw my hand. This was an amount of filth that it would take at least one month to build up which means that the hotel didn't have a process to clean the room properly and also didn't have a policy to inspect the rooms properly which I found very concerning. Furthermore I find it absolutely unbelievable that after the hotel has seen and agreed that my bed was filthy and they had more than 1 hour to sort out a new room they still didn't ensure that my new room was clean. So after midnight, jet lagged and extremely tired, I was again moving rooms. My new room was an upgraded room which was nice and it was perfectly clean as far as I could tell.\n\nThe next morning I went down to breakfast, the breakfast room was very elegant but it took half an hour before I received my English breakfast which is too long in my opinion and when my breakfast arrived my poached eggs (requested medium) disintegrated into an under cooked watery egg soup which would have been inappropriate even if I would have requested my eggs to be very runny. The next morning I decided to have my breakfast delivered to my room and I decided to go for the healthy option, instead I got a continental breakfast delivered so again I was waiting for my breakfast to be delivered and was told that the manager had accidentally pressed the wrong button. The morning after that I received the breakfast that I ordered but it was delivered late. The final morning my breakfast was delivered without problems and I also had 2 room service dinners both of which were nice. In fairness to the hotel I should mention that a bottle of wine was sent to my room after they mixed up my breakfast order. Finally I didn't receive all my LHW benefits at this hotel.\n\nThe thing is that while I did find the service to be unbelievably sloppy on several occasions the staff were so friendly that it was hard to get really mad at them. The rooms (when properly cleaned) were very nicely appointed but considering the price tag and the quality of service that I received 3 out of 5 is still probably a generous rating.","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Nothing has changed, which believe me is the ultimate compliment. This place is a jewel that we visit at least two times every year. That said, I would like to re-post my previous review. \n\nI believe we've been staying at the Lowell for approximately 15 years, usually visiting in the spring and fall. My wife and I have a favorite one-bedroom suite that we request, which is particularly nice in cool fall weather with its wood-burning fireplace. The suite has been totally renovated with a beautiful and spacious white marble bathroom and granite topped kitchenette. We use the Lowell as our base on these 5 night trips for forays to the theater, museums, restaurants and socializing with friends who are lucky enough to call NYC home. The Lowell is a welcome and ultra-comfortable respite from busy days and nights. We have also used it to host small cocktail gatherings in our suite, or order pizza up and watch a movie with friends. As I said, it feels like home and it's a tranquil and inviting respite to busy days and nights in the city. But above all, the real gems of the Lowell are its staff. These people are there to serve in a friendly and professional manner. They're down to earth, but exacting in executing your wishes and making you feel welcome and very special. From desk managers, to doormen, to bell men, to waiters and housekeeping, we see very little turnover from year to year. I assume the Lowell personnel are treated well, enjoy their jobs, and therefore reciprocate to their guests. The concierges, John Mark and Philip, are outstanding resources, well connected, and eager to advise and facilitate. The Lowell is a small hotel with approximately 4 rooms or suites per floor on 17 floors. It is an old building, but gracious and elegant. If you enjoy your hotels large, sleek, and bustling, this isn't what you're looking for. If you want highly personal attention, elegantly timeless ambience, and a stellar east side location between Park and Madison, this is your place. However, like most things dear and unique, it comes at a price, and it will get your attention depending on what type of accommodation you choose. But, that is a matter of choice, personal prioritiy and most likely frame of mind. The Lowell offers my wife and I everything we're looking for in NYC and we always look forward to coming back.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is great though.  It's located near the designer stores on Madison Ave. Hermes and Chopard are just around the corner. It's near enough to walk to the famous tourist spots but far enough to be isolated and private, which is a good thing. I suggest trip advisor to add another function to show the average age of the reviewers, as people of different age groups have different needs. The restaurant,  Pembroke room, is overrated. The decor needs some refurbishment. The caffe latte I ordered through room service turned out to be regular coffee that cost me almost usd30. The lobby is very small and dark. It doesn't feel very welcoming. You could say it feels like \"home\". The service is so so. No one showed me around the room.  The least they could do was to introduce me to the amenities , which is a standard in most luxury hotels. The junior suite I booked was pretty nice though.  It looks better in real than in the pictures.  Also,  I must commend the excellent service offered by the concierge , Mr John [--].  He was very friendly and helpful. He helped us book Broadway show tickets and even sent the confirmation with directions to the theater to our room. Housekeeping was very well done. They folded our clothes and organized them neatly for our convenience. Another thing I want to mention is the welcome email they sent a day prior to my arrival, something which they should have done earlier. I didn't see the point in sending that email, as it didnt serve any purpose. They asked if they could offer any help, and I replied requesting for pickup at the airport. But apparently by the time they got to the email, it was already too late to do anything. Also, they asked me about the things that I like and even my travel companion's name, which got me very excited as I was expecting a very grand welcome.  But the reality was far from that. If you are unsure of your ability to meet certain expectations , then don't set the bar so high because it's just very anti climax and disappointing. Even the hotels in bali could have done a much better job. Oh, and they broke my suitcase. Also, be careful of the bellboy, who solicited private car services at an exorbitant price. On my first outing to times square, which isn't very far away, I actually wanted to hail a cab but he recommended that I take a private car but when I got into the car and asked about the cost , it was too late to save myself the embarrassment of saying no. He asked if I was paying cash and I said yes. He then told me that it wouldn't make a difference if I took the private car, but the difference turned out to be more than triple of what I'd have to pay for the regular taxi. Maybe a rookie traveler to NYC like me should have known to be a bit more careful. To summarize my experience,  \"old rich\" with no wow factor.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

So if you want a Jimmy Stewart \"Rear Window\" experience you would like our room.  \n\nThe reader must wonder why we rated the hotel very good, after the above description. The room was fabulous, with a great bathroom.  The room was quiet with a very comfortable bed. We had breakfast in the second floor dining room, where if you looked out the windows you would have a similar view to our room, but the food and the service were great.  Some may find the place stodgy, with tea in the afternoon, and very formal service, but that beats, \"hello my name is Hepy Titus, and I will be your server today.\"\n\nSo in spite of the view from our room, the small lobby, and some of the patricians the frequented the place, the old world service and charm won us over.","travelDate":"2013-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Since the rooms are nose-bleedingly expensive, we have always checked and re-checked before staying there to make sure that our preference will be available, as we know the rooms in the hotel. On this occasion, we had called beforehand three times and were assured that there would be no problem.\nWhen we arrived from our long flight, after checking in, we thought to ask and to our surprise,  were told that our preference was not available but that we had been allocated a room in the same category. Problem was that we knew the room in question and did not want to stay there,  as the room in question is right next to the elevator bank and looks out onto the street, which can be quite noisy at times. We were offered a late checkout or a reduction in rate as compensation, or a transfer to the same room on a higher floor. We did not want this, as we want quiet above all and the hotel knows this is the case, if they had looked at our record.\nSo now began our problems. The front desk manager was insolent, telling us that room allocation is always done after careful consideration daily of the list of expected guests, which showed that we obviously were not on the Lowell's list of guests considered worthy of consideration - and she appeared quite surprised that we wanted the category of room expected, which showed that she had not reviewed our record at all. Nor had any attention been paid to us as repeat guests, our room preference or the three phone calls leading up to our stay checking on the room category availability. Very quickly we decided, being tired and discomfited by this unwelcome reception, to go elsewhere - we went to the Carlyle, where we were warmly welcomed and had a good experience.\nHowever, the Lowell management has not responded well. We felt that, after what had happened, the hotel management should either cancel or mitigate the room charge. The hotel Manager, Mr Verma, apologized most insincerely but suggested that not the Lowell staff, but we ourselves, had been insulting - which is absolutely not true - and that we were accusing him of lying about room availability, which is also not true. This line of polite confrontation allowed him to avoid completely a discussion about what had happened with our reservation. Instead of trying to work with us to leave us with an impression about the Lowell that could bring us back in future - he tried to put us in the wrong over the entire affair, which has made certain that we would never want to stay again. I told him that I was totally shocked that someone in hospitality could behave thus, but he clearly did not care one whit about my opinion.","travelDate":"2013-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":93585,"title":"Comfort in the East Side","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2012-06-16","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"My family and I stayed for five days at the Lowell in April of 2012. We organized a two-bedroom suite for everyone, and I must say it was very, very comfortable. I thought the rooms were wonderful, with every amenity you can think of included - and I was happy to have a tiny kitchen as well.  Beds were comfortable, and weirdly enough, the hotel was really quiet - which was a new experience for me in New York!\n\nAs other reviewers have suggested, it really was like being at home in New York.\n\nThe best thing about the Lowell are the concierge team, hands down.  They were courteous, they were able to organize anything, they didn't kill you with crazy charges and if things were expensive, they were also able to offer alternatives if you wanted them.  Our family usually uses the concierge service a lot, so this was perfect for us.  I really appreciated both John Mark and Philip and I would go back just for them.\n\nI was sad that we didn't have a view, but I think that is because I had asked for rooms with fireplaces; I wouldn't do this again because the fireplaces looked a bit shallow and I would have been afraid to have a fire in them, so when we go back I will try to book a suite if I can that has the outdoor area (I think it is a large covered balcony or something).  Since we used to stay at the Ritz at Central Park, we really love a great view, and I feel that we missed this. But this isn't something that the Lowell can be faulted with.\n\nI didn't really love the restaurant\/bar that is next door to the hotel and is attached to it with a door.  I felt that, on the one hand, it did have the feel of \"old New York\".  On the other hand, the bar is just a line bar that is set in the walkway to the restaurant, and it didn't look comfortable or inviting.  Surely there must be a way to make this place more like a place people want to have a drink before dinner?\nThe restaurant, in my opinion, could also use some sprucing up.  We had a better experience (thanks again to the concierge) at Le Billbouquet across the street.\n\nFinally, the hotel breakfast room\/small restaurant on the second floor was really weird.  I thought it was creepy the first time we were there because it is low and dark and furnished in an old-fashioned way. Later, I went down and had breakfast there, and it didn't seem so strange.  It was kind of cozy.  It is, again, more like a home than a hotel - which is a good thing.\n\nAll in all, I would go back. I loved the neighborhood setting as well.  You don't always have to be in the middle of everything all the time, and Lowell Hotel is a nice place to kick back and relax, knowing that you are steps away from anything you want or need at any time.","travelDate":"2012-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I don't want to give this hotel a negative review, I wanted to like it as much as Margaret in reservations.  It is certainly not a bad hotel, but it has the potential to be a wonderful hotel.  In defense of the hotel, since I only stayed for one night, maybe I caught it on an \"off\" day.  I was coming to town for a Dr's appt and because I was so sick I needed my mother and her husband to drive me.  I had changed my reservation 3 times because my migraine was so bad and Margaret was very accommodating.  The day of my arrival I called to add a room to my reservation.  The rooms were around $750 and I was eligible for an upgrade because I am an Andrew Harper member.  Margaret made the smart suggestion that I upgrade my room for a couple hundred of dollars and then use the upgrade, and add on my parents room making it a two bedroom suite.  I thanked her for even thinking that up and was so excited about my stay.  The Andrew Harper rewards also entitled us to a bottle of wine, vip fruit basket, free afternoon tea and a continental breakfast.  When we arrived, around 3:30, they said the room wasn't ready and I thought, oh perfect we can go for tea, but we were told to wait in the waiting area, which we did.  After about 45 minutes we were taken to our room.  The living room was great, it was comfortable, newly re-finished, it had a terrace with a really interesting city view, if you hung over the balcony enough, you could even see central park.  I took the nicer bedroom, it had the same city view, a gorgeous bathroom with great amenities.  The carpet however was wet from being cleaned and had that weird chemical smell, if I didn't have a migraine, it would have been more livable for me.  The other bedroom was also nice, city view, but not as good as mine and it had a much smaller bathroom. But again, we were only there for one night.  We had room service for dinner and we were told that it would take approximately 45 minutes, it ended up closer to an hr and 45 minutes.  I hate confrontation, so does my mother, but my stepfather yelled at room service which embarrassed me greatly, they took care of the bill which I thought was more than generous (maybe it was part, I really stayed out of the whole thing, I hid in my bedroom).  The food was amazing, we had this awesome tomato soup, although it would have been better if it came with the gorgonzola crustini it was advertised with.  I had the fresh pea ravioli which was delicious. The VIP fruit basket was 3 apples.  No tea. There was no breakfast the following morning.  We were also charged a price higher than quoted.  Oh, and the lady who did the turn down was lovely I guess to some up.\nPros:\nMargaret, Margaret, Margaret....\nCIty view suite with terrace\nroom service\n\nCons:\nThings are just not delivered as promised (I believe this is a customer service issue)\nWe were charged a price higher than we were quoted\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't stay here again because I don't know what it would be like, this is my only experience with this hotel. It was overall just more disappointing than anything, it would have been better to expect nothing and be surprised along the way.","travelDate":"2012-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms have been refurbished more than once during that period.  The latest do-over was A+ with respect to the bathroom in our last suite -- a very worldly friend commented, on seeing the bathroom, \"I want a bathroom just like this!\"  Our bed had about 10 pillows on it, making choosing just the right one a snap.  Usually higher rooms are hotter (hot air rises, after all) but to our delight our suite on the 14th floor was not unpleasantly warm.  The hotel only has two tiny elevators, one of which is not infrequently out of service, which is inconvenient, but the only fly I can identify in this particular ointment -- or, rather, balm.","travelDate":"2011-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My wife and I have a favorite one-bedroom suite that we request, which is particularly nice in cool fall weather with its wood-burning fireplace. The suite has been totally renovated with a beautiful and spacious white marble bathroom and granite topped kitchenette. We use the Lowell as our base on these 5 night trips for forays to the theater, museums, restaurants and socializing with friends who are lucky enough to call NYC home. The Lowell is a welcome and ultra-comfortable respite from busy days and nights. We have also used it to host small cocktail gatherings in our suite, or order pizza up and watch a movie with friends. As I said, it feels like home and it's a tranquil and inviting respite to busy days and nights in the city. But above all, the real gems of the Lowell are its staff. \nThese people are there to serve in a friendly and professional manner. They're down to earth, but exacting in executing your wishes and making you feel welcome and very special. From desk managers, to doormen, to bell men, to waiters and housekeeping, we see very little turnover from year to year. I assume the Lowell personnel are treated well, enjoy their jobs, and therefore reciprocate to their guests. The concierges, John Mark and Philip, are outstanding resources, well connected, and eager to advise and facilitate.  The Lowell is a small hotel with approximately 4 rooms or suites per floor on 17 floors. It is an old building, but gracious and elegant. If you enjoy your hotels large, sleek, and bustling, this isn't what you're looking for. If you want highly personal attention, elegantly timeless ambience, and a stellar east side location between Park and Madison, this is your place. However, like most things dear and unique, it comes at a price, and it will get your attention depending on what type of accommodation you \nchoose. But, that is a matter of choice, personal prioritiy and most likely frame of mind. The Lowell offers my wife and I everything we're looking for in NYC and we always look forward to coming back.

The bed was amazingly comfortable - one of the comfiest I have ever slept in - and we were made to feel like a king and queen with the level of service we received. In the marble bathroom were Bulgari toiletries, two washbasins, a huge shower room and a bathtub with a flatscreen television embedded into the wall. We could not have asked for more.

The suites are newly renovated, tastefully decorated and extremely spacious. They feel like apartments with their little kitchens and gorgeous bathrooms! And now my second favorite part, the Pembrooke Room. It is the ultimate setting for breakfast in New York. Afternoon Tea is also served fantastically. The room is hidden on the second floor at the back of the hotel and is decorated in lovely light spring colors and mirrored. There is tons of daylight on a sunny day. There are not that many amenities within the hotel because of it's size but the Post House. A Smith and Wollensky operation, it is just as good as their signature restaurant or Park Avenue Winter\/Spring\/Summer\/Fall. A lot of celebrities like the bar because of it's privacy and charm.

I stayed here for 3 nights a few months ago. It was a good stay, but definitely not worth the price in my opinion. \n\nThis Lowell Hotel is pretty small and low key. The location is great, it's 2 blocks from Central Park in the upper east side. The neighborhood is very residential and not as touristy as other areas of Manhattan. The hotel is right in the middle of a residential street.\n\nThe lobby is small and pretty dark. So are the hallways and the elevators. The front desk staff is nice, but a bit snobby which I will elaborate on later. \n\nThe rooms are very nice. We got the cheapest one, so it was pretty small. The bed was big and comfy. The kitchenette is stocked with snacks and drinks but they're pretty expensive. ($5 for a little bottle of water). The bathroom is amazing and probably my favorite thing about the room. There isn't much of a view, just the apartments across the street. This hotel isn't a high rise so you won't get a pretty view of Manhattan like other hotels.\n\nWhat I didn't like was how snobby the staff and other guests were. My boyfriend and I being 21 years old definitely got some condescending looks. It's kind of hard to explain through typing but you'll know when it happens. \n\nSo if you're a bit older, like low key, non touristy 5 star hotels, then you will love the Lowell Hotel. If you're younger and want to be in the hustle and bustle of Manhattan this isn't the hotel to stay at.\n\nIt's a good hotel but I wouldn't stay here again.","travelDate":"2009-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We like trying 5-star hotels around the world (for example, in NYC we've previously stayed at the Trump twice and The Carlyle, and enjoyed both) and based on reviews we've read both here and elsewhere, we had high expectations of The Lowell. Unfortunately, we went away disappointed.\n\nWe had booked a Lowell King room through the American Express FHR program and we were upgraded to a Junior Suite. It was pleasantly decorated and fairly spacious, but overall there was nothing special about it. There was no view (in fact, we were looking straight into surrounding apartments and thus had no privacy unless we kept the curtains closed), no fireplace, no terrace. It just didn't \"wow\" us (unlike the 1-bedroom suite we usually get for less money at Trump, with fantastic views of Columbus Circle).\n\nWe didn't like the Pembroke room, where breakfast and tea are served. It is in a dark, semi-basement location with heavy draperies and an overdone decor (tassles everywhere). We found it dismal. The food was okay but the service was only so-so.\n\nIn fact, the biggest disappointment about The Lowell was the service. At such a small hotel, with a tiny lobby, guests should expect to be greeted personally by the front desk as they walk by on the way to the elevators. During our entire stay, we were NEVER greeted. In fact, they didn't even make eye contact. There always seemed to be several people behind the desk, but they were all busy talking with each other. Our one request to the concierge was handled pleasantly but impersonally. The most personable people on staff were the doormen, and even they were not all that friendly. We've had much nicer experiences elsewhere.\n\nIn short, we just didn't enjoy our experience at The Lowell.","travelDate":"2009-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When I first arrived, I was given a room on the fourth floor with ancient chipped furniture, a stained rug, and a dingy kitchenette complete with 70s-era appliances.  Also, the room was so low and surrounded by other buildings that my cell phone did not work.  When I called the front desk to ask for another room on a higher floor with furniture in better condition, I was told that chips and worn paint were simply \"the style\" of the furniture, and that no other rooms were available.  Only after I insisted was I told by the rude desk clerk that she had \"moved some things around\" and found me a room on a higher floor.  Unfortunately, that room was a carbon copy of the first, but at least I had cell phone reception.  I got into the shower to find dried splatters of blue soap all over the shower walls and curtain.  I had to call housekeeping to clean this up while I went out, which they did.  Later that night I turned on the air conditioning, which rattled loudly and kept me awake.  The bed and sheets were fine.  \n\nI'm baffled by the rave reviews given to this hotel.  Some floors have renovated rooms, and I hope they're in better shape than the one I was condemned to sleep in.  They could hardly be worse for a hotel with this type of name and reputation.  The only good things I can say about The Lowell are that it is well located on a nice side street and is quiet.

Luckily, we chose The Lowell.  What a gem!!  In the past we have stayed at the St Regis and The Penninsula.  Not anymore.\n\nI called the hotel directly and got, for the great East Side location, a pretty good price after asking if there were any \"specials\" for my dates.  I was quoted a rate quite a bit cheaper than any of the discount websites.  \n\nThe elegant, understated entrance only hints at what is inside...a lovely, small lobby that smells of fragrant flowers.  \n\nWhen we checked in, Jonathan, at the front desk, had upgraded us to a room with a recently renovated bathroom.  We were offered a complimentary beverage (we chose champagne which arrived within 10 minutes on a silver tray) and enjoyed the beautiful bowl of fruit that had been placed in the room.  The decor was refined, the room was immaculate and the new bathroom was stunning.\n\nThe next day we realized we were on a smoking floor (I had neglected to request a non-smoking room) and I called the front desk to see if there was anything that could be done.  Johnathan called back within a half-hour to inform us that we would be upgraded to a suite for the remainder of our stay!  We were promptly moved and the maid service was already in the suite making a king bed out of the two twins that were there.  Needless to say, we were very impressed by the gesture and most appreciative.  \n\nWithout exception, the staff were the nicest and most helpful of anywhere we've stayed...and we've been to a lot of 5-star hotels.  \n\nI can't say enough about this superb hotel in the heart of NYC.  My only concern is that the secret will get out (should I really be writing this?) and we'll be out of luck next time we're in town.","travelDate":"2008-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This review is for the people who read the same reviews and  feel some sort of doubt  if they should book there or not -- trust me, you can put your fears to rest !!!\n\nThe hotel is historic, and located about 2 blocks from Central Park on a fairly quiet street on the Upper East Side.  Historic means that the elevators are slow and small, which can be frustrating sometimes.  But, a small thing when you look at the overall service the hotel provides.   The F subway line is about 2 blocks away, plus the 6 subway line was about 4 blocks away.  We found we mostly used these two lines to get around NYC. \n\nThe staff were not snobbish at all and were all very friendly, down to earth, and welcoming.  Kudos to Antonio, the evening concierge, especially. He would always greet us in a warm, friendly manner and was always interested in a short chat on how our day went or in a debate the virtues of a particular restaurant.\n\nWe stayed in a King Jr. Suite. The suite was spacious,  beautifully decorated, and is very true to the pics on their website.  Everything was extremely clean and in good repair, no worn furniture or dirty walls or peeling wallpaper as reported in another review.  The bed was just a tad firm, but I'm splitting hairs here, and is made up with very high end linens.  The bathroom was extremely spacious, all beautifully done in marble and comes with  yummy Bulgari Green Tea amenities.  Get to know your maid and be on friendly terms, and she'll leave you more to take home ;o)\n\nWe ordered room service twice from the Post House, and each time our food came well-prepared and hot, within 1\/2 an hour, even during busy times.  Portions are extremely large, so you may want  to split entrees if you are not positively starving.   Our faves were  the coconut cake; lots of white cake layers sandwiched between coconut mousse and the Lobster Club sandwich.\n\nThe service at the Lowell is top notch, we have stayed at  Four Seasons Hotels and I would say it is comparable.  For example, there are plenty of umbrellas on rainy days, and when you come back from a wet outing, they automatically exchange your wet umbrella for a dry one.  We had mentioned it was my birthday and one evening a very large chocolate mousse cake was delivered to our room, gratis, with a candle.  After the first day, the staff greet you by name.  Little things like the above make all the difference and should be expected as well, as it is not cheap to stay at the Lowell. There is also a  gym that  is fairly well equipped, with  plenty of bottled water, fresh fruit and every type of energy bar\/ protein bar you can think of that you can help yourself to. Also, there is also a free computer and printer to use, which saves you from bringing a laptop.\n\nAll in all, we feel it is worth it to stay at the Lowell, and will save our pennies to do so again. We felt totally pampered and relaxed, plus the friendly staff made it a pleasure to come back \"home\".  I can truly say we had a wonderful experience at the Lowell and look forward to staying there again soon.","travelDate":"2007-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The place was a little too fancy (and almost too snobby at times) for my taste (completely personal) but nonetheless, it was still a very classy hotel that is in a league of its own.  \n\nHOWEVER THIS IS WHERE THE PRAISE FOR THE LOWELL HOTEL ENDS!!  \n\nWe had made some large purchases in NYC and needed to have some items shipped home.  I told staff the package was fragile and that we needed to buy insurance for $3,000.  The items arrived to our home in the original bag I had given the staff to pack, in a box with no bubble wrap or other cushion and that was about double the size necessary for the contents inside.  In addition, very little tape had been used to secure the package.  Needless to say, about $300 worth of items arrived broken.  The shipper denied the insurance claim for $300 because of the poor packing of the fragile items.  \n\nGiven the caliber of The Lowell Hotel and how they are known for such intimate personal service, I just expected much more from them on handling the package.  Besides the obvious lack of packing material inside a box 2x too big for the bag shipped, they just put the bag (which was incredibly heavy with glass and lead crystal balls and bowls) in the box.  Placing the order for $3,000 worth of insurance should at a minimum have been a flag for the staff to take additional steps to ensure the package was shipped securely. \n\nHowever, that was not even the worst part of the whole experience.  I had several conversations on the phone with the hotel staff and the lead manager,  expending a lot of effort to make my case as to why the hotel should pay our $300 claim.  The hotel denied ever being told the package was fragile (thus, in effect, implying I was lying).  And the manager participated in a very lengthy dicker-and-ticker with me trying to explain rational reasons why the package was handled in the way that it was.  We spent over $4,000 at The Lowell and yet, they decided to put me through a grueling, tiring batter of the blame game in order to avoid paying a measly $300 claim.  Never once did they offer anything for my troubles and damaged items.  Not even 10% off our next stay in The Lowell; not that I would even stay there for free now.  \n\nIn closing, The Lowell is a good, nice hotel and I hate to see them treat a customer this way, particularly one that spent so much there.  I guess a $4,000 hotel bill is a pretty measly chunk of change compared to their usual clients and they don't mind losing us.  Maybe we did not live up to the ideal of a Lowell client.  Whatever the reason, they should have paid the $300 claim, written it off as a loss and subsequently ended up with a very satisfied client happy to come back any time.  Instead, their actions have produced this review and created bad word-of-mouth into the general circulation of a well connected and influential former client.  \n\nMy ex-boyfriend's name is Lowell too.  I should have known trouble would be around the corner!!\n","travelDate":"2005-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I can't imagine staying anywhere else in New York after this trip. We were in town because our daughter was in the hospital and the staff at the Lowell couldn't have been kinder or more accommodating. Our suite was just right- the fireplace offered a wonderful ambiance at the end of the day. The location is perfect and I've never seen a staff so dedicated and lovely (and we have stayed many times at the Four Seasons). Book a suite or a room and know that this is the hotel you'll call \"home\" from now on in New York!\n","travelDate":"2005-01","tripType":"NONE"}

It's not affiliated with any chain, and you can tell the moment you arrive.  There are no key cards; instead actual room keys that you leave with the desk staff (whom after the first time you reurn, have their arm extended with your key before you open your mouth).  Since this was an old apartment building, each room has a full kitchen (the deluxe rooms have kitchenettes with Sub-Zero brand appliances) and rooms are exactly what you except a hotel of this caliber to be (Bulgari porducts, TVs in the tub, etc).  Service and attention to detail have the corporate hotels beat hands-down.  Four Seasons and St. Regis (stayed at SR, both have double the rate) can't compete.  Ice comes in two minutes, and room service is quick.  The low turnover in staff is amazing.  I live in the city and when my parents visit, once or twice a year, the staff always remembers me and sends me up without calling them.  One complaint, there is not a bar with a sitting area (neighboring Post House has a door to its restaurant and offers full room service in addition to the hotels own kitchen, but has a stand-only bar).  However, guests have signing privileges at Club Macanudo next door (and Le Bilbouquet bistrot across the street).  All in all, this is not the place to see an be seen and the staff and guests wouldn't have it any other way.  And who has actual terraces and in-suite fireplaces that work? (they will actually come and build a fire...for a fee, of course.  This is the East Side after all).  NB:  Leading Hotels (and even Orbitz) can have rates at $310, even during the holidays.  If you want to go back and brag that you stayed at a Peninsula or Mandarin, do it, but you'll pay more and get less.\n","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}

If you want to get the feel of being a New Yorker living near Central Park & within steps of the best shopping in the city, you won't want to miss coming \"home\" to The Lowell. I was there for Christmas in 2003 with my pekingese, and we had the best Christmas I've ever had.  Room service is superb, the concierge will arrange whatever requests you may have, and the desk staff treated me & my dog like we were 1st class. The rooms are very quiet and furnishings are very comfortable. Enjoy your trip to New York & please consider this your fine luxurious peaceful home away from home.\n","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}

It was a very good value and just steps from the best shopping on Madison Avenue, I went with low expectations so had little to lose. On first impression the lobby seemed dark & a bit dreary, but the welcoming staff & unasked for room upgrade quickly made up for it. As a woman traveling alone, I prefer small boutique hotels with a european feeling and my idea of heaven is a bed filled with down pillows, a bubble bath and great room service when I'm away from home... and The Lowell had it all. Right down to the Bulgari toiletries and Frederic Fakai shampoo! My room was spacious, tastefully furnished, and I couldn't wait to get back for 'High Tea' at the end of the day (clotted cream & all). If five star service is a priority, you may be disappointed, but if quiet, privacy, and understated elegance makes you happy you will be delighted with The Lowell.\n","travelDate":"2004-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
{"helpfulVotes":23,"locationId":93585,"title":"very unhappy with service","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2003-12-21","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I absolutely LOVED our room. We stayed 5 nights and it truly felt like we had our own apartment in the city. However, the service was terrible! We booked a $750 suite and were upgraded by the hotel manager to an even nicer room ($1,200) without having to ask. The front desk staff was rude each and every time I spoke to them. They didn't recognize me as a guest once during my 5 day stay. They neglected to bring packages to my room. They lost my husbands lap top for a few hours. A houskeeper and repairmen working on another room on our floor raided our kitchen of alcohol and candy bars and the front desk refused to take them off the bill. Also houskeeping neglected to place a sign on our fireplace informing us of the $20 per day fee for it's use. We used it every day and were shocked upon checkout to have $100 in charges. Again, the desk refused to remove the charge. I even suggested that they accompany me upstairs to prove the sign wasn't there. The staff member then accused me of \"disposing of the sign\". I received a refund for the extra charges after writing a letter to the hotel manager. He was very nice about it and has offered us a free night next time we are in NYC. I'm a little scared to give them another try though, especially with so many fabulous hotels in the city.","travelDate":null,"tripType":null}
