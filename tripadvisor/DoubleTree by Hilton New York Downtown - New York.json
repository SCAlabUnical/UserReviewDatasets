Hotel itself was just ok.\n\nRoom was very cramped - I couldn't fit my suitcase in the closet with the safe and the ironing board and the awkward doors so I kept it on my desk.\nThe bathroom was very small with zero counter space, just a little shelf above the toilet. I had to move the toilet paper roll to the back of the toilet because if it was on the holder it interfered with the seat lid. \n\nView from Room 1107 was looking into another building. I thought Floor 11 would give me some kind of view, but disappointed that I looked at and into buildings. The only good thing was I was low enough that I didn't have to wait on the elevators very long on Wednesday and Thursday, but Friday morning was insane. Every car that came down was completely full. Three small elevators for 40+ floors is not enough, or they need a more efficient elevator system as I have seen in other high rises.  City noises were very loud which I was mostly able to drown out with my white noise app. I'd go higher if you are sensitive to noise at night. I could also hear doors slamming and talking\/tv\/music from other rooms well into the night. Definitely not a quiet hotel.\n\nI left for meetings at 9am and when I returned at 5pm, my room still had not been made up.  They showed up a few minutes later and I told them just to give me towels and she did empty trash cans too. Would have been nice to have come back to this vs. trying to get ready for dinner while they serviced my room.  Coffee maker in the room - I went to put water in the tank, and it was dirty\/dusty. I ran water through it a few times and tried to wipe out with a washcloth. Ew.  \n\nShopping and dining\/bar options within walking distance. The sign in the elevator said there was a lobby bar, but I never saw it. Plenty of bar options easy walking distance or in the restaurant on the bottom level.\n\nHilton, you really should give your members free water every day like Marriott does. The front desk staff were ok but not overly friendly.\n\nIt wasn't terrible, but I might look at other nearby options next time.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

In general, the location was fabulous as it's central to so much in the financial district. \nUpon check in, I thought there was a valet and became very flustered. We were told to go to the 2nd floor to check in and I was overwhelmed as there was no one to help me get a lot of stuff upstairs. There were carts, but they were horrible to navigate. The elevators were packed and took a ton of time while I waited to get to the second floor. My fiance took the car to look for parking and it was very stressful.\nOnce I got to the second floor to check in, I was greeted by the nicest man. I was having a bit of a meltdown and he was kind, patient and generous with me. He apologized for the misunderstanding and gave me directions to the closest garage (which I texted my partner). He gave me a bottle of water and helped me relax. \nOnce I unloaded everything in my room I was much better, but the experience was not fun alone. I wish they had bellhops or someone to help. The issue is that the space is small, there's 44 floors and not enough room in the 3 elevators. \nRoom was great. Small but clean, charming and comfortable. Had a great view! \nI would actually stay again now that we know what to expect. The only downside is the elevators. When we checked out (and they did give us a late checkout which was nice) - we had to wait 30 minutes to get from the 42nd floor down to 2nd floor lobby. It was so bad they had to send someone up on the service elevator to come get us. \nIf you aren't in a rush, don't have a ton of stuff to take to your room and it's a quick trip - this hotel really is worth the money.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The first inconvenience occurred when we were directed to use a lift to reach the salle d'attente on the second floor, cue the PA struggling to fit my 15 piece matching set of Louis Vuitton luggage (and his back pack) into the rather tight elevator. I left the PA to carry out all the check in formalities, however I was rather flabbergasted to see him spinning a wheel as if he was some kind of game show host. It was then back to the elevator to reach our room on the 23rd floor, this is where problems started as all the lifts were full of other patrons; I instructed the PA that he would have to take the stairs with my 15 piece matching set of Louis Vuitton luggage. I eventually managed to get myself into an elevator after being told to go in sideways and not touch the sides. Obscenities began to be shouted towards the PA when he finally showed up to the 23rd floor because he hadn\u2019t left me the room key, he then ushered me into the room which was rather diminutive. First thing I noticed was how cold the room was and I had visions of having to sleep in my morning dress, the PA found the thermoregulator and turned up the temperature; what a mistake that was at it sounded like the PA had started a diesel generator. For a quick dinner I allowed the PA fetch something called a \u201ctakeout\u201d however he hadn\u2019t picked up any silverware, I found some coffee stirrers in the room and we had to make do with those to eat the Mac\u2019n\u2019cheese (pasta and a cheese sauce). The beds were incredibly comfortable which resulted in both of us feeling very refreshed come dawn, this came in handy for the PA as due to the popularity of the lifts there was a wait so I demanded to be carried down the stairs (I don\u2019t like burning calories unnecessarily). The gentleman on the ground floor was always very courteous and I tipped my top hat each time we passed. It was a little disappointing to find the housekeeper hadn\u2019t cleared any of our detritus we\u2019d left beside the receptacle, likewise the coffee stirrers weren\u2019t replenished which resulted in the PA having a mac\u2019n\u2019cheese flavoured coffee. For our early flight from JFK I requested the PA to request a station wagon from reception, this was met with blank stares resulting in us vulnerable gentleman having to brave the conditions at an ungodly hour trying to flag down a cabriolet. Ultimately despite the few negatives our weekend retreat at the DoubleTree New York Downtown was pleasant and enjoyable, if the PA booked this boarding house again I would be fine with it.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Small but that\u2019s to be expected. It cost roughly \u00a3200 a night, which was reasonable for NYC around Thanksgiving and compared well with other hotels at the same time.  A last minute booking would have been even cheaper, down to \u00a3125 per night.  The bed was comfortable and the aircon\/heating worked well. \n\nIt is true you can be kept waiting a while for lifts\/elevators but we didn\u2019t find it too bad.  One afternoon we found that our room still hadn\u2019t been serviced by 4.30, but a call to reception quickly sorted it.  The check in guy seemed nice and we got a free cookie!  \n\nI liked the location of this hotel. It\u2019s close to at least 3 subway stations, giving you good connections to pretty much everywhere. Whitehall Street is the very closest, literally 100 yards away.  Take the R or W trains uptown to Times Square and other destinations.  Bowling Green and South Ferry are also close by. You\u2019re also close to the ferries for Liberty Island and Staten Island.  It\u2019s round the corner from the NYC transit shop which I loved.  There\u2019s loads of eating places around.  I liked that we weren\u2019t right in the middle of everything - Times Square would be too noisy and busy I think.  \n\nOverall I\u2019d recommend the hotel.  However it is high rise (44 storeys) so it might be one to avoid if you don\u2019t like being on a high floor.  I\u2019ve never been in a lift with so many buttons - but noticed that strangely, there\u2019s no 13th floor!  \n\nOne final thing.  It is possible to get to JFK from here on the subway from Bowling Green station (use the elevator in front of the American Indian museum) and changing at Fulton Street to the A train, then getting the Airtrain to JFK at Howard Beach.  No steps involved at any point.  It costs $10 each and took us just under two hours from hotel lobby to check in desk.  The hotel can arrange a taxi but this will set you back around $100.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Hotellet ligger t\u00e6t p\u00e5 flere subway linjer (gul, gr\u00f8n, brun og r\u00f8d linje), Battery park, f\u00e6rgen til Staten Island, vandet og b\u00f8rsen (NYSE). Brooklyn bridge ligger indenfor fornuftig g\u00e5afstand. \n\nEfter n\u00e6rmere overvejelser valgte vi ud fra pris og anmeldelser dette hotel til 10 overnatninger i New York city (Manhatten). Ud fra anmeldelserne var vi forberedt p\u00e5 at elevatorerne kunne v\u00e6re en udfordring og det holdt stik. Elevatorerne er s\u00e5m\u00e6nd fine nok. Der er bare for f\u00e5! Tre elevatorer til 44 etager er i underkanten og giver i perioder ventetid. Is\u00e6r morgen\/formiddag samt eftermiddag. Alts\u00e5 n\u00e5r folk tjekker ud og ind. De fleste vil nok blive irriteret over dette men det er til at leve med hvis man er forberedt p\u00e5 risiko for ventetid. Vi pr\u00f8vede trapperne b\u00e5de ned og op (sidstn\u00e6vnte kun \u00e9n gang...) men det kr\u00e6ver en vis fysik. \nDer er en stor isterningmaskine p\u00e5 hver tredje etage og desv\u00e6rre ogs\u00e5 p\u00e5 vores (32. etage).

Times Square (og priserne noget mere spiselige). T\u00e6t p\u00e5 hotellet er der et par k\u00f8bm\u00e6nd og ok udvalg af madsteder (herunder take away). Vi satte is\u00e6r pris p\u00e5 poke bowl. \n\nGenerelt tip i New York City: Det er dejlig nemt at bruge VISA kort direkte i subway i stedet for at k\u00f8be et subway kort, som skal tankes op. Udgiften p\u00e5 ugebasis kan makimalt blive 34 dollars. Vi gik meget men brugte ogs\u00e5 subway meget.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Not a big deal, unless you need an elevator. There are three elevators for all 44 floors of this hotel so you will be taking the stairs a fair bit. I winced at those who chose a high floor, we stayed on the fifth and took the stairs almost daily. We often had to wait in excess of 10 minutes for an elevator (which don't have A\/C).\nThe rooms are smaller than you might expect, but they were very clean and well stocked with bathroom supplies. The beds are soft and the tv was a good size (around 40 inches). The room (we had a double), came with a tiny fridge-but it was enough to store a few drinks.\nThe on site gym is open 24 hours and has two treadmills, two ellipticals, a couple of bikes and a few weights, all in all, totally suitable for a workout.\nThe hotel is located within a block of a subway that can take you directly to Times Square in 15 minutes. \nWe were also warned of a possible wifi charge but did not get charged with that, even after a four night stay. This is possible due to the 4 hour long fire alarm that occurred on our third night, starting at 3am and went until 7:30am. There was no explanation as to why this happened, but since no one else evacuated the hotel we stayed in our rooms, assuming someone had smoked in their room and the fire alarm was broken. It made for a very unpleasant night. Another night we had someone decide to vacuum outside our room after 10pm, so that was also annoying, and a first for me (I stay at a lot of hotels for work). \nThe staff were always up-beat and polite and aside from a couple of issues we generally were fine with our stay, as I say in the title, it was a mixed bag of positives and negatives.

The stay was not charged to me as remediation.\n\n04\/12\/2023 - I arrived on Wednesday to the front desk about an hour or so before check-in to drop my bags so that I could get something to eat nearby while I waited.  I was received by Jose Rodriguez (Assistant Front Office Manager) and he informed me that the room was ready and that because I was a long time Honors member I wouldn\u2019t have to pay early check-in.  I thanked him and was very happy with this and so I went upstairs to leave my bags and get something to eat.\n\n04\/13\/2023 - Day goes by as expected.

I come back to the hotel somewhere around 10:30-10:45 pm that night and upon entering my room I notice someone has entered my room and left their bags, put their toiletries in the bathroom and even hanged up some clothing in the closet (See attached photos).  I immediately go into fight or flight mode, more fight as I stood my ground and stayed in the room.  I pickup the phone and call the front desk.  I explain the situation and the girl that answered the phone tells me I need to go to the front desk and I inform her I have all my valuables up in the room and someone else has access to the room to which I don\u2019t feel comfortable leaving my stuff and also at this point I don\u2019t know if someone has gone through my things or stolen anything.  I end up going downstairs, give my ID to prove my identity and the keycards to the room to the girl at the front desk, she immediately goes into what I call \u201cDamage Control\u201d mode.  She doesn\u2019t give a damn about what has happened to me and she is only trying to cover herself and the hotels behind at this point and she lies about having no idea what has happened and that the system shows nothing (I am a Senior Systems Engineer, I know she\u2019s full of it, I\u2019ve dealt with keycard systems for years of my career, there is a log with details, she knows what happened).  I\u2019m furious at this point, they send me up with a security guard and I check my belongings at that point to see if I am missing anything and I pack all my stuff and so that I can get moved to a different room as they have done NOTHING to remove the other persons items or anything at this point.  She tells the security guard via the walkie talkie to leave the room so that she can talk to him, obviously so I wouldn\u2019t listen to whatever mess she\u2019s about to fess up to.  He comes back in the room, I am packed and ready to go and he calls her over and asks if she has a room ready for me, she doesn\u2019t respond and we end up having to go to the front desk.  She is still lying and acting like this isn\u2019t a big deal, she switches me rooms and gives me a downgraded room because there are no more River View King rooms available.

I ask for the manager of the hotel, some guy named Diogenes Castillo who is no where to be found and couldn\u2019t probably care less, I ask for any manager and she says he wont be in until the next day at 3pm.  I go to my downgraded room, put every possible lock in place and barely sleep that night, wondering if someone\u2019s going to come barging in and I have to be ready to fight.\n\n04\/15\/2023 - I have barely slept and am up out of my bed pretty early, I then realize my very expensive medication is still in the room.  I go to the front desk and tell the same incompetent girl to call her security guy and inform her about my medication.  She tells me she has gone to the room and said that I left a bag there with my last name on it (I have not left a bag but now their incompetence is starting to make more sense, the person they gave a copy to shares the same last name as I, maybe even the first name), I chuckle and say unbelievable and walk away.  The security guard helps me secure my medication and the person who is staying there is not there but must be having a great time at my expense.  I leave and come back later at 3pm sharp, to no surprise the manager has not arrived yet, I am starting to understand why these people are so incompetent, they say lead by example, and that they do.  He finally shows up about 30 mins late and to no surprise it\u2019s Jose Rodriguez!  He tells me that someone said I wanted to talk to him.  I\u2019m thinking his team can\u2019t be this terrible to have not even explained the situation to him.  Indeed they have, whatever twisted version the incompetent front desk girl gave him.  I give him my version and ask him what the heck are they going to do to make this right.  He slaps me in the face by offering my Honor points, I ask him if he thinks me foolish enough to ever stay in a hotel with the name Hilton on it.  He keeps trying to push the points on me and that I can use them for other things than stay or gift them to someone.  I offer to gift it to him, maybe he can use them one day, he declines.  He makes no offer that is enough although nothing they can offer will fix this situation.  We finally arrive at me not paying a penny for the stay, I say thats the least they can do, he offers dinner at the hotels expense at the downstairs restaurant to which I tell him I work for a living I don\u2019t need charity or food, he offers a bottle of wine, I tell him thank God I don\u2019t drink.  We settle at not paying for the room, I advise him to teach his employees some manners before someone else decides to do it for him and I leave with one more day at this forsaken place before I leave home.\n\n04\/16\/2023 - I go to checkout pretty early, some other woman helps me and tells me she can\u2019t check me out and that she will when the manager comes since he is going to zero out my stay so I don\u2019t pay anything.  I tell her I will wait and I get a coffee and sit down to wait for Jose to show up.  He comes back, gives me a receipt thats zeroed out, he apologizes for the mess up, I shake hands with him and he says I hope you will come visit again, I laugh and tell him I will never step foot at a Hilton for the remainder of my natural life span, I leave this nightmare and go home.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

It took me about 5 mins to walk down but after a 10 minute warning from someone else who was waiting before me I was not in a position to wait! Check in was very cold and as a HH Gold member I expected more (regardless). I had to extend my booking before arriving and after several calls with Hilton customer service nothing was acknowledged about ensuring I didn't have to switch rooms during my stay. Even getting a message on the app asking, 'how can we make your stay awesome ' WELL I DID RESPOND HOW but it was a waste of time!! So disappointing. So I was rudely told I would have to stay in one room and switch over then on the day I did there was another RUDE member of staff who was going to make me bring my luggage down in the foyer and come back at 4pm to check in again...WHAT A JOKE!!! I simply refused and waited to speak to another member of staff (Analisee,  I might have spelled her name wrong) but she finally used some level of customer service and swapped my room without any issue. Honestly they need to train their staff properly so inconsistent. \nHH Gold member gey a $18 credit for the breakfast buffet that will cost you $25 in total. The quality is poor, but it is a DoubleTree. The is an Essen round the corner where the quality is better for breakfast or lunch so just pay a bit extra and go there! I only used the $18 credit 3 times as it was more convenient but the staff were friendly and attentive.\nThe rooms itself were pretty good , first was a city view room and then a Hudson view room. The Hudson view room was quite nice in fairness and the view was decent. \nMy city view room stank of weed, ironically on arrival and each time after the room was serviced. After a few days I then realised a number of the staff smoke weed themselves as when they entered the lift the literally stank of the stuff and the were doing the room cleaning. Way to go Hilton!!\nThe lift situation is exacerbated by the staff using the lift to go through the floors.  THEY NEED THEIR OWN LIFT OTHERWISE THE SITUATION WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM \n\nThe guy doing the luggage on the ground floor was nice and helpful for directions and general tips..!! He is an asset to the hotel.\nThe location is in Wall Street and is about 30 mins from Times Square on the subway. Its pretty easy to get around as there are a number of stations by the hotel.\nThe main reason people will stay here is mainly the price point compared to other NYC hotels. Having stayed in numerous Hilton and associated brands globally this one really let's the side down. The fact that it's relatively new is a joke and the decor in the city view rooms was poor.\nI found the Riu Hotel near times Square as a friend was staying there and next time I'm in NYC I will definitely be staying there as for a similar price point this hotel was far superior!\nHilton points or no Hilton points!!","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

The restaurant bar offered excellent food and most of all, the best service from the waiters to the captain who were so proud - and hard workers.   The bellman on departure truly cared about the guests and helping them with taxis, etc.   Every place has its pros and cons.  The hotel is 40 something stories high and slim so the elevators require some patience at peak - but everything requires patience.    The rooms had all the amenities we look for from refrigerator to coffee maker and were clean AND if you choose allow fresh air in which is important to me -- I love hearing street sounds in the distance.

I use a mobility scooter and waited more than an hour to get to the room after check-in. Husband walked down 14 floors to meet with family.  Twice, I called and a helpful staff member came up to get me when I had to get down, and each time, it took more than 15 minutes for the staff person to get to me. When we checked out, it took nearly an hour of waiting, calling, then getting on a packed elevator with the staff member, and it stopped on EVERY floor with open doors and angry people who could not fit on, even though nobody on the elevator was getting off except on the ground floor. The trip down after we got on with the staff member, took nearly 15 minutes!  If there were a fire, I would have been dead! \n I did not choose this hotel, a family member booked it. Had I chosen it, I would have read the reviews and known about the elevator problem and booked somewhere else.\nSometimes, the staff with cleaning carts, garbage carts, used the same elevators and took some of the spaces the guests were waiting to use.  They had no service elevator.  While I was waiting for a staff member to help me get down to the wedding, a few staff members were cleaning rooms.  They needed things on other floors and walked up and down the stairs.  Many guests used the stairs. When waiting, it was common to see guests on the stairs through the little window in the stairwell.\nI don't know how they can operate such an expensive hotel under such dangerous conditions.  I have stayed in hotels and motels in all sorts of conditions, but never have I felt such fear as knowing that I could not get out in the event of an emergency.\nThere are many hotels in NYC.

You'd be in a pickle if you couldn't use the stairs\/were on a higher floor - there are 44! \nThe room was a reasonable size for NY, but very dated and tired - chips and marks on furniture and walls, grubby windows etc. We had a procession of ants come to visit one morning, too!  BUT it had everything we needed. Just looked about 20 years out of date and not in great condition.\nWe are diamond Hilton members and have come to expect excellent service from Hiltons when we stay. The service was fine, but nothing special.\nWhat I *will* say is that the location is absolutely excellent and we loved being in a slightly quieter area than the chaos of Midtown. Also, I think the breakfast reviews are unkind. We ordered from the menu and found there to be a lot of choice and the food to be tasty and good portion sizes. The staff in the restaurant were friendly, too.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is dated and room was quite small. We were advised on check in that hospitality will try to refresh the room every day but if we specifically needed it done we would need to request it.  They do not put water bottles in the room, I don't think I have ever stayed in a hotel that did not supply bottles of water, but especially in New York in June when it is very very hot outside.  They do sell bottled of water but for $2.50 for 500ml. Thankfully there is a store on the same street where we bought our own. There is a drinking water tap on the same floor as reception, however they didn't tell us this at time of check in. We spotted it a few days later but the water is warm out of the tap anyway. \n\nThe lifts are an absolute nightmare and I really feel for people who were on higher floors than me, or those that could not manage the stairs at all. We were on the 11th floor and used the stairs mostly as the wait time at the lift sometimes was substantial due to only being 3 for 40+ floors.\n\nThe aircon was very strong, which was not ideal as it was right next to the bed which means you are either freezing if you leave it on overnight, or too warm if it is off.\n\nIn summary not quite the standard I would have expected for a Doubletree by Hilton hotel. The pictures definitely make it look a lot more modern and brighter than it actually is. Thankfully I had booked it very far in advance so only paid \u00a3450 for 4 nights. I had tried to amend my dates closer to the time but the price changed to \u00a3800+ so I kept it as it was.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

There are 5 major points we would highlight as leading to the absolutely abysmal review.\n 1. Service: the hotel staff have no interest in any of the guests and we actually had to call the front desk while standing in the lobby to so much as be acknowledged by them. \n2. Furnishings: the room we stayed in was in a terrible state - peeling wallpaper, scuffed furniture, dilapidated chairs, bathroom doors without handles, or staples sticking out of the carpet - the place looked and felt like it was pulled straight from the dumpster. \n3. Access: there are some 30-odd floors and rooftop bar in this hotel with just four elevators and no upward access stairs - on a Friday night we had to regularly wait 10-15 minutes before we were able to get into a packed elevator to access our second floor room. \n4. Noise. Whether it\u2019s the complete lack of soundproofing leading to us overhearing simple conversation in the room next door, or the sheer volume of the AC unit meaning we were unable to use it at night, this hotel isn\u2019t loud due to street noise - the hotel itself makes plenty to ensure you never sleep.  \n5. Water Pipes: clearly this building has been around for ages. As soon as we turned on the shower (which was covered in scuff marks and grime) we were affronted by the percussion section that was the pipes for our room. Good luck taking a quiet shower.\nAll in all, Hilton should be embarrassed to have their brand associated with such a poorly-run, shoddily-maintained, sorry excuse for a hotel.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This Doubletree popped up, so I booked on a whim. Location is EXCELLENT for this area of NYC, with premium access to Wall Street, WTC, and the NY ferry to Statue of Liberty. That being said, here are a few things to note from this experience.  \n1.) it is located on Stone Street, but you won't find it unless you actually are walking passed it.  The entrance and marquee are recessed from the building.\n2.) when you walk in, dont be concerned.  There is NOTHING of significant note that identifies you are in the hotel.  You must take 4 flights of stairs, or a very long wait for a lift\/elevator to get to the beautiful 2nd floor lobby.  \n3.) the lifts\/elevators are horrible. There are only two (technically three), which have capacity for about 6 people close together.  With 20+ floors, you will wait, and wait, and wait for an elevator.  \n4.) breakfast is on the ground floor in a very nice restaurant.  Even with Hilton Diamond status and food vouchers, expect to pay $12 out of pocket for two people (taxes, tip).\n5.) Rooms and hallways are typical urban: Compact. \n6.)

Room was OK but aim for a high floor if you don\u2019t want a view of an office. Negatives included only two towels in room for four - trip to reception (15 floors) to get two more. Room not cleaned for four days despite published promise to clean every two days - meant trip to reception (15 floors) to get more toilet tissue and then another trip on day four (15 floors) to ask for fresh towels.  Can\u2019t help feeling I have worked as hard as the staff team this week.  Just get the basics right - if you are putting four people in a room, four towels.  If you say you will clean a room every two days then clean it. The response from the receptionist on the fourth night was that this was my fault for not asking for the room to be cleaned \u2026. As I stated that it was not unreasonable to expect a room to be cleaned once during a four night stay I was told to complain to Expedia.  Complete indifference from the receptionist.  So if you\u2019re coming be clear at check in what you would like to happen during your stay - be controversial, ask for a bare minimum 2 Star service and you will get better than we did.  Hilton must be thrilled with the apathy at this hotel.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

Alg\u00fan huesped lleg\u00f3 a decir que esper\u00f3 \u00a140 minutos!.  No hay ascensor de servicio, por lo que los empleados deben utilizar el mismo.  Las habitaciones no se limpian ni por petici\u00f3n cada d\u00eda , hacen todo lo posible para que desistas de la limpieza de la habitaci\u00f3n , por lo que, considerando el tama\u00f1o de la habitaci\u00f3n, r\u00e1pidamente acumularas botellas vacias, vasos usados,  papeles en una papelera que rebosar\u00e1.  Consigue champ\u00fa y gel en cantidad, puesto que el servicio de habitaciones no repondr\u00e1 , a\u00fan cuando ellos mismos retiran el usado.

The location of this hotel was perfect for us having previously stayed uptown on our last visit. Walking distance to the brooklyn bridge, battery park, 9\/11 memorial and plenty of shops and restaurants.\nWalking distance to all subway lines and the hop on hop off buses station.\nCheck in was quick and easy, they do put a hold of $250 on your card incase you incur a charge during your stay. \nId read a lot about the lifts in this hotel and was dreading it a bit, on a short break I did not want to waste time waiting around for lifts however, the only time we had to wait a little longer than expected was on check in due to how busy it was. Not once for the rest of our stay did we wait more than a minute, we were on the 8th floor though so that might have helped.\n10\/10 for the housekeepers, room serviced, cleaned and fresh towels everyday, very happy and impressed with this after reading some previous reviews!\nOn to the room itself - quite small for two people, especially when the ironing board was out but we did not spend much time in there so not problem. Couple of drawers were hanging off and not useable but we only had a few bits as it was a short stay so we didnt mention it. TV was great, bed really comfortable and the shower was always hot, perfect. So why the 4*? Unfortunatly this is mainly down to inconsiderate guests. I think there is 10 rooms per floor, Therefore all rooms are near the lift and the door to use the stairs. We could hear the 3 lifts, we could hear talking, shouting, singing (fair enough at a reasonable time but im talking 3\/4am). Paper thin walls. When a door was opened in any room on the floor the walls in our room shook as the door slammed shut, which was often. The door for the stairs was even worse and that was next to our room.

We had to deal with 2 days of food garbage in the room. We also had no more space to use the garbage bins and we had no towels as a result of the lack of house keeping.  It was the biggest disappointed coming to a hotel room with garbage which wasn't cleaned and the scent of food because no one took out the garbage, it was disgusting. \n\nOut of the years I have traveled and stayed in hotels, I have never had a hotel neglect their customers in this manner. Its poor hospitality with a clear disregard for their customers. \n\nWhen you book a hotel, especially in New York City, you are spending a tremendous amount of money. Within the price you pay, you are also paying for your room to be serviced (house keeping), so its reasonable to expect your room to be cleaned, to be provided with fresh towels and have your garbage cleared. None of which happened here. 4 nights and house keeping just came once. \n\nI always go out of my way to tidy the room before we leave in order to make it easier on the house keepers, mainly because I think its rude to keep a room a mess for house keeping.

They told me to call in the next morning, which I tried to while on the train and they had me on hold for over 10 minutes...we were almost there, so I figured I'd just inquire once we got there.\n\nWe booked the room on the Hilton app, and it required our payment information so my father in law gave me his card info. NOWHERE on the app, or the confirmation e-mail did it say that we needed to bring the card physically for payment. When we arrived, we were told that we had to have the card physically present, and of course since my father in law didn't come with us, we had to get him to drive 20 miles round trip into his work to print and complete an authorization form with copies of both his card and ID, front and back.\n\nThe front desk person never got his e-mail reply, so had to call him back and got him to text the photos to me. The attendant said that wouldn't work. I asked her if I could print it on site, she said she couldn't guarantee it would suffice. Tried to connect to WiFi to print, but of course I didn't have a room yet, so I had to go back and ask for the password to print. FINALLY got it printed, she went away for 10 minutes then came back and said it needed to be provided 24 hours before check-in.\n\nAt this point I am LIVID, so she said she would not charge us for the room that day, but rather the next to satisfy the 24 hour rule. I had to give a physical card for the incidentals though, which posed another issue. What should have been $50 held, on my bank account it showed SIX DoubleTree debits @ $50.00 each...so $300.00!!! Because of this, I was unable to use my debit card during our trip...thank GOD I had cash.\n\nTwo hours later and almost missing the audition...the only reason why we were there, we got a key to a room. There's 44 floors and only 3 elevators so it took 20 minutes to finally get up to the room.\n\nWe made it to the audition and coming back I was insistent on not eating at their restaurant (we paid $60 for lunch while waiting for the above to get figured out...one $13 house glass of wine and two appetizers) so we grabbed Chipotle. My own fault for not checking, but they didn't give us silverware, I ordered a burrito bowl. Realized it after waiting the 20+ minutes to get to our room, and I was not going to waste another hour going back down and up to get one.\n\nI called room service to see if they'd send a fork, and they said they could but would have to charge us the 10% room fee. Insanity! Called the front desk and they happily obliged. An HOUR later, I finally got my fork.\n\nAfter we showered and tucked in for the night, I received a phone call to my room. It was the front desk letting me know that for some reason, they tried to authorize my father in laws credit card and it declined. I called him, and he was unable to reach his credit card company to see what was going on. He told me to have the hotel call him and he would provide another card. The front desk said that was unacceptable and if another card was used, he would have to go through that whole process again with the authorization form and the copies. How do businesses pay for rooms for their employees?!\n\nThankfully he was able to get in touch with the credit card company, and same as my debit card, the reason why it was declined was because there was a fraud alert since there were 4 debits from DoubleTree at $50, $100, $150 and $200. They did whatever was necessary to make the card be authorized, but WHAT A NIGHTMARE.\n\nStill livid, the next day I called Hilton to let them know of my experience and the person on the other line was a total idiot. He kept thinking I was not in my room yet and tried to connect me with the front desk, which of course at this point were the last folks I wanted to speak with. I then e-mailed my concerns and was basically told that was just their fraud policy and sorry about it. So much for their \"Care\" guarantee about doing whatever is necessary to make everything right! Nothing about this hotel visit went right.\n\nWe didn't get much sleep as the room we had didn't have blackout curtains, just sheer ones and the bright city lights shined right on through. I didn't want to spend $14 on pancakes for my daughter for breakfast so we escaped that awful place and experience the second we woke up, and will NEVER go back again.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I came last year and really enjoyed the location and staff. So when I booked a returning trip to New York, I fondly remembered this hotel and promptly booked two of my four nights here. \n\nWe arrived at 7am after a redeye and had very little hope that we could check-in early. Obviously, they pretty much laughed at us and told us to come back at 4 for check-in. They did offer to text if our rooms were available sooner. I thought that was a really great gesture and excellent customer service. \n\nWe return to the hotel at 330p because we had reservations we had to leave for by 4pm and were hoping to check in and change. We get to the front desk and were told that yes our rooms were ready an hour ago. We never received any texts or calls like we were promised. When I asked why, they apologized and said they must have forgot. Well gee thanks...\n\nAfter my last stay where I was on the 39th floor, I was grateful I was on the 9th this time. As I recalled, the elevators are really slow and I knew I wouldn't mind taking the stairs if I was on a lower floor. The room was nice but a little cramped, which is to be expected in New York. \n\nHonestly, this was a mediocre stay. Nothing bad and nothing great. I love the area and was able to get some great runs in because of where we were located. And the subway was easy to access. I was mostly happy after the rough check in up until the check out. \n\nWe are waiting for the elevator at 10:50am so we can check out at the 11am check out time and move to our next hotel. There are three elevators but for some reason there is only one opening on our floor. And every time it opened it was jam packed full of people and luggage. We were patient because we knew everyone was checking out at this time. By 11:10am I am no longer patient while waiting for an elevator. My friend took the stairs since he only had a duffle bag and went to check us out of our rooms so we wouldn't be fined for a late check out. At 11:20am my other friend was sick of waiting and took his suitcase and pushed it down the stairs. I tried to wait it out and get an elevator because I had a large suitcase, duffle bag, umbrella and purse. At 11:30am I was fuming. I had wasted 40 minutes of my day waiting for a friggin elevator and could no longer sit in the hallway reading my book. I then started the trek down the 9 flights of stairs with all my luggage just as everyone else had. It took me forever as I had to keep moving out of the way of multiple other people doing the same thing. When I finally made it to the bottom, I was angry, covered in sweat and carrying a now broken umbrella because it got stuck in the stairwell. \n\nNot one employee apologized or offered to help. Just one comment when I finally made it to the bottom of \"rough day huh?\" I am still baffled by this experience. I made an exception the first time with the elevators but I now understand the old saying \"fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\"\n\nI will not give this hotel a third try regardless of how much I love the location. The elevators are a joke and the lack of empathy from the employees is laughable. We had a much better experience at the next doubletree we checked into and only wished we had just stayed at that one the entire trip instead of subjecting ourselves to this nonsense.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

Make sure your confirmation spells out every little detail of what you  paid for because otherwise they will not honor it. \n\nI stayed in this hotel the end of September 2019. It was a last minute trip and was because I wanted to go to an event on Governor\u2019s Island.  I noticed that the Hilton Hotels offered a \u201cStay Longer Sunday\u201d on one of the Hilton websites it explained this meant you could stay until 6pm on Sunday.  I selected a Hilton Hotel that offered this. \nI drove to NYC on a Friday evening. I arrived to the promised valet parking and found nobody around. Finally a man appeared downstairs and rudely told me I\u2019d have to wait for the valets.  He disappeared, finally a more mannerly individual appeared to help me, and the valets finally arrived.    \nThe room itself was ok.  The bathroom is very badly designed \u2013 no shelves to put anything on so you end up having to pile everything on your suitcase outside the bathroom, the shower has a weather strip to stop the water getting out but it stops about 2 inches from the bottom of the shower so the floor was very wet.  There is no bath and the shower is tiny. \nIn the bedroom there was a drip from the AC unit \u2013 it was dripping onto the floor. \nAll of that aside it wasn\u2019t terrible \u2013 we got room service and the waiters were polite and the food was pretty good. \nThe reason I wanted the stay longer Sunday was because I wanted to shower after the event on Sunday, before driving home \u2013 so on Sunday morning we went to our event and came back around noon, ate and showered. As I was showering the cleaning staff knocked on the door. My daughter answered and told them we had bought the stay longer package.  I finished my shower, my daughter was showering when the downstairs staff called me \u2013 I told them I had bought the stay longer package \u2013 they told me they\u2019d need to see that \u2013 and they\u2019d need to see where it said until 6pm. Of course the confirmation only said \u201cStay Longer Sunday\u201d (I paid more for this option) but didn\u2019t say what time, so when I went down to show the confirmation the front desk woman she told me this didn\u2019t prove that it was until 6pm and normally they\u2019d charge someone an extra night for not leaving on time.  At this point I needed to get back upstairs so I told her I needed to pack and this had caused myself and my daughter a terrible amount of stress. She didn\u2019t miss a beat, was entirely unconcerned about what this did to us, the customer, she then questioned me for leaving my daughter in the room (my daughter is 12) unpleasant words followed and I returned upstairs to finish packing.  Not a hint of an apology, embarrassment, No customer service concern \u2013 nothing! It was basically \u201cProve it\u201d which, due to the confirmation that only stated \u201cextended Stay Sunday\u201d I was out of luck. \nAnother supervisor \/ manager type called me shortly after I got back upstairs, she basically restated what they had already said \u2013 they had no intention of honoring what I purchased my receipt only said \u201cStay longer Sunday\u201d but didn\u2019t say until what time therefore I should have been out of there by 11am. \nI actually had no intention of staying until 6pm \u2013 I had a long drive back \u2013 but I was hunted out of the room.  I am a middle aged, professional woman. I am quite sure I have never been hunted from anywhere before \u2013 it was a really awful experience.   Not only did I not get any form of an apology \u2013 they stuck to their guns and let me know I could have been charged for the extra time. \nA few days after I got back I started a chat with their customer service \u2013 and was expecting based on this chat \u2013 that they would contact me and apologize. Nope! Not one hint of that. \nThey had multiple opportunities to make this right and opted instead to not do that.  I understand that it\u2019s tough to get staff right now \u2013 but Hilton really needs to do better than that.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

We came to NYC for the weekend (2 nights) to visit with some friends, so access to the subway was key so we could easily meet up with others in our group who live all over the city.\n\nOther than a great location, the hotel is very clean and the rooms are pretty standard size for a city hotel. However, the bathroom was extremely small with absolutely no place to hang a towel, so even if you wanted to be eco-friendly and reuse your towel, you don't really have the option to do so. I couldn't do my hair\/make up in the bathroom because of the small size, but luckily there's a large mirror in the bedroom. \n\nThe closet had ample hanging space and included a safe. No fridge to keep though. Another drawback is that the air conditioner was very loud, and if it wasn't 90 degrees out I would have opted to turn it off, as the blowing woke me up every time it started up in the middle of the night.The gym is severely lacking but it does the job. Two treadmills and one elliptical, but one treadmill was broken so that was disappointing. \n\nYou seriously need to leave your room at least 10 minutes before you need to be anywhere because the elevators are SO SLOW. Like painfully slow. \n\nAnother weird thing is that the reception is on the second floor and there's no one to greet you on the first floor. I found this a little unsafe, especially late at night, as anyone could wonder in off the street and go to any floor without a keycard. \n\nOverall, very average hotel. If you're only going for a few nights it's okay, but any longer probably wouldn't be pleasant with the elevator issues, small bathrooms and possible safety concerns.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

To my surprise, my card declined to function in London the next day and while examining I found that an amount of $1971.96 has been charged to my card once again which has resulted in massive inconvenience (in addition to $150 which is still not returned)\n\nI wrote back to Hilton customer care the same night (8\/29) and within minutes they replied stating that I shall get a response within 3 days. Just to let you know that now it is over 7 days and one has bothered to get back to me even after multiple follow ups. Although the amounts are pending with merchant for clearance, the frustration and inconvenience caused due to the irresponsible behaviour by Hilton staff is truly deplorable.\n\nMistakes can happen, however this amounts to tormenting if you are travelling with family and kids\u2026.

Pulizia delle camere da rivedere, come anche la qualit\u00e0 della biancheria, bucata o sporca. 3 ascensori per 44 piani sono un problema - pi\u00f9 di una volta siamo saliti al nostro piano a piedi attraverso le scale di emergenza.

The AC unit was a nightmare. It was so noisy and antiquated that it barely cooled the room and I had to use ear plugs in order to sleep. \n\nThe elevators are a nightmare....only 3 serving 44 floors! The layout of the hotel is also a nightmare. Reception is on floor 2 and it's a bun fight every day trying to get from the ground to the 2nd and elsewhere within the hotel. No amenities as such. \n\nBreakfast is hosted in the adjacent restaurant. Worst Hilton breakfast ever. Not only was the choices on offer extremely limited, but the scrambled eggs where so dried up they resembled yellow cow pats. The serving dish didn't close properly, which added to the problem of the eggs drying out. The chef certainly knew about it as he kept trying to push the lid down to close it. Interestingly enough they are awaiting a food hygiene standard rating....personally I know what I would award them!  The tables weren't properly set with cutlery and teaspoons had to be requested. The melon wasn't ripe, the things that looked like a scone could be used as paving bricks. It all seriously yuk, apart from the bananas which had not been tampered with. On a positive note, the coffee was quite good. \n\nAll in all it is a fairly rubbish hotel located in a good area. Best it's demolished and rebuilt. Would I recommend it to anyone....no, unless I really disliked them. ","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}
{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1858923,"title":"False advertising and too many problems","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-08-15","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"The location of this hotel is great, with a station for the R and W trains on the same block, and access to the 1, 4\/5\/6, and Staten Island Ferry nearby. I also found the staff friendly and was pleased with the housekeeping service. However, the main room was tiny, with only a narrow passageway around the perimeter of the bed. And the bathroom was small as well, with no counter space to speak of - and I travel light. All of this could have been OK - it's NYC after all, there's no need to spend a lot of time in a hotel room. But I'm a very tall guy, so when I book a Cityview King Room - and the view of WTC was great from the 40th floor - I think it's reasonable to expect a Standard King mattress, not what I have determined to have been what is referred to as an \"RV Short King\" mattress. My 79\" height belongs on a standard Queen or King mattress, with 80\" in length, not the 75\" RV short king. And I checked the Hilton website to be sure and, no, this non-standard mattress is not disclosed in the description of the King room. It says there's a 32\" TV, but can't be bothered to be honest about the short bed. Although the mattress and pillows were comfortable, I woke up with sore feet that didn't get proper rest from walking the streets of Manhattan because they were hanging off the end. The fundamental purpose of this hotel room - rest - was defeated by this. Don't lie to people about the mattresses in your hotel rooms.\n\nAlmost as frustrating is what it took to get out of the hotel every morning. The other reviews on this site - and I read them thinking, \"It can't be that bad,\" - are not exaggerating about the amount of time it takes to get an elevator down, especially in the busy morning hours. There are only three elevators - and small ones at that - to service a 44-floor hotel with nine rooms on each floor. Many people end up getting on an up elevator and then taking it down as that's the only way to get out of the hotel in the morning, so no matter what floor you're on, you're taking a risk at getting down to the lobby. If someone is already on the elevator with luggage because they're checking out, not only does that mean there likely isn't room for you on the elevator, but even if you can squeeze on, it's going to definitely stop on the 2nd floor - where the reception area is - rather than going straight to the ground floor. Why is that extra annoying? Because if you squeezed on a full elevator on floor 40, it's still going to stop at almost every 2 to 3 floors for other people who are calling the elevator, and you're going to have to be rude and press \"door closed\" to try to make it move any faster at all. Again, this sounds like an exaggeration, but it's truly a nightmare. Especially in the heat and humidity of August - the A\/C is minimal, if at all, in the elevator.\n\nA friend of mine in NYC says, \"You get what you pay for in New York\" and this hotel proves that adage very true. It was one of the cheapest hotels to book in the area through Hilton's website, and now I know why. I prepaid for the room to save even a few more bucks, but while my credit card was charged for the prepaid room at the time I booked, and I agreed for a $50\/night deposit to be put on my card as a pending charge to cover incidentals - standard hotel business - what I didn't agree to was to have my card have a pending charge for the price of the room THAT I'D ALREADY PAID FOR. When I spoke with someone at reception about this, they acknowledged it was an error that shouldn't have happened, but that there was no way it could clear until I checked out after five nights. I didn't take a trip to NYC expecting not to spend money, but to have that much money tied up on one of my credit cards for my entire stay was ridiculous and rude.\n\nI have stayed at Hilton properties all over the country and while no hotel is perfect, I have generally been able to rely on consistency throughout the Hilton brands. This hotel was a big dent in my confidence.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

My complaints are about environmental issues. The first thing the desk staff does when you check in is hand you two plastic bottles of water! Plastic water bottles are quickly destroying the environment, AND NYC has delicious tap water, so there is absolutely no reason why this hotel should be handing out water bottles. There are cups in every room that could be used with the tap. Also, every morning after I showered, I hung up my towels, since the little card said that they wouldn't be replaced if they were hung up. Yet, every day, I came back to my room to find that the used towels were taken and new, clean towels were left in their place. After two days, I just left the Do Not Disturb sign on my door and refused the housekeeping. What a waste of water to wash all those towels after only one use, and what a shame to make your guests think you care about the environment, when you actually don't. I strongly encourage the management to reconsider its policy of handing out plastic water bottles to all guests, and to start implementing the laundry policy that is actually advertised.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

There are issues which other people have mentioned such as everything being a little cramped (which is understandable in NYC), the lack of a fridge in the rooms and the limited number of elevators leading to long waits. However, the main problem for our stay was noise from outside. We had been up since 3am travelling and really needed an early night's sleep but an open air restaurant\/dance bar opposite the hotel started playing music really loudly from 5pm until past midnight. Obviously you expect a bit more noise being in NYC but this was ridiculously loud. We complained to the front desk, unfortunately we couldn't be moved to a higher room (we were on floor 16 of 44), but they did provide us with ear plugs and said that they would send over someone to ask the bar to turn the music down. Unfortunately this didn't seem to have much effect and we finally fell asleep in the early hours of the morning. We were then awoken from our unplanned but very necessary lie-in early by people using the elevators which were just outside our door. At this point we decided we couldn't face another sleep deprived night and checked out a day early. The hotel is in a very useful location and it's not their fault but it was definitely too loud at night for us.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We get ready to go down, packed all our stuffs back to our bags ( to make this short) we brought the bug to front desk and let them know what transpired, my friend left in the room to finish packing and checking out stuffs. The front desk offered to change our rooms, I didnt make a scene and asked them to simply make it right, instead we were given a room in 14th floor with access not working. Messed up room was hot, ac not working at all. I filed a complaint and they told me it will take 72hours to respond. Well I'm only here for one night. I complained about having a full bed when they know it's two people in the room. They said no two bed so no choice, everything was full. I said did u guys check? This has stressed me so much that I can't rest since we wont fit in a the mattress so I asked for them to make this right, hot room same bed size as before, they gave me a comforter and I use that to sleep in the room that I paid for 135 USA plus taxes about 140-150 for a four star? And not even four star. I asked in my complain for refund if I will be stuck in this room. Again they apologized and said no upgrade. We will see if they refund me since overall this place has bug.

Check in was fine and was excited about the free cookie and the high floor, but as soon as I entered the room it was all downhill. There was a smell to the room that i was trying to figure out. The tv was a wall mount that couldn't stay up. It kept falling down. I noticed that the AC was leaking water. I called the front desk and was put on hold for 5 minutes with no pick up. I hung up and went down to the front desk. I told them about then issue and they said they would contact and engineer to come fix it. I went out to enjoy the city and when I came back from being out I noticed that the AC was still leaking water into the room. The floor was soaked. And I mean soaked. (Now I know why there was a smell to the room when I came in). That whole night it was a rotation of sleep, dripping water, and clicking from the AC. I could not sleep all night. The next day I was a miserable person. Not the way I thought i would be spending my vacation. I called down again and told them of the issue. They sent someone up to fix it, but the room smelled and the carpet was soaked. I went down and told the from desk and they said at first they couldn't move me because they were booked. (45 floors with approx. 10 rooms on each floor.) I found that unliking, and of course they were able to put me into another room on the same floor. I would recommend that no one stay here. Horrible rooms and bad customer service. At the very least they should have moved me immediately without any questions and offered me a refund for my stay.

I rang multiple times to check room accommodations, even the night before my stay. I paid in advance with the school credit card and completed the tax exempt form. While on the phone I wanted to make sure one of the rooms could accommodate 3 teenage boys. I was told only king size rooms were available. So to solve the problem I asked for a roll away bed. I was told over the phone- no problem. On arrival, I felt like my reservation was an inconvenience. It took a while to find my reservation and when I asked about the rollaway I was told that due to storage restrictions they do not have any at the hotel. The hotel was full and therefore they didn\u2019t have any other rooms to accommodate the three boys. I asked to talk to a manager. I waited 20 minutes and then asked the manager to call me. She did call and I was told that a room maybe available late tonight if a cancellation comes in. We lucked out. A room did become available, for one night only. Now I had 5 rooms on five different floors. Yippee! Fun at curfew! \n\nAfter the first night we checked out of the room we were given. Later in the afternoon I talked to another person at reception about our situation and asked what was the plan for night two. He asked me to explain what had happened because there was nothing in the computer on our reservation. I explained and was told the same thing that I was told the previous night. Totally full hotel. No rooms available and no rollaways. This time I felt my situation was falling on deaf ears and when I asked for a managers name who was on call that night, no name was given until I asked which business card should I contact. I asked if I could have more comforters and pillows sent to my boys rooms so they could sleep on the floor for one night only. The receptionists said they will send some bedding up. I gave the room number and they questioned it. I told them to look at my reservation to confirm the room it\u2019s needed for. \n\nI am so upset that a 17 year old kid that paid to go on their first trip to NYC has to sleep on the floor because of a lack of communication and blatant bad customer service from a hotel chain that we as a family are gold loyalty members of. \n\nThe hotel is 44 stories tall, the elevators take forever so ask for a lower room so you can use the stairs. Don\u2019t expect employees that actually can accommodate you because their hands are tied and because of a lack of accommodations in the financial district they really don\u2019t care.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We were greeted by a very terse check-in attendant named Venetta who was extremely rude to us. Practically yelling to us \"That check in is not until 2pm.\" We kindly asked if there was a  possibility to see if she could check to see if any rooms were ready. Again we were yelled at by her \"Can't you see that Im very stressed out here! You need to wait and see when the manager arrives!\" We asked if she could give us an indication as to when the manager might arrive. \"I don't know!\" She yelled, \"Maybe in an hour - maybe in two hours?\"  We sadly backed away and took our bags to the bell desk to be looked after while we went and found some breakfast. After this, we went back to see if this manager had turned up. He was there and we asked if we could check in early and he made everything look so easy. He found us all rooms that were available and checked us in early. \n\n2) Check out:\n\nWe had other issues with the hot water, and this occurred at our final morning of checkout.\n\nWe needed to check out at 5:00 for a 14 hour flight. Each of us set our alarms at 4:00 so we could shower and prepare to leave.\n\nMy room had NO HOT WATER - it was freezing\nMy two other friends' rooms had ONLY HOT \/ BOILING WATER.\n\nNone of us were able to take a shower before we departed to the airport.\n\nI was the first to the check out desk and made a small complaint. The check out attendant apologised and offered to add 1000 points on my Hilton Honour account. \n\n2 weeks later and this hasn't happened.\n\nMy friend checked out and made a small complaint and the checkout attendant apologised and offered to contact expedia (who we booked with) and provide a small refund as compensation. The same occurred with our friend in the third room.\n\nNone of this has happened and I feel sad that we were lied to by the desk staff.\n\nSo overall, a great hotel but we had a horrible start and finish to the experience.

I questioned the fact that I had a booking that was confirmed, and was told \"I'm not sure what to tell you\" and was offered an opportunity to come down to talk about it further, but there was nothing that could be done.

I had to manually force it to close shut. Also, the shower was leaking water out on the floor and soaked the entire floor towel we had down and I almost slipped getting out the shower as well. \n\nLastly, one of the main reasons my wife loves Double Tree is for the amazing soft warm chocolate chip cookies.

So I call down to the front desk and the woman informs me all is well and that I would need to do nothing else . The next day after working and being out most of the day we go back to the room only to find that the key does not work. I go back down to the front desk- let me note there are only 3 elevators for a building with over 40 Floors. We get there again we are waiting for an additional 16-20 minutes so they can figure it out and find out if my personal possessions are still there or had been moved ??

The location is perfect in that it is footsteps from a subway station and walking distance from any building in the financial district. Check in was quick and the staff (Luis) was able to make a room change for us quickly and without any hassle. The rooms are small but this has to be expected for a downtown location in any city; however they were clean, contemporary and well furnished. \n\nThere was some maintenance issues that were never fully resolved, the sink faucet has to be run while the shower is on to keep the water hot, the bathroom fan ran constantly and the solution was to disconnect it and there was a deep crack in the shower floor which could cause cuts if you were not careful and for that I took off half a star. \n\nThe breakfast was a let down. While the staff were pleasant and attentive, Fernando was particularly good at this job, under cooked eggs to order were more a health hazard than a morning welcome and overcooked hot buffet food made the place feel like a cheap motel. even with free coupons for the week, my wife and I chose other local options such as the starbucks round the corner or one of the fantastic breakfast foot carts within eyesight of the front door. Again for this I took off l half star.\n\nA final note is to give praise to the door staff all of which were friendly and always had time for a quick chat. Hopton was especially helpful with his morning greetings and informed us of (and arranged for) the airport shuttle which we did not know about and this saved us time and stress.\n\nDoubletree is not a hotel that should be passed up and with a few minor updates and changes it could easily compete with other more expensive locations.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I stayed at this hotel in 2009, and I expected to find the same experience.  I was disappointed. \nCons: \nRoom size:  I must have stayed in an upgraded room before, because, even though I had a King Size room, the room was extremely small in comparison to my previous room. \nExtra Amenities: There is nothing special, here.  If I were traveling for a company, I would feel short-changed, as the only little extra here is the warm cookie, IF you go downstairs to ask for it.  \nSurroundings: Unfortunately, there is construction near the hotel; so, that messed with the appearance of the street on which the hotel sits. \nCons: \nCleanliness: Housekeeping does a great job.  My only complaint is that I saw the bowl full of some mushy substance sitting in a corner right outside my room for two whole days and nights.  Even though I mentioned it to an employee at the desk, the bowl remained there all night and the next day.  ...frustrating.  \nEnvironment: It is very quiet, there.  And, although the hallways are extremely narrow and almost every room seems near the elevator, I didn't hear any noise--either from the street or elevator--when I was in the room.  \nDining:  It's pricey, but there are several places to eat, in the area.  Be prepared to pay dearly for the best dining experiences in the area; however, there are some sandwich shops and coffee shops, in the area as well.  \nEssentially, I do believe the hotel was well-priced, but I believe management needs to step things up.  There are too many similarly-priced options--both in this area and others--for me to ever consider staying here, again.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We did not expect our room to be ready by the time we arrived and left our luggage with the best front door person ever Allen. He should be called Director Of First Contact as he is really a great ambassador for the hotel.\nWhen we arrived back at the hotel at the agreed time the room would be ready, it was not. It only had . to be checked on cleanliness and such. The lady at the reception would come to us one that was done. It should not take more than 10-15 minutes according to her. Only the lady did not come to us. Even worse, she ended her shift and left without informing us at all. By this time we already waited for more than 30 minutes.\n\nBy the minute my wife got more annoyed and I was not a happy person. After almost an hour I went up to the front desk. Nobody acted as if they were up to date with our situation. This despite the two gents behind the counter being there when we walked up almost an hour prior.\n\nThis infuriated me and the front desk manager was called for. I explained to her the situation and she was apologetic and very unhappy with this treatment. She rectified it by upgrading us and providing us with breakfast and a dinner voucher.\n\nThe room was nice; a bit dated though and soem things were loose or not properly fixed. We were already happy that we finally had a room.\n\nThe next day we used our voucher in the Italian restaurant at the ground floor of the hotel. After dinner we paid with the voucher and left a cash tip. The latter despite very bad service from the waiter who had more eye for four girls sitting at a table near us. He was trying to impress them and we could overhear him fibbing. (you do not leave the great country of Albania to become a waiter in New York when you have this great life and make so much money in Albania).\n\nWhen we left the restaurant and were waiting for the elevator this same waiter came up and demanded more tip. When I told that I had given him enough for the great service not rendered he threatened us that he would take the full amount on the hold by the hotel and more. \n\nYou can tell me anything. I am big boy, been in war situations so a guy like him does not make me feel uncomfortable. My wife though is another story. She is all for kindness, harmony and more. She felt so uncomfortable that she started hiding stuff in the room in case he really would access the room and take stuff. Also she did not want to go for breakfast anymore since that is in the same restaurant and she wanted to avoid a confrontation in case he would be working the breakfast shift too.\n\nWe sent an email to hotel manager. He called us back as we requested. He implied he was not happy with the situation and would come back to us. The manager never came back. We went for breakfast elsewhere.\n\nOverall the hotel is reasonable. It is more three stars at most (service rendered by Allen are five stars).\nWe probably would not go back. And do not count on the hotel manager as he will not follow through his promises.\n\nWhen you decide to stay in the hotel avoid the overpriced Italian place. Go next door to the Irish pub. They serve better food at more realistic prices. In the weekend Barry is on staff and he is a blast. (the owner Dennis is not bad either, he knows all about black and white movies)\n\n","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The layout of the hotel is inconvenient when traveling--you have to open a door to enter the hotel (this may be temporary in colder temperatures), then go up a floor to the lobby.  This would not be a problem if you didn't have to wait and wait and wait for the elevators.  Taking the stairs is not an option with bags and checking in\/checking out.  However, I have never seen so many hotel guests taking the stairs with me than at this hotel.  Upon checkout it took > 10 minutes to get an elevator on a Sunday morning--I was concerned we would miss our flight, and by the time the elevator came to our floor, it was almost always full. We also experienced issues with the internet being out for a day during our day, which was inconvenient.  The rooms are also very small, even for New York.  It would be nice if the bathroom had any space to put items--just a very small shelf.  Can hooks be added to hang clothes or towels?  It's impossible to even put down the hairdryer in the bathroom--more storage in the bathroom would be helpful.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

In that respect, convenient.\n\nStaff at lower elevator lobby were courteous -- always a welcome.\n\nGood breakfast in lobby restaurant for Honors members.\n\nI had booked my room six months in advance.  I booked a high floor, river view, away from the elevators.  (I am Hilton Gold, and my profile has for years said away from  the elevators.)\n\nI got to my room.  Arrived right on time -- no last minute check-in where rooms might have been limited.  No river view.  View of the cooling towers of a nearby building, plus the rest of the skyline.  Right across from all three elevators.\n\nRoom was very small.  And then there was the smaller bathroom.  Shower stall -- no exaggeration -- was only 24 inches wide.  I am not a large person, but showering meant constantly bumping my elbows on the walls.  A person of size would have a very difficult time fitting into that shower.\n\nHalls on guest room floors are so narrow that two adults cannot pass without turning sideways!\n\nStaff team leader William did, per policy, check with guests about their satisfaction, so I met with him in the lobby.  He admitted that some rooms are very small.  (Why would you put a Gold Member who booked six months in advance into one of those rooms?)\n\nHe did follow up on the river view issue.  His explanation was that, when you use the HILTON App to check in, it apparently overrides the booking instructions you made and just assigns you a room.  I did not choose a room with the system -- just let the App assign the room.  (Again, why would the hotel's App assign a Gold Member to one of the smallest rooms in the hotel?)\n\nLesson: DO NOT use the App to check in!\n\nSo, overall, I always hesitate to give a low rating to a property, and truth be told, the room and facility were clean and modern.

The Doubletree Financial District offered really reasonable rates for Labor Day weekend, but I'm afraid I learned why after my first evening there.\n\nHaving taken a redeye flight from the West Coast, I arrived at the hotel at about 8 AM on the Friday of Labor Day weekend.  I knew there would be little chance of having a room available to check into so was prepared to check bags with the valet and come back to the hotel in the evening to officially check in.  The front desk very generously offered me a voucher for free breakfast buffet in their downstairs restaurant since no rooms were available.  They did not have to do this -- was a very nice thing to offer.\n\nI returned to the hotel at around 8:30 PM, ready to finally get into my room.  There was a line of guests stretching from the elevators to the front door of the hotel.  The hotel has an odd layout where the front desk and lobby are on the 2nd floor.  But what was causing this huge backup was the fact that one of the three elevators was out of service!  For a 44-story property, three elevators isn't sufficient so when one goes down, the entire hotel basically grinds to a halt.  There was no valet downstairs so I could not pick up my bags.  I walked up the stairs to the lobby to pick up keys.  The front desk told me that the valet would eventually bring up my bags, but to be please be patient due to the situation with the elevators.\n\nAbout an hour later, the valet arrived with my luggage.  I was actually pleasantly surprised it was only an hour as I was expecting worse.  Luckily, I wasn't going anywhere else that night so I didn't have to deal with the elevator situation again.  I went to sleep assuming that it would be taken care of by tomorrow.  Unfortunately, the third elevator never went back into service so my entire weekend was spent with 15 - 20 minute waits for every elevator trip.  When your room is on the 28th floor, taking the stairs isn't really an option.  Needless to say, it's extremely inconvenient to add an extra 20 minutes into each trip on the elevator.\n\nTo the hotel's credit, when I wrote to complain about how the elevator problem really made the weekend more difficult, they offered a sincere apology and Hilton Honors points.  It's a tough situation for everyone, but the hotel really needs some work on it to have it meet Doubletree standards.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

The rooms were fine and cleaned daily. I will give a special mention to Ramses with his knowledge of New York, Simone, Harry, Tony and Tina who were extremely friendly and made our stay even better than it was. Also the hotel were extremely accommodating, even though the booking agency had got one of our rooms wrong and there was nothing they could do about it- my advice book with the hotel direct!! The hotel's location is superb and there is is subway just 2 minutes away. Chinatown on Canal Street  is 40 minutes walk away off Broadway. Also the free Governor's and Staaten Island ferry is just a few minutes away too. Wall Street is just around the corner where you will find Starbuck- I love the coffee! and lots of place stop eat. Tony, we had a fantastic ride back to the airport and thanks for making us laugh Harry- You are all stars. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and we will definitely be using them again when we visit. By the way the rooms varied in size but were comfortable and normal for rooms in financial districts- trust me I have stayed in a few.. Only missed a fridge, hence the 3 stars instead of 4 star hotel, as used to fridge in the 4 and 5 star hotels I say in, but air conditioning will keep room cool enough for most mediations, unless it has to be kept in fridge like insulin.

The rooms and corridors are narrow and never saw a reception in the second floor of a hotel. There is no place for you to park during check-in (ok, that\u2019s NYC, folk) but you literally enter the hotel from its back.

That looks good, except for the fact that the receptionist didn\u2019t ask any questions about who\u2019s entering the room with me, and that seems a very serious issue concerning the security of the hotel. It looked like you can bring in whoever you want.

I stayed for 10 days, and not once was I able to get either down or up on the elevator in under 20 minutes, This was the average wait time just to board it, The entire staff uses the same elevators including all the housekeepers and workers. Not once do they offer to wait, They just push them selves into it.\n But here's the real problem, On 7\/14\/2018 in the morning while in the elevator heading down with 8 yes 8 other people it stops around the seventh floor. It was stuck for over 30 minutes, with zero ventilation or air able to get into then elevator. The alarm in the elevator and the fire department also located in the elevator didn't work. Luckily we had phone service, One of the phone's called the  front desk, Who was of zero help, She told us that this is the first time that this happened (Which is actually a lie, As the Bellhop the following day said it gets stuck all the time) She mentioned that it would be less than 5 minutes before it was running again, So after 25 more minutes we told her to call the fire department, As even oxygen was getting scarce, and panic had set in we asked the front desk to call the fire department in which she actually refused to do. So we called on an additional cell phone on our own, Just as the Firetruck was getting dispatched the elevator moved, We all got off the very next floor and walked down the stairs.\n I had such a horrible experience that I checked out a day earlier than I was supposed too and stayed in a different hotel.\n Zero compensation or even an apology were never extended my way.\nI dont want to even get started on how terrible the Breakfast Buffet was.\nI will never stay in this hotel again.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The subway is quite close and within walking distance. \nLets start with the good things: \nLobby \u2013 very  nicely done it looks very professional and clean. It\u2019s a good welcome to the hotel itself. The staff were very friendly and professional. \nOkay here goes the bad things. Bearing in mind that I have spent time in many Hilton hotels over the years and have been a diamond member. These have been at varying levels of cost and quality. \nRoom \u2013 Standard size, same amenities that you would get any Hilton. Coffee machine which is fine, the linen was old and did have a whole in there. The iron needs replacing and ironing board also. The air conditioning is loud and I believe was damp on the carpet underneath. There is one sofa seat as well. There was no bath but shower which had decent pressure. The sink was too big and there was no place to put my shower gels, etc. \nFood \u2013 When I checked into the hotel bearing in mind it was my first time in new York I was actually quite excited about the breakfast and food in the hotel. I checked the menu in my room and was really disappointed to see it was standard menu that you would find in the uk. To add the menu was in such a tatty state, it was falling apart. In the morning I went to check on the breakfast. The food is served in a partner restaurant at the bottom of the hotel, I have not been more disappointed in hotel food in my life. There was a very limited selection of food, for the hot food, there was scrambled eggs, cardboard bacon, bad sausages and pancakes. There was no fresh rolls or croissants, the fruit seemed to be canned.  I should have known that there was something wrong after there was no one in the restaurant for breakfast in the morning. \nLifts- There are only 3 lifts in the building and they are constantly in use by the guests and the staff. The staff (not the receptionists or public facing staff) use the lifts themselves even if there is only one level for them to go. They could easily walk this but I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t. They are constantly busy and at peak times you can wait for 20 minutes for the lifts. \nOverall a good location but that\u2019s about it, unfortunately I have been told that hotels in New York are expensive but I expected more from a hotel that costs over 200 dollars per a  night. I would not stay here again and cannot recommend it to anyone.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I switched it out with little resistance from front desk.  Then, when I took a bath, (my solution to a cross country flight) I was interrupted by knocking at the door and a man's voice.  I ignored, they continued, I got out and told them to go away, I hadn't ordered anything.  I was a little frightened. I returned to the bath, anther knock, and a few more. Again I told them to leave.  They said it was security. Now, I would think someone would call first, before sending two different men to a room with a single female occupant. No way am I answering that door, especially still dripping from a bath. I called the front desk and they said the room below me had a leaking ceiling and they had to check the room. They said they had called first... but I heard nothing. The phones are weird so who knows.  They offered to send a woman from front desk up with the man but said they did need to check the tub. I decided instead to vacate the room. They called me shortly to say it was ok and fine to return.  After I complained and asked to cancel my next night, which they refused a refund for... they instead offered to switch me to another room, with a view, and complimentary breakfast. Overall, it is fine. These things happen.  But I would not stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I stay at Doubletree and Hilton properties regularly - and this is the worst one I've stayed at.  \nPros: \n1) Room was relatively clean \n2) Bed was comfortable.\n3) Breakfast at the restaurant next door is good (and included in some reservations).\n\nCons: \n1) Elevators are SO SLOW...  and the lobby isn't on ground floor... so every time you need something, you wait for the elevator and then get off on level 2.  then wait AGAIN for ANOTHER elevator to go to your room.  I timed it last night.  It took 7 minutes to get from the ground floor to my room because I needed to stop at the front desk to pick something up.  Absurd\n2) Rooms are TINY... you can barely walk around in them and 2 people cannot pass each other in the room.  Even by NY standards - it is SO SMALL\n3) Noise - we had to move rooms because the screeching from the broken plumbing in other rooms was so awful we were up all night.  They told me they didn't know what we were talking about - but then 2 other guests in the elevator said they had also been complaining.  The old plumbing needs repair.\n4) Poor staff service.  Other than the manager (who I corresponded with on text... not in person); the staff were not helpful or accommodating.  And to be honest, the manager could have done more to help with the absurd noise our area of rooms was dealing with.  One of them actually SCOLDED me for losing my breakfast ticket\/voucher.  What am I, 5 years old?  \n\nJust stay elsewhere - this hotel is the pits.

We chose the hotel mainly because I know the Doubletree brand and also the location in Lower Manhattan is good. \n\nThe location is definitely the high point - right by Battery Park, the hotel is ideally situated to explore Liberty, Ellis and Staten islands and the financial district. We spent an entire day doing this. There is also a subway station at the end of the street for exploring the rest of the city. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and courteous throughout our stay. We had a view of the Freedom Tower from our window which my son loved. \n\nBut the hotel itself is a little disappointing. The decor in the rooms is very tired and in need of a refresh. The air-conditioning unit is effective but incredibly loud which makes it difficult to sleep at night. So you have a choice of the 35 degree NYC humidity or being kept awake by the rattly AC. \n\nThe lobby is on the first floor (American second floor) so the welcome on the ground floor is underwhelming. There are only two lifts so the wait is sometimes really long - 10 minutes plus, which when you're on the 32nd floor is tough. \n\nThe restaurant is not actually part of the hotel but a separate restaurant next door with an interconnecting door. Don't waste your time having breakfast here - there are tons of much better places to have breakfast a short walk away. Pearl Diner, on Pearl Street, would be my top recommendation as it's an original American diner where nothing has changed since the 1950s. \n\nOverall the hotel wasn't worth what I paid for it.

On arrival which was late around 2am they were 2 staff at the front desk checking in no line just myself and one other couple came up to the 2nd floor where the lobby is located. I had the less competent of the two as she could not seem to get me situated. The couple was dealt with by the other lady within 5 mins and about 3 more people came and left after that and I was still waiting. Eventually I was told the room I booked(King Room city view) was not available so I was placed in a room with 2 double beds for the night and given complementary water(2 small bottles) and breakfast. \nThe next morning I had breakfast. It was nothing spectacular and not a very wide selection. The basics fruit,toast, bagels, pancakes, pastries bacon and tater tots and a few other things. \nGot to check out of my room the next day and into the room I booked around midday. The room had a slightly smoky scent when I entered. Also the heaters in the bathroom took a lot longer to kick in. Like 10 mins for the shower to heat up. The other problem I had was with the temp control. I tried to turn the ac down a bit since the room was getting too chilly and then it just went kaput and started blowing hot air. After like 5 mins of trying to figure out on my own or waiting to see if it would readjust on its own I got frustrated and called to have maintenance come check it out. They came about 15 mins later by that time it was just overbearing. And that was on the same day I was getting ready to check out and trying to get all my stuff together didn't improve my mood. \nChecking out was a lot smoother however I checked my online banking to see I had been charged more pending than was on my booking so I made an inquiry and sure enough they had the wrong rate by an extra 20 a night which is an extra 40 a night in my currency which is A LOT. I'm not sure it would have been changed if I didnt draw it to their attention. \nThe best staff were the guys at the entrance. A special mention to Allen who was super helpful with my luggage. \nOverall for the prices in NYC I need the service to match and I was let down by the service at Doubletree.

At one time.. out of the three elevators only one was working. There was a line for the elevator out the ground floor all the way up the block. Not sure why the hotel has not addressed this issue. Like I said its been the talk of multiple reviews. Another thing is the rude front desk. Another common issue. If you don't like your job you should probably should find a different job. Just standing there to check in  multiple people were angry with the front desk service. Ok. Now on to  the room.Our first room was on the 37th floor. We had to change rooms due to the air conditioner leaking water all over the floor. Sopping wet all around the bed. The carpet was had mold. So this had been going on for awhile. The air conditioner grill was broken and  only half of the unit was blowing air. The air blowing out the vent... too smelled like mold. So after going down and talking to the front desk girl, she was rude and said they didn't have any rooms available. My wife started to get irritated. She finally got us a new room but it wasn't ready yet. So we left and came back later to another front desk clerk. This one was very nice. She told us that she was putting us on the top floor. I guess these were newer remodeled rooms. This is were we stayed the rest of our stay. Not to say that there weren't issues but we dealt with them. Hair left in the shower after the maid cleaned. Also she did not restock anything. Shampoo. Ect...The phone didnt work. The TV was acting funny. also the long wait on the elevator... Like I said we just dealt with it.

The air conditioning unit made more noise than the traffic in midtown and that\u2019s saying something. \nAfter arriving yesterday, severely jet lagged, and before going out for some things, I asked for a small fridge for our room. No problem was the answer - there would be a fee - also not a problem. I bought some things that have to be cooled only to arrive back to hear that there wasn\u2019t a fridge available but I could keep some things in their fridge on the 2nd floor. \nThe problem with so many floors\/rooms and the elevators had been well documented so you can understand that I wasn\u2019t happy having some things on the 2nd floor with me on the 22nd floor. \nBreakfast is in the adjacent Italian restaurant. What looks romantic in the evening looks completely different in daylight hours. After going in I was told that I had to have a voucher for breakfast and that it should have been given to me at check in. So back upstairs with the s l o w elevator only to hear that it had been forgotten at check in. Back downstairs in the s l o w elevator. The buffet gives the impression it is an after thought. It\u2019s all bit uncared for. The backroom in the restaurant definitely needs a makeover, everything is a bit dingy. Unfortunately that is where the buffet is set up. \nWe are here for another couple of days and hope that it gets better.\nOn a positive note, the staff is friendly, the rooms are clean, the bed is very comfortable and the tv is good but further for me it is all a bit outdated and tired.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

While you're over there, check out the wonderful local shops for coffee, home goods and gifts, local hangouts and views of the water.

Room size are average for NYC.  Largest issue is the elevator situation.  You need to take the elevator from the ground floor to the second floor lobby for checking in and then again to your floor for your room.  That is fine, except there are only three elevators and the hotel has 30 or 40 floors with ~10 rooms per floor.  It can take a solid 5 minutes, which becomes worse during peak mornings, especially on a Thursday where people are checking out.  It isn't necessarily a deal breaker for the property, but something to manage.  Also, in case you were wondering.  The stairs are really convenient as they are very steep, but it is an option.  Mind you not with luggage and also in the mornings there is typically trash bags waiting for collection from housekeeping.  If you do go, I suggest a low floor.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":1858923,"title":"Meh","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-04-28","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We stayed at the DoubleTree recently for 5 nights. We chose the Financial District because my daughter\u2019s apartment is very close to the hotel. The hotel location is indeed great. There is a Duane Read just around the corner as well as a Starbucks, Chipotle, Broadstone Bar & Kitchen (we ate there twice\u2014it was great) among many other interesting bars, coffee shops and restaurants (it is NYC after all). There were some good things about the hotel and bad things. I think the bad things outweighed the good. While it wasn\u2019t a horrible experience, I\u2019d probably look elsewhere for my next hotel.\n\nFirst the good. The bed was comfortable. Overall the room was clean. Our room had a nice large LG flatscreen. The price was good. The staff was great. As mentioned, the location is great. \n\nAnd the bad. If I could offer only one piece of advice: make sure you get a non-adjoining room. When we first arrived and got to our room, within 30 seconds, the first thing we noticed was the loud talking, TV and singing coming from the room next door. Turns out we had an adjoining room that has a door between rooms. So there\u2019s essentially no sound insulation because of that door. We could actually make out what our neighbors were saying (which included some obscenities\u2014yay!). I immediately went straight down to the front desk to see if we could switch rooms to a non-adjoining room. Unfortunately, they were apparently booked that day and couldn\u2019t switch us. But, we were able to switch to a quieter, non-adjoining room the next day. \n\nWe got a king sized bed and my feet hung over the end of the mattress. I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d. This must be a NYC thing because the rooms are so small\u2014the same thing happened at a Holiday Inn Express in NYC just recently. I found that odd.\n\nAnother odd thing: the only bedside electrical outlets are up next to the raised bedside lights. If you take a look at some of the traveler photos, you can see the bedside lights I\u2019m talking about. So, in actuality, if you\u2019re charging your phone, camera, smartwatch, what have you, the cord will be hanging down towards the bedside table. If you have a short cord, this could make charging awkward.\n\nAs mentioned by numerous other reviews, the elevators are hit or miss\u2014usually miss. In one instance I had to wait about 6 minutes for an elevator. Now, in the grand scheme of things, 6 minutes may not seem like a long time. But take the opportunity to stand there, wherever you are and set a timer for 6 minutes. It\u2019ll seem like an eternity if you imagine you\u2019re waiting for an elevator. By the time the elevator arrived and I got to the ground floor, there were perhaps 15 people waiting for that elevator. \n\nAlso note that the front desk is on the 2nd floor. This is not immediately clear when you enter the hotel from the street. We entered, went to the elevators, then, confused, went back outside and thought maybe the entrance with the front desk was around the corner of the building. We asked a staff member outside and they clarified it\u2019s on the second floor. So we went back in, around to the elevators, and sure enough there is a sign on the wall indicating that the front desk is up one floor. Reading other reviews, we\u2019re not the only guests that had this problem. Perhaps they should put a big floor sign, right when you walk in, indicating that check in is on the 2nd floor. \n\nOne of the worst things was the bathroom. There\u2019s practically no counter space. There\u2019s a small 2-3 inch or so ledge around the raised sink and a small glass shelf above the toilet, half of which is taken up by a tray featuring 3 tiny bottles of soap, shampoo and conditioner (which no one will probably use). That\u2019s it. And the cramped shower (just a stand up shower\u2014not a tub\/shower combo) had very low pressure and the door wasn\u2019t sealed properly so after each shower, I was left with a small puddle of water on the floor. And the lighting was horrible. If you\u2019re in to mood lighting I guess it\u2019s OK. But, if you\u2019re trying to do make up or something, good luck!\n\nThe air conditioner was loud, dirty and the front grill was hanging on by a thread. I tried to brace it to stop the knocking and rattling, and the grill fell off. \n\nLastly, when I checked in on a Saturday for a Saturday - Thursday stay I was told it was actually 2 reservations and that I would have to actually \u201ccheck out\u201d Tuesday. Not a real checkout. We didn\u2019t have to change rooms or anything. But I had to go to the front desk on Tuesday to \u201ccheck out\u201d and I guess check back in. All they did was take my key cards, update them, and then hand the same cards back to me. Then I was good until the real check out on Thursday.

We had a parking package that despite confirming on check in and check out I received a charge posted to my AMEX a few weeks later..... so just be sure that you check your bill!\n\nThe electricity went out in our room because someone had moved the phone from the side of the bed to across the room and either maintenance or housekeeping never bothered to repair the problem.  The staff was pleasant enough, but the whole property just seemed to be poorly run.  Breakfast was my chosen HHonors benefit but when you got down to breakfast they pointed us off to a mediocre breakfast buffet being attended to by a fairly inept waiter.\n\nThe room was small and the bathroom was VERY POORLY appointed.  I'm not sure who designed the bathroom but it had a very low sink with practically no place for 2 people to place toiletries.  There were no towel bars and the shower had no accommodation for someone to shave their legs.  The shower had55 one tiny little corner shelf that was totally inadequate and they didn't even bother to put a foot rest in for a lady to use to shave her legs.  The only forethought put in to planning this bathroom was to save money!\n\nThis is without a doubt the worst Hilton property I have ever stayed in my 25 plus years  of being a Hilton member.

As it turns out, the reception is on the 3rd floor which I found very very odd. The reception was however nice and the check-in was quick and efficient so I thought it will be all good. Well, not really.\nThe 3 elevators are VERY slow. It takes ages in the morning to catch an elevator that is not full yet - which is really unconvinient especially if you got to be somewhere on time.\nThe room was small which I did not mind but the bed really bothered me. I had a king sized bed but my feet were still hanging off at the end of the bed. I suspect that due to the size of the room, they turn the bed to the side and push the length side to the wall.\nAt night time, I could hardly sleep as a weird noise was coming from the bathroom (almost like the cistern was constanly filling up with water).\nAfter my first night, they did not clean my room, even though I left the room at 8.15am. The next day, I wanted to put the sign of \"Cleaning please\" outside my door but there is not such sign in this hotel.\nFinally, drinking water does not come with these rooms. I ventured to one of the floors that has an ice machine, hoping that the machine would also give filtered water. No luck there.

The staff were all courteous and friendly, especially Tony at the front door.  You'll get to know him very well because you will be waiting an age for the elevators.  Three tiny lifts to serve such a tall building is almost a running joke in this hotel among staff and guests alike.  You will never get a free run to the ground floor unless in the middle of the night and the problem is compounded by guests floor hopping ro use the ice machines.  Rant over...the elevator service is dreadful.

Staff were all friendly.   Location is excellent.  Only a couple minutes walk from battery park (visiting Statue of Liberty).   \n\nBreakfast in the restaurant was not very good.  It is typical small- mid size buffet selection but they were often out of key stuff.   You had to ask if you wanted anything.   Including water or a refill.  \n\nNote that checkin \/lobby is on the second floor.   Elevators are on the small side.  Only two worked during our time there.  A third was being fixed.   This led to LONG wait times for the elevator - even when not full.  I waited about 15 minutes to get down.   And I was able to get on the first one.   This is especially true in the morning rush time.   Other times the wait was less than 5 minutes.   \n\nOut first room they have us was occupied.

The desk is minimalist in size, I would prefer a larger desk, but it is workable.\n\nThis hotel practices energy efficiency in rooms lighting to a fault.  I couldn't get a confident read on color matches anywhere in the room!  Some hotels only provide one bright light in a room, this hotel managed to provide no bright lights.  Ironically, the best light in the room was the ceiling light over the door entry!!!  I found that to be an odd priority with respect to lighting.  If I was managing this hotel, I would replace some of the bulbs with efficient, higher light output versions.  It would make a big difference.\n\nThe bathroom mirror was well designed with respect to providing even lighting without shadows, with long diffused lights on the right and left side of the mirror.  The bulbs just aren't bright enough, emitting more of a glow instead of illuminating the area brightly. \n\nThe sink is way off center from the mirror lights.  The sink is nearly aligned with one of the edge lights, resulting in an inconvenient shadow if you are using the sink (such as one would be when removing makeup or shaving).  \n\nThe shower was nice.  My particular shower had a couple of issues, however.  The drain was very slow, so during the shower I ended up standing in a deep puddle (nearly high enough to flow onto the bathroom floor).  The bottom 3 inches of the shower door were missing the splash seal, so that a significant amount of water escaped during the shower and created an inconvenient puddle on the floor outside the shower.\n\nThe phone in the room was filthy - the housekeeping staff needs to be trained to to wipe off the phones periodically.\n\nI was awakened at least twice each night by noise in the hallway.  Apparently the door doesn't seal out noise very well and falls short of what other hotels in the class accomplish.\n\nAs others have noted, the elevator situation at this hotel is less than optimal.  The building is relatively new, but apparently had a poor architect that didn't think that a service elevator was essential (or centered sinks!).  During the day it is not uncommon to have a staff member with a cart consuming a significant portion of the elevator.  Just be prepared during peak times (such as 8am-9:30am) to wait excessively long for an elevator.\n\nDespite the issues I have listed above, otherwise the hotel does a good job.  The door staff was very helpful and attentive.  The location was excellent.  It was an easy walk any where I needed to go.  I would stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This hotel only has 3 elevators to serve 44 floors leading to long wait times. Also, the staff use the same elevators to take loads of garbage down to the ground floors, to move furniture from floor to floor, etc. This means elevators are sometimes full of staff rather than guests and they don't exit the elevators to allow guests to use them.   2. There are only ice machines every 3 or 4 stories so you have to either wait for elevators or use the stairs to access an ice machine unless you are lucky enough to be on a floor with one.  I was using the stairs to go to another floor to get ice when I came upon a group of malodorous people having some sort of meeting in the stairwell. They grumbled as I squeezed by to go up the stairs. I did not use the stairs again and I warned my wife not to move about the hotel without me being present.  3. I noticed unsavory looking people outside the hotel smoking while sitting in nearby doorways or sitting on the steps of the near by subway station. I later found myself on the hotel elevator with some of the same people!??  4. As you'd expect, the bathrooms are small with only a small glass shelf above the toilet. If you are not careful, items can fall in the toilet.  5. My final advice regarding this hotel is you may want to check on the internet regarding this hotel as you may find some interesting things about it that staff can't tell you.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"NONE"}

We didn't bother to complain about it while we were there.\n\nIf you're a man over 6 feet or are traveling with a man over six feet tall, you may want to find other accommodations. My fianc\u00e9 is  6'7, and his feet were hanging off the end of the king sized bed.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":1858923,"title":"2nd stay at this property, not as pleased as 1st time","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-01-15","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"This was my 2nd time staying at this property.  I was not as impressed as the first time.   I was greeted upon arrival on Sunday, 1\/14\/18 on the street level by a long line of people waiting for the elevator.   Some had been there for a while.  In a building that is 44 stories there has to be more than two elevators working especially in the evening when many people are arriving. Because of the hotel's layout with check-in on the second floor, that means two waits to get up to my room.   After a while I gave up on the elevator and made my way with heavy suitcase, laptop, and another item and schlepped up the steps to the 2nd floor lobby, where yet another several people were camped out waiting for the same elevators.\n\nI was checked in quickly since I had bypassed those who were still downstairs waiting.  My Hilton Honors Diamond status was recognized with 2 water bottles.  Although I had checked in a day ahead and selected a room on the 30th floor, staff had upgraded me to the 44th floor, which I believe is the highest.\n\nThe room was again what one would expect in NYC.   Tiny with best use possible made of the space available.  Bathroom leaves noplace to put down any toiletry bags or the items themselves.\n\nGood night of sleep and minimal noise from outside at that altitude.  However, the heat could have been a little quieter.  Controlling the temperature of the room was fairly easy once I got the hang of the thermostat.\n\nIn the morning, I could not get hot water for a shower.  It was ice cold despite the fact I ran it for 20 minutes.  One negative aspect of the shower is that where the only door is placed, one has to put their hands through the flow of water to turn the shower on or off or adjust temperature.  That made it more uncomfortable since it was very cold.\n\nWhen I checked in, the front desk assured me that breakfast would start at 6 AM. I even verified this knowing it would be a holiday, and they said yes it would be open.  So around 6:30 I took another elevator ride to the ground floor lobby, to find the restaurant closed.  Back upstairs again , and then I went down again at 7 AM and it was open.  I was able to partake of the buffet quickly and be on my way.  The food was good, and I appreciated it being on the house.\n\nUpon check-out, I told the front desk about the water issue, and I was told that it was known that the 44th floor had a problem and that maintenance was addressing it.  That would do me no good, since I was already leaving.  I did not complain about the elevators, since the evening crowds waiting for it had to be witnessed by the staff the night before.  I did receive an apology for the water temperature as I scratched the dandruff out of my hair and heaved my luggage back down the stairs to the ground level to avoid one more elevator wait.\n\nThere  are many hotels in this area, and generally those in the financial district are better priced than Midtown.  If you have nothing to do but wait for elevators, this property comes recommended.  Once you do get to the room you paid for, it is comfortable.  It's also easy to get to from subways in the South Ferry area.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

We got a beautiful view of....buildings.\nI called the hotel right after booking through TravelZoo to mention that we did submit a request that we will be on our honeymoon. The hotel said it's not in their notes and will get that added.\nAlso that we might be arriving around 9am, can we check in early if a room is available - the answer was absolutely!\nWhen we called from the airport asking the status of the room, we spoke to LaTonya and she was very curt and dismissive - we don't have a room available and there is nothing she can do about it, and hung up.\nWhen we arrived at 12pm, no honeymoon notes as well. We checked in and went up to the 44th floor, only to find the key card was not working. So, another 15 minutes waiting for elevator, down to 2nd floor lobby, and... just too tired to even explain.\nAnd we got a plate of fruits for our honeymoon. Fruits. Really?\n\nStructure - What you see in the page is NOT the entrance of this hotel, it's the WINDOW of their restaurant.\nThe entrance is on the side, congested. And the restaurant is congested, the lobby is on 2nd floor (strange) and you guessed it, congested.\n3 elevators for 44 floors and they are not programmed to run simultaneously. So, unless you wake up super early and return super late, expect to wait at least 15 minutes for the elevator.\nNot to mention the running elevator will stop at all the floors where people want to get on, and the worst thing is if you want to go to the lobby, you have to get off on 2nd floor and wait another 15 minutes to get to the ground floor. \nWith large bags, the elevator can squeeze in 3 people.\n\nCafe - they are very partial towards the business patrons rather than the tourists. No one really paid attention to us. The coffee was good though, never tried the food, cos the place was congested.\n\nHeating - the room was overly warm at night. We had the air conditioning down to 65F, but it did not help. We got up a couple of times at night to get water as the heat made our throats very dry.\n\nRoom - the carpet was very dusty, like it was hastily vacuumed and only on the major area of the room. My husband bent down to pick something that rolled under the bed and could not stop sneezing afterwards.\nThe coffee area only had 1 creamer.\n\nBathroom - I liked the standing shower, but figuring out the water temperature was a pain. It was either freezing cold water, or scalding hot shower. We never got the happy medium. we took scalding hot showers.\nThe shower gel and shampoo were Lemon Verbena scent and were in very tiny bottles, which were alright.\n\nTools - the hairdryer worked great, but there was hair on the comb that was in the little sack the hairdryer was in, so, that was gross.\n\nAccessibility - Great! Right down the street Staten Island ferry, Bowling Green Subway station, Statue Cruises. It takes 15-20 minutes to get to Times Square. There is Chipotle and a pharmacy right around the corner.\n\nAll in all, I would say, the cons outweighs the pro and I am not sure if I would book at this hotel again.

The cons related the overall design and condition of the building.  The entrance is very under whelming...in fact I initially thought I was using the service entrance, as the dim and narrow space contained linen\/service carts, and some checked luggage.  Fortunately a friendly staff member pointed me to the second floor lobby for check in.   As others have noted, the elevators are small, and it appears there are only two available to service guests for a 40 story building resulting, in long waits during peak periods.   Finally, the condition of the room left something to be desired.  While modern in decor and generally clean, it was definitely well used, with damaged bathroom and lighting fixtures, peeling ceiling paint, and torn curtains.   These items are not unusual for a well used hotel frequented by business travelers, but still sub-par to other Hilton properties I've had experience with.

Lift up to reception only two lifts very small and very slow which after a flight and long taxi ride not great. Always queues for lifts. It is evident this hotel houses homeless which a lovely to give those less fortunate a place to stay and very profitable one for hilton but you do not advise paying guests of this!! Check in was prompt then another slow wait for the lift to our room floor 23.. very dated decor rubbish on the corridor which was still there the next day. The room it's self dark and small. Bed a reasonable size but very dusty, dated and just not what I would call Hilton or double tree standards. Air con and heating were so loud. Also loud work going off outside the hotel across the street very late at night. Location wise good near subway and ferry and battery park. Also an Irish bar right next door and lots of other bars and places to eat. Lots of homeless people congregate with the homeless guests just outside of the hotel. We have been loyal to hilton for many years as usually hilton offers great hotels but lately they have just been a let down and not worth the honours benefits which are pretty poor anyway.

Room 4410. \n\nI'll start with the Pros: \n1) The bed is amazingly comfortable\n2) Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating\n3) Great location for exploring the FiDi and lower Manhattan. Close to subway stations and Brooklyn Bridge\n4) Delicious cookie upon check in - which was really nice after a long cross-country flight\n5) View was amazing! Hudson River view. \n\nCons: \n1) Elevators are small and extremely slow (3 elevators 44 floors and no separate service elevator for the staff, so elevators are sometimes full with carts). I intentionally picked a room on the 44th floor so at least I knew there would be room to get on the elevator. One trip up took 17 minutes (10 minute wait and 7 minute ride)\n2) Horrible smoke smell piped into my room - it smelled like someone was smoking a cigarette and weed in my room at the same time. Gross and unhealthy. \n3) Housekeeping did not leave new toiletries. I wasn't about to brave the elevators to go back to the front desk to get more, so had to forego washing my hair since no shampoo or conditioner\n4) Room and bathroom are very small - difficult to maneuver around with two people in the room  \n\nI read previous reviews, so I knew about the elevator and the small rooms.  I can live with that - I'm in NYC so those are realities.  What tipped my review to only two stars is the horrible smoke smell and the lack of toiletries.

Rooms are small but well laid out.  The bathroom is small but has adequate shelf space next to the vanity sink.  Water pressure and temperature were fine.   As others have noted, the air conditioning unit has a noisy fan; it also drips water on the floor which makes the carpet feel uncomfortably damp to bare feet near the window.  The view from our 40th floor room was pretty cool.  We had a corner room on the City View side (01 thru 07) and the new World Trade Center buildings were right in front\u200b of us, with glimpses of buildings further uptown and a bit of the Hudson River.  Elevator noise was not an issue and our elevator waits were not too bad.  Considering this was the lowest priced decent hotel room in Manhattan for our visit, we were happy overall.  Room Service did forget the coffee with our breakfast order, but brought it quickly when we asked.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I found a Double Tree Hotel in the Financial District. I like that area of Manhattan because with the Stock Exchange close by there is extra security in the area.   The front entrance was dreary. The hotel staff were friendly. The elevators took forever. I finally discovered that they didn't work if you want to go up, so I had to go down first before going up. The hotel room was reminiscent of hotels in the early 60's: dark, clunky furniture and tan, tan, tan color everywhere! The bed was extremely comfortable and if you want to have a place to sleep for a night, it did meet that requirement. I did expect cockroaches to come out when I turned out the light, so I slept with the light on. Needless to say, I found another hotel the next day.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This was the worst run hotel in franchise that I have experienced.  Let's start with the good, however.  Good location and nice bed.........that about covers the positives.\n\nThe lousy experience started upon check in.  The usual chocolate chip cookies the DoubleTree is known for were cold and hard.  Worse, the hotel which should have at least 5 elevator banks has 3 and one of them was offline about a third of the time.  We got our keys from the front desk and waited 5 minutes for an elevator.  We open 'our' hotel room on the 19th floor only to find a nice, older Chinese man that must have been given same keys a few minutes earlier as he was unpacking.  We apologized, waited another 5 minutes to get elevator and got another room on 20th floor.\n\nThe housekeeping person on our floor was abysmal and we had to tell front desk to have her come twice after not cleaning the room when we were out at brunch and walking around for 4 hours.  Front desk personnel were consistently surly and housekeeper did not speak a word of English.  I emphasized that girlfriend was sleeping one afternoon and not to disturb her.  When I came back I was told she was removing the sheets when my girl woke up.\n\nThe clientele also seemed very down market despite a price of $340 a night (including taxes) hotel was charging.  My girlfriend who is Brazilian and doesn't have a mean bone in her body, asked why there seemed to be so many 'homeless' folks in the hotel.  Gym was sparse so it was also hard to work out frustration with the hotel staff.  Unless you want an 'econolodge' experience at a Conrad price, avoid this hotel.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Really chose the hotel due to its location being near to where my sister lives and the fact that you can walk to so many places - Battery Park for the ferries, South sea ports, China Town, Little Italy, Brooklyn Bridge, Freedom Tower and the memorial pools and the Occulus. Also very near to subway station where you can catch trains to Brooklyn, Central Park, Times Square etc all reached within about 20\/25 minutes by train.\n\n I was slightly disappointed upon arrival at the look of the hotel - its above a restaurant with 'net curtains' at its windows that looked like they needed a good wash!! The hotel reception is on the second floor. We arrived at 2pm but sadly our room wasn't ready so we were told to leave our luggage and return an hour later. This meant taking our luggage back down to the ground floor where concierge looked after it for us. Upon our return an hour and a half later our room still wasn't ready and it actually took around a further 30 minutes or so until it was. The gentleman called Will on reception gave us a voucher to use in the restaurant below the hotel as an apology for the delay which was very nice and we used it one lunchtime and the food was very good. \n\nOur room was on the 35th floor with a view of the East river in between a couple of buildings. It was a very small room, the bed was very comfortable although the furniture was rather dated and although we were supposed to have a sitting area there was only one rather shabby desk chair. The room itself plus the bathroom were very clean and was cleaned every day to a high standard. I am a light sleeper so sadly I was kept awake by the ice machine in the corridor very near to our room  which would make noises during the night as it made ice. You would then get inconsiderate hotel guests wanting ice at ridiculous times of the night\/early hours of the morning. Although being 35 floors up you could also still hear car horns, traffic, dustcarts, builders working etc during  the night plus guests who don't give a second thought to letting their room door slam shut. Perhaps the hotel could look at ways of having the doors shut slower or quieter as that's very annoying. After three nights of being kept awake by the ice machine I asked if we could change rooms. Will once again helped us out and we were able to move to a room on the 6th floor where there was no ice machine. We did loose the view but I needed to sleep so it was worth it. This room was bigger with an armchair in addition to the desk chair which I had been expecting in our original room. It was also a room which had a connecting door to another room and I did hear the occupant of that room return around 1am one night and then make a phone call. I could hear her on the phone for about 20 Minutes. As previously said I am a light sleeper so maybe I'm just unlucky but again it's just another guest who doesn't consider their surroundings. \n\nOn a more positive note ALL the staff were really friendly\/helpful and the different concierge would always welcome you upon arrival or wish you a pleasant day\/evening when you went out. Will was extremely helpful. The lift situation as mentioned in other reviews was a little annoying but once we moved down to the 6th floor if it arrived and we couldn't get in then we would just walk down. This was no real hardship and we would have done the same even if we had been up as high as say the 10th floor. \n\nOverall the hotel was adequate for our needs and I feel that wherever you stay in a city like New York you will hear noise from outside.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Check-in was not a problem, and it was especially welcoming how the doormen greeted you upon arrival each time you went back into the hotel. I noticed that the room size and elevators were an issue in some reviews, but in my experience, I did not have much of a problem with this. The elevator wait time was around 2 minutes average for me, with the most being about 5 minutes. The rooms were small, but for staying in NYC and for the price, it was completely fine.

Ook Wallstreet is op amper 5 minuten wandelafstand. Het hotel zelf heeft mooie kamers met een goed bed en nette badkamer. Er is gratis Wifi. Voor de normen van New York is het een vrij rustige buurt met enkele goede restaurants in de buurt zoals Broadstone tegenover het hotel. en 1 straat verder de legendarische Fraunces tavern die iets prijziger is, maar hier kwam vroeger de eerste president van de USA Georges Washington over de vloer.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are clean and well appointed, wifi is good.  The restaurant (in the same building but not run by the hotel) was excellent -- I was pleasantly surprised.  If you want a different option, Fraunces Tavern is nearby.  An irritating thing about this property is that the elevators take a long time to arrive, and have no lights or bells to indicate they have arrive, or which way they are going.  So it's easy to miss them, extending the wait time.  Service personnel seem to spend a lot of time in the guest elevators.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-08-06","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"We were here for 7 nights and had a lovely stay.\n\nThe hotel is in close proximity to a subway station, bars and restaurants. It is also within walking distance to Battery Park and the Seaport areas.\n\nThe hotel staff are very friendly and will be happy to help if you do have any problems. All you have to do is ask and you will get service with a smile. They will always aim to please. When we checked in we were given warm cookies which are delicious and a nice touch I thought. You can also have complimentary bottles of water every day too.\n\nWe were not comfortable with the first room we were given as it was very small. I know it's to be expected as we were in NY however it would have felt, in our opinion, very claustrophobic for a 7 night stay. We asked for a bigger room and the hotel very kindly upgraded us on the second night once a bigger room became available.\n\nThe second room was lovely , very spacious and clean. We had a view of the river which was an added bonus. The room was cleaned to a very high standard every day.\n\nThe concierge staff are fantastic! They will answer any question you may have or sort out taxis for you.\n\nWe didn't eat at the hotel at all as we like to go out to explore the local area and we found some amazing places to eat. \n\nWould we stay here again? The answer would be yes without a doubt! \n\n* Not a hotel related issue but a little word of warning.....\n\nThankfully the hotel booked us a taxi through Uber on our way back to the airport. This was much cheaper than the traditional yellow taxis they have waiting outside of the airport when you land! The Uber price includes any toll or tip fees. The yellow taxi we were advised to get as it is a 'set fee' is not so set after all! The taxi driver insisted on a 25% tip on top of our fare. We travelled from Newark to the Financial District. We were made to feel very uncomfortable by the driver and did end up paying just so we could get out of the cab! Please don't get caught out like we did. A $125 taxi fare is not a good start to a holiday. Uber was around $80. ","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When I made the reservation I was not told that we would have to drive a block away and park our car in a garage and pay $80. Had I factored this into the room rate I would've just stayed at a better hotel with a garage in their building. What a major pain it is to walk in pouring rain with a heavy backpack and laptop bag and pocketbook (in  90\u00b0 heat ) wading through a sea of people to get to the hotel and then again when we headed back home. \nWe had a double room and it was fine. The best part about the room was the water pressure in the shower. IT WAS THE BEST. It felt great after a long day walking around the city. \nWe had some room service- club sandwich and shrimp cocktail- it was okay. \nI hated the whole layout of the hotel.  The reception desk is on the second floor. The elevators take forever to come because it's a 40 something floor building and pretty old. \n Next time I'm going to do a little more research and find a better suited hotel.
