The staff was extremely nice and helpful. The hotel is fairly centrally located on 36th street and an oasis of peace in the middle of this energetic city. Our room was on the eighth floor and very well insulated, we were not bothered by any noise at any time. The room is very large by New York standards and has plenty of storage space. We had two large suitcases with us and could easily store everything. the bathroom with walk-in shower was also equally good with very good water pressure. Around the corner from the hotel is the subway station on 34th which will help you travel in New York with great ease. We took the subway, leaving to the airport at the end of the week and it brought us to Jfk easily for just a subway fee instead of an overrated taxi price. The Empire State building and Macys are both just one block away. The central located Time Square is just a few minute walk and easily accessible via Broadway. If I have to mention a downside (which we didn\u2019t really experienced) it is the price-quality ratio, for the money we would have at least expected any kind of breakfast, but it did not spoil our enjoyment. There are plenty places on the street that you can choose and it gives you the  advantage not being tied to early morning wake-up, which is useful because you have to get used to the time difference during the first few days when you come from Europe. Yes!! Next time we would definitely choose the same hotel again it made our stay in New York very pleasant.\nWe advise Breakfast at the very clean and friendly Korean Cafe Joa Kitchen just next door. We enjoyed diner at the Keg Room, an Irish Pub one minute away in front on 36th.

If you have never been to New York and are looking for a quiet, safe, quaint hotel with an NYC feel look no further! Our stay here was excellent. From walking in the doors we knew we picked the right place. The marble floor and the decor was beautiful. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious. The bed and the pull out sofa bed were both comfortable. They offer free bottled waters at the front desk and have hot coffee in the morning, or there is a Keurig in your room,  and since it was winter time hot chocolate throughout the day, and even umbrellas if you need them. The location was excellent, 1 block from the Empire State building. While not right in Time Square, it was a short walk and the subway was down the block making for easy travel to all the sights further away. But we were able to get to great restaurants and shopping just by walking down the street. The Trademark restaurant that is attached to the hotel was excellent. I could not express how this hotel made my first trip to NYC even better. My next trip back will definitely be at this hotel.

It was absolutely humiliating. There was music playing and it had to have been obvious from outside that the room was occupied. When I put on a robe and went out into the hall to find out what was so important that she had to enter the room without permission she didn't even apologize. \n\nThe problems with The Executive started when we got to the original room on Thursday 11\/30. First and foremost, the room was insulting for the price point, but more importantly, looking around there were small holes in the ceiling and it just did not have the feel being worth anywhere near what we were spending. Within minutes I also found a hole in the frame of the window and cold air from the street was pouring into the room. I called down to the front desk and they were accommodating and moved us to a suite on a low floor for no additional charge. \n\nOn Saturday we tried the restaurant Trademark that's part of the hotel for brunch. It was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. Our server was completely overwhelmed and verging on hostile to us, other guests and the staff. I ordered the 'Eggs in Hell' and it was one of the worst dishes I've ever been served at a restaurant. I sent it back for the bacon egg and cheese croissant. The only saving grace of the meal was the manager that came in around 1pm who tried her best to turn things around for us. We didn't have to see the original server again and to her credit she really made the remainder of the meal excellent for us. Unfortunately, it was too late to salvage the visit and I wouldn't ever come back to the restaurant.\n\nBut all pales in comparison to what I described above. Housekeeping just bursting into the room after 8pm on a Saturday night at the absolute worst possible moment and then not even apologizing. If anything she seemed put out by the experience, herself. \n\nI worked with Nico at the front desk who, to his credit, did his best in a terrible situation. We were somewhat compensated for what happened but it was ugly enough that compounded with everything else made me just want to go home. It ruined the rest of the night and the trip.

She stayed the weekend before me and had an equally great experience. The staff absolutely went above and beyond for both of us. I was visiting NYC for a bootcamp that was subsequently cancelled. I had made arrangements in Brooklyn but had a horrible experience and could not sleep with heavy traffic noise and no security or locks on the doors of the accommodation and no wifi (Outsite). I had shared a room with my mom at Le Soleil the weekend before and slept great so I trudged back to Manhattan with all of my stuff to see if they had any rooms available to fit me in that night for a week stay. Despite being completely full, they were able to find me a room that fit my budget (that even included a view of the empire states building!) and took incredible care of me throughout the stay. The staff are so warm and personable and I just loved chatting with them. Everyone who works there deserves the highest praise. Le Soleil truly prioritizes guests experience and only hires the best of the best. Also, the location is AMAZING. This is a hidden gem that I secretly hope too many people don't discover so their prices remain extremely reasonable! Thank you so much!

I hated it. The front desk lady (can't remember her name) was the worst. She was loud and couldn't be if any assistance when I needed to cxl my booking because it was unfortunate that right after I landed in NYC at Midnight but needed to fly back home the next morning as my father had been admitted for surgery. I had booked the hotel through Priceline and spoke to agent at Priceline and was at the lobby while Priceline had to contact the hotel to do the cancellation. So, I could hear the front desk lady talking to the Priceline agent and was super rude. So, I asked to talk to her myself and she just wouldn't even try to understand the situation I was in but just being loud and saying no, there is nothing she could do. Not even politely saying what she needed to say. \n\nAnyway, the bedsheets were smelly as if they had not been changed from the past guest. The shower is built cheap as water just leaks on the floor. The rooms are super tiny, if you are claustrophobic I would say not to stay here coz you gotta remember the windows don't open either. The toilet clogged and they had to come fix it. \n\nOverall, it was UNPLEASANT stay. ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I'm going to address all the things that I look for in reviews of hotels, especially hotels in NYC, so that anyone looking to know the things I like to know, gets clear answers. \n\nLet's go inside-out. \nThe room- I stayed in an Executive Queen Suite. Although this isn't their lowest priced room, the rate was similar to regular rooms in NYC. Based on that comparison, this room provides more space than the average NYC hotel room. What I really liked was the separate sleeping and living room areas. Typically, a larger hotel room in NYC is just 1-room that's larger, so more space to move around, but no separation of the space, excluding the bathroom. But, this room is great to feel some distance from TV watching in the living room to sleeping. Really great for more than one person. But, even someone traveling alone (like business travelers) will appreciate not feeling like you are staying in a closet. The room was very clean with great decor, a real desk and nice size bathroom. The room also had a mini-fridge, which is nice for those NYC leftovers and snacks.\n\nThe fitness center- I care a lot and wish reviews were more specific than just saying, \"nice fitness room.\" This hotel had a decent size fitness room with several quality treadmills, a Peloton bike, free weights, and a multi-exercise strength machine.\n\nThe hotel staff and lobby- this was the friendliest and most willing to help hotel staff I have met in NYC. Some hotels have staff that say what they are told to say when talking to customers, but they don\u2019t convey warmth and helpfulness. Not the case with this hotel. Everyone from the front door men, concierge guy, to the front desk, had a welcoming smile every time they asked if I needed anything.\n\nLocation- if you use Amtrak (Penn Station) or want to be close to the heart of tourism in NYC (Times Square) this hotel\u2019s location is the perfect location to give you easy access to those sites without putting you in the middle of all the noise and traffic (both feet and cars).

Some considerable time was put into researching where to stay and Executive Hotel Le Soleil appeared to tick all of the boxes. \n\nThe positives: \n\nThe location is ideal for many of the attractions in New York and is within walking distance of most of them. There is a subway station close by for those attractions further away with regular services to Downtown Manhattan. \n\nWe were allocated a room on Floor 16 which has a good view of the Empire State Building. \n\nUnfortunately, this is where the positives start and end. \n\nThe room was in the main, clean and relatively spacious for New York, however the fully stocked mini bar (as described on the hotel\u2019s own website) was found to be empty and switched off. I enquired about this with staff however was simply told that the minibars are no longer stocked. This is an unfortunate example of some misleading advertising. \n\nFurthermore, we returned at 6pm after a full day exploring to find that our room  had not been serviced. The room was serviced when we made the request, but again, the daily complimentary water was not replenished. \n\nThe bracket to hold the shower in place was also broken. We raised this with 2 separate members of staff who assured us they would have an engineer attend to repair it, but this was not fixed by the time we left. \n\nThe most frustrating part of our stay was on day 3 when (due to extreme weather) we enquired about ordering in room dining. A menu was provided to us and we placed an order at 7pm for 4x items to be delivered. At 9pm these items had not arrived and we were told the restaurant were working on it. In the many 4 and 5 star hotels across the world that my wife and I have stayed in, never has in room dining taken 2 hours and then still, the order not arrive. We cancelled and gave up in the end. \n\nFor the prices charged, I simply cannot recommend staying at this property. Whilst the location is favourable, it is not worthy of the 4* status and you will find better service at other hotels across New York for a lower rate.  \n\nA shame, we will not be returning nor recommending. The small things make the difference but the hotel seem to miss that concept.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I used a white noise app at night for street noise, and our granddaughter said she didn't hear hallway noise at night.\nStaff goes out of their way to please. We will definitely stay here again next time in NYC!","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"NONE"}

We've been to NY many times and went for 8 nights this time. We chose to start our stay with 5 nights in an East Village hotel, before switching to Le Soleil.  We live in Vancouver, Canada, where we have the flagship Le Soleil, at which we have never stayed, but which looks lovely.\n\nWe arrived and immediately felt the more luxurious feel of the hotel with a dedicated doorman, and then being warmly welcomed by Louis at the front desk. We all first enjoyed the cold fruit-flavoured water in the lobby. There was a line-up at registration, and while we waited for our room to be readied (we were a bit early), we sat on the lovely lobby sofas and chairs.\n\nWe had challenges with entering our room digitally, and every staff member who saw us having difficulty in the elevator, at our room door...jumped in to help, including the cleaning staff! Louis was there every day of our staff and it was lovely to be welcomed by him. At our arrival on July 12th early afternoon, there was a young woman with glasses who was also helpful and so perky and welcoming--I wish I had taken note of her name. \n\nWe booked the executive suite of 1 queen bed and 1 sofa bed. We loved having the good-sized washroom (with a large shower) between our queen bed area, and the queen sofa bed where our 2 daughters slept. There are only 2 small negatives about this hotel, and one of them was that the girls said the sofa bed was just ok for sleeping. In contrast, our bed was very comfortable, and our room very quiet.\n\nAndrew at front desk was also very friendly and helpful. ALL staff were such! We'd also asked the help of the concierge regarding a visit to a park to which we had intended to take the subway, but he encouraged us to literally spend maybe $1 more per person and take the ferry. What a terrific suggestion that was--such an enjoyable, cheap and wonderful way to travel and enjoy the view.\n\nLe Soleil is so centrally located in Midtown. You walk out the door and it's close to restaurants, all the best shopping, and within walking distance to Broadway shows. We felt so fortunate to stay in such a safe and convenient area.\n \nMy hubby and I enjoyed happy hour at the hotel's restaurant, and were told we had to sit at the bar, which was just fine. We enjoyed the wings (delish!) and something else, but I've forgotten what it was, but it was yummy. The bartender and server were both great. Which leads me to the small 2nd (and only other) negative: the \"public\" washroom for the hotel is in the basement, so restaurant and hotel patrons go downstairs for the restroom.\n\nWe loved our stay at Executive Le Soleil, being welcomed every time we returned to the hotel, and feeling like valued patrons. We will stay there again the next time we return to NY!\n\nThank you kindly for the wonderful staff and for contributing to our great stay in NY.\n\nWarmly,\nMichael, Christina, Justine and Andrea\nVancouver, BC Canada\n\n ","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel staff was superb and tended to all of our needs.  When checking in at the front desk after a long day of traveling, my husband commented that he just wanted to drop off our luggage and get an ice cold beer.  Someone on the staff overheard him, asked him about his beer preference, and brought him a beer from the bar!  It was a great start to our fabulous stay at the hotel.  When asking the staff at the front desk for dinner recommendations around Madison Square Garden, where we were attending a concert, the staff provided an outstanding recommendation and called to make reservations for us.  The restaurant was amazing and treated us as if we had been long-standing customers.  When I needed to fax some documents, the hotel staff immediately handled it.  When I was trying to pour a glass of water from the lobby water dispenser (my hands were full) someone on the hotel staff immediately came to assist and helped me with the elevator.  Every day, we were greeted warmly by the staff and asked if we needed anything.  The staff went above and beyond to provide the best service possible and to make our stay in NYC a memorable one!  We would like to give special thanks to Shelley and Louis at the front desk, and Connor with the Trademark restaurant at the hotel.  They were terrific and made our stay so special.

We booked the Queen suite with a sofa bed in the separate, living room area. We tried to check in early (2pm), but our room wasn't ready. None-the-less, we were greeted warmly upon getting to the hotel, the bell staff helped with the door and stored our luggage so we can make our appt at the Statue of Liberty ferry.\n\nUpon returning to the hotel, we were offered cold, flavored water which was super refreshing after being out in the heat\/humidity. Our room was perfect, as we expected, with extra pillows and blankets for the sofa bed. It is worth mentioning that the sofa bed cushion was not the usual 3-4 inch variety we've seen at other hotels and my 10-yr-old even noticed it enough to say this is the first sofa bed she'd slept on where she couldn't feel the wires\/springs. It had a light-up mirror and a desk outside of the bathroom so I was able to get ready while the bathroom was in use. And more importantly, the hotel manager was so friendly and gave the kids chocolate every time he saw them, which made them feel special. I did not taste the chocolate but my kids assured me they were delicious.\n\nOn the day we checked out, we learned that our flight was cancelled and we were stuck for an extra 2 days due to weather. They kindly stored our luggage and let us use their lobby area and restaurant, while we were on hold\/on the phone with the airline trying to get our flight home rebooked. Although they had no availability, except for a penthouse suite, which was going to be available around 4-5 pm (departing guest requested late check out), they assured us that they'd figure out a way to have us stay. They ended up accommodating us at the penthouse suite, as a free upgrade from the regular suite price.\n\nTheir kindness and generosity lifted our spirits as we went through the unexpected travel disruption, and we enjoyed the extra time in the city. Special mention to Shelley, Sunil, Nikko, and the rest of the Le Soleil and Trademark (on-site restaurant) staff for taking care of us and turning a frustrating situation around. Our extended time in NYC was very enjoyable and we will definitely stay at this hotel again if given the chance.\n\nLastly, this hotel is 5 mins from the nearest metro station (34th and Herald), 7-10 minutes walk from Time Square, and very central to many coffee shops, restaurants and bars, and retail shops.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

In addition to this, the hotel staff were really friendly and we were made to feel welcome throughout our stay. There's a couple of excellent cafe's just as you walk out and turn left which are great places to pick up some breakfast etc. The hotel arranged a taxi back to Newark for us (our initial transfer was arranged free through booking.com) at a cost of $105 (cash)\/$110(card) which we also thought reasonable. \n\nThe only downside was that there are only 2 lifts in the hotel and given that we were on the 13th and 17th floors we sometimes had to wait a while to get to and from our rooms.

I stayed at the Executive Hotel Le Soleil New York for business and after a week at this boutique hotel I felt at home.  Hospitality is clearly this teams core competency.  First the hotel has very nice Keurig Coffee Makers in the room but no tea options.  I mentioned this to the front desk and the next day the team had left a note for me with a full box of premium English Breakfast Tea to meet my daily needs.  The week I was in town was particularly hot and the hotel AC runs on motion sensors which were shutting down while I slept.  I mentioned this to the front desk and they accompanied me to my room immediately and saw that the settings were set to shut down after 2 hours.  They changed this setting to 8 hours.  I mentioned while they were in my room I was working so hard that I was too tired to go out for even a pastrami sandwich.  30 minutes later there was a light knock on my door.  The Front Desk had the restaurant make me a few Pastrami Sliders.  I cried.  This simple act of humanity and hospitality was enough to cement my business at this hotel for my annual meeting in the city.  Look, I'm sure not everyone is getting a sandwich, so don't expect one, but note that these guys are paying attention! Its classic old school hospitality that has seemed to disappear. The hotel is very nice with bigger hotel rooms than most in the area.  It is very close to the subway which was good for getting me to my meetings and close to famous restaurants like Joe's Pizza and Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao.  They were also walking distance to Times Square and Broadway which is how I spent my evenings after work when I wasn't crashed out. They have a car service that you can book with the Concierge that will get you to the airport.  I loved my driver.  She was fun to talk on the way to Newark.

After looking at reviews, we decided to try out Executive Hotel Le Soleil. We were not disappointed! We\u2019ve travelled to the city numerous times and this hotel is by far the best we\u2019ve stayed at. We arrived at around 11 am and although check in wasn\u2019t until 4 pm, Andrew and Luis from front desk were super helpful and welcoming. They were able to find us a room right away on top of upgrading us to a suite at no additional charge. The suite was slightly bigger than what we had initially booked, with a king size bed. The room was very clean, perfect to accommodate both of us. If you are travelling as a family of 4, I would recommend the suite or an even bigger room (depending on how spacious you want it to be) as the room wasn\u2019t overly spacious. The window gave view to the street which wasn\u2019t an issue for us. The hotel was perfectly located for all of our sightseeing, only a 5-minute walk from the Empire State building, 15 minutes from Time Square. It was about a 45-minute walk from Soho etc. Juan, the Concierge was very helpful with some restaurant suggestions. Jamie, the doorman was also very helpful in giving us tips on how to get around the city quicker. Thanks to him, we know the city inside out.  This hotel and its staff are a gem. Definitely worth checking out! A big thank you to Andrew, Luis, Jamie and Juan for making us feel right at home. Peter and I are forever grateful for your hospitality, we will be back again. \n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There are a couple of bars and restaurants just a few steps away.   The bar attached to the hotel serves good food too.\n\nThe King room we had was very small.  (If the chair in front of the desk was being used, it was impossible to pass behind it)  but everything you need for a short stay was there.  If you want a room with a view ask for it when booking.  Ours on the 7th floor faced front and was probably the only floor with a high brick wall just two metres from the window which made it quite dark.   The views are probably at the back of the building.    \n\nApart from that, it was very clean and the bed was comfortable, although the quality of the bedding could have been better - the pillows in particular were low-grade and didn't have protectors on them.\n\nThere was a fridge with bottled water but unfortunately no fresh milk.   We British do like fresh milk in tea.   I'm sure it would have been provided by the excellent staff if we'd had asked.\n\nThe shower was very good and toiletries provided.  \n\n36th Avenue is not that busy compared to other streets around and we weren't bothered by any street noise.\n\nIf in NYC for the first time, I recommend taking the city tour by the hop-on-hop-off bus.  \n\n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Coffee\/ice tea\/spa water filled and properly maintained in the very welcoming and spacious lounge area.  Our room was spotless. We had great water pressure in the rain shower, and there was a nice makeup mirror, too! The pullout couch in our suite was easy to use and surprisingly comfortable. When we decided we wanted an extra blanket late at night, it appeared at our door promptly. Every single staff person we saw was friendly and efficient. We were able to store our luggage conveniently when we arrived several hours early to check-in, and they called to let us know when the room was ready and had our bags waiting for us. When our flight was delayed, they again stored our luggage AND made arrangements for a car service to pick us up (which was prompt and a reflection of the same level of service we received at the hotel). Special shout out to KERON for arranging everything, and SHELLEY for also going above and beyond and taking the absolute best care of us.

Luis (front desk) answered all my questions got in touch with Juan (consierge) to assist with mobility questions and I felt ready for our one day trip. When I arrived Luis knew who I was before I even said my name! He was extremely helpful and worked his magic for us. The bellhop Keron quickly jumped in to help with ALL our stuff. Latch, Chief Engineer came out to clean the side walk because I accidentally stepped on dog poop when getting my family out of the car. He went as far as to clean the bottom of my shoes with the hose! We arrived before check in so we left our stuff and heading out to explore the city. Shelly (front desk) helped get things sorted when my sister got back late in the evening to check into the hotel before me with a baby and our luggage. The room was great (including view of Freedom Tower) so was the location! If I'm ever back in NY, I'm staying here!  We will always remember this trip.

We couldn\u2019t figure something out in the room and he showed up in one minute.  He takes so much pride in the hotel and kept it going alone for two years when it was closed during Covid.  He was so welcoming and even told my mother if she is in the city next time and wants to pop in for a coffee and bathroom or to rest by fire in lobby to come see him.

It\u2019s a very nice hotel, with character and a small but beautiful lobby. The people at the front desk and the manager were excellent, professional but warm and welcoming. The free coffee and hot chocolate in the lobby were a beautiful and very well received gesture. If I had to comment negatively on something, it would be the quality (or maybe the old condition?) of the mattresses. Also, the bathroom door did not lock and it could easily slide too far into the wall, and the lack of a hand held shower head in the bathroom may be a problem for many people. The sofa bed, which was opened for my daughter, did not have the same quality bedspreads and duvet cover as the main bed. Why? Initially we had a room on the 6th but after complaining about the mattress quality we were promptly moved to the 13th floor ( room 1304)  and it was larger and much better, we could even see the tip of the Empire State Building haha! But the best of all is the location.  Walking distance to whatever you like, Times Square, Rockefeller, Whole Foods market, multiple subway stations, Grand Central Station\u2026 you name it. The concierge arranged for a taxi to the airport and kept our luggage until the trip.

Early Monday morning, I learned that the Billy Joel concert had been cancelled. I was devastated to say the least! \n\nThe excellent staff came to the rescue in a big way!! There is no question that I will stay at the Executive Hotel Le Soleil again and I will definitely share my experience with my friends and colleagues. \nBelow is a list of the individuals that assisted me including examples of their excellence. \n1.\tYadira Aviles \u2013 provided outstanding customer service and thoroughly researched entertainment options and excellent places to eat (Andrew\u2019s was delicious!). Sent me a beautiful note and LaMarca Prosecco (Sparkling Wine) to ease my disappoint about the concert. She does not miss a beat! She demonstrated a keen knowledge about the job, a natural leader, attention to detail and very personable with everyone she encountered. She represents the epitome of customer service, leadership, and hotel management.\n2.\tEranny Crisostumo \u2013 greeted me at check-in professionally and was very welcoming. Gave excellent advice on securing tickets to the Rockettes at a reasonable cost. Made sure that my Wi-Fi worked well and improved the efficiency of my cell phone service at the hotel. She has excellent work ethic, grace under pressure (at one point it became very busy), and outstanding professionalism. Her exceptional problem-solving skills and technological expertise should be commended.\n3.\tJuan Espinal \u2013 was very proactive in securing a taxicab for me during my hotel departure. Although it was very busy in the hotel lobby, Juan made certain that my luggage was safe and kept track of my taxi\u2019s arrival (I noticed he did the same for all guests). He was very detailed oriented and expertly ensured that the guests departed safely and efficiently. His communication skills, knowledge of hotel management, and professionalism were exceptionally executed.\n4.\tShelly Rosario \u2013 greeted me at check-in with a smile, professionally, and efficiently. She went above and beyond the call of duty to find a place for me to get a facial and tickets to the Rockettes. Very knowledgeable about the area regarding where to eat and where to shop. Her hotel management skills were exceptional because of her operational knowledge, communication skills, and flexibility in navigating unforeseen problems. She is a true professional and an exceptional leader.\nAll four of these individuals should be highly commended for their excellent work, knowledge, and dedication. Thank you so much for such a pleasant experience.\n","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

We absolutely loved the hot chocolate and water dispensers near the front desk!\nStaff was wonderful and accomodating at all levels. A huge thanks to JUAN for all his advice and help! \nWe stayed in an executive Queen suite with sofa bed. Suite was the perfect size with a large bathroom. Unfortunately the pull out sofa was not up to par. The mattress was paper thin creating a huge crease in the center. Very Very unconfortable for early teens to the point where they did not sleep. I have no problems with sofa beds in general but these were bad as stated in other reviews. For a family of 4,I recommend taking a room with 2 queen beds.\nFinally, the hotel is very clean, especially the lobby area. But some areas are a hit and miss. That was the case in my room when I walked in and found a Pepperidge farm cookie bag behind the bathroom door from previous guests. I would think a 4 Diamond hotel would have a quality control system in place...\nAll in all, I recommend this hotel for the premium location, the staff and charming atmosphere.

However, the photographs on Booking.com sadly were misleading on the size & lounge layout. I reported as such to reception, who immediately called management. Mitchell, the manager, kindly offered to move us to another room, however it would only be available for our 2nd night. So we enjoyed a comfy first night, with great coffee, and a complimentary bottle of Chardonnay. The following day Mitchell said we had been upgraded as a courtesy. He accompanied us to the 20th floor Decolette  Penthouse Suite! We were so impressed - such favour!  Double rain-shower, superb queen bed, lounge with huge couch, fully equipped kitchen, dining room & double floor-to-ceiling views of the city skyline!

Late at night parts of the area can be very sketchy. Hotel is in desperate need a face lift as it is far behind all of the new modern hotels in NYC. The rooms are normal to NYC standards but they lack storage space. The closets do not have much space for storage. Sofa beds are very uncomfortable for an adult. These sofa beds may work for young children but is extremely uncomfortable for a grown adult. When sofa bed is opened it blocks the doorway to exit the room which could be an extreme safety\/fire hazard. The Front Desk staff is amazing Special Shout out to Yadira, Eranny, Jaime, Nicole, Andrew and Meredith. They truly are special and care about their guests. Trademark offered great options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Overall the staff was great but the hotel could use some updating\/fixing.

Customer service is a top priority here and it shows.  I do a lot of business travel and I can tell you that the staff here is top of the top.  Doorman and Concierge were amazing and extremely detailed, friendly and on point.  Desk staff were welcoming, efficient and maintained security and privacy on each interaction.  Front desk answered the phone on on first ring and attended to all requests immediately.  A lot of great little restaurants and bars are along this street so it's easy to grab a bite or a drink 'close to home' if needed.\n \nNow for the 'ish-iness\".  Our stay was a family vacation weekend with my spouse and two tweeny daughters.  We booked an Executive Suite with a queen bed and sofa sleeper.  This is really just one room, there is no door separating the 'living space' from the bedroom.  But it's New York for god sake, so that's fine.  The bathroom had a pocket door that was off the track so getting it opened and closed took some work, so luckily we are no the type of family that needs too much privacy.\nThe biggest issue was the lighting.  Somehow there were three wall switches, but it was impossible to have one room light and one room dark.  So we just kept them all on and used the actual light switches on the lamps to turn off and on.  The 'living room' lighting is wall hung sconces so getting the kid's lights off or on required crawling onto the sofabed.\nOn our first night we realized the can light at the door did not have a switch to turn it off and this was in the 'living room' where the kids were sleeping. We called the front desk and they sent an maintenance guy at midnight to actually take the light OUT OF THE CEILING.  So that was the fix.  Staff and maintenance were great...but REALLY?  You have a light in a hotel room that cannot be turned off?  \n\nAnyway, that was it.  We loved our trip and the hotel was otherwise super lovely.  Lots of families staying there, but the room was so well sound insulated, we didn't hear a peep from anyone else or the street, which is saying a lot.  \nFitness room was clean and had plenty of equipment, towels and water.  Hotel restaurant and bar was great, but closed on Sunday which is a big ?????????\nI'd like to give 4 1\/2 stars but having to choose I went with 4.

In base al men\u00f9 scelto alla carte, l'eventuale sovrapprezzo dei piatti si paga a parte. I costi sono nel complesso mediamente alti, quindi in coppia, con la cifra corrisposta, si riesce a consumare, ad esempio, un toast all'avocado con uova in camicia e una spremuta d'arancia. Eventuale caff\u00e8 lo paghi a parte, ma lo sconsiglio, \u00e8 quello americano. Poco distante trovate pasticcerie o locali dove servono caff\u00e8 Illy o Lavazza. Sinceramente ho trovato il personale della reception non particolarmente accogliente: all'atto dell'arrivo neppure un saluto di benvenuto, nessuna spiegazione (d'iniziativa) sui servizi disponibili e sugli orari dei vari servizi, del genere Don't ask, don't say.

The room was cozy, but still felt luxurious. Meredith kindly answered all of our questions on the phone, prior to our check-in. All the front desk staff was so very nice and accomodating. They provided a microwave for our room and a couple of extra chocolates. These are the nice touches that made us feel like people, and made us feel welcomed. They accomodated my needs as a visually-impaired disabled person. The gym was fantastic. There are weights, treadmills, and a Peloton bike. Our suite was clean and cozy. We were on a business-related trip, but would stay here again as a quick getaway. It\u2019s a good place to stay if you don\u2019t mind walking to your destinations in the City. Although I do walk alot, I still think this hotel is in walking distance to everything. The lady who checked us out was also very nice and made sure our checkout was smooth. One last thing, the evening valet-person was kind enough to keep an eye on our car while we checked in.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Bagage wordt ook kosteloos apart gehouden op je laatste dag. Het hotel heeft ook mogelijkheid tot ontbijt, lunch en diner. Maar in de buurt van het hotel zijn ook veel eetgelegenheden.
