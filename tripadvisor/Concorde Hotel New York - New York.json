It is in a safe area & our room was quiet. (We had a room on the 27th floor which is why it may have been so quiet.) The hotel is close to Central Park and Rockefeller Center & a short walk to Grand Central terminal. Our room was clean, comfortable, very spacious, & had lots of natural light from the windows. Our bathroom had a large soaking tub, separate from the walk in shower. Our room had several charging outlets (which is a big bonus in my eyes). We dined at the Bonsall Tapa bar located on the ground level & we loved it; Excellent tapas, great drinks & lovely staff. Our reception & bell hop were kind, courteous & helpful (especially with recommendations & directions).  I highly recommend this hotel for the location, the helpful staff & the comfortable room.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}
{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":14040955,"title":"A Delightful Midtown Gem with Amazing Staff","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-07-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"There really aren\u2019t enough nice things to say about this extraordinary hotel! Not only is the location ideal\u2014 centrally located near several restaurants, shops, sites of interest, and even a short stroll to Central Park, but also 2 blocks from an (E,M) subway station and 5 short blocks away from an (N,R,W) subway station. This makes getting to the hotel from LGA super simple with a total 35 minute trip on the currently free Q70-SBS LaGuardia Link +Select bus to Roosevelt Av\/74 St and then the E subway from Jackson Hts - Roosevelt Av directly to two blocks from the hotel. Don\u2019t miss out on this tip, as it\u2019s a lot easier than you\u2019d think and infinitely cheaper at just under $3 vs anything else you\u2019d do. Entering the hotel is a full sensory experience! You leave the bustling NYC streets and are immediately enveloped into a haven of inspiring music and alluring aromas. The lobby area is cozy and clean, but opens to a spacious and convenient check-in\/check-out counter, which is situated immediately across from the elevators. This layout and the super efficient check-in process makes it truly uncomplicated to get in from your journey to the hotel and be in your room in a matter of moments. The elevator requires key cards to access your appropriate floor, which adds to the effect of safety and security. While there are 37 floors in this hotel, the elevators are modern and fast, so it never took too long going up or down. The beauty of the layout or the floors is that there are only 4 suites per floor! It\u2019s so divine to not be disturbed with lots of people running up and down the hallways while you\u2019re enjoying the truly BEAUTIFUL rooms. There are so many options to choose from, but I spent my time in a 28th floor Premier King, which was 325 sq. ft or 30 sq. m of well appointed goodness! I had some critical criteria in my hotel selection for this particular visit and they nailed them all: King Bed (which is not easy for boutique or chain hotels to pull off in real estate challenged Manhattan); a desk for some work; solid free wifi; a large modern TV; huge windows with a spectacular view; couch (leather cushioned window bench in this case) seating; a mini refrigerator; Nespresso; air conditioning, noiseless walls\/ceiling and a separate bathtub and shower! The ambiance in the room was stylish and comfortable\u2014 you\u2019d easily feel like not leaving, which was the goal! However, when I did journey out for daily adventures, I was truly grateful for the convenient location and ease of transportation\u2014 subway, Uber, and walking. On the 4th floor, there was a well appointed business center and a solid gym with cardio and weight machines, free weight dumbbells, towels, water, AND a full bathroom with shower! While I didn\u2019t use it, there was a cute restaurant right off the lobby. Truly you couldn\u2019t ask for anything more or better, but they gave you more anyway! I saved the best for last. The primary reason this will be my GO TO NYC hotel from now on is the incredible staff! Seriously MAJOR kudos to the friendly and helpful staff that were on hand ALL THE TIME to help in any way possible. And they all genuinely cared about the guests. From the second I checked in to every time I walked in\/out of the hotel, they remembered me and would take time to chat and see how I was enjoying my stay. When I left, it felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends! So, thank you tremendously Sandy, Kiara, Ivana, and Samuel\u2014 this hotel is ONLY as good as you are, and you are awesome!\nDo yourself a favor\u2014 do not pass on this hotel, but do save room for my visits!","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

I had a lot of anxiety before arriving in Manhattan as to whether the Concorde hotel room would live up to my expectations. It was my 60th birthday so things had to be 'just right'! I analysed the size of the rooms online in advance and the bathrooms, paying particular attention to the bed size and whether a great view would\/ could  be included. We were given a warm welcome and showed to our room. My initial reaction was disappointment, the room felt quite small and the view was awful (overlooking a low building with an ugly roof) There was no lounge area as such, and I just felt 'oh gosh is this it'! I went downstairs and asked whether we could change rooms, unfortunately there was nothing available that first night. In the morning I went down to reception feeling pretty emotional (tears in my eyes to be honest) and was hoping for some great customer service and a much needed  alternative room. From the moment I met 'Sandy' on reception i just knew that she could sense my dissapointment and would do anything in her power to make things right. She organised another room for us which was much more what we had in mind, and the view was SO much better! Her professionalism, warmth and understanding was second to none. I will never forget her kindness. Needless to say we settled in so well and our trip was an absolute dream. I would like to go into some more detail about the bed and the bathroom so that fussy people like me can take reassurance from an experienced  traveler like myself. The bed was super large and I can honestly say that it was the most comfortable hotel bed I can ever remember sleeping in, the bedding was so soft and luxurious, the pillows 'just right'. The housekeepers did a great job of making the bed so well every day. The bathroom was EXCELLENT, so spacious with great lighting, a large well lit magnifying mirror by the sink. The shower was great with a handy ledge  for products, a bath was in there too, it was all done to a  high end finish and we had plenty of great quality fluffy white towels. To me the bed and the bathroom is so important. The fridge wasn't great but nevertheless we had one, and the coffee machine was clean and easy to use. Al l the staff were friendly and  obviously passionate about customer service, in particular Francisco and Andre who would go above and beyond to offer support.

I have never experienced anything like this when it comes to hotel services. I gave them the flight information and they could have confirmed that my story was true. I was repeatedly told, \"it was their policy.\" I understand policies. I write policies. However, extenuating circumstances typically allow for room in any policy. They literally simply pocketed a one night stay, which was approximately $450. As I spoke to people up the chain of management, the only response I received was, \"that's our policy.\" No one could have an actual conversation.

But when I say amazing I genuinely mean amazing and specifically I am referring to the staff. The hotel was in a great location easy to get to and a good base to use for sightseeing downtown as well as uptown. \n\nThe room was spectacular we had a suite with a triple aspect window. Oh and the blinds were motorised, nice touch. Didn\u2019t always work and you had to do it twice but still cute. \n\nThe hotel was always clean and well looked after. We met Sebastian who was constantly working and making sure all areas of the hotel were spotless. Never saw him standing still, he was a delight to talk to and always said hi no matter how busy he was. We felt he went above and beyond out of his way to engage with us and helped us when room service failed to turn our room with fresh towels and toiletries. \n\nTalking of room service, this is unfortunately where the hotel failed us. We were there for a week and room service failed\/refused to service our room for 3 days in a row. We had to keep asking reception to talk to the service team to turn our room and they didn\u2019t. The hotel management really need to re evaluate their service contract with this external provider as they are seriously letting down all the good the hotel team do. It\u2019s not fair. \n\nAs for the rest of the staff. We were met at reception by Ajla and Chris. The two of them went onto become our best friends for the duration of our stay. A friendly smile and greeting every morning and help with absolutely everything and anything we asked. Restaurant recommendations and reservations, assistance with a medical issue. Their prompt responses when we had not one but two chairs fail in the room. Note to the management, those egg chairs may look nice but they are not stable I fell off one on one evening and my partner fell of the other a few nights later they snapped at the weld point. Not good. \n\nHowever back to the review. So even though we had a couple of issues we would absolutely recommend this hotel not just for all the great things that we experienced but mostly for the staff and how they rose to the occasions when faced with a challenging issue. Ajla stood out from everyone as the most experienced and knowledgeable and don\u2019t get us wrong we really enjoyed interacting with Chris and Sebastian and Sayed, but we feel like Ajla made extra time for us and that she went even more above and beyond her duties. I hope the management read this as you have a gem there and I hope you look after her and the rest. We plan on coming back and we hope to see them all again. \n\nWishing you all the best from London. \nWe\u2019ll bring extra chocolates next time and seriously change your room service contract. Don\u2019t let one cost saving contract ruin the hotel reputation or all the good things your actual staff do.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The standart room was big enough,  cozy and most of time clean. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom with the shower and bath was excellent. Most of the Hotel team was kind and friendly, some of them less. Chris fron the reception was very helpful, always with a smile and willing to help. Then why I Raye it low? Because of the check out time. After 11 days in this Hotel I was sure they will allow me to check out at 3pm instead of 11am. At first I got a negative answer.  After that I was allowed to stay until 12 o'clock free of charge and if I want to stay until 2 o'clock in the afternoon then the cost is $75 without taxes and if I want to stay until 3 o'clock then the cost will be an extra night.  It's ridiculous, absurd and of course I didn't agree.  Chris spoke with the receptionist who said I could stay until 1pm at no extra charge and the matter could not be discussed further.  At 1 o'clock I left the room and waited about 4 minutes for the elevator (which is a disaster!!).  While waiting I heard the phone in the room ringing, probably to find out why I hadn't left the room yet, 3 minutes after the departure time. Seriously? 3 minutes? \nSo I did the check out and the woman was so unfriendly without asking me how was my stay or wishing me a good travel or whatever.

I really wish I hadn\u2019t tried Concorde Hotel. It is supposedly a \u201c4 star\u201d institution, but to be honest it is nothing close to that. \n\nUpon arrival, as a single woman traveller, I expected at the very least to get some help with my large luggage. I didn\u2019t even get the door opened for me. Usually, when you pay this much for a hotel, the staff at least offer to help with the door (or your bags). \n\nWhen I got to the desk all I wanted was some room service, I\u2019d travelled 10 hours that day and to my unpleasant surprise - the hotel doesn\u2019t offer room service. I get to my room and find an empty mini fridge (no bottled water, no snacks). The lights on the bathroom mirror don\u2019t work, and the lighting panel by the bed is faulty. \n\nI realised I forgot my adaptor plug, I ring down to see if they have one. They did, but refused to bring it up to my room and insisted I come downstairs to sign a waiver in order to use it\u2026 I found this ridiculous, and no other hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed at has staff which are so unhelpful that they can\u2019t even bring something to the room to help you out. I was happy to sign their document, but surely this could have been brought up to the room\u2026?\n\nI wanted to watch some TV, and then to my (now entirely expected) disappointment, you have to download an app and pay for a subscription in order to stream TV. No other hotel I\u2019ve ever stayed at has charged for this very basic service. \n\nThe rooms are not well soundproofed and unfortunately the man staying in the room next door kept me up all night with his coughing. Also the doors of the rooms slam so loudly that you\u2019re woken up if the person next door leaves or enters their room. \n\nThe gym is very basic, one of the two treadmills didn\u2019t work during my stay which was frustrating. \n\nI have another upcoming trip soon which I\u2019d also booked at Concorde, and I went to the front desk in attempt to cancel the booking. I was told by the man that since I booked through booking.com I had to go through them. When this was an unsuccessful request, my colleague called the hotel for me to try and plead with them to let me cancel and have a refund because the hotel was so massively disappointing. She received very rude and unprofessional treatment from the woman on the phone saying there was \u201cno record of me trying to cancel before\u201d which is completely false. Generally, I found the staff here to be unhelpful and wanting to do only the bare minimum. For the price of this hotel, there are infinitely better options out there. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as me and be sucked in by the nice pictures online, in reality the hotel looks and feels cheap, and the service matches.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Apparently the 37th floor used to be all one big 2-bedroom suite, but it was broken up into 3 rooms sometime recently. The front desk told me there is an ambassador king and an ambassador queen. The king is what was the \"primary\" room when it was a whole-floor suite, which means it has a massive bathroom with a tub and a huge shower. The bathroom alone is the size of most New York hotel rooms. Pretty awesome. The bedroom area is a single room, so no separate area like you think of with a \"suite\" if that's what you're looking for. The bed is super comfortable, the closet is a great size, and I appreciated how much drawer storage the room had. The space was designed very well and intentionally.\n\nVIEW: The Ambassador Parlor King faces north and has a lovely view of several buildings. I loved how you felt like you were among the skyscrapers, but you weren't just staring into another building up-close. It was exactly the view I was hoping for.\n\nCLEANLINESS: I read another review about how clean the rooms are, and I can confirm this!!! Hotel rooms usually have a little grime hiding in the corners or in the tile grout, but this room was so clean, it looked brand new. We chatted with the housekeeping ladies in the mornings in the elevator and they are SO sweet. \n\nLOCATION: I usually stay in lower Manhattan for the vibrancy so I was worried about feeling isolated in the UES, but I actually really loved the location. Several convenient subway stops nearby, and it's a quick 15-20 minute walk to the park\/5th Ave shops, etc. \n\nHOTEL\/SERVICE: Everyone who worked here was so nice, from Abdul at the bell desk to the front desk staff. The little restaurant in the back is cute although we didn't eat there. The lobby was really cool, and the lobby bathroom was super nice and clean and a good place to freshen up if you need to before your room is ready. \n\nOverall, I can't say enough great things about The Concorde Hotel.

But I was disappointed by many things with my stay. First off, for a hotel that almost $800 a night, they are lacking in luxuries to justify the price. No room service (although there is a room service button on the phone) no mini bar, no waters in the room. Bathroom amenities were disappointing. No q tips or cotton, hair dryer was small and older model. Today I called at 11:30 & asked for housekeeping to clean the room. When I returned at 4, it was not done. At 5, I was in the shower and housekeeping didn\u2019t knock, they just walked straight in\u2026I quickly covered myself and she brought extra towels. To her credit, she was so mortified and very kind. She was not the problem.  I then called downstairs to ask for the room to be cleaned while we went to dinner. I was told that housekeeping had already left for the day and there was nothing they could do to accommodate me. In a luxury hotel, there is always housekeeping. I spoke to front desk supervisor who had no empathy and didnt seem to care much about my complaints. Again this is hotel charging 800-900 a night. It doesn\u2019t warrant the price. Which is sad because the location is great and the room was nice. I think if you are going to charge that much money, certain amenities and services are necessary.  And if the front desk supervisor had just showed some remorse and offered to fix some of these things, I would have been happy. Instead she was blaming the housekeeping staff.

I loved the spaciousness of my room and the pretty amazing neverending window with its view of Manhattan, facing south, as well as a smaller window facing East with a splotch of blue in the distance, the East River. I never got tired of watching the movement of life below during the day (people hanging out on their balconies, eating, doing yoga exercises, reading) and the play of the lights at night. Hard to believe, but the windows are sound-insulated! I kid you not when I say that New York\u2019s permanent street noise could not be heard when the windows were closed, at least not on the 22nd floor. \n\nA small fridge as well as an espresso machine in each room and a coffee machine in the business room area across from the fitness room with various coffee concoctions,  hot chocolate and tea, were nice extras. \n\nThe staff, from housekeeping to reception to the bell attendants, were always friendly and eager to help. The caf\u00e9-bar, Bonsai, is definitely a useful touch. The wine was excellent and Rubin, one of the owners, is a real charmer. \n\nSeriously? It\u2019s hard to say where there was room for improvement. It\u2019s hard, but I CAN think of a few things. \n\nThe desk was too high! You may think this is a strange fault, but if you\u2019re shortish, like me, measuring in at 5 feet 4, a rather normal height for a woman actually, sitting at a desk that is higher than your chest makes you feel like a toddler sitting with the grown-ups. Plus, it makes it hard to work on a laptop and even to drink a cup of coffee or snack on a quick sandwich. I suggest desk chairs that can be regulated in height or just higher chairs. This is another way in which women are inadvertantly discriminated against when furnishing hotel rooms.\n\nThe air conditioner was easy to control and did its job, but I couldn\u2019t find a setting that really worked for me. Either it was too cold or a little too warm. I relented and kept it cooler and threw a wool shawl over my shoulder that I happened to take along with me. \n\nThe furniture was in fairly good condition, although I found it surprising that the bathroom door was rotting on the length of its entire bottom edge. I imagine the bathroom was at one point flooded with water (now how did that happen?!? \u2013 The shower was great and well-sealed). The door was otherwise fine so they didn\u2019t replace it, but it IS an eyesore in an otherwise pretty perfect setting.\n\nThe area outside the hotel is not a real neighborhood. 55th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues is midtown east, a business area, and not especially pretty or cool or special. On sundays some shops and stores are even closed. And just a few steps from the hotel where there is a parking garage there was a homeless man who hung out the whole week I was there, mostly sleeping. He didn\u2019t bother anybody as far as I could see, but he was not a pleasant sight and every time I passed him I felt bad.\n\nDespite a few hiccups, I would come back to Concorde Hotel in a heartbeat and hope to some day soon.

Not sure what magic they wield with the bathroom ventilation but even when it should have been steamy it was well ventilated (never heard a vent?). The air-conditioning in the room was fantastic and also super quiet. They don't have a restaurant (they do have a cafe though) but you can get room service via Butler. The front desk staff was friendly and they held our bags after checkout and were really gracious and accommodating in general. If I had to find a con: the first night there was only one bath towel and there were two of us but we inquired with the housekeeping staff the next day and not only were they super lovely to deal with but they supplied us with an appropriate amount of towels.

The eminent Concorde hotel. \n\nI\u2019m here now, writing this review. \n\nIt\u2019s midnight and the Upper East Side looks so beautiful from up here. This window is four times the size of my body and yet I feel so large. It\u2019s all in the room, I think. It makes me feel like I\u2019m Wilson Fisk. I'm Tony Stark. I'm Bruce Wayne upon Gotham. \n\nIn this moment, I run New York.\n\nWait a moment. Something caught my eye. I wonder why a single room light is on the 61st floor of the Bloomberg building? Is Mike home? \n\nYou really need to see the Bloomberg building at midnight from this floor. What a view.\n\nBack to the Concorde. Every place is defined by its people, so let\u2019s talk folk. All Concorde staff I encountered were excellent, from the courteous doormen to the tireless housekeepers. A few to note: the amiable Christopher Shepard, the efficient Rada Drascovic, the soign\u00e9 Dukens Alexandre. They exemplify luxury hospitality. Meet them and consider yourself lucky.\n\nLook, we all agree that that hospitality in New York is a gamble, regardless of star ratings or thousands paid. Well, not the Concorde \u2013 it\u2019s consistently well reviewed as far as excellence in customer service and I got to experience first-hand why. New York is not known for consistency in anything. I was impressed.\n\nLet\u2019s now talk about the space. Understand that this hotel is less boutique and more New York history. It was born as a residential high-rise owned by a major airline to provide exclusive lodging to visiting crew. Keep in mind that corporations take it very seriously that the people flying their billion-dollar aircraft get the pinnacle of luxury for their night\u2019s rest. So, you will too.\n\nThe Concorde is designed with your comfort in mind. That\u2019s why every floor only has four rooms. That\u2019s why the beds are so soft. That\u2019s why the soothing tones of mid-century modern mellow your eyes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m typing this with my laptop on a marble table top. That\u2019s why\u2026 the bathrooms. \n\nOh, the bathrooms. God damn. We\u2019re talking bathrooms the size of a New York city studio. Professional vanity mirror taking up a warehouse chunk of wall real estate. Walk-in shower and soaking tub. That\u2019s right - and. Have you ever finished a run in Central Park with a perfectly-temperature-controlled Bahamas waterfall of a chilled shower, soak your tired muscles in a home spa of a soothing bubble bath, then back to the Bahamas you go? I have.\n\nA bit about the amenities. Well, there\u2019s the essential WIFI, but note that you can ask for a network cable for better Zooming or Teaming. 92 Mbps down \/ 94 Mbps up during my stay, by the way. My TV is quite big and has all the usual channels and music. A fridge (mind you, much mini) lets me keep a few refreshments cool for when needed. Finally, an iron and board in the room let me have my pilot uniform looking crisp for my flight out.\n\nA note about laundry - Hill Cleaners (160 E. 55th St) is just down the block. \n\nIf you get bored, there\u2019s a lot to do. Are you a tourist or a non-jaded local? Rockefeller Plaza and Central Park are within walking distance. Funny story \u2013 a few days into my stay at the Concorde, I climbed a tree in Central Park to see if I still could. Well, I certainly got down faster than I got up. My rib hurt for a week. Cherish your twenties, kids, because they\u2019ll pass you by.\n\nBe smarter than me and work out at the Concorde gym on the 4th floor. It\u2019s not massive, but has all the essentials: treadmills, bikes, weight machines, and free weights. Mirrors, too \u2013 mirrors holding secrets. Shh.\n\nHungry after all that exercise? Whole Foods and Duane Reade are just 3 blocks away. If you\u2019re so inclined, so is McDonalds. Want takeout? There\u2019s over 30 local restaurants on Seamless. I highly recommend Jackson Hole. The pecan pie is de-li-cious.\n\nReady for some retail therapy? Bloomies, Saks, Bergdorf, Home Depot, Zara, MUJI, Saks Off Fifth, Uniqlo\u2026 to list a few\u2026 are within a 10 block radius. I recommend stopping by Columbus Circle on the west side of Central Park too \u2013 their Nordstrom is amazing. If you find yourself in the Men\u2019s shop, ask for Will in Men\u2019s Shoes, because he\u2019s a class act and you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nWant to travel a bit? Public transportation is readily accessible, both subway trains (N, R, W, E, M, 6) and buses (M2, M3, M4, M50, M101, M102, M103, Q32, Q60). I\u2019m telling you, this place is so convenient.\n\nAll in all, staying here is a fantastic experience and I highly recommend it. \n\nI will forever hold a special place in my heart for the Concorde. It helped me get over a - very - difficult goodbye. This hotel means a lot to me and I hope it will for you, too.","travelDate":"2020-07","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel is renovating the lobby so you walk in to take an elevator to 4 to check in. They had a nice coffee\/espresso machine with tea options. A computer and a big enough lounging area for the space.The room was super roomy and clean and modern and had all the things we needed. I appreciated the lighting options around the room.The cleaning staff was attentive and friendly. The stay was exceptionally quite since there were only 4 rooms on the floor and after a long day in the hustle of the city that was almost priceless. There is so much to see in the city it\u2019s hard to say it\u2019s not convenient. I guess if you are going on a trip specific to a purpose, you would look for a room in a certain neighborhood however, it was close to all public transit, close to Central Park, 5th Avenue shopping.

Its location in the city is the only reason I am giving it one star. The hotel is supposed to be a non smoking hotel. Someone was smoking in their room and because to the very close proximity of the rooms to each other, they might as well have been smoking in our room.  The shower was blocked and caused the bathroom to flood if you took anything longer than a three second shower. We checked in in the early evening so I did not alert the front desk until the next morning as we left to check out the city. They assured me they would address the situation. Well nothing was done to address the situation. Bathroom still flooded and the smoking was just as bad. At over 300 dollars a night, you can put your dollars somewhere else.

I am giving this hotel 4 stars because:\n- the location is great and its super close to Central Park for a morning run and Bryant Park and many walkable destinations\n- the rooms are great for business travelers - comfortable, stylish, great placement of power outlets, etc\n- no line at check-in\n- super small floors of only about 4 rooms each and despite having a baby next door, it was quiet and peaceful for the most part\n- the team at the hotel was really nice and I appreciate their friendliness\n- i will definitely stay here again and I'll recommend it to others \n\n*One additional thing. Although I really like this hotel, I left really frustrated. At check-out they explained that in addition to the price I paid for the room (which wasn't cheap and was pretty average for a nice room in NYC), I had to pay a separate charge of $50 for the \"resort fee.\"  This is not a resort.  There are not resort amenities. There is bottled water in the lobby, there is Wifi. These are standard in 99.9% of hotels. This charge amounts to hotels being able to list prices on the internet (and I booked on the hotel's website) that are lower than what you will actually pay.  I'm tired of it and I think it borders on unethical. I asked the front desk to explain the \"amenities\" that I received in exchange for my $50 and i got a look of agreement with my sentiment.  So.... as much as I'd like to give this and all hotels only 1 star for ripping all of us off with their \"resort fee,\" I don't feel like its fair to ruin their Trip Advisor ratings, when most decent hotels are engaging in this shifty practice.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Staff is friendly, front desk always has someone bellman and door man all go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. And always ask how your day was and eager to advise. Rooms are clean. The view was amazing. We stayed on the 33rd floor and a corner room.  We felt the rooms were a decent size. Bigger than most places we\u2019ve stayed around the world. The bathroom was also decent size. We never had any issues. We always had hot water and never really waited for the lift. And the lift was also very quick. They offer free unlimited bottled water. The room has all amenities you would need a small fridge a decent size cupboard incl some hangers. Even an ironing board. The room is equipped with an espresso coffee machine and pods, a few per day. So no running out.  And a kettle. The bathroom also has toiletries. Towels were always clean and bedding too. I\u2019m really fussy with clean hotels and this hotel is spotless and very new. There is a rooftop which we never really used. Too much to do in New York. The hotel is extremely central. Walking distance to 5th ave and Central Park and has a great view of the Chrysler building when u stand on Lexington Ave.  and actually central to most places in midtown. But given that you walk everywhere in New York. We did over 16kms per day of walking.  We walked to all the sites except downtown. Subway is close and really easy to use otherwise yellow cab and Uber very easily accessible.  We found this little gem for breakfast that was close by called French baguette. On Lexington. I can\u2019t fault this hotel whatsoever. There was nothing that we were dissatisfied with. Highly recommend this place. It was a bit steep on the price but still reasonable. Our currency is really bad so it was our currency that let us down in general in New York and not the price of the hotel. Wood berry commons is a must for shopping. It\u2019s an outlet mall about an hour out of New York. There are busses that leave from Manhattan daily. And we did a doors off helicopter ride with FlyNYON. Highly recommend that too. And if u looking for a fancy dinner Tao uptown and tavern in the green are a must. There is so much to say about this city I just can\u2019t fit it all in. This city is breathtaking.

For almost $200 a night I don't think this was worth the price and we should have just spent an extra $100 more to stay somewhere nicer. \n\nThe service was very friendly and accomodating which was nice but there are about 37 floors to this hotel with only one elevator. Be ready to either use the stairs or wait a long time to get out the door. \n\nIt was about 29F the night that the heater in the room decided to not work. Called the front desk and they sent a space heater up and said engineering will have a look at it AFTER we've checked out. We honestly barely got any sleep in the 2 nights that we stayed due to the very uncomfortable bed and loud space heater. I'm not sure how they managed it but the bed sheets were crunchy and felt scratchy. The pillows were so bad that the back of my head hurt! My husband ended up with bad shoulder pains by the end of our stay. I'd also like to complain that they had a duvet comforter but with NO cover on it. I felt very uneasy about sleeping in the bed due to the yellow stains on it.\n\nLastly, if you are staying here, perhaps bring slippers for the bathroom because the floor is very slippery. They do provide a bathmat to help with it but the shower floor bumper is slippery and I almost broke my neck from slipping. Thankfully I was able to grab onto the glass door and regained my footing. \n\nThe reason why I am giving this place 3 stars at minimum is because of the wonderful staff here. Everyone was friendly, helpful and greeted us with smiles. If you are lucky enough to get an alleyside room it is very quiet.  Overall, skip on this place if you can.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Before reaching the front entrance the bell staff anticipated my arrival, opened the door and greeted me. Annabelle at the front desk was gracious and welcoming as were all staff. Rada had previously shown me a room which I booked that day for this date. The bright boutiquey recently remodeled lobby and seating area were inviting yet intimate and included an outdoor patio. The elevators quickly whisked me up to my high floor corner room which was thoroughly updated in a clean, crisp minimalist style, comprised of wrap around double paned windows (one of which opens slightly), rain shower and a separate tub. Lighting, both natural and artificial are exceptional. The room was quiet, equipped with a refrigerator and a Nespresso. Molton Brown bath products are provided in my favorite fragrace, orange and bergamot. Rooms provide plenty of bathroom counter space, a safe and city with some east river views. A few rooms have large patios. My friend had an equally nice room as well. The neighborhood is quiet yet close to the essentials, Blow Bar, Gregorys Coffee, Bloomies, Saks, King Cole Room, etc. An architecturally beautiful synagogue is across the street. We walked to see Come From Away and Network on Broadway. Concorde in the past was a British Airways hotel for crew.

There was a reception desk, a receptionist and, errrrr, that's it. It's a pity that the hotel was so overpriced because it meant I had no money left to buy the cat. This was the cat I was going to swing in the bedroom but, no matter, it wasn't big enough anyway. Nothing wrong with the room itself (apart from the size) and it did have a magnificent minibar which was doing a sterling job in keeping the air inside it cool. Obviously, since there was nothing else inside it, it only had to concentrate on the air. On returning to the hotel from dinner out, my wife needed some water. We asked at reception whether there was any available and were directed to the drugstore round the corner. When I enquired as to the reason for having a minibar which was empty and pointed out that by stocking it they could make more money, I was reliably informed that they were thinking of adding a restaurant to the hotel. Guessing (correctly as it turned out) that the restaurant would take more than an hour or two to build, we went to the drugstore for the water. This hotel has nothing, absolutely nothing. No bar, no restaurant, no seating area, no warmth, no character - nothing.

Upon arrival to the hotel i was told that hotels.com did not charge me and that they needed to charge my card at the front desk. As a result of the front desk workers being uneducated about how that worked i was charged twice for my stay. I was charged by the hotel and by hotels.com. Upon check out i was told that i would be refunded and an email would be sent with the conformation, that never happened. I gave it a few days and contacted the hotel where i was told it was really confusing on what the person did when they checked me out of the hotel. I was told that a manager would call me the following morning, that also did not happen. After not getting a call back or email still i contacted the hotel again to speak to a manager. The manager finally sent me a conformation of my refund for the charge that should have never happened and was extremely rude on the phone. I do not recommend this hotel if you want decent customer service.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Big, clean, nice bathrooms. We had a whole wall of windows plus an extra window on the corner. Lots of outlets. Not much street noise facing 55th, quiet at night. However they really really need to fix the wifi and second elevator. These have been an issue since the hotel's earliest reviews. Even during our stay they said the elevator will work the next day or the wifi will be back up later. Second elevator and wifi didn't work over four days. There are 37 floors, maybe most only have 4 rooms, but there were times that it took forever for the elevator to come and there's probably chances it's full by the time it gets to your floor. Staff were all really nice, convenient location. First floor has an outdoor sitting area. But really need that wifi and second elevator fixed.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was surprised by how spacious my room was, certainly not a typical NY hotel experience. I was also happy with how everything seemed new and clean. There are definitely quirks they are still working on - one of the elevators was out of order when I was staying, which made it a long wait to get up and down. The desk lamp also didn't work. However, they get high marks for customer service. The front desk and concierge folks are all friendly and helpful. I think this offset the fact that there's no food\/drinks inside the hotel.

We paid around $400 net non-refundable per night for the Family Suite.  For the space we got, we were extremely happy.  The suite was special in that it has tons of space and windows while the room admittedly is nothing special.  Both rooms have full and spacious bathrooms, comfortable beds, great showers and AC that was too cold for me.  Wifi was running great.  Quiet as well for a good night's sleep.\n\nI will say, their seating area now is optimal.  I much prefer a proper sofa to the current bench with pillows arrangement.  Similarly, a proper height working chair would be helpful for those on a business trip, especially given the location of the hotel. \n\nReceptionist and doorman\/concierge were always so courteous.  I was particularly impressed that Abdul put all our water in their fridge after we checked out but left our stuff with them first while we picked up our rental car.\n\nAll in all, it was an enjoyable stay for us and I would not hesitate to recommend a stay here.

When I arrived on the 4th floor to have my meal, the room was a sort of living room, with two low tables and a coffee machine. There was a tiny selection of pastries and nothing more. For the location and the quality of the rooms, I found this was quite a slip - I would eventually have negotiated a breakfast coupon in a nice cafe nearby rather than having guests getting disappointed. The other people that came had the same feeling. I will come back and definitely see if my next review will reveal the true potential and assigning the fifth star. Some work to be done but I would be confident the management will work its way out.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This hotel used to be a private airline crew hotel until it was recently renovated and reopened to the public.  Overall, I was very impressed and enjoyed this hotel.  It is very expensive (compared to hotels in places I normally stay at) and things like the breakfast are kind of limited (just simple pastries and coffee \/ tea), but the price was quite reasonable when I compared it to other NYC hotels in the area.  Be prepared for a ridiculous set of taxes to be added to your bill, but that isn't their fault.\n\nThey only have 4 rooms per floor, and the hotel occupies 37 floors.  I stayed on the 15th floor.\n\nThe room was comfortable, with new furniture.  They greet you with a personalized card and a small box of chocolates.  The bathroom is spacious and has a nice large shower stall.  I found it odd there was no towel bar to hang towels up, but that's minor.  The closet has a nice little safe, which I used several times.  They also give you a mini-fridge in a cabinet to store your own drinks and food, which I did use.\n\nThe staff was excellent, very friendly and attentive.  One day I had an issue with the AC in my room, and I ran into the building engineer in the elevator.  He promptly stopped on my floor to check it, and the next day remembered me when we met again in the elevator and he asked if all was OK.\n\nI only have two small complaints: The first is that one elevator was out-of-service, so that meant I had long waits a couple times for the other one.  The second is that the WiFi access points need to be relocated.  I had great signal strength (and decent speed) near the door to my room, but at the desk by the window at the room's far side it was so weak I couldn't use it.  The building absorbs the signal.\n\nOtherwise, I highly recommend this hotel, and would stay here again when I next come to Manhattan.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"SOLO"}
