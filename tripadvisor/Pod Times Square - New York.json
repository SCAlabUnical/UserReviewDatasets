Possiamo solo consigliare questo hotel a chi, come noi, vuole visitare la citt\u00e0 e vedere il pi\u00f9 possibile. Le stanze sono davvero piccole, ma per dormirci la notte bastano ed avanzano. Sono molto pulite e non abbiamo avuto alcun tipo di problema. Il letto Queen-Size \u00e8 un po\u2019 piccolo per due persone adulte, ma come gi\u00e0 detto, per soli scopi notturni, basta ed avanza. Il quartiere offre molto, sia in termini di cibo che di negozi per le prime esigenze, ecc. \u00c8 davvero situato perfettamente, a 5 minuti di camminata dall\u2019inizio di Times Square e a qualche minuto dalla stazione degli autobus e dalla prima stazione della metropolitana. Se dovessimo tornare in citt\u00e0, sicuramente sceglieremmo di nuovo il Pod Times Square. Una cosa per\u00f2 che ci mancava era al meno un piccolo armadietto o qualcosa di simile per mettere i vestiti. C'era solo un'attacca panni dove si potevano appoggiare i vestit all'entrata ma sinceramente non era l'ideale.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Hear me out, This may be the smallest room I have ever stayed in in the area, but it had everything I needed, was comfortable and there was a beautiful simplicity to the room, bathroom,and desk area. My son and I stayed here for 7 nights during a spring break trip to the city. For a boys trip the bunk bed layout was perfect. Location is also a big plus. You are two blocks from Time Square, Subway, and great restaurants. Over the years I have come to find that every place I stayed at in Time Square is overpriced, rundown, and not very hospitable. The Pod Time square has changed this for me, they are affordable, have a great staff (let us check in early), and  the rooms are clean, bedding in comfortable, and was the right balance of everything we needed and nothing we did not. Will stay there again if given the chance!","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Also, There was no provision for placing toiletries and such (tooth brushes, toothpaste, razor, etc.) in the bathroom. This was in contrast to the bunk room I had stayed in last year. The bunk room had a huge bathroom with a glass enclosed shower and space to place and keep toiletries during my stay.

I really enjoyed staying here.  The rooms are super clean and comfortable as well as super efficiently designed and like the Pod 39, had the necessary items like an in-room safe, television screens attached to the wall and plenty of places to plug in your laptop, cellphone and ipod.  You are not going to get a place any cheaper than this in a location like this and have your own full bathroom (has a shower, no tub, but that's how it is in a lot of efficiently designed hotels in New York because tubs just take up too much space).  I had a great view down 8th avenue which really surprised me (no such views at the Pod 39) and there's a small but decent gym on the upper floors with even better views to look at while you work out (and the equipment they have is better than average, so many hotels only have the cheapest, crappiest bikes and treadmills).  It is a short walk from the Port Authority with many different subway and bus lines and plenty of great restaurants nearby (I liked the Westway Diner less than two blocks away and it's a longstanding New York institution).\n\nThe front desk people are friendly and knowledgable about the area when they are not overwhelmed by phone calls and long lines at the desk.  The place has a decent restaurant that serves all three meals; while their breakfast isn't cheap, you wouldn't pay much less to each at another place in the area.  The only downside is you can't charge anything to the room like you could at the Pod 39 (which may be different by now anyway).  They also stretch the definition of being in Times Square - I didn't think 42nd street & 9th avenue was part of that area, but it's location is still super convenient and I don't need to really stay right in the middle of Times Square anyway.\n\nIf you can do better than this place, build your own damn hotel!","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

(I think you can have housekeeping come every day if you want). The bed was comfy. The room gets nice and warm if you put the heating on (I went in winter). I was cold the first night as there is only a blanket rather than a duvet, but I asked for a second blanket and they brought me one no problem, and I was nice and warm from then on.

The location is fantastic: right beside multiple restaurants, a corner store, and within walking distance to iconic spots like Rockefeller Center and popular shopping spots (Nintendo store, Hershey store, Disney store). Check-in and check-out were a breeze, room was clean. My friend and I had a bunk bed room. We enjoyed the fact that we each had our own television. The top bunk was a little difficult to get up onto mostly because of the ladder being made of metal... it was a bit painful on the feet, and nothing to grip onto to pull yourself onto the bed... would probably not be an issue for a child or younger person (I'm mid-30s). The first night we found it to be extremely noisy--to be expected since the hotel is in a high traffic area. However I realized by the second night that the window was not completely sealed shut. If you're a light sleeper, highly recommend making sure that the window is closed as snugly as possible for optimal noise reduction! Our phone receiver had a low-battery issue and would beep sporadically, despite being properly installed on the base and plugged in as it should have been. We ended up turning the receiver off and keeping it off the base as it was the only way to get the beeping to stop. Despite these inconveniences, we enjoyed our stay and the staff and guests we encountered were nothing but friendly! I will definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"NONE"}

The accommodation has a bit of a hostel vibe, in that both staff and guests are some of the friendliest people I've ever met whilst staying in a hotel. Loads of different nationalities and everybody keen to converse. It had a really great vibe.\n\nThe staff are on the ball - we requested an extra bed cover for the second evening and house keeping were at our door within minutes. The rooms are compact but offer every basic you really need for a trip where you're not spending much time in your room - bed, shower, TV. - sorted.\n\nThe views are amazing, too, with most rooms offering exceptional views of the city skyline. It was lovely to leave the blinds open at night and take in the city and lights. The sound proofing is also very good - I've stayed in a few hotels in NY before and the incessant car horn beeping and emergency services sirens wailing throughout the night really do grind on you after a while, but we hardly heard any of them when we were in our room.\n\nRecommended.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

But, I easily walked from the Port Authority to this hotel with my luggage. So great location near transportation, fast and slow food, stores, Times Square, and Broadway. From the street it did not have a typical hotel front. You enter and go up to the main lobby. It is what it says it is . A minimalist experience. My room was upgraded from Full to Queen. I had to use my key for the elevator. So it was secure. It has the look of something you might see in a James Bond scene. Cool. The room was a decent size. Larger than I\u2019d imagined. I had two small complaints. The room was musty. I Ieft the window open while I took a walk. Also, bring an extension cord. Unless I missed them elsewhere, the outlets were next to the TV.. I wanted to plug in my streaming stick and it would not reach the plug. I was able to stream without issue from my laptop. My big complaint, the one I had ignored in the reviews from others, was the bed. I barely slept and hurt all over the next morning. The bed was so hard and uncomfortable. I am on the older and larger side but, I have never had this much of an issue sleeping. Imagine a hard floor. That\u2019s what it felt like. I booked direct and got the best deal so I was able to cut my trip short and spend the next 5 nights of my trip somewhere else. That being said. I can see how it had such high marks even with the bed complaints. ","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

The Lounge was ok, some guests got free drinks at checkin, I did not.  noticed that sometimes they had coffee in the Lounge in the morning, but many mornings they did not, just walked to the Starbucks on the next block or the Big Apple Market around the corner for coffee, all very close","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Ao lado do Port Authority Terminal, e a duas quadras da esta\u00e7\u00e3o de metr\u00f4 da Times Square. V\u00e1rios restaurantes e op\u00e7\u00f5es de alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o na volta. O quarto \u00e9 MUITO pequeno. Estava sozinha no quarto com cama de casal, e achei tudo bem apertado. O banheiro \u00e9 espa\u00e7oso, e o box tamb\u00e9m. O chuveiro \u00e9 bom, com uma ducha fixa e uma ducha m\u00f3vel, a regulagem da temperatura funciona bem, mas poderia ter mais press\u00e3o de \u00e1gua. N\u00e3o conta com ducha higi\u00eanica, mas a ducha m\u00f3vel do chuveiro pode ser usada para esse fim. O hotel oferece shampoo, condicionador e sabonete l\u00edquido de \u00f3tima qualidade. Eles ficam acoplados na parede, dentro do box. O secador de cabelo \u00e9 antigo, mas muito bom. A cama \u00e9 muito confort\u00e1vel, e a TV \u00e9 a cabo. A mesinha com cadeira \u00e9 muito \u00fatil para fazer algumas refei\u00e7\u00f5es. Como muitos hot\u00e9is de NY, n\u00e3o existe frigobar no quarto. N\u00e3o existe cortina na janela, somente uma veneziana que permite a entrada de luz durante a noite e quando amanhece. Se tu tem problema com a claridade a noite, sugiro levar um tapa olho. Um ponto curioso foi o servi\u00e7o de limpeza do quarto. Cheguei em uma sexta-feira, e o servi\u00e7o s\u00f3 aconteceu na ter\u00e7a-feira da semana seguinte. N\u00e3o sei se \u00e9 o costume do hotel, mas como estava sozinha, sa\u00eda cedo da manh\u00e3 e chegava tarde da noite, n\u00e3o foi um problema para mim. O ar condicionado \u00e9 central, e existe um controle no quarto para regulagem da temperatura, que eu nunca consegui ajustar. A conex\u00e3o Wi-fi \u00e9 boa, mas as vezes oscilava. Cheguei \u00e1s 10hrs, fiz o check in e meu quarto estava pronto. Pude subir, deixar as malas e me organizar para sair. No check in ganhei duas cortesias de drinks para beber no Josephine, bar localizado no lobby do hotel. Foram dois pontos muito legais. O hotel conta com o servi\u00e7o de guardar as malas, tanto no check in, quanto no check out. N\u00e3o existe um valor espec\u00edfico para o servi\u00e7o, ele funciona pelo sistema de gorjetas (tips), ent\u00e3o tu pode ficar a vontade para pagar o valor que ficar melhor. Com rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao staff, precisei do suporte da recep\u00e7\u00e3o duas vezes e fui bem atendida. As demais pessoas que tive contato foram sol\u00edcitas e educadas. \u00danica exce\u00e7\u00e3o foi a mo\u00e7a que me atendeu no check in que foi antip\u00e1tica. O hotel conta com passeios guiados gratuitos por algumas regi\u00f5es tur\u00edsticas. Os dias e hor\u00e1rios ficam escritos em um quadro na recep\u00e7\u00e3o, como na foto que eu anexei. Pelos coment\u00e1rios que li, talvez tenha ido com a expectativa muito alta e esperasse mais, mas num geral foi uma boa experi\u00eancia, e recomendo a acomoda\u00e7\u00e3o.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

You enter downstairs and then take an elevator to the hotel lobby. I checked in around 11 in the morning. They said they had a room ready for me and everything! I originally had a bunk bed but since I was a solo traveler, she switched me to a single bed on the 21st floor. I greatly appreciated that.\n\nIt's the perfect size for a single traveler. There's the bed, the TV, and the bathroom. They had a place to hang sweaters or coats. The room could've used a fridge. There was room for one and I often had leftovers so it would've been good if it was in there.\n\nFor the tech people, there are no plugs near the bed, but there are two UBS ports affixed to the wall. A plug, two outlet prongs, are found opposite that on the wall where the hangers are. So there was no plugging in my charger for my phone. But there is a charger attached to the alarm clock. The cord is really short but it works.\n\nThe location is really close to the theater district. It's about a block away. The only thing I'm dinging this place for is there was some kind of mold along the bottom of the shower. They need to rectify that. The room really suited my needs.

Magically after 3 times of being down to reception to complain, someone went to look at the shower & fixed it - so it wasn't the city maintenance. \n\nThis was a trip for our 5 year anniversary and our experiences in the hotel honestly just tainted the whole thing. The staff weren't very apologetic or empathetic about any of it. We spent nearly 2K on accommodation and it was a waste of our money. I am also still waiting for our resort fees, city tax & deposit to be refunded, as promised by the hotel for the inconvenience caused.\n\nReally disappointed, we had heard great things about the Pod Hotel chain but unfortunately our experience has turned us off returning or recommending them.

Would not recommend coming here with someone you are not really comfortable with. Over all for the price and location you can\u2019t really beat it. ","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The POD hotels in NYC continue to be my \"go-to\" for value in the city.  (I've stayed at the 39th Street location and I am planning a trip to the midtown location this fall.) \n\nOur bunk room was ready when we arrived hours before the published check-in time. This is was a nice surprise!  Check-in was efficient and friendly.   Our room location gave us a view down 9th Avenue of the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood.  \n\nThe room:\nDecent cleanliness.   There is a little mildew build-up in one corner of the shower and possibly a small  water leak from the shower pan into the guestroom causing some bubbling of the wall behind the lower bed.  No odor of dampness in the room.  Linens and terry were clean.  Beds were comfortable.   All the outlets worked.  Have always appreciated the roomy shower and rain shower head.   The AC unit cooled the room quickly when we wanted it to.  Lighting is bright. There is a safe if you need it.  \n\nThings that could be better:\nBy day three our small bar of hand wash soap was just about done.  I know we could have called and gotten another.  How about a wall-mounted dispenser for soap and lotion like the ones in the shower?\nOne more set of towels (we had two sets) would make it easier to avoid having housekeeping come for a three-night stay for two people and not take up any more room on the rack.\nThe reading lights are great but show age and do not always turn off after use.  I know this from a past visit and actually brought a small roll of tape with me so that I could tape them \"closed\" if necessary.  It is probably time to replace them, put them on a switch, do something with them.\n\nThings to know: \nThe shutters are great to let light in and for privacy, but they will not fully black-out the room. Bring an eye mask if you need 100% dark to sleep and\/or plan to sleep late. \nThe TV remotes will work both TV sets.  Aim straight at the TV so the signal doesn't bounce off the walls and onto the other TV set.  This can be annoying but the fix is not practical for a hotel.  \nThere is a small convenience store almost right next door for water etc. There is no refrigerator or microwave (or room for them!) There is a larger bodega about a block away.  \nWe had two carry-on sized suitcases, two back backs, and one handbag and were just about out of space to store things for easy access.  You will need to be prepared to live out of your suitcase and pack\/unpack things as you need them to keep yourselves able to walk around the room.  That said, we also did some shopping and had no issues finding creative places to stash things when needed.  \nIt's easiest to plan for one person to be in the bathroom getting ready to go out while the other is in the \"room.\"  \nI've never had an issue with noise from other rooms or the hallway.  \nI brought a small travel extension cord with USB\/C and plugs on it that we plugged in under the desk for extra outlets.  But we would have been fine with plugging in phones at the bedside, laptops on the beds when we went out for the day etc.  \nWifi signal was good.  \n\nThe hotel offers luggage storage. Since our room was ready we did not need this service.  I also have never used the lobby or concierge services.  \n\nThe bar\/lounge has a great outdoor terrace but it was completely empty at 9 pm on Saturday night.  It was unclear whether we could sit and get service outside so we didn't stay.  \n\n","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Bathroom stocked with soap, body wash, hair stuff. The hallways have an interesting sci-fi bunker feel to them. When we first arrived to check in, there was a slight miscommunication; our 3rd party booking receipt had made it seem like we already paid the hotel resort fee, but the employee at the front desk said we had not and she would charge our card the fee now. This was fine, just a confusing wording on the booking site\u2019s end, but the clerk had an odd attitude even before we began talking. She didn\u2019t seem to want to deal with guests at all. Maybe a personality thing. Every other employee we spoke too was friendly and helpful enough, though.

It was very quiet once everything was closed up for the evening or we could open the window and experience the sounds of the city outside. My one tip would be to let the front desk know if you need room cleaning or extra towels. Our stay was short so just new towels was all we needed. Also, we did not know until leaving, but on your check out day if you need them to hold your bags for the day before departing, they will.

We overheard her telling a coworker she was working overtime, you would not have even known considering the smile on her face and how quick and efficient she was. She even bumped us up to a queen pod instead of the full pod we booked. I cannot say enough good things about her, someone give this woman a raise \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \n\nA gentleman helped us onto the elevator and ensured our key cards worked to get to our floor, which was very appreciated. He really went above and beyond to make us for welcomed! \n\nEntering our room, we were not disappointed! There is a ton of storage space, the bed linens were spotless, and the bathroom was also very clean. The bed was very comfortable and the checkout time was not until noon, this was great to be able to sleep in and not feel rushed after a late night out in the city. \n\nThe location of Pod Times Square was fantastic, we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and the self-park garage across the street was great to be able to have access to anything we may have forgot in the car. \nAs 2 younger woman staying in the city, we felt very safe here and will definitely be back!!

In general terms our stay was fine; the excellent geographical location very close to important attractions and places to visit, as well as public transportation; Security through electronic cards for the elevator and the room are strengths to consider. Despite the fact that the rooms are small, we liked the cleanliness of the bathrooms and the water service. Some suggestions for improvements are: 1- If the client does not ask for the room to be cleaned daily, they do not do it. Before our complaint that the room was not ready, they told us that we should sign up on a list at the reception. We did it but still another day we had to ask the reception again for cleaning and change of clean towels. We consider it important to pay attention to this point, since cleanliness is essential for a comfortable stay for customers. 2- The hotel does not have its own cafeteria, so hotel guests must look for nearby cafeterias to have breakfast. At the end of our stay we found out in a nearby cafeteria that hotel guests enjoyed a discount on breakfast. Despite the fact that we stayed for around ten nights, this benefit was not communicated to us, so we could not take advantage of it. We suggest better communication and information with customers. 3- Despite the fact that the Hells Kitchen neighborhood (where the hotel is located) celebrates an annual international gastronomy fair, we found out on the last day of that event when it was ending. Once again, we suggest better information about the activities of the community and the city that can be enjoyed by hotel guests. 4- The hotel has a bar, which during our stay was closed most of the time. Several nights we wanted to have a drink but could not.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Domestic staff were very helpful and room cleaned daily unless we requested it to be left.  Iron was requested and this and ironing board were delivered to the room within 10 minutes. \nCLENLINESS: Room was clean although the main bedroom door could have done with a wipe over.  Room cleaned daily.\nFACILITIES: Two lifts which took you from Ground floor to the reception area. 6 lifts which took you from reception area \/ bar \/ resturaunt to the bedroom floors. This meant you only had to wait a few moments before a lift arrived. Your room key is needed to access the lifts and this will only allow you to access the floor your room is located on. This improves security. \nThe resuraunt area has outside seating with views of the city as well as indoor tables. Decore is extreamly tasteful. Food is lovely.\nROOM: The bedroom was as stated on the website. This consisted of a large comfortable bed. Pillows were a little thin and had to be doubled over to suit my sleeping position. Beside the bed there was a small table with charging points and a phone. At the bottom of the bed was another small unit which contained a safe. Storage space available under the bed for shoes and suitcases. There was 4 hangers for clothes. (could do with more hanging space)  We had an on suite which comprised of a shower , toilet, sink and toiletries. The shower\/ toilet cubicle was wall to ceiling frosted glass which didn't provide a great deal of privacy. OK if you are with partner or on your own but not good if sharing with friends.  Bedroom door was metal and had a security latch on the inside. Again this was good for solo travelers. \nThe hotel was quiet so no issues with sleeping.\nAREA: Handy for Times square and transport links around the city and further.  There was groups of people smoking weed around the exterior of the building but this was normal for all of the Times square area and not a reflection on the Hotel or people stying there.\n\nOVERALL:  I would stay here again when next in New York but will bring hangers and an extra pillow.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was myself and my teen daughter. We were on a budget trip to NYC and this fit the price! Compared to what other area hotels were charging this was a deal! We had a bunk room and it was tiny but not terrible. We had enough space for us and our bags. Pros: it was cheap! They allowed us to check-in early which was a huge bonus and they also will hold bags free of charge after check-out. Full-sized amenities in the shower. Beds and temperature of the room were comfortable. Wi-fi in the room. Elevators were timely, not too much waiting. Cons: It's in good proximity to Times Square but I'd stay closer to 8th ave next time. We hated the bathroom!! The door didn't shut all of the way. It's a frosted glass sliding door and every time that you tired to shut it, it would just slide back open. Door also doesn't go to the top of the wall. Zero bathroom privacy in this room. The entire bathroom is frosted glass wall so whenever anyone is in there, it lights up the entire room. The shower was horrible! Took forever for the water to get warm and very low pressure. Some room features didn't work - light on the top bunk was broken and bluetooth connectors to the tv weren't functional. No tissue, only toilet paper. I really hate that every hotel in the area is charging a resort fee and this one was no exception. Don't feel like we really had anything that justified a resort fee - at check-in they give a 20% off coupon for the restaurant which was only open one night of our stay.  Housekeeping needs to be requested and we didn't know that until we saw the request sheet when dropping off our keys. Lobby is very cramped and busy. Really disliked the two elevators. One to get from the ground floor, one to get to your room (you need to tap your key then hit your floor!!! also not explained to us at check in). Overall, it served its purpose for a budget stay but I wouldn't stay here again. ","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"NONE"}

To get from the lobby to the rooms is via a second bank of elevators that is activated by your room key, meaning only those staying on each floor can access that floor. We stayed in a bunk room with bath & like other Pod hotels it is small but well laid out. There was ample access to everything including USB plugs, but we did miss a small fridge that we had at other Pod hotels. The bath sits inside the door behind a glass barn door, but because the shower curtain was too short, water ended up everywhere. They need longer shower curtains with magnets to hold it closed.

To the end when checking out, and getting an eye roll when I said I was wanting to check out (different girl) and then the concierge not being helpful, he went running off to laugh & joke with a friend when mid telling me something. Luggage storage broke my suitcase and I didn\u2019t realise until I left the building and was already running late for a flight (was fine in the morning when I left it with them but they\u2019d put all the suitcases on top of each other and didn\u2019t realise I could see them just yanking them & bashing them around from the door).\n\nDo not use the concierge service to the airport, much cheaper options, depending on the time of day.

It's a tall building, we were on floor 17 and had a great view down to the freedom tower.\nRoom was just right, clean,tidy and just right for two people.  A little more space might have been appreciated, but not a big deal.\nPoint to note....toilet light goes on and because its a glass enclosure with bunk beds backing on to it....the light may wake up who is sleeping !\nDecor is bright, corridors slightly in need of refurbishment but I certainly didn't feel I was staying in a place that was dated.\nDidn't use the bar,it did seem lively a couple of times. Good bag drop room if you have a late flight out of NY.\nI would recommend this hotel. Got it at a decent ( for NY) price. Clean and tidy and friendly staff are my must haves...it had these.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel entrance is on 42nd st near the 9th ave intersection. Subway stations are all around too. \n\nTimes Square is a short walk away (10 minutes depending on how much you dawdle) as are many of the major Broadway shows. Javits Centre where my conference was held was only a 10 minute walk too. There are lots of food and drink options whichever direction you head. \n\nThe room itself was small, simple and clean. Lots of usb charging ports and hooks and coat hangers. I had a bunk Pod and each of the beds had it\u2019s own charging area and tv. The bathroom was small but well appointed. The water was hot with good pressure and the bathroom items were great. Nice fluffy towels too. There is no room service (which I was clearly told when I checked in -> you have to request this) but I didn\u2019t mind - once you get to my age you\u2019ve learnt to make your own bed. \n\nI stayed on the 10th floor and didn\u2019t suffer from any of the noise issues that have been commented on. Once you get the hang of the lift to the lobby, then a different lift to street level it\u2019s pretty simple. I didn\u2019t have much to do with the staff, but anyone I spoke to was friendly and polite - the porters in light blue shirts were super lovely. The luggage storage after I checked out \/ before I headed to the airport was appreciated. \n\nThe room prices were very reasonable for the area (keeping in mind everything in New York is more expensive). Pod doesn\u2019t present to be flashy with extras and pluses galore.

The room was small, but I got the Full bed which was very comfortable, but the room is definitely only good for 1 person at a time. The bathroom really roomy and easy to spread out all my beauty stuff and overall style very modern. The checkin was easy and they let me in the room before the official check in time, and the elevators are fast. ","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We asked about the breakfast, he told us that it was not possible, without further explanation. The lady for the check out was very nice, helpful and smiling so really two different experiences.\nThe room was small but the bed was nice. The walls of the bathroom are made of opaque glass which is a bit disturbing and leaves less intimacy. the main problem is the lamps, we used the bathroom lamps to light the room","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}
