We travel there at least twice a year. This particular vacation was fraught with disasterous airline\/FAA controllers issues. We were trapped in NYC for an extra week because of the enormous amounts of cancelled flights. We booked the Belleclaire for our forced extended stay due to our familiarity with the hotel (we have stayed there before). \nLet me first tell you that we have always enjoyed our stay at this hotel. But, it was quite conforting to know that even though we were stuck in NYC for an extra week, we would be well taken care of by the hotel and staff. The staff, all of them, from management to the regular employees are wonderful.\nThey are responsive to requests, they help you with transportation and things to do and see.\nWe also couldnt ask for a cleaner hotel. They really take pride in their appearance and it shows. I mean, come on, this is NYC, the land of tourism! You would think that with that much foot trafffic coming and going, the place would be kind of run down, worn out. I assure you that it is not.\nAn additionak benefit is the most lovely french cafe in the lobby, yes it does get quite busy, but people like good things so the crowds can grow for the cafe alait and pastries.\nThe location of the hotel on the upper west side is perfect. When in NYC you tend to walk a lot! This hotel is centrally situated and is walkable to most spots you would want to visit. The subway system is still decent in NYC and this hotel is close to the subway lines. The added benefit for us, is the location to Columbus Ave, Broadway and Amsterdam Ave. Theses streets on the UWS contain so many restaurants and bodegas that you will be able to eat, whatever tye of food you want, whenever you want.\nSo a quick recap. This is our favorite hotel in NYC! I reccomend staying here any time you travel to th 'Big Apple'.\nKudos to the Belleclaire for this gem of a place. Go, you'll be gad you did.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I had a relatively spacious Delux King room, although the bathroom was tiny without any surfaces on which to store anything. Good quality bed and linen. Small closet without shelving or draws. Decent lighting. Paper thin walls  allowed one to hear everything from plumbing to babies in neighboring rooms.  Front desk service decent, but housekeeping erratic (on one occasion it took 3 requests before an extra bath towel was provided). Breakfasts at adjoining Mille Fuille bakery not bad,. but long lines, and after 6 days got a bit repetitive.

It is conveniently near the number 1 subway on 79th street and the neighborhood is quite walkable.\n\nAt first I was seriously considering nearby hotels that seemed to offer a better value price-wise, but decided to splurge a bit and my friend and I are glad we did \u2013 we enjoyed our stay very much.\n\nBecause this stay was a bit of a splurge I'll be looking for values in the future and booking here again will be based on current prices (post-pandemic sticker shock!)\n\nHotel Belleclaire is part of a collection of Triumph hotels, of which there are five - there are walking tours and wine hours offered every day at one of the hotels. It's very nice that guests at one hotel are welcome to join a wine hour (5-6pm) or morning (10am) walking tour at another of the hotel locations if not staying on a day when the wine hour or tour is offered at the hotel where booked.\n\nEveryone we encountered at Hotel Belleclaire was flawlessly professional and helpful. I'd also like to mention that I was a bit confused at some of the fees listed online (NYC and NY state really load on the 'resort' and other fees!) - but when I called the hotel desk Josh was quite kind and helpful in explaining the price structure to me and this really helped to influence my choice to book with Hotel Belleclaire, because there were no hidden fees at least.\n\nThe room was altogether lovely. My friend and I enjoyed the very comfortable double beds, Frette bedding and C.O. Bigelow toiletries. Blackout shades were really appreciated in the morning.\n\nIt was nice to have bottled water waiting in the room on arrival.\nThe CVS across the street was handy in getting additional drinking water - however, it would have been fantastic to have additional water available right in the hotel throughout our stay.\n\nThe only issue was that the room was not as well sound-proofed as it could have been.\nI was awoken a bit after midnight after turning in around 11pm by voices in a nearby room. It seemed to be a calm conversation but it was loud enough to disturb my sleep.  I cut the sound down a bit by closing our room's bathroom door. \n\nOn returning to the room after breakfast someone in the room on the other side was participating in an online meeting and we could hear every word. This wasn't an issue because we were ready to check out, however if we ourselves needed to join a zoom meeting we would have needed to use headphones.\n\nI understand that soundproofing can't always be perfect in city hotels - I'm just mentioning our experience so others may know it may be helpful to bring earplugs for a sound night's sleep - I certainly will next time! \n\nMille-feuille Bakery Caf\u00e9 is certainly an important asset to Hotel Belleclaire! Not many hotels offer breakfast in NYC and this is an outstanding bakery in the Parisian tradition. Each guest receives a voucher for $10 at the bakery or the Allure restaurant for brunch or lunch - which we didn't try. \nThe bakery staff were very warm and welcoming - and although my heart sank a bit when I saw how long the line of other hotel guests was - snaking down the hotel hobby - the line moved efficiently enough along.\n\nSeating was plentiful if the seats in the hotel lobby were taken in to account - but we very much enjoyed being able to have breakfast at the tables outside and felt a part of the lively streetscape on Broadway!\n\nMost important -  I'm vegan and I was able to find something for breakfast - the whole grain loaf was truly fantastic, and I really appreciated that oatmilk and almond milk were options.  I am used to traveling with my own snacks because vegan options are often unavailable - so I rounded out my breakfast with almonds - however it would be absolutely fantastic if a vegan yogurt or assortment of nuts or almond or peanut butter were also available as a source of vegan protein.\n\n(I understand that traditionally French bakeries are not vegan - however, friends in Paris tell me more and more French eateries are providing vegan options - so why not follow this trend...?)\n\nCheck-out was smooth and there were no surprises - the hotel lists all additional fees to the room rate clearly on their website. A small complaint -  I peeked into the fitness center - it's a small room with weights and a Pelotan - if it is possible to partner with an area fitness club or yoga studio that would be another enticement to stay again! I'm a fitness swimmer and  yoga enthusiast and being able to try a new studio or pool - even with a small additional fee \u2013 would have been nice.","travelDate":"2024-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Staff at reception is mixed - some are amazing whereas others could do with some training in terms of the advice they provide. There is a 'facilities fee' of about $30 per night. The fee is used to cover the breakfast. Breakfast is served in the small cafe in the hotel. People get a voucher of 2x$10 per night to redeem. There are not many seating options there, so people seem to take the breakfast to their room or eat in the restaurant\/lobby space. Lines can be long. The facilities fee is also used to cover internet but one day the internet was down which is highly problematic if you are there on business. The facilities fee is simply an additional fee on top of your room rate but I struggled to see the benefit.

Its convenient location within walking distance to Central Park, along with a great bakery next door and an elegant bar inside, made our stay enjoyable. The hotel itself was gorgeous and maintained impeccable cleanliness, from the lobby and our hotel room.\n\nThe experience of being in New York was already exciting, and the staff at Hotel Belleclaire added to it. In particular, I'd like to commend Mark for his exceptional service. He was professional, knowledgeable, and incredibly welcoming.

The rooms are bright, clean and cheerful, and even the smaller one felt spacious enough, with a king bed, two night tables, a small dresser and a desk with a chair. The larger of the rooms had a small sitting area (with another table and chair).\n\nThere\u2019s a lovely lobby area with tables for breakfast, which later becomes part of the attached restaurant, Allure. We love sitting in the lobby in the mornings over breakfast, and we\u2019ve eaten twice at Allure (once for brunch and once for a light dinner with cocktails) \u2013 the d\u00e9cor is beautiful and the atmosphere is really festive. An amazing bonus is the French Bakery (Millefeuille) that you can enter from the lobby, and for which the hotel gives you a $10 voucher per person per day of your visit. Millefeuille was already one of our favorite bakeries, and with the vouchers it\u2019s been completely irresistible!\n\nBut the most fabulous (and I mean fabulous!) thing about the Belleclaire is the staff. From the doorman to the front desk personnel to the restaurant waiters and cleaning staff, they are without exception attentive, efficient, caring and delightful! They\u2019ve made every aspect of our stay even better. \n\nBenedict, Maria and Veronica not only took care of everything we needed (sometimes before we even asked) but their fun-loving, joyful personalities have kept us smiling the whole time. \n\nChristian arranged for us to extend our stay.

She made the effort to check with me afterwards as well, to make sure all was ok. They also give you vouchers to use at the bakery downstairs for each day which is great, although it can get a bit \u201csamey\u201d as although their selection of pastries is good, there isn\u2019t much else to choose and they don\u2019t do many vegetarian options in the non-sweet selection.

If it wasn\u2019t for the room!\n\nWhen we stayed last year (September of 2023) we were quite happy with the room. It was clean, small but adequately sized, funky angles and view into other hotel rooms from the window, but we liked it.\n\nForward to January 2024.  I arrived on a one night solo stay in an \u201cstandard full\u201d. Again, the \u201cexperience\u201d was fine. When I opened the door into my small room my first thought was:  \nTHIS IS A CELL IN A MONASTERY. OR A ROOM IN A YOUTH HOSTEL.\n\nI understand industrial aesthetic, but this is just so bleak and bare. All hard surfaces and echo.  The bed frame looks like a fold out cot- maybe a temporary piece of furniture? Not a soft surface in the room. No window treatments. No half-quilt on the bed. Just bare sheets.\n\nNo noise insulation, and my neighbors in the two rooms next store were drunk-conversing and slamming doors at 3 am.\n\nEven with the industrial style window blind closed, the room was not dark enough for good sleep. \n\nThere appeared to be fresh paint and plaster drips on the floor. \n\nI think that this room is likely not indicative of all the rooms at the Belleclaire. I understand that I did not book a room at a luxury property.

The location is great, near Lincoln Center, Natural History Museum and Central Park. It is not as noisy as a Times Square hotel. The area is quiet and tow blocks away from Metro station line 1 or 5 blocks away from Metro stations 2 and 3. Aside from other hotels in NY, they give you a 10 dollar ticket a day to purchase your breakfast at Mille-foullie, a French bakery next to the hotel. Although is expensive, you can get a coffee and a pastry, and the pastries are delicious. The only negative thing is that it is very small and very little place to dine in. You can get your breakfast at the hotel\u2019s restaurant, but between 9 and 10 am it is hard to find a place to sit, I suggest to go earlier. The rooms are well equipped but there is no fridge in common rooms, only in suites. Beds are very comfortable, and so are pillows . There is only one elevator working, if you are lucky and get higher floors, you can always get in but if you are in 4th floor or less, you always have to wait. Elevators are too old and there is a service elevator in case of emergency, cause the day the only one working, broke down, we have to use the emergency one. People from reception are very nice and comfy, and I have to congratule Jaelle, Benedict and Mark, that been very nice and helpful with me. I had a problem with the tidy up room service, that for two days in a row, they forgot to come in, and people from reception come up with a quick and helpful solution.

We really loved the suite - highly recommend. It's bigger than our daughter's NYC apartment!!

That made us very happy.\nI'm taking the time to post reviews of this hotel because we did have an issue we couldn't resolve when we were there, due to the sudden Go Time rush of a wedding (which was in Central Park -- this is a great hotel for that location!).

First, grossly overpriced at $600 a night (including tax) for a tiny room without even a closet or a single hanger. Taking advantage of the new ban on Airbnb's? Adding insult to the price injury, as we checked out of our pre-paid room, they added a $30 \"facility\/resort fee.\" For what? This is no resort, and they had already charged me $600 for access to their \"facility.\" Protesting did no good. WiFi was very weak, and was limited to one device per person, so you can't use hotel WiFi on both a cellphone and a tablet unless you have multiple different email addresses; I do and it still didn't work. I've never seen this in any other hotel we've stayed at. Walls were paper thin; we went to bed listening to someone across the hall and one room down tongue-lashing her partner for a half-hour. Were awakened before 7am Sunday morning by someone in the next room on an extended phone call. So we went downstairs to get coffee and a pastry at the in-house breakfast bar. The hotel provided complimentary coupons as part of the room price; how nice! The place was so tiny that the slow-moving line stretched down the hall - this just for hotel patrons trying to take advantage of the \"free\" continental breakfast coupons.

Virtually no place to store anything in the shower or bathroom, and only a single hanging photo.\n\nThe only other thing that bothered me was that I was granted a later checkout, but found out the hard way that my key was disabled regardless.

The room was a good size and overlooked Broadway.  The location is superb.  I made sure I took advantage of the complimentary benefits (breakfast vouchers, wine night, free walking tour) since I am essentially paying for them.  However, the breakfast vouchers meant everyone at the hotel is waiting in the same line - give yourself at least 30 minutes each morning.  The selections of pastries and espresso was great but fruit options were nil.  By the 5th day, I was tired of the breakfast.  \n\nAlso, with it being an old hotel, our shower's temperature controls were OUTSIDE the shower\/tub itself.  With a piece of fixed glass covering half the tub, you have to get inside the tub to turn on the water and if the temperature isn't satisfactory, you have to then get out and fix it outside the tub (in front of toilet).  Our rug had pet hair that hadn't been vacuumed thoroughly.  Also, no fridge (despite what Tripadvisor says) or kettle in the room - would've been nice to have.  \n\nFront desk service was fabulous. The bed was very comfortable.  As others have mentioned, the elevators are tiny - we were lucky to be on the 8th floor but we had to pass by many folks on the 5-6 floors.  All in all, we had a nice stay but for the price and \"resort fees\", I may choose one where I just grab my own breakfasts and sign up for free tours on foot.  Although the hotel talks about providing all these \"complimentary\" items such as wine night and walking tours, the \"resort fees\" really cover activities you may or may not partake.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Not familiar with the names?Y You will be after your stay at Hotel Belleclaire, a former Grande Dame of New York's Upper West Side, but no snob. Those names are attached to a few of the smiling faces you will meet during your stay. They and their equally charming, helpful colleagues will do their best to accommodate your every need and make your stay memorable. \n\nBuilt around 1903 and once home to the likes of Mark Twain and Babe Ruth, Belleclaire received a major facelift in 2008. A fitness room was added. The lobby was updated in 2013, and, voila, back to the future was complete.\n\nThe (relatively) modestly priced digs at Belleclaire felt Scandinavian modern - read understated elegance or all things minimal, but essential in place.\n\nOur only gripe was a temperamental internet. But at our departure Jonathan, who is director of the front office, happily informed us the whole system was about to be updated. In addition, the hotel will soon host a brand new restaurant  called Allure.  Jonathan also told us his favorite rooms at Belleclaire are the Broadway Kings (?).  If we did not get that quite right, ask any of the above hosts for one of the rooms with rounded walls. \n\nFaces make places and the list above really aim (and almost always succeed) to please. \n\nComfortable digs,  a helpful staff, a great location, reasonably priced, with plenty of built-in amenities.

The hotel is really basic with rather small rooms and no windows opening and very small washbasins and bathrooms. Fonic insulation is weak so you can hear everything from the neighbours. Beds are though comfortable and sio sleep was good. Breakfast is offered via a very good bakery accesible from the lobby though limited to pastry, coffee, juice or yogurt. Therefore, qeues are long or very ling in the morning. Eating breakfast in the bakery or the lobby is very much limited by the limited space available. Staff was very nice from the beginning to the end. Location of the hotel in Uppe West Side, in the proximity of the subway on Broadway makes it very accesible.

So far a four to five rating for Hotel Belleclaire. BUT: When we checked out the doorman advised us, that we should take a taxis to Newark airport. I said that we planned to take an UBER. He said because of a parade it would be difficult and very expensive to take an UBER at the time (2 pm) , we were supposed to leave for the airport. I asked him, how much the taxi would cost. He said around USD 100 plus tip. He would organize everything for us. When we left the hotel, the taxi was waiting for us. I asked the driver for the price to the airport. He answered: USD 150 plus tolls and tip. I said an UBER would cost us USD 115 inkl. tolls.  Indicated time to pick us up from\nUBER was four  minutes at that time. After some discussion we agreed on USD 115 inkl. tolls if we pay cash. Just after after departure from the hotel, the driver began a conversation with somebody over the speakers of the taxi (which was very dirty), where somebody (probably his boss) told him, that the \u201cfxxxx\u201d passengers should pay more. He asked us for more money. I told him UBER would take us for the agreed USD 115. He drove us back to the hotel. My wife and my two children really felt offended by that guy. We took an UBER. When we left Belleclaire, the taxi was still waiting in front of the hotel. I take a bet, that the doorman \u201csold\u201d it to the next tourist.

But guests didn't appear to share tables and several were done eating but didn't leave their table despite some waiting to sit. We took our breakfast back to our room.  That is a bit of a challenge since the elevators require you use your key to access your floor by waving the card and pushing the floor button, all while holding your drink and bag.

Having only stayed with friends when visiting in the past, it was my first time staying in a hotel in NYC and bringing my family along, and we were pleasantly surprised by everything. Wonderful staff\/service (both the lobby and housekeeping). Our room and bathroom were clean, comfortable, and had all the amenities we needed for our family of three. And it didn't hurt to have one of the *best* French bakeries in the city as the included breakfast for our family every morning! So much better than the barely edible \"continental\" breakfasts at chain hotels that cost the same per night. Our tween especially loved being down the street from Sephora *and* right next door to LUSH (and the wonderful aromas from their store doors always being open, plus the French bakery open to the hotel lobby, were such a nice escape from the otherwise oft-unpleasant smells of the city :)). \n\nP.S. Yes, the elevators are on the smaller side and the hallways aren't super wide, but honestly that didn't bother us. Part of life in a big city is that you are going to have to maximize efficiency in small spaces and get used to being around others! ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It\u2019s such a shame to be writing this negative review.  We had a wonderful stay at the Belleclaire.  The staff were lovely, the location perfect.  I booked via Trivago \/ Algotels and paid upfront.  And was told THREE times by the hotel that we had paid in full and there was nothing more to pay - once when I called to check a fortnight before arriving, then when we checked in, and again when we checked out.  So what a shock to find a debit for over $120 when I received my credit card bill a couple of weeks after checking out.  I called straightaway to query this, and was told that it is a \u201cfacilities fee\u201d - something that had NOT been mentioned beforehand.  So I then emailed, and waited.  Nothing.  So I sent a second email.  Again, no reply.  So I\u2019m now raising a dispute via my credit card company, but just want to warn anyone else off.  In the scheme of things, it\u2019s not a great deal of money, but it\u2019s the principle of raising random charges without letting people know.  And I\u2019m even more annoyed because we recommended the Belleclaire (before this spurious charge) to a friend of ours who has booked for his extended family of 8.  Oh, and I\u2019ve checked out \u201cfacility fee\u201d on their website.

Hotel Belleclaire and its staff have reaffirmed my disposition. From the Frette linen, bath, robes and slippers to the Mille Feuille coffee shop in the lobby you are guaranteed to never stay at another hotel exactly like this one. You will never be greeted as warmly as my family and I was by Shanies and Mike. And I'm still trying to figure out how a boutique hotel on the UWS can be so family friendly. My kids are 12, 10 and 8 and it was no sweat - for me and apparently not for the staff either. Even the other guests were happy to see my kids - that's different.

Beds were FANTASTIC and pillows were AWESOME - I usually hate hotel pillows and sleep terribly but these were great. Loved the fact that there was an actual floor and not a grungy\/filthy carpet in the room. Bathroom well-appointed, if very small. Room was no-frills (no fridge or coffee\/tea maker). Could hear some street noise (e.g., ambulances passing) but not a problem. Fantastic location, easy walk to 72nd street subway and only 1 stop to 42nd street\/Broadway shows on express train - local is only slightly longer at 3-4 stops. Close to both Central Park and, in the other direction, Riverside park. We walked all over. Fabulous restaurants a block or two away on Amsterdam. We loved Miriam (middle eastern) and Sala Thai. Cannot beat this location. Daily vouchers ($10 per person) for Mille Feuille bakery downstairs are a real plus - coffee is the best and baked goods outstanding but  few savory options if you want a nutritional\/healthy breakfast.

The hotel is newly renovated. Well done to the hotel for a nice fit out. \n\nIf you want an atmospheric boutique experience in an authentic neighbourhood - the Upper West Side (Seinfeld country) then this is a good choice. It's a very central location near two subways 72nd and 79th st, and Central Park, hence the high rates they command. \n\nWas a bit alarmed when I checked in at 9.30pm to be given a room with no view - but on the plus side there was also no noise. The room was compact, commensurate with the age of the building. Was going to request a room change in the morning but I slept very well in that room and decided to stay there. \n\nShout out to the young lad Michael, I think, who gave me a warm and friendly welcome on check in, after my rather long shuttle ride from Newark. He put me on to the fabulous nearby Sala Thai eatery where I ended up having three meals.\n\nThe hotel is 1903 art nouveau\/beaux art style. It\u2019s just gorgeous! So the lifts and hallways are not your modern day dimensions. Didn't bother me and makes me laugh at the reviewers complaining about the charming vagaries of a 120 year old building. These people should go to Holiday Inn next time.\n\nBed was good and nice cotton linens. Good aircon. The room had been renovated recently so very good condition. Room was serviced daily which seems to be a rarity these days.\n\nPaid an astronomical price of $300 usd incl taxes per night but that's NY for you. I believe the month of May is graduation season and consequently the UWS accom area is very busy. The whole world wants to travel now as well! \n\nI was thinking of staying at the nearby Hotel Beacon, down the road, which has kitchenettes and which we've stayed at before. But their prices ranged from $450-$600++ a night the whole three months prior to travel. So it's all relative between Hotel Belleclaire and Hotel Beacon (which offers cooking facilities). The location is basically the same. There are two fabulous food markets 5 minutes walk from both these hotels - the Fairway Market and the wonderful Zabars.\n\nWi-Fi was ok. Did disconnect from time to time. I would have liked a coffee maker in the room.  The included breakfast at the adjacent, excellent French bakery makes the stay very pleasant. You can take your pastry\/quiche and coffee to a dining lounge next to reception. \n\nTo summarise, I enjoyed my stay at Hotel Belleclaire, despite the\nview being basically out to a light well, the room was in very good condition, quiet and the staff are friendly and the breakfast yum. I think I'd go for a broadway king room next time. They are the rooms on the curved facade and would have good views of Broadway. \n\nAirport transportation.\nFrom Newark\nOn arrival I ordered a go Airlink shuttle for $42 from Newark. Not sure I'd recommend this. Took 1.5 hrs to get in to Manhattan, due to having to wait for another party. I'd recommend having Skype and connectivity for this mode if you are coming from offshore. Do your homework on this. \n\nTo JFK \nTo get to JFK to fly out I caught an Uber ($25) to Grand Central station 383 Madison entrance, where there\u2019s a connection to Long Island railway which takes you to Jamaica station. ($5.26), from there you catch the jfk air train ($9.25). Takes up to an hour and a half and would only be doable with minimal luggage as there\u2019s some big escalator rides at Grand Central Station.\n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

A 3 minutes walk away from the underground line 1\/2\/3 that will take you pretty much all around Manhattan and Brooklyn (with the right connection). The staff was lovely and super helpful, our deepest THANK YOU to Maria, Hector and the entire team for making our stay the best experience in NYC. \n\nOnly note on the WiFi; is a bit tricky to access, but it's an easy IT job to fix. Also, the bakery inside the hotel would elevate the experience by providing Vegan Options as they have so many lovely pastries and croissants but unfortunately, all with dairy. \n\nOverall very looking forward to come back and enjoy the new improvements in the Hotel are happening by Summer this year.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

How about being transparent about your pricing rather than trying to bait-and-switch people?\n\nI refused to pay this nonsense charge, because it wasn't included in any of my booking documents (either during the booking process or in the confirmation document itself). They don't get to demand a hidden fee at the point of handing you the key. \n\nThen they told me that I had to pay a $350 deposit as well... I asked why, and was told that this represented $50 per night deposit. So, by their logic, I had to pay more than someone else who was staying for one or two nights, as a deposit, because I'd pre-paid to stay longer? This made no sense to me, so I refused this also. I told them they could take a $50 deposit and no more, and that I would not be authorizing any other payments to the hotel.\n \nThis was not the kind of experience I was expecting after travelling for about 15 hours to get there. There was no \"can we get you a coffee\" or \"how was your trip?\" - it was simply \"and now we'll be charging you money you never agreed to pay\". \n\nThe room wasn't what I expected really; there were holes in the ceiling where previous light fittings were, and the walls are VERY thin - we could hear every single thing happening within 30 yards of us, from doors opening and closing (loudly) to people in adjacent rooms turning their showers on and flushing the toilets. You can't open the window (at all) which is poor. The hot water doesn't work a fair proportion of the time, which at one point meant we were stuck in the hotel room since we couldn't shower or wash for most of a day. \n\nThe worst part of the whole week was having to keep on explaining to different people (honestly, how many \"managers\" do they have?) about the extra fees they were trying to charge us. After all of this, and after one of these \"managers\" telling me in reception that I was being entirely fair, that she'd read the documents and I was right, there was no mention of any fees due, *THE HOTEL STILL TRIED TO CHARGE MY CREDIT CARD, WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION*. \n\nIt wasn't enough for them to cast a shadow over our whole week there by creating this tension, but then they agreed I didn't need to pay and tried to illegally take the money anyway.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location was ideal for us and we were happy to have chosen it over Time Square which is a super busy and overcrowed area. The Belleclaire area is more residential, very safe, next to the Beacon Theater and very close to the Natural History Museum and Central Park. There are subway stations on both W 72nd and W 79th and there is a lot of shopping in the area.\nThe hotel, opened in 1903, has a very beautiful architecture. It is a renovated building, but it has kept the original style and decoration. The lobby and breakfast area were under renovation, with a somewhat neglected appearance because of this and we found the area too small for the number of guests. The two existing elevators were frankly insufficient for so many floors and so many guests.\nCheck-in was a bit impersonal, we didn't feel a particularly warm welcome. There was some confusion with our rooms, but it was quickly resolved.\nGiven the age of the hotel, the stairs and corridors are a bit dated, but they are clean and well maintained. The rooms were very good and looked very clean and renovated. They were cleaned daily. The only thing that we didn't like was the sound isolation. You could hear everything and it seemed that the guests in the rooms next door were in our own room, which is not pleasant as it seems that there is no privacy.\nOur stay included breakfast (with this additional cost paid in advance). This hotel breakfast has its own system, it is not the typical buffet breakfast. The hotel has a direct connection to a bakery-coffe shop (Mille-Feuille) and gives guests daily vouchers worth $10 per person. Both the bakery and the breakfast area are too small for so many people. Prices in NY are high, so 10$ to cover breakfast helps, but not much. There was little variety because the bakery mostly offers croissants and other cakes. It became repetitive and the voucher was insufficient for other types of products, so it was almost always necessary to give more money to cover the order.\nDespite some less positive points that really need to be improved, we would return to this hotel for the fantastic location and cleanliness of the rooms.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The only things really missing are tea and coffee facilities but this should not detract anyone.\n\nThe location itself is good - a subway station on the corner of the next block along can get you a train to Times Square in 5 stops, and Central Park is a mile walk away which is well worth visiting. Plenty of shops, bars and eateries around and I gather they are building a restaurant within the hotel which I am sure will be good.\n\nThe hotel take a $50 per night deposit for damages, you get this back (or are meant to more to follow!) upon checkout, but they also charge a $24 daily resort fee which is used against the deposit so that the difference is returned at the end of your stay. This $24 is for the following\n\nUse of the hotel gym which is on the first floor and can be accessed with your room card at anytime, has a handful of exercise items in\n\nUse of the hotels wi-fi which is simply logging in with your email and quality is good\n\nA $10 breakfast voucher per guest per night for the cafe which is within their lobby, they serve a good variety of hot drinks, sandwiches, pastries and cakes which are well worth having as are great quality\n\nThey also have a luggage room for storing luggage if your having to wait for an airport taxi after checking out (check out time is at 12pm)\n\nNow onto the checkout.....which is where our experience sours somewhat\n\nUpon checking out we were presented with a $323 bill for the room (bearing in mind we had prepaid it through our holiday booking with British Airways) so we then went back to the front desk and asked them about this at which point they realised our mistake and Maria assured us that not only would this be corrected but they would also waive the resort fees - problem solved\n\nWell NO far from solved, they put the resort fees of $72 back on our card as a credit but then put the remaining difference of $251 on as a DEBIT meaning we were now $502.00 out of pocket - and from reading some recent reviews it seems this is not the first time there have been billing errors like this!\n\nWe had to call them from back in the UK on 2 separate occasions before we were given an assurance by one of the girls on the desk that it had been done, but at this point we were only refunded $251 and not $502 as we should have been\n\n2 more calls to the duty manager Benedict and nearly 2 weeks later and the matter is nearing resolution but we have not been refunded the resort fees (despite the earlier promise) so we have emailed him asking about this\n\nSo in short would I recommend this place YES - but be wary and careful upon checking out!\n\nWould I stay again based on the overall experience, never say never, but our immediate reaction after what we've experienced with the billing errors and how long its taken to resolve something which could have easily been avoided is a NO","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

A large, homey and clearly designed living area gave way to the king bed, more windows (all with room-darkening shades) a fuzzy shag rug and dressing table.

This was our first time staying at the Hotel Belleclaire in the upper Westside. It was truly a wonderful experience. I was a little cautious at first.

It\u2019s a great location and we were able to take the train to within two blocks of its location on 77th and Broadway. It\u2019s a beautiful old building nicely restored with a quaint French bakery attached. The neighborhood was clean and safe. We arrived early, around 12 noon, but Maria, at the front desk, was wonderful and allowed us an early check-in at one, once the room was clean. The weather was nice, so we walked to Central Park which was about a 10 minute easy walk from the hotel. When we returned, Maria had a room available, which she upgraded so that we had a bit more room, and a wonderful front facing view. On arrival we were also given a gift box of macaroons which my daughter loves as well as breakfast tickets for the continental breakfast they provide from the bakery next-door. Coming out of the pandemic, it was a real pleasure to experience such wonderful customer service! The young man who was the bellman was a gem. Full of great information and recommendations. On top of the kind and professional staff, the room was lovely as well. It was renovated, clean and comfortable. The bathroom had a great shower.

The Hotel is located UWS away from the madding crowd, yet easy to access anywhere in Manhattan with multiple subway and bus options only a few short blocks away. \n\nAlso fantastic was the little French cafe attached to the hotel which, dependent on your room rate, you are provided vouchers which can be redeemed in the morning. \n\nBut maybe it was the discounted TravelZoo deal that we took advantage of to book our stay (I don\u2019t know for sure) but the room we got was small\/poky and without any basic amenities that you expect in a hotel room of today (coffee maker, glasses). Our bathroom was poorly designed, so much so the toilet literally sat under the vanity. And yes I know NY hotel rooms are known to be on the \u2018small side\u2019, however having stayed in many hotels over the years this was just a case of poor design.\n\nThe wifi was deplorable.

Hotel Belleclaire was a wonderful find! An affordable option in the heart of NY that has grand style with modern updates and is connected to a lovely French bakery where you can enjoy a delicious pastry and a coffee or OJ on the house. \nWhen we first arrived Benedict was so friendly and upgraded our room for us so we didn't have to share a bed. The upgrade was much appreciated. The room was super clean and although on the smaller side, it was totally adequate and surprisingly quiet. The towels were bright white and very absorbant. The sheets and pillows were so comfortable and also white & crisp. The beds were also super comfortable. We requested TP for the room because for some reason it was hiding in the closet rather than hung in the bathroom so we didn't see it. A few minutes later, someone arrived with several rolls and asked if we needed anything else. We asked if there were any blankets available and were given nice quality blankets for each bed also within minutes. The service at this hotel is amazing! Everyone was so attentive and we felt very well taken care of. I was also pleasantly surprised that our room received a cleaning and a turn down service while we were out exploring the city. I thought those types of cleanings ended with Covid. Why would you stay anywhere else? It's a great value and the location can't be beat. Staying near Central Park was so much nicer than other places I have stayed in the Times Square area and you can be in Times Square in about 15 minutes by taking the Red #1 train on the subway that is one block over.\nWe will definitely return to this hotel for any future NY visits, thank you staff, we really appreciated the personal attention that we received. One area of improvement would be to fix the bad wifi signal, otherwise, no complaints from us. We loved it!","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

This is our favourite hotel and one to which we intend to return to. The foyer is beautiful and when we arrived we were warmly greeted by Benedict who was excellent during our entire 4 night stay. Nothing was any problem and he always greeted us when he saw us every day and showed interest in our plans for the day and offered good advice. Breakfast was an added bonus from the amazing French Bakery adjoining the hotel. You can get served in the hotel or in the little bakery itself and bring your breakfast into the hotel to enjoy. Having had difficulty finding a lovely diner for breakfast on our previous 3 trips meant we really appreciated having such a wonderful breakfast in our hotel. Our room (2 double beds) was beautifully appointed and newly decorated. It was extremely clean and we had maid service every day. The room was a good size by New York standards. The air conditioning was excellent. I am claustrophobic and was concerned when I read a review about the tiny lift however Benedict directed us to the service lift which is bigger and was less of a problem for me. On previous stays our hotel was closer to the main shopping areas in New York however Hotel Belleclaire is a 2 minute walk to a subway station (79th Street) which we used a lot during our stay. That said the hotel is only a 38 minute walk to the Rockefeller Centre off 5th Avenue and the walk is very pleasant passing the fabulous Columbus Circle Shopping Mall and part of the walk overlooks Central Park. The $120 taxi fare from JFK airport can be easily avoided by taking the Air Train ($8) to Howard Beach then the subway ($2.95) to Columbus Circle (about 20 or 21 stops). At Columbus Circle change to the No. 1 line to 79th Street (about 3 stops). This is about 15 minutes longer than the shortest subway route however with heavy suitcases it is the easiest in my view. It is also worth buying the $33 (7 day unlimited rides) on the subway and bus ticket.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I couldn\u2019t have picked a better hotel! With my mom mobility issues, the front desk staff (Michael, Bennett & Marial) we\u2019re SO wonderful & accommodating to me & my mom!

My only suggestion (it\u2019s my fault though, I didn\u2019t speak to someone at the bakery to see if they could\/would arrange to have something egg for my mom to eat, even if we had to pay more for it!

Plus, I do have to say, the people at the Belleclaire, as well as during our outings around NYC, were very accommodating to my mom & I, as I did have her in a wheelchair most of the time, opening & holding doors for us, giving a hand to helping us with whatever was needed at the time to help my mom be successful!

In fact, the person in charge was clear when mentioning that, as a hotel\u2019s policy, only half an hour was offered to guests as a complementary late check out. That\u2019s it. \nTo put it clear, I am not complaining because I was not given a longer late check out (even if half an hour is more of a symbolic late check out as mentioned). I am disappointed because we were not treated fairly. The front desk officer on evening Sep.  25th could have mentioned that complementary late check out was only half an hour and that was all he could offer to guests. However, he did not and this is why I understand we were not given a fair treatment. Instead of that, he sent us to speak to another colleague  the following morning knowing in advance that the answer was going to be exactly the same: half an hour late check out as a rule. \nIn a world of fierce competition, loyalty means a lot. Behaviors like these ones Do Not contribute to generate loyalty ties  with customers. \nHence, I would respectfully  suggest those responsible of Hotel Bellclaire\u2019s  customer relations to review their customer service\u2019s protocols in order to avoid in the future practices like the one above described.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Francella was sympathetic and efficient in moving me, and she even took the trouble to check in with me at the end of her evidently 12-hour shift to make sure I was truly comfortable.  \n       Pros about the hotel:  good location; attractive lobby; clean throughout; reasonable-size rooms; updated bathrooms; good beds; good elevators; wide carpeted staircases at both ends of the main corridor; streamlined room decor; no carpeting in the rooms (good for those with allergies).\n       Cons: narrow halls branching off the main corridor (tight for bulky suitcases, and seemingly likely to get clogged in an evacuation scenario); rather austere room decor; no carpeting in the rooms (an element of the spartan feel).\n       I've listed some things as both Pros and Cons because they can be viewed differently according to your preferences.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

But this made it very quiet, which was great. I'm sure there are other rooms that might be larger and have a better view but I'm sure you'll pay more (and the quiet was worth a lot!). Finally, one of the best surprises of this hotel is the Mille Feuille French bakery next door (actually there's a lobby entrance). Each room is given two $10 vouchers for each morning. This can be used on anything they sell. I even got a delicious sandwich to eat on the plane the day I left. The pastries and bread were amazing--like you get in Paris! And although the line is long in the morning, you can use the vouchers any time you wish. This is a wonderful benefit of staying at this hotel.

Price is comparable to what we paid at name hotel but without the cab fare to 72nd. We stayed twice - one Sunday night and then 9 nights just 2 days later.  All inclusive rate for one night was $260 ($204 rate plus taxes and fees) while 9 night inclusive rate was $302 per night for same king bed room.  Both included $20 credit for bakery. I booked with hotel using Triumph coupon.  Not sure if the extra fees would show up when comparing rates with other hotel booking services.  No explanation for why the longer stay was more expensive.  First night room 810 was fantastic.  Longer term room 727 was slightly smaller and shower control seemed to be broken or not easily adjusted. Maid service was more consistent than name brand hotels are offering today.\n\n $20 bakery credit was used as much as we could but limited offerings and long lines from 7:30 am to 9:30 am made it difficult to use if you were in a hurry to get somewhere.  Drop by later for no line or book without the bakery credit since there are other places to get  breakfast nearby that are less busy..  No published menu so you have to review the offerings by looking at the display case once to really know what you will want. \n\nWe had the staff order a Black Car to LGA airport on the last morning.  The car did ok but the vehicle had an issue with the trunk release not working, an unbalanced tire at high speed,  and a check engine light on the dash so my confidence in the maintenance of the vehicle was not high.

We stayed several days to celebrate our daughter\u2019s  11th birthday. On her birthday, the director of housekeeping sent a beautiful handwritten note congratulating her, with goodies and a cute teddy bear that my daughter absolutely loved. In return, my daughter sent a note back thanking them. The hotel brings the best traditions within us that should not be lost. In addition, it has a wonderful French bakery on the first floor with a kind staff. So many options are walking distance. The rooms are wonderful. The beds are comfortable, and all the staff have a smile. We highly recommend this hotel for families or any group, as the rooms are separate. The Italian restaurant Serafina that is across the street is very good. There is Bloomingdale\u2019s outlet is walking  distance. Central Park and Natural History Museum are also minutes away walking. The Metro is close, and also easily accessible to find an Uber. There is also a Market on Sunday\u2019s with all types of goodies from vintage clothes to food and unique jewelry. We went to see The Broadway The Cursed Child (Harry Potter) which is one of the best plays we have seen. If your child turns 11, this is the place to stay, with a wonderful experience for the entire family. Thank you to the staff off Belleclaire Hotel.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This hotel is my absolute favorite , fora very reasonable price,  and we will definitely be back!\n\nFirst of all.... the location.  This location was fabulous.  We loved being able to  walk to Central Park, Riverside Park, Natural History  Museum and lots of restaurants!  Also, we took advantage of the subway being two blocks away which got us anywhere very quickly. Being outside the noise of Times Square and some other busy areas was very appealing for us.   And we loved the feel of the neighbourhood,.. more residential, very clean and safe but still quirky, lots of character and great places to eat nearby!\n\nThe hotel itself was the quietest we've stayed in, due to location but also the brand new windows they have recently installed.. I also found the walls were nice and thick and we rarely heard any other guests in the hall or in adjoining rooms.\n\nThe bakery was an amazing treat every day and definitely added to our happiness!  yes, there were lineups but they moved quickly and the people who worked there were lovely and very efficient! \n\nSpeaking of LOVELY PEOPLE.. I cannot say enough about the FABULOUS staff at the Belleclaire!!  From the moment we checked in, we knew were were in a good place.  I would be remiss if i do not give a huge shout out to two people in particular, Francisco & Maria.  I would return to this hotel just to see their smiling faces again. They both radiated warmth and made our stay so wonderful. Seeing them each morning, or evening truly made our days feel wonderful!  We also loved the housekeeping staff and both Shanis & Benedict at reception were great and went out of their way to  assist us!\n\nIf i had any criticism of this hotel it would involved the lack of furniture in our room.  We stayed 8 days and not having a dresser to unpack our bags did make things very unorganized. I would have also appreciated a space in the bathroom such as a shelf to leave items on.  Hopefully dressers have been ordered as the rooms were all recently (and beautifully) renovated,..because that will truly make this hotel a PERFECT one for us!   \n\nThank you Hotel Belleclaire for a dreamy week in my favorite city and a huge hug of gratitude for Francisco & Maria for everything you did to make our stay so special.

Ha quel non so che di vecchio e nuovo che  fa parte della citt\u00e0 e che ha un suo fascino. 9 piani con un solo piccolo ascensore chiedono un po\u2019 di pazienza ma ne stanno realizzando un secondo. Per un episodio spiacevole mi \u00e8 stato promesso un risarcimento dalla responsabile, al momento non ancora avvenuto, attendo e scriver\u00f2 in merito. Eviterei la colazione, da pagare extra, la si ritira in una bakery associata,  e bisogna fare sempre la coda, i tavolini per consumarla sono pochi,  viene servita in bicchieri di carta, la qualit\u00e0 \u00e8 buona, ma nel complesso \u00e8 scomoda. Meglio fare due passi, in zona si trovano locali accoglienti e di qualit\u00e0. L\u2019albergo all\u2019esterno \u00e8 davvero un bell\u2019edificio, nelle vie intorno si trovano piccoli ristoranti, ed \u00e8 piacevole passeggiare la sera lungo gli ampi marciapiedi, ogni tanto un venditore di fiori o frutta, e negozi per la citt\u00e0, per intenderci non turistici. Siamo sulla Braadway, non lontano da Columbus Circle, Central Park \u00e8 a due passi e poter fare una passeggiata nel verde salutando gli scoiattoli \u00e8 un bel modo per cominciare la giornata. In conclusione ritengo una buona scelta questo albergo, anche per il rapporto prezzo\/qualit\u00e0, qui son tutti un po\u2019 rigidi ma anche molto pragmatici, i newyorkesi sono interessanti, praticano una gentilezza diffusa che contraddice l\u2019idea della fredda metropoli, le persone son sempre migliori della rappresentazione che ne viene data. \n\nthe hotel has a nice, very typical atmosphere.  It has that something old and new that is part of the city and that has its own charm.  9 floors with only one small lift require a little patience but they are building a second one.  For an unpleasant episode I was promised compensation by the manager, which has not yet happened, I wait and I will write about it.  I would avoid breakfast, to be paid extra, it is collected in an associated bakery, and you always have to queue, the tables to eat it are few, it is served in paper cups, the quality is good, but overall it is uncomfortable.  Better to take a walk, in the area there are welcoming and quality places.  The hotel outside is a really nice building, in the streets around it there are small restaurants, and it is pleasant to walk in the evening along the wide pavements, every now and then a flower or fruit seller, and shops for the city, so to speak. tourist.  We are on the Braadway, not far from Columbus Circle, Central Park is a stone's throw away and being able to take a walk in the green while greeting the squirrels is a great way to start the day.  In conclusion, I think this hotel is a good choice, also for the price \/ quality ratio, here they are all a bit rigid but also very pragmatic, New Yorkers are interesting, they practice a widespread kindness that contradicts the idea of \u200b\u200bthe cold metropolis, people are always better than the representation that is given.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was lovely, spotlessly clean and the bathroom was nice. Thermostat worked correctly and it was easy to manage temperature. My only \"complaint\" is that like a lot of \"modern\" hotels, there was no chest of drawers of any type, so we had to deal with \"living out of our suitcases\". No major complaints about the \"daily fee\" which was offset by cards we could use in the bakery downstairs (albeit with torturously long line (offset by unbelievably good baked items)) plus \"free\" wifi. Other reviews mentioned the \"daily fee\" so I was not surprised by it. One tiny nit: bathroom sink faucets were hot\/cold reversed, and NO hotel manager should tolerate dopey plumbing mistakes like that. GREAT shower. Room was utterly quiet at night. Location: great, very close to two subway stations plus everything you need nearby because, well, you're on Broadway!

They had closed down during in the height of the pandemic and recently renovated and then opened. Lucky for us, I called weeks ago to see if they were open and was given great rates for the upcoming trip we had this past weekend. In addition to the great rates, we also received $10 vouchers for each person, PER DAY, to spend at Mille Fiulle next door. This was probably the best part of the stay.\n\nWe had the best time but unfortunately, our stay was the least of favorite of our trip. Our room was recently updated with new floors, paint, furniture, mattresses, etc. but it was dirty. As if they finished construction but didn\u2019t clean up the mess. The floor and window seats\/area (we had the parlor suite) had a lot of grit, dust, and particles of sorts. The bathroom set up is terrible. Water from the shower just flooded the outside and we had to use a ton of bath towels just to keep the floor dry. The space was small to begin with, and having wet towels on the floor shrunk the space even more. In addition to that, the bathroom was dim as one light was out. \n\nAnd then, our group got stuck in the elevator and we were told that we shouldn\u2019t have had more than 3 inside (there were 6 of us). The elevator states the max is 1500 lbs, and we were well below that capacity. My husband, thankfully, was able to pry the doors open while we waited for the fire dept, and got out quicker than anticipated. Please post signs if there are certain limitations anywhere - especially in an elevator! It would also be nice not to be blamed for something we had no knowledge of. To be told \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have more than 3 people in there!\u201d as we were nervously getting out of the elevator was not necessary. If this was a policy, where were the signs?!\n\nLike I said, we are repeat customers of the Belleclaire and was really excited to return and be one of the firsts to stay in the renovated rooms. Luckily, we got a deep discounted rate having booked the room weeks ago. Otherwise, we would\u2019ve been very upset paying the full price for the way less than stellar expectation of \u201cnew\u201d rooms and facilities.\n\nAfter this past visit, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever return.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I then went to the front desk to let them know and the lady at the desk was pretty rude and told me to then get my stuff and they\u2019d have another room at 3. Check in was at 3 but I called earlier and they said they could have something ready by 1, I got there around 2. I was so annoyed at that point because I was told I\u2019d be able to check in early I upgraded my room to a bigger space. It was fairly clean and did not have that smell. Another friend was staying at the hotel that week (there was a show nearby so there were about 20 people staying at this hotel for it) said they also had to change from the first room they were given because it\u2019s dirty. I understand in the city you will pay a lot for a little space but I expect that space should at least be clean. I would recommend going for a suite, they seem to take better care of those rooms.

I was told they absolutely had that type of suite and that there was only 1 left.\nOmg imagine our surprise on entering this suite.\nBefore we even got to the suite I noticed that the passageway was filthy like it had not been vacuumed but then again I thought it could be that we had arrived mid evening and that was why...no worries moving on.\nWe enter the 'suite' to find that it's  2 bedrooms connected to each other with no lounging room in between. I became extremely irritated but thought I should make the most of it as we were already there.\nThe curtains on the window were put on backwards which makes zero sense. The chest of drawers was old and dilapidated and the drawers had the knobs missing and this to me seemed tacky and lazy as it is an easy fix. The headboard was so scratched and discolored you would think they would replace it...seriously, the leather had been scratched off the headboard.\nThe room looked barely cleaned but I reserved comment until a few days.\nWe hardly slept through the first night as they have VERY old radiators that sounds like someone is crashing through the door. We complained the next morning and were told that somebody would fix it but that never got done.\nAfter a full day of being out, we return to our 'suite' to find the beds made and nothing else.

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-11-23","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"This hotel did not live to expectations at all. We paid over $1000 for three nights, however, the hotel is only worth maybe $300 for three nights. This is not a 3-Star hotel like it supposed to be, and I\u2019ve stayed in nicer motels. \n\nWe got a double deluxe room with a view. The double deluxe is supposed to be \u201cspacious\u201d which includes a window seat, include a refrigerator with a minibar, slippers, and robes just to name a few amenities. The first room they gave us was not a double deluxe, it was a standard room with two double beds crammed into the room any room. It also did not have any of the amenities listed above. And it was very dirty. So, we went down and told them and they gave us a new room (had to wait an hour and a half for it to be ready). When we requested the new room, we said there was no refrigerator in the first room, and were told that we had to request one when we booked the room (it does not say that anywhere online when you\u2019re booking a room). They told us to call down and request one to see if there was one available. \n\nWe got up to the new room and it was the right room this time, however, it still did not have any of the amenities listed above. No refrigerator (but we did get one after we had to call down an ask for one). There was no mini-bar (not a problem though, as we weren\u2019t going to use it, but it was still listed as something that would be in the room). And we still didn\u2019t have our robes and slippers. \n\nAlthough the room was cleaner, it was still rather dusty, and the furniture was very beaten up. There were cobwebs on the ceiling, the headboards were peeling off. There were chips and scratches in the wood on every single table, chair, shelf, etc. It was not a room worth spending over $1000 on. Also, there was no coffee maker or microwave in the room, although not listed in the amenities what hotel doesn\u2019t have a coffee maker in the room? They also don\u2019t have coffee sitting out in the lobby, every hotel I\u2019ve been to has complimentary coffee in the lobby. \n\nWe paid for the breakfast package, the hotel itself doesn\u2019t have breakfast, it\u2019s through a bakery next door. The breakfast package only includes one small cup of coffee, one croissant or a slice of cake, and a small cup of orange juice. The bakery doesn\u2019t open until 7:00 am so when you need to be somewhere before then because you\u2019re staying due to a business-related event, you can\u2019t get your breakfast you paid for when you want your breakfast, and have to get Starbucks or Dunkin on your way. And for the price you paid for it, it did not include very much.\n\nThis hotel did not live up to the pictures or description you see on their website, and when I return to NYC in three weeks, I will be staying at the Fairfield Inn which is only $175 a night, and I know it will  have coffee in the room, a refrigerator without having to request one when I book the room. It will be clean, and it will have coffee in the lobby and have everything else you expect from a hotel. I would not recommend staying at the Hotel Belleclaire to anyone, it is way overpriced for what its offers, and you don\u2019t even get the stuff it is supposed to have. \n\n*Cross-posted to Google Maps, as well \n","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Location was perfect. Near Cenyral Park and on Broadway Ave. The place is quiet and near parks. We love the exterior design as well as its classic interiors. However, the bedrooms are small as well as the elevators. They only have 2 small elevators and they are quite old, slow, noisy and rough. Bedrooms and toilet are clean but you will continuously hear a hammering sound everytime the heater is working. Their bed is also small and you have no coach or luggage rack to put your luggage on. They also don't have usb ports in the room and only provided power outlets on the bedside lamps. They also don't provide complimentary water bottles, and doesn't have a bar for liquor, coffee or tea. They also don't have a fridge. They also don't have All Day Dining area. Their breakfast place(very limited choices) is in a small cafeteria beside the hotel. Their wifi connection is free but average speed and you will need to log in your email everytime you use it. Overall, I give it a 3 only because of its historical significance. For its price, we could have gotten a newer and better hotel. I guess that's the price you have to pay for staying in a 116 year old hotel. ","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The bathroom was small, dark & the shower was appalling. My partner jumped in the shower because after being up for over 12 hours & pulling a 17kg case from Penn Station to the hotel he really needed one. In the mean time I sat on the bed disheartened, wondering how we would both fit in here let alone sleep!! I checked the website & the room did not fit the standard room description or images.\n\nI decided to go down to reception to express my concerns. I was respectful & just stated my disappointment as the room didn\u2019t match what we had paid for or the website. The same man mentioned above was VERY rude & abrupt saying \u2018that is a standard room, what do you expect\u2019 I showed him the website image & he said \u2018you\u2019ve booked a standard room, that\u2019s a queen bed, you won\u2019t get that when you pay for standard\u2019 I showed him the website stated this was in fact a standard room so in that case the website isn\u2019t accurate. He said \u2018well I\u2019m sorry about that\u2019 I asked what could be done as it\u2019s such a small room especially for 2 people & he eventually said we could look at another standard room. This room was so much better so it just shows you the difference in rooms, still a standard room but this was actually a double if not a bigger bed, plenty of room either side of the bed & the shower a lot better.\n\nThe man rang the old room to ask what we wanted to do & I said yes please can we change, he asked if we had used anything so of course I said my partner had used the shower to which he replied \u2018oh really\u2019 and put the phone down on me aggressively. I apologised when I went down with the old card, I know it wasn\u2019t ideal but I didn\u2019t know we would be able to change room & my partner needed a shower!!

Considering crazy pricing in the area, it also came at more or less competitive rate, which also played a role.\n\nIt doesn't look as impressive as some other places from outside, but lobby was spacious and functional with a lot of people taking space chatting or working. The attached coffee shop is a nice addition, but, unfortunately, their non-sweet selection was very sad.\n\nCheck-in went smooth and staff was helpful. Our room was on the 2nd floor, which was nice as elevators were a bit claustrophobic - tiny and slow. \n\nThere was a sign, which looked somewhat permanent, that they are doing repairs, though we didn't see any work being done anywhere during the 4 days we stayed there. Repairs and updates are needed indeed.\n\nRoom was clean and need, but tiny. The few pieces of furniture there was (aside from the beds) looked not just old, but ancient and useless. No fridge and safe was just laying on the floor in the closet not secured to anything. Bathroom, on the other hand, was humongous and in serious need of updating. All windows were super drafty. Room appeared to have been winterized as A\/C unit's vent was covered with the piece of wood taped by a packing tape. I'm not sure if that was due to us being pretty close to the street on the 2nd floor or because windows looked like they were 100 years old, but you could hear quite a bit of outside noise through the night - NY is never quiet, but decent windows could help with this.\n\nIt was pretty clear that no money was invested in the rooms lately, though lobby was kept more or less up to date.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because staff was very professional, efficient and courteous and location was great - two subway stations within couple of blocks (1 block one way and 3 another) and another subway line was about 5 blocks out. It's about 30-40 min walk to Times square (or couple of stops on a subway), 10 min to central park. 24 hour CVS right across from the entrance in case if you need something after hours and whatever else you might possibly need withing few blocks.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I picked this hotel because my sister lives on the upper West side and I wanted to be close to her.  The rate for a standard room was better than other surrounding hotels, but as soon as I began the check-in process, I realized that I had made an error.  I arrived before 9 PM on a Friday night and only one person was working the front desk so I had to wait.  The front desk person was pleasant, but slightly difficult to understand as she mumbled a little.  Once I arrived to the 9th floor, I could not find my room due to lack of clear signs and I returned to the lobby for more info.  They provided me an escort and once I got into my standard room, I was shocked that my own personal bedroom at home is much larger than this tiny room, occupied mostly by a bed.  Only about 1 ft. around the bed and no closet.  The next morning, I left before noon to meet my sister for lunch and no one bothered to clean the room.  Upon my return later that day, I notified the front desk and someone then left me clean towels piled on the bed and never cleared the used towels from the bathroom floor.  I actually dumped my own trash then complained again and got a night maintenance worker who took my used towels.  I've stayed in lower rate hotels before, but for $336 per night (standard room rate) this is unacceptable.  The positives were the location near good shopping and close to my family.  The room was also quiet and I slept comfortably in the bed.  The bathroom shower fixtures were new, but the sink is too shallow so all the water splashes out onto the vanity that is very water damaged.  I won't go back there.  Staff was nice and tried to makeup for problems and offered me a discount, but I will not go back.  They have crammed too many rooms into this building creating an uncomfortable stay for anyone not getting the biggest, most expensive room.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

It was the second time my husband and I had stayed there. It was very welcoming and a  good value for a very comfortable room, with a great bed and pillows (always a litmus test of ours). Having just left the hotel after a two night stay, we are hard pressed to say anything nice about it. After checking in and deciding to take a nap, we were grossed out by a significant stain on the bottom sheet - there were also holes in the pillowcases. Two out of the three black out shades did not work (and were not fixed during our stay); the toilet flushed somewhat haphazardly; and the shower door leaked. Now we have been in small bathrooms, but this room brought new meaning to the word SMALL! You could not shut the door & turn around. My husband was also quite disgruntled to find there were no drawers of any kind to use for unpacking. To the hotel\u2019s credit, they did adjust the bill.

Starting from the entrance it has a poor sad look - too classic and I'd say a bit depressing....no decorations, low light,  just wood.... The stuff, although nice, was looking sad (or depressed also because of the surroundings..). The halls and elevators were also terribly used. The room was awfully small, barelly could go around the bed. The thing that frightened me the most was the window. It was not well isolated (lucky us it was not December :))), could not open it -we could only use the air co to air the room. While we were in NY it was not hot at all so we did not use it for its purpose. Worth mentioning it was noisy too?.

Doet wat gedateerd aan en eenmaal in de kamer aangekomen zijn de slijtages zeer duidelijk zichtbaar. Smalle kamer waar de koffers lastig op te bergen zijn. De airco maakt ontzettend veel lawaai als deze is ingeschakeld. En dat is echt nodig met deze zomerse temperaturen. Slapen is bijna niet te doen met de airco aan, dus hebben we deze maar uitgezet. De bromtoon van de overige airco's zijn dan nog goed te horen, maar dit is, los van de warmte, goed te doen.\n\nDe badkamer is, eigenlijk net als de hotelkamers, aan vervanging toe. In de toiletpot lijkt verf te zijn aangebracht over kalk? Ik weet het niet maar het ziet er niet echt fris uit. Ook rondom de toiletpot zijn schimmels en roestplekken goed zichtbaar. Bij het doortrekken rammelt de pot aan alle kanten. Jammer dit.\n\nWanneer de buren de deuren sluiten hoor je een enorme dreun.

Per questo, relativamente vicino alle principali attrazioni. Tutte raggiungibili a 20 minuti di metropolitana (in media). \u00c8 un tre stelle, con interni un p\u00f2 vecchiotti. Ma, considerando la citt\u00e0, costa quanto un quattro stelle italiano. Le camere sono essenziali, piuttosto piccole e soprattutto rumorose. Le finestre sono vecchie, del classico tipo a ghigliottina e nient\u2019affatto insonorizzate. Se a questo aggiungete che nella via di fronte c\u2019\u00e8 una stazione dei mitici pompieri di New York, capirete il titolo della recensione.

Per me non \u00e8 stato un dramma. Ma siete avvisati. Un altro inconveniente riguarda le serrature delle porte delle camere. Del tipo a scheda, ma \u201cprima maniera\u201d. Per chiudere dovete sbattere la porta (altro motivo di fastidio) o fare come me che mi preoccupavo di sbloccare la maniglia inserendo la scheda, per accompagnare la porta alla chiusura, per non sbatterla. Ma in quanti lo fanno? I condizionatori nelle camere sono efficienti, ma \u201ctipo anni 80\u201d. Di quelli con buco nella finestra. La sensazione, sempre riferita al titolo, \u00e8 quella di dormire con la finestra aperta. Ma per il rumore, non per il clima. Anche qui \u00e8 avvantaggiato chi \u00e8 abituato alle grandi citt\u00e0. Per il resto il giudizio \u00e8 positivo (occhio per\u00f2 alla tv con addebiti dei canali on demand che non sono chiaramente indicati) e anche all\u2019app per pilotare la tv da scaricare sul telefono, che diventa a pagamento. Se la colazione non \u00e8 compresa nel vostro soggiorno, al piano terra c\u2019\u00e8 anche una boulangerie dove poter fare colazione.

I stayed 5 nights during my first visit to NYC. It has beautiful architecture, and interesting history. I\u2019m only giving it 3 stars for a few reasons. First, I think free coffee should be a given at any hotel. Belleclaire doesn\u2019t offer coffee, however there\u2019s a very sweet coffee and pastry shop next door (a lovely break from Starbucks!) Second, my room had fluorescent lighting.  Why would such a quaint place use horrible fluorescent bulbs in its hallways and rooms? Warm light bulbs would be a nice improvement. I didn\u2019t like being in my room because of the harsh and creepy lighting.  Finally, the housekeeping effort needs improvement. Outside my room, on the hallway floor was debris (nothing terrible - lint, threads, tiny bits.)  But it was there for several days, signaling no vacuuming was being done during that time.  The 4th day, it was clear the hall was vacuumed. In addition, the bed skirt on my bed was significantly torn. When housekeeping made the bed, the skirt was awkwardly tucked up into the mattress in an attempt to hide it. Hotel Belleclaire, you\u2019re better than this. Take a few steps that would make a big difference.  Otherwise, the bed was comfortable, the service friendly, and I appreciated being able to store my luggage after check out, but before I left town. The location was perfect for my trips uptown to Columbia, downtown to Times Square, and everywhere in between.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

It also has a fitness center, which we meant to check out but didn\u2019t end up doing.  They have a mini fridge in the room and 2 complimentary waters, which was nice.

It is a bit larger but the \"extra\" size is taken by the kitchenette (no table). The problem is that the kitchen had utensils but no coffee at all, the coffee bar was closed. The kitchen was a waste of space and money since we did not cook at all.\n\nThe bedroom was fairly small and with a \"grand\" view of the brick wall of the next building. There is very, very limited space to put away your clothes, basically we lived out of the suitcases. The room was nice and the bed was great.\n\nThere is no instructions for the Media center and for the AC unit (the remote was useless). It would have been nice to program it to raise the temperature as the outside ambient temperature cooled down.\n\nThe Bathroom was very large with a large shower area, two problems we noticed. The Toilet Paper dispenser was too far from the Toilet, unless you have extensible arms, there is no way to reach it, we ended up taking the TP out of the holder and put it in the floor next to the toilet.\n\nThe other problem was the shower door, it would not close flush as the bottom was scraping the tile protector. We were worried that the glass could break if we forced shut. Luckily due to the shower stall design, not much water leaked out of the door. The problem was reported but the fix was not complete, you still need to apply a bit of force to shut it down (it made a awful screeching sound) and there was always the worry of cracking or completely breaking the glass.\n\nOverall is an ok place with a nice location and close to the subway and restaurant and grocery shops. With some changes it could be an much better lodging.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

And so I compromise to availability and swallow my pride and, well, I got a room at the Belleclaire.\n\nHaving said all that, I will ignore the notion of value proposition and just deal with the hotel straight up. I liked it. A kind of Parisian Art Nouveau entrance, lobby floor a mass of tiny tiles that lost their linearity ages ago. It has a coffee-bakery operation attached to it that I didn\u2019t experience. It has grand thoughts for a lobby bar in its future. Reception was welcoming, kind and chit-chatty in a good way...I felt connected. I paid an extra $20 bucks to upgrade to a large King on the 8th floor. \n\nWished up on little elevator to a narrow hallway and rabbit warren of rooms. Opened my door to a quite large room with nice creaky wood floor (I like the romance of a wood floor). A very attractive room that some might call dated or worn but it just felt well-lived-in to me. A small empty square fridge on the floor with a cord to the nearby wall receptacle. Seemed lost. Soft mattress tightly made up on an oversized platform...perfectly sleepworthy. And the pi\u00e8ce de resistance - a teeny tiny bathroom so redolent of old buildings. How small? You can sit on the toilet to brush your teeth at the sink. Shower-tub. Nice amenities. I travel solo so just need a bathroom to function not to impress.\n\nAll in all, I would happily go back to Bellclaire when the rate aligns to the property instead of city vacancy rates.

This was our first visit to the Belleclaire and probably our last. Its location is quite good, I will give it that.  And the staff was polite and efficient. But it was one of the least enjoyable nights we've spent in NY.  \n\nThe rooms are generally fine, and typical of that price point in smaller hotels.  But the details were rough.  The in-window a\/c unit was loud.  Really loud.  Like you're not going to sleep tonight loud.  The bathroom is pretty vintage and the shower didn't drain properly.  There was no coffee in the room, which isn't per se a problem, but neither was there a complimentary coffee cart in the lobby like many of the Belleclaire's competitors provide.  There was however a $3 tall coffee for sale in the lobby.  The two elevators are also vintage, and every ride we took seemed like it might be our last elevator ride--ever.  There's also no bar in the hotel if that matters to you.  It matters to us.  \n\nAt the end of the day, there are a fair number of boutique choices in that neighborhood or a little bit south towards Times Square that are much preferable.

Very bad quality finishes in lobby and rooms.  Horrible smells coming from bathroom and air-condition.  No ambiance in the lobby, no decent breakfast area, very sparse and low quality furniture - even the night reception turns on his mobile TV much like what you see on TV when one goes to a cheap highway motel inn!!!  \n\nHousekeeping is particularly poor where cleaning of the rooms don\u2019t seem to be top priority.  Rooms don\u2019t get cleaned daily.  Hairs still in drainage post cleaning.  Towels and toilet rolls don\u2019t get replenished unless one asks.   Bed covers are not folded and just thrown below the luggage rack in the main room.  The toilet odors are not pleasant and even when one complaints - there is no response to fix it.   Even when one runs into a housekeeping staff,  they said please speak to reception for service ! \n\nUsually when one complaints, these complaints are escalated via guest services.   This didn\u2019t work as well as I have never seen day reception deliberately misleading and ineffective. When I asked to speak to the duty manager after repeatedly asking for housekeeping service for almost an hour, the two receptionists could not agree whether the duty manager was a male or female!!  When I challenged the male receptionist (who seemed to be the more senior), he told me that the duty manager was female and that the female receptionist I spoke to on phone was mistaken.  Turned out that I was introduced to the female housekeeping manager who did not introduce herself as housekeeping,  did not have a business card claiming she was new.  She never introduced herself as the housekeeping manager and seemingly positioned herself as the manager on duty and not once correcting my assumption that she was only the housekeeping manager.   She  also took 15 minutes to see me after I stood at reception having given up waiting on the phone for another 15 minutes to speak to the manager!!  I have never seen such poor response at so many levels for a hotel claiming to the caliber of Belleclaire.  The whole thing just felt like the front desk guest service staff and housekeeping colluding together to not escalate issues when customers are unhappy!  \n\nTo really hit the point home on lack of cleaning standards by housekeeping there was also a cockroach in the shower !!!  \n\nThere is one exception to the poor service standards - which is the bell service who were all very helpful.  \n\nThe best thing about the hotel is the French cafe Mille Feuille (excellent coffee, pastries, ambiance and service) which one can access if one stayed at the Arthouse Hotel across the street where I spent a fair amount of time in their library bar and incredibly warm reception lobby area.  Arthouse Hotel seems new, trendy and has nice buzz about it.  It also has two very good restaurants, Serafina and Red Farm.  To add salt to injury, on booking.com the rooms are also considerably cheaper than what Belleclaire is charging.  \n\nBottom line - avoid Belleclaire at all costs.  stay at Arthouse Hotel instead (also on 77th and Broadway) if you want to be in that area.  As Arthouse Hotel faces 77th whilst many of the rooms for Belleclaire faces Broadway,  their rooms may be quieter.  The noise pollution factor for Belleclaire was very very bad!!!  \n","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

She took it upon herself and transferred us to a larger room, knowing family would stop by to visit. I felt incredibly taken care of by Shanee,  She treated me more as a family member then a hotel guest. I was able to relax and explore the wonderful neighborhood. Zabars and Fairway both within walking distance, as is the Hudson River. I am so grateful for my experience at Hotel Bellclaire. Next time I first NYC I know where to stay.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It\u2019s European charm, great rooms, amenities, location, and amazing staff has made it my hotel of choice for the past 6 years. On my most recent stay April 14-15th, I was amazed at how beautiful and luxurious the hotel looks after recent renovations. The hotel has maintained it\u2019s classic historic charm while adding a modern flair. With that being said, the constant that is true of my stays at the Hotel Belleclaire is that the staff makes you feel like you\u2019re coming home. They make sure that your needs are met. They greet you with a smile, and when they ask you, \u201cis there anything else you need?\u2019 they mean it! The rooms are stylishly appointed. I always get a great nights sleep on there super comfortable beds.\n\nI love the accessibility to great restaurants on Amsterdam Avenue which is a two block walk; Central Park West which is a three block walk, and if I want to go downtown the 1\/9 subway line is one block away.  You can\u2019t ask for more. Oh, and to add icing on the cake, the room rates can\u2019t be beat. What a value for all that Hotel Belleclaire has to offer. Can\u2019t wait till my next visit to the city in July!!!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

Good location in terms of Upper West Side and subway stations for midtown and other areas of NYC. Nice spacious lobby and helpful reception staff.\n\nRoom a bit small and a bit basic in terms of furniture, but not unexpected for a standard double in NYC. Room at back of hotel away from Broadway and 77th Street. Nice sized bathroom and shower. Very good housekeeping and restocking of room amenities.\n\nBuilding works were carried out in a nearby room and outside our window during stay, intermittent at first and then serious noise last two days. Engineering staff shouting to each other in hallways, banging, drilling, vacuuming, welding outside window, playing radios very loud.\n\nAdmin staff were helpful in resolving radio noise on second-last day and provided breakfast vouchers on last day to compensate for disruption. We were told we could have moved rooms, but noise was manageable early in stay and wasn\u2019t clear how long works would last. It didn\u2019t seem worth moving towards the end of our stay, after settling in room. Anyway, irritating to be placed in a room beside building works in the first place, without being warned of potential noise, especially given we were staying for 7 nights. Admin\/reception staff not aware of timing of building works? Also the attitude of the engineering staff seems unacceptable anyway, seem completely unaware of disruption created by their shouting and radios when guests are trying to relax or sleep, aside from the actual building work noise.\n\nWould most suit those on a first visit to NYC who would be leaving room early and returning late, i.e. just somewhere to sleep. Larger rooms would probably be preferable for return NYC visits, if wishing to crash in room for longer periods. And bear in mind to inform admin staff of noise problems early in stay, as they seem happy to help resolve issues.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Even so, the upgrade cost far less than many other basic hotel rooms in NYC. \n     We would definitely stay there again--but make sure to book a large room.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Still, I feel I have valid feedback that will help readers make a choice in hotels on the Upper West Side.\n\nAs someone who has been visiting the neighborhood and staying in its hotels regularly since 1995, I know no property is perfect. They can be expensive, noisy, etc. I get that, and expect it going in. But some of what I encountered -- in my first stay at the Belleclaire -- I feel should be shared with others.\n\nWhen I first got to my room to start my three-night stay, I immediately looked out the window. And looked smack dab onto an empty construction scaffolding. It was set at a height just below my second-floor window, and gave the appearance that it was in use...but perhaps not that day, given that it was the weekend. Still, I know crews work on weekends, so I asked one of the cleaning crew if there was \"action\" on that scaffolding, and I was assured no one uses it or had done so \"in a long time.\"\n\nHmm, well, ok. They wouldn't lie to me.\n\nWrong.\n\nAt 9 am the next morning, I was awakened by the sound of three construction workers doing their thing. Electric saws, drills, the works. Merely being separately by a thin pane of glass -- and a window air conditioner that wasn't completely sealed -- made it feel like I was out on the scaffolding with them!\n\nI couldn't believe it, especially as I had spent the evening at a concert and was looking forward to sleeping in.\n\nI attempted to call the front desk -- which, in a haze,  I recalled being told upon check in I couldn't do via the \"Front Desk\" button on the phone -- and the cord slipped out of the handset. To make the call, I had to hold the cord and make sure it stayed in the phone jack.\n\nEventually I was able to connect with the front desk, who apologized for my plight and connected me to the manager...who was, shall we say, slightly less hospitable.\n\nPerhaps I came off a bit brusk, but I was also going deaf from the noise as I explained the situation.\n\n\"So what do you want me to do, ask them to stop? Absolutely not!\"\n\nI was more than a bit horrified by his response, and countered that I needed another room, especially since I was already deceived about the situation by one of his staff. He had me recontact the front desk, and I did so in person, at which time I showed them the pictures I am including here. They cringed, but cheerfully switched my room to one far away from the noise, and I was satisfied. I didn't even mind half the TV channels didn't work, or that the thin walls made me feel as though I was actually invited to the sex party across the hall (how loud can sex get?!?  Clearly I'm doing something wrong...but I digress).\n\nAll in all, the hotel was fine and had definite upside. Would I stay there again? Maybe, but I am much better prepared now. \n\nMost importantly, the hotel needs to warn guests about possible noise from construction, or not put guests in rooms located near \"ground zero.\" And if and when someone complains, the manager, of all people, shouldn't be obnoxious about it.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

The hotel is located in the an area with many restaurants and things to do. Its just a few blocks from Central Park and not far from subway off\/on. The hotel has a small caf\u00e9 that is located downstairs but I don't believe it's theirs and they offer coffee, treats and much more. We stayed on the backside of the hotel and it was quiet and I heard no noise. The elevator was small, they have two. I used the stairs a lot since I was only three floors up. The ice machine and soda machine are located on the first floor inside the stairwell, next to elevator. The room was clean and spacious. The small fridge was on the floor so you have to bend down to put anything in there or take out. The closet had a small safe and even had an umbrella, if you need it. The phone\/clock combo had cords attached so you can plug your phone in, many different cords for different phones. The Wi-Fi is free but if you want to up grade and go faster they do offer a package you can purchase. I found the free Wi-Fi to be good and didn't need to upgrade. Many channels on the TV to choose from. This hotel is just a \"Gem\". My stay was perfect and I couldn't ask for anything more. I would like to say Thank you to Carlos and the other Maintenance staff who helped me with the a\/c and helped with getting my friends earrings out of the sink drain. Before I end I would like you to know that the beds were some of the best I have slept on. Amazing slumber and I did think about how to get them outta the room without getting in trouble. The beds were perfect!!!!!! If you are in the area I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Our \u201cRiver View\u201d was another freaking building! ABSOLUTELY NO RIVER!!!!!!!!!! I looked straight into somebodies window. I didn\u2019t even feel comfortable changing because guess what! In the bathroom was another freaking window where people can see into and it doesn\u2019t even lock! Not to mention the description said I would have a bath tub and to my utter most surprise there wasn\u2019t one! TINEST ROOM, NO BATHTUB, NO PRIVACY! Ruined my birthday. When we called to get my car back I had to wait for 20 minutes on hold and then another 30 minutes for my car. We spent 1 hour in the hotel total. When we came downstairs the desk was surprised by our early check out, they asked why and did not even have anything to say. Then gentleman stare at us like we had five heads.

Or from outside.  The front desk staff was friendly.  The car service they arranged to the airport was professional and on time.

I hate to slam housekeepers  and the individual staff members in that department were OK, but a 3 hour wait to get room made up AFTER you put up the \"Please make up the room\" sign and AFTER reminding the front desk twice, seems excessive. It's true that in the early morning, we briefly had a \"Do not disturb\" sign up and according to one housekeeper, that did divert staff from a quicker response. \n\nAlso, a housekeeper said it is futile to ask housekeepers on the floor to get to the room more promptly, no matter what signage is displayed. You must always ask the front desk to give the order to clean if you are in a hurry to get back. To us, those pyrotechnics speak to the need for a larger housekeeping staff. \n\nOK...don't want a totally negative message here...experience was actually somewhat positive. The architecture of the hotel is awesome. Designed in 1903 by iconic Emery Roth in Art Nouveau style. Roth went on later to gain even greater fame with his Art Deco and Beaux Arts wonders that also grace the upper west side of Manhattan. \n\nFront desk people were  knowledgeable and helpful and valet parking staff were terrific and competent.  Nice small view of the street from side window and also view of other parts of the finely designed building. Lobby is large for a \"boutique\" hotel and it is easy to work at the tables. Guests are gracious and largely European. Lobby is also enhanced by the presence of the wonderful Mille Feuille bakery\/cafe. \n\nThis is a mixed use building with permanent hotel tenants and rooms set aside for overnight guests like us. The resident apartments are not huge by New York standards and the overnight rooms are about half the size, so you should understand that you are getting a very small room. The in-room bathroom is especially a joke as you can barely wedge yourself in that narrow space between the toilet and sink. \n\nThe shower is...well iffy... but if you are sufficiently patient, you are likely to get enough hot water. The bed is kind of soft and cushiony which makes maneuvering around in bed difficult and my wife wants me to say that the backboard is unattractive! \n\nBut, here on the upper west side, it is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. Wonderful shops, health clubs, restaurants, cafes, bars, gourmet supermarkets, arts and more! I grew up about 5 blocks from here and have re-visited the area periodically, so for me this was not only a location treat, but a kind of trip in a time machine.  \n\nAs I said, we would return under the right circumstances and for the right price and will recommend this venue to friends. We don't like to take a negative tone, but the quirks mean we need to be fair and accurate.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It\u2019s been overhauled and labeld as \u201chistoric\u201d.  I stayed there in 2018 , in several rooms, and I can tell you I would NEVER return.  The \u2018regular\u2019 Queen rooms are VERY expensive, tiny spaces with remodeled, OK bathrooms. I appreciate that these bathrooms have been completely redone, even took a photo.  The windows have bars, like a prison.  If you are clastrophobic, this is not the hotel for you!  The expensive King bed \u201csuites\u201d facing Broadway are much roomier, with multiple windows BUT, the bathrooms are NOT remodeled AT ALL & are even smaller than you can imagine.  You can barely turn around in there...  I mean, you can brush your teeth while seated on the toilet.  Really.  The service at this hotel is FAR below average, and they do have people living semi permanently in the Belleclaire, so then there\u2019s that.  If you are disabled, believe me, don\u2019t stay here!  You would NOT want to ride up in the claustrophobia-elevators, omg, I would really hate to be stuck in them. Plus, you would be forced to be dependent on the seriously unreliable and sketchy staff, so I do not recommend it.  I doubt a wheelchair could even fit safely in the questionable, tiny elevators.  The  security at this hotel is BEYOND AWFUL. While I was sleeping, they gave a second key to a man, who claimed he was \u201ca relative\u201d.  They never even asked for his I.D., NOR phoned my room to ask my permission!!!   He entered my room with the key card that THEY GAVE HIM.  (I could have been killed, good thing I carry).  Serious warning for all single travelers, ESPECIALLY WOMEN:  If you stay at this hotel, bring a door jam-lock and door alarm with you, SERIOUSLY.  DO NOT TRAVEL ALONE, DO NOT STAY HERE.  This hotel is NOT SAFE. You couldnt pay me to stay at this dump! \u201cHistoric\u201d - what a joke! It\u2019s just an old, creepy building where many, MAAANY people died of drug overdoses.

The tv in the room is very temperamental and has a lot of static; there\u2019s is no TV guide so it\u2019s a guess of what station is what. The room is very loud at night with fire engines going past at around 4am every morning with sirens blasting and then horns going off throughout the night. Although this can not be helped, you can ask for a \u2018quiet\u2019 room but in theory every room should be in a way. The breakfast that is offered is just pastry\u2019s and coffee although they are very nice it\u2019s quite expensive for what it is. The location is good, near subway stations and Central Park so that\u2019s a good thing. The bathroom is very small however and the shower leaks, the hairdryer isn\u2019t very powerful and the shower isn\u2019t either. You can either have it boiling hot or freezing cold, no in between. The room itself is small, they have a mini bar with very expensive prices and it does look like it could do with a redecorate. We only had one tiny bin in the bathroom so we had to try and fit all our rubbish in that. The hotel looks nice, the gym is really nice. Overall it is a nice hotel but I think you can get better for your money. ","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

That said, don't expect a five star experience.  The hotel's upper west side location is close to subways and all the amenities that the UWS has to offer.  It was also less expensive than many comparable hotels we searched in the area.  Rooms were what you would expect for a NYC hotel: big enough to hold a queen-sized bed, desk, closet, and decent sized bathroom.  Enough space for what you need.  The hotel staff was friendly and very helpful.  The shower was very nice and had good water pressure.  It is an older building and has some quirks you would expect in an older building: mostly strange noises.  The radiator and the bathroom pipes made strange noises throughout the night that were somewhat disruptive.  The hotel room was clean in the important areas (bathroom, linens) but there was a lack of attention to detail in some spots.  For example, I'm not sure the base of the lamp had been dusted recently nor had the corner of the nightstand.  Overall though, its a solid option and I would recommend it for the value.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":93390,"title":"Great location & perfectly acceptable, if a little tired and jaded - but 5* prices for a 3.5* experience","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-09-24","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Stayed here the weekend of Thursday September 20 to Sunday September 23 inclusive as part of a surprise trip to NYC with my wife and two teenaged children (boy and girl) for my wife's significant birthday. It was our first visit to the city.\n\nI wanted to be out of the immediate chaos of downtown but in a hotel conveniently located to be able to get everywhere reasonably easily. To be completely up front, there were other hotels in the city I would have preferred but for budget reasons I wanted a family room rather than two separate rooms - and they are in remarkably short supply here.\n\nSo, after weeks of searching and for that reason alone, the Belleclaire swung it. The $1,632 (\u00a31,250) cost was a little eyewatering - putting it within striking distance of a very upmarket hotel in the UK - but I learned NY is busy in September and I also knew it's one of, if not the, most expensive cities in the USA. And at \u00a3100 a night per person, I convinced myself it wasn't a bad deal. And maybe it wasn't.\n\nThe good things:\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: The staff are amazingly helpful and friendly, and to be honest and in my experience that mitigates an awful lot of the not-so-good things in life. This is its absolute saving grace and a credit to the management - because not all about the Belleclaire is faultless by any stretch ...\n\nLOCATION: Two blocks from the park, a comfortable 20 minute stroll from Lincoln Center and the start of the fun, there's little to complain about here.\n\nCOMFORT: The beds were among the most comfortable I've ever experienced in a hotel\n\nCLEANLINESS: Contrary to some reviews of the hotel that I'd seen on Tripadvisor, the rooms were clean and presentable.\n\nIn the end, the hotel was there for us to sleep in and nothing more. It doesn't have dining in the traditional sense, but we didn't need or want that, so it wasn't a consideration and that doesn't factor into this review at all for that reason (though obviously if you're looking to dine in your hotel, this isn't the place for you). There is a small cafe, run independently of the hotel but accessible through a connecting entrance, where you can grab coffee and pastries and it looked rather good, though we opted to breakfast at the Manhattan Diner on 95th and, for our last two mornings, directly across the road at Serafina.\n\nSo in short, it met most of our requirements.\n\nThe not so good things:\n\nBUILDING WORK: The biggest issue for us was that there is building work going on at the building adjacent to the hotel (on the other side of W77th). Raw materials, including scaffolding, were delivered to the site in the early hours of both Friday and Saturday mornings (around 1.30am), with the noise of lorries and the clatter of steel extremely loud. On Friday morning, work began on the site just before 8am - and okay, it was a weekday and maybe that's to be expected. This was work that had clearly been in progress for quite some time, not something that had started within the previous week or so.\n\nFor all sorts of reasons, I looked at the hotel website several times prior to travelling and nowhere was there a warning (at least that was obvious - I haven't checked since we returned) of building work in progress within the immediate environment of the hotel. That's a mistake, in my view, because it makes me feel like it was deliberately hidden from me.\n\nSOUNDPROOFING: The noise in itself wouldn't have been too much of an issue if the sound insulation at the hotel had been effective, but because the building is old, the double glazing is secondary - and rather flimsy at that. In fact, the noise was so intrusive that both my wife and I, unknown to the other, got up during the night to check that one of us hadn't left a window open. Apart from the building work, NY really is a city that never sleeps and so there was noise (mainly fire truck sirens) on and off all night. \n\nThat's to be expected, of course - but at \u00a3400 ($525) a night, I'd have expected more obvious investment in measures that offered the chance of a decent night's sleep.\n\nBATHROOM - given this was servicing four people, the bathroom was very small (as in tiny) and very outdated. Again, if I'd been paying 3* prices, not an issue - at 4-5* prices, it created a sense of genuine disappointment. Gravity fed shower, combo faucet ...\n\nWEARY DECOR - the hotel management\/owners have obviously gone to some effort to create a contemporary feel. But wooden floors magnify sound issues and the finishing is jaded and tired. I can only speak for the room we were in, but as examples, the (faux?) leather material on the headboard in the double room area was worn and scuffed (God alone knows why - it was quite a way above the head height of a prone adult!), the bathroom door was cheap and the finish at the bottom of it was chipped and scuffed (with obvious signs of having been repainted but, sadly, not filled), the door from the hallway to the suite itself was old-fashioned, with very dated door furniture, there were too few power points (especially near the dfressing table and mirrors).\n\nELEVATORS\n\nFor a building of this size and capacity, the elevators were tiny (not more than 6 to a ride and on several occasions, I saw guests resorting to sending their luggage down on its own whilst they took the stairs. The situation wasn't helped by the fact one elevator was out of order, which extended wait times (and exacerbated frustration when the car eventually did stop at your floor, only to open reveal a full car or one crammed with luggage).\n\nFinally, MINIBAR. In this day and age and for the love of God, why provide a minibar? My 16-year-old son helped himself to a bottle of mineral water (before I'd managed to have the 'don't touch the stuff in the minibar!' chat with him and his sister. The charge? 10 dollars. That's just greedy and obscene - particularly given the room rate - as is the commercial motivation for all hotel minibars. The prices may be high, but the message it sends out is really cheap.\n\nIn the end, this is all about price and expectation. Would I stay there again? Yes, probably - assuming there was no ongoing building work and I had a room that didn't overlook the front of the hotel - because it's a perfectly comfortable experience in many ways and the hotel manager has obviously gone to a lot of lengths to make good customer service a priority ... as I say, that forgives a lot.\n\nIfmy bill had been, say, $250\/$300 a night, I'd be sitting here talking about what wonderful vaue for money it was. But it isn't $300 a night, and so it isn't wonderful value for money. It's a perfectly decent but expensive 3.5* hotel - the customer service alone is why I rated it 4 rather than 3.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Let's start with the GOOD: 1) hotel staff is really friendly. Always ready to help out. 2) Location really convenient. It's in Broadway and just 5 minutes walk from a metro station. Around the hotel, in walking distance there are several eating places, for breakfast and lunch\/dinner. Recommend \"Zabars\" (West 80th street), it's a supermarket but they have also a cafe' where you can eat breakfast (from pastries\/danishes to cereals, fruits, etc.). Not famcy, no frills, lots of locals go there and therefore it's very cheap for Manhattan standards. Their coffee is good, and this is coming from an Italian used to drink at least 3 espresso coffees a day.\nNow let's look at the \"Less GOOD\": the hotel is basically a very old building, and it has the limitation that comes with it. In order to fit as many rooms as possible (sure they are within requirements in terms of minimum floor space) it turns out that the rooms, at least the one I had, are really small. I had a double queen room (3 occupants) and with 3 suitcases (traveling from Europe) we had difficulties in moving around. Also the airco is system is quite dated. It works but it's noisy and by today's standards it looks like something that should be in a museum. I would recommend this hotel to parties of 2 maximum and suggest them to take the double bed rooms, at least they can use the extra bed to put the luggage on it.\n","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"NONE"}
