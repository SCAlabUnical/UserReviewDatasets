He is the worst the housekeeping manager had to intervene I would never stay at this place EVER!..To think I am doing a tour of a Wyndham property for an upgrade, and they assign me this dump, with the worse front desk person I ever experienced and interacted.  He is a weird and terrible person....What is worse I received a response from the manager and she advised it was ok that employees can lie and state \"hotel policy\" without having to prove or show anything in writing or even explain?  Be treated like a criminal, so if you bring small children, and whoever make to this property make sure you have their id.  If you do not like it they are given the authority to cancel your reservation.  I guest they think we are in a communist country without due process or accountability.

Check in was easy - the front desk stored our bags as we arrived earlier than expected and our room wasn't ready.  This hotel is cash-free - if you're looking for small bills for tipping you'll have to get change outside the hotel.   There are  4 guest rooms per floor in the 18th floor facility, we found elevators to be accessible and uncrowded during our 3 night stay.  We felt very safe at this hotel, the front door and elevators require a hotel key to access guest floors.  There was very little external noise nor was there much in-building noise. We were on the 13th floor and other than the occasional guest room door closing it was quiet. The rooms are clean but tiny, usable for a single occupant, cramped for two or more. The bedding was new and comfortable, the beds themselves are platforms which allowed the mattress to slide around, we discovered this after the first night of sleep.  The included breakfast was served in a somewhat cramped 1st floor area that got crowded at peak times.  The food was acceptable to good, depending on the daily selection, with hot selections of scrambled eggs and either sausage or bacon, DIY waffles, breads and pastries, juices, coffees, yogurts and fresh fruit.  There is no fitness center nor valet parking, although the hotel has a discount program with a parking lot around the corner on 38th street who promptly retrieved our car upon checkout. The only ice machine for guest use was in the basement, meaning you needed an elevator ride to get ice for the room. We were unpleasantly surprised to discover that the weekend NFL schedule was not available on the room television channel selections. As a frequent guest of the Wyndham chain, I rate this facility as average due to its convenient location, cleanliness of the room and facility, but due to the relatively high room rate and small room and limited amenities, I would investigate other options along with this one.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were in the back of the hotel, which is quieter, but the view was of some older buildings and a fire escape. It didn't really matter because we were not in NYC to sit in our room. \nThe hotel is just a couple of blocks from Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. Get takeout from the Bryant Park Deli and grab a table in the park to eat like New Yorkers instead of tourists. \nThe New York Public Library has an outstanding free museum. \nIt is only a short walk to Times Square. We saw a Broadway show each night and were fine walking in the neighborhood of the hotel while coming back late. There was always a desk clerk on duty and we could tell that security was a priority.\nThere are only 4 rooms on each floor and two elevators. We never had to wait long for an elevator during our stay. \nThe breakfast room is like the guestrooms, compact. The staff worked hard to provide breakfast each morning featuring waffles, eggs, bacon or sausage and a variety of breads, muffins and pastries. There was also cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit and a selection of single-serve yogurts. Beverages included coffee, tea and hot chocolate. Breakfast gets crowded, so get there early to get a table.\nKudos to the hard-working staff on their unfailing courtesy and willingness to help. This hotel is very well-run.

Her family brought her to the hospital to check. Thus, I canceled this hotel today that I booked through Expedia in June 11th, and no refund appeared even though our trip would be in another month. I talked to Expedia, and they told me to get approval from the hotel. I called the hotel 3 times to ask for that, but they said no. I made a deal that I do not need a refund for myself, but at least please 50% at least of the amount that we paid ($923 for 3 nights) for my cousin's hospital bills. (or even $300 or $400). Their final answer is still a no. They have no heart in this situation.\nTalking about the business side, they have problems with ethics in management. I have been managing 1 restaurant and 1 nail shop for a couple of years, and I am an MBA student in Florida. I just see this hotel is gaining money from visitors without customer service and ethics; related to this, I am not sure whether their room is cleaned or anything else.

Wingate is a franchise (I contacted the Wyndham group abut this) and this means they have their own rules and do as they please.\nI contacted the hotel prior to arrival to enquire about the room and got a message back from Esteban who advised I will not be able to check in because the credit card used and its cardholder must be present during check-in along with a photo ID for verification. Obviously this is not possible when booking via a travel agent and having the hotel stay paid in advance. I followed up on that email asking for clarification to be met with complete silence. After being ghosted, finally someone else responded saying this is their policy, which, as far as I am concerned, cannot be found anywhere on their website. Sadly, I have no crystal ball to foresee what policies they have or invent as they go. Long story short, they cancelled my reservation and as a gesture of goodwill (!) issued a refund. Had I not contacted them prior to my arrival, I would have been left with no accommodation in NYC. They never meant to contact me or the travel agency advising the booking is not valid.

Suspect it\u2019s low because it might be new.  I paid a little over $3000AUD\/$2228USD for 9 nights.  Room was clean and in pretty good condition.  I booked a King Room with a large double bed through Booking.com.  Not huge but I think hotel rooms tend to be small in NYC.  There was room for everything, I just couldn\u2019t open my large suitcase and leave it open without it being in the way, not the end of the world.  See photo attached.\n\nRoom had a safe, TV, mini fridge, ice box, marble top desk with lamp and chair, open closet space (with electric steamer) next to the bed for hanging jackets and shirts and 4 shelves above the bed so I used the shelves for folded clothes and as bedside table space.\n\nOn arrival, I was given a choice of two rooms.  A room on the street side that had a nicer view or a room at the back without a nice view, nice touch that they gave me a choice, went with the back one to avoid street noise and for the slightly bigger bathroom.  My room had the bathroom sink in the bathroom, not in the room like others do.  \n\nFloor was nice \u2013 wood or vinyl that looks like wood, I prefer that to carpet.  \n\nBed was comfortable.  \n\nBathroom was nice and one of the selling points for me to book this hotel.  Marble walls in the long stand up roomy shower enclosed with well designed glass wall and door to keep the water in.  Large overhead rain shower head as well as a detachable alternative shower head to switch to.  Decent water pressure and great temperature.  There was an air vent, no switch to turn it on but the bathroom never got steamy\/fogged up.  Not much room around the sink to put toiletries but two shelves under it so I used those.  \n\nBlock out curtain kept the light out.  Lighting wasn\u2019t super bright, but was decent.\n\nRoom was fairly quiet.  Only 4 rooms on my floor.   I didn\u2019t get any street noise.  The walls are thin, you do hear other people in their rooms and in the hall.  But I guess the people on my floor were quiet and considerate as it wasn\u2019t an issue for me.\n\nThe staff were very nice.\n\nI\u2019ve read reviews of other hotels in NYC where people have to wait a long time for lifts.  Never the case here.  Only 4 rooms per floor and lifts always came right away.\n\nOnly issue was the WiFi.  I was given a password for it but I got low security warnings for it on both my phone and laptop so I didn\u2019t use it.\n\nI read reviews complaining about the breakfast.  Not an issue for me as I wanted to eat out.  There's a couple of Fresh & Co locations nearby so I went there.\n\nBeyond Sushi a couple of blocks down is excellent if you don\u2019t mind eating plant-based sushi.  There's a good vegan Korean restaurant called Franchia Cafe on Park Avenue about 3 or 4 blocks away too.  Location was pretty good, fairly central but enough of a distance from Times Square.

If you are lucky as we were and you get a room pointed south on one of the higher floors, you will have a great view of Empire State Building directly from your bed.\n\nWe chose this property because our reservation at another hotel was cancelled and this one was in the same location and promised similar experience (e.g. breakfast included) for just slightly higher price.\n\nHowever, we were very disappointed by what they advertise as \"breakfast\". Every morning, we could pick up a bag at the reception which included some light snack. It was something you could take with you when going for a walk in Central Park but definitely not something that would fill you up in the morning. A pandemic is not an excuse for this because we stayed in a different hotel a few days before and we had a buffet breakfast there. So just add $40 per day for breakfast for two to the price of this hotel if you really want to have breakfast every morning. (Andrews Coffee Shop is great by the way.)\n\nAnother problem was that they didn't clean our room during the whole stay. This would be ok if they at least picked up the trash because it was really smelly the very last day.\n\nAlso expect no sound isolation from the corridor and no wardrobe in the room.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Four rooms per floor, and maybe two dozen floors stacked to the sky.\n\nTiny but clean rooms are updated with comfy beds and resilient flooring. They do a nice job of maximizing space. Housekeeping service is every third day, so don't expect fresh sheets and towels every night. That's fine. I don't require it, and the front desk can accommodate any interim requests.\n\nIncluded breakfast comes in the form of a brown bag to-go - a granola bar, fruit cup, muffin and yogurt. Don't look for a waffle iron, at least until the pandemic subsides a bit more. It was small but perfectly adequate.\n\nEsteban at the front desk made the stay great. He was kind, helpful, and knowledgeable - the sort of hospitality professional one does not frequently encounter. Cheers to him. He's outstanding.\n\nSide note: If you're a Wyndham diamond member looking for perks and upgrades, Wingate is not a perk-y upgrade-y sort of place. I don't know if they even have suites. Still, the location can't be beat, the price is good, and the people are great. A-plus experience. Don't hesitate to book.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Several times a month. Been doing that for years so I've been to a LOT of hotel I'm the area.\nPros: very modern, newly renovated, clean everything, sleek & minimalist decor. Great view of the Empire State building.Very safe area close to everything touristy and business. Polite staff.\nCons: small room, no microwave (but fridge), no breakfast. They also charge 25$ for a checkout at noon (one hour later) which is completely outrageous. No other hotel does that. It's always complimentary!\n\nMy major issue is the lack of flexibility when it comes to the check-in rules. I had a prepaid reservation via Expedia but I had a last minute major issue on my business credit card caused by my previous hotel. Being overseas it was very impossible to solve the issue. They require 100 $ a night for incidentals and I was only staying one night. So I offered Selena (front desk agent) to make copies of my credit card infos and passport to let me check in. She refused and was willing to see me (also pregnant) go somewhere else despite me having a prepaid reservation.Zero willingness to work with the client and see what would benefit both of us.It had to be their rule or nothing. Never seen a hotel being that stuck and not willing to work with me despite the circumstances. Just for that I will never go back ever again.

Loved the small hotel concept with just four rooms to each floor of an 18 floor building.  They maximize the space and have updated it to be modern and chic.  I appreciated even the luxury vinyl flooring that will prove durable and more sanitary over time than carpet.  Loved touches like the abundant lighting and bonus was ample window with great sunlight and a view of the Empire State Building which was lit up to celebrate the reopening of international travel with colors of UK flag.  This brings up how centrally it is located in midtown with ability to walk down to Herald Square, the Empire State Building(checked out their new higher 100 something lookout) and  Koreatown where I had great Korean bbq outdoor complete with DJ!; then \nup to Bryant Square and over to Times Square and Broadway facilitating my seeing the fantastic Tina! The Tina Turner musical.  Finally and should have started her, the staff was wonderful, friendly and informative whether helping me to understand and navigate the city\u2019s COVID protocols, printing out directions or just offering a friendly smile or even gentle reminder to wear my face mask when I neglected to from coming off the street.\n\nOverall a fantastic stay.  One con that seem to find at all hotels is the thin walls, doors or I think it might be ducting connecting the rooms because I hear the other people across the hall so much that thought they were in front of my door.

Maintenance came to the room, did a temporary fix and all was fine until the middle of the night when the a\/c stopped working properly again.  The next day after being out in approximately 90 degree weather all day, they returned to their room around 8:30 pm to find the a\/c not working properly again.  They again called the front desk and maintenance came and did another temporary fix.  They were told that if it did not cool off in 30 minutes to call the front desk back.  They were told by the front desk that maintenance was no longer on the property.  So apparently, there is no on-call maintenance.  They requested another room with working a\/c but were told the hotel was completely booked for the night.  I also called the hotel to complain and was given the same information.  I requested a call from the manager for the next day, which I did not receive.  I called the hotel on Monday morning and spoke with Selena, the manager and told her about the issue and requested some sort of compensation for my daughter having to spend an entire weekend in a hotel room that did not have proper working a\/c.

I called again and was told she was not on the property and that I would receive a return call.   I have still not received a return call.

I will be contacting cooperate their isn't a policy for Wingate saying \"you will be charged for towels if using them\" I WOULDN'T EVER RECOMMEND STAYING HERE!

As we checked in I confirmed that we are in our requested king deluxe but for some reason we were in queen. Fortunately I booked through the Wyndham website, showed him our reservation details and after several minutes of waiting they put us in the correct room The king deluxe was a nice size room  for NYC and well designed. Bedding and mattress are very comfortable; air conditioning was quiet (compared to other hotels). The two areas that I would not give a high grade to were the shower and the breakfast. Maybe because we were on a high floor but we had to wait and wait for hot water to come out of the shower head. In addition there are two controls that are exactly alike - one for the temperature and one for the two shower heads ,  so it took a while to figure out which one worked which and which direction to turn- just poorly designed. As for breakfast, during the week it ends at 9 AM. Why?? I don\u2019t know but it is not worth  rushing down for. Pastries look like they were industrially made, fruit was not ripe, coffee tasted burnt. Being a former NYer I knew if I wanted to get a healthy breakfast to walk to the corner to the deli and get an egg on roll and toasted corn muffin. Best part of the hotel is the location. If you have any business in midtown or want to be near Times Square but away from the crowds this is a great location. Subway stops are close by, there is a City Bike rack on the corner (only advise to use if you are extremely confident in riding though city streets with trucks and taxis making turns and suddenly stopping).  I would recommend this hotel for the right price. When I did research  depending on the night pricing can go from $159- $469. At anything less than $325 you re getting a good deal for a NYC hotel room.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
