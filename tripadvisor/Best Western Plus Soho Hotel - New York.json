We would definitely return and book directly in future as would advise anyone to AVOID BOOKING.COM!!!!\n\nI would also recommend this hotel due to the location, staff, cleanliness, value for money, amenities AND THE STAFF!!!

Friendly staff and decent breakfast.  Swanky looking rooms with a Scandinavian feel.  Beautiful bathrooms.\n\nThe hotel is not actually in Soho though - it's just off Canal Street, on the border of Chinatown and Tribeca.  Walkable to many attractions in Lower Manhattan, but not the nicest neighborhood (lots of garbage on the streets and homeless people).  \n\nI would give this hotel 5 stars, but we had two major issues.  The room we stayed in did not allow us to control the temperature and we were VERY HOT at night. A maintenance person adjusted it for us the next day and said that any room ending in 01 (ex: 701) controls the temperature for the entire floor.  So anyone in one of these cannot adjust the temperature (there is a lock box over the thermostat).  This is a function of the way the hotel was constructed, so there is nothing to be done (apparently).  Why on earth would you construct a hotel that way?\n\nThe second issue was the sofa bed, where our son slept. It was comfy, but every time he moved it would creak really loudly.  That kept us up at night as well.\n\nI wanted to love the hotel but we didn't sleep well due to the temperature and the noisy sofa bed.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

One Best Western stands out above all: The Best Western Plus Soho in New York City. And it\u2019s not even close- this sparkling gem in Manhattan is the crown jewel of the BW family of hotels, and in my experience ranks first in every category you can name.\nFirst off, it\u2019s the cleanest hotel I\u2019ve ever set foot in. Yes, it\u2019s just under a year old, but every time I ventured out of my room I saw staff meticulously cleaning in a way you just don\u2019t see- once I saw two employees scrubbing the grooves below the elevator door with toothbrushes! Every inch of the place looks like brand new, and in NYC that isn\u2019t an easy feat. The entire staff here seems to pitch in, and what a friendly, welcoming staff they are! As a Diamond Select level BW Rewards member, I am used to getting a little extra customer service, but the warmth of these employees surpassed all expectations! The people at the front desk were so genuinely sweet and accommodating, welcoming me cheerily and asking me how my stay is going and do I need anything every time I passed through the lobby. Then I met Tommy, the hotel\u2019s general manager, and I realized that warmth and  professionalism starts at the top. What a nice guy! He, like all the staff I encounter during my stay, seemed genuinely concerned about my stay being as pleasant as possible, and I\u2019ll tell you, it was, thanks to Tommy and Co.\nOne of my favorite aspects of staying at BW is the free breakfast buffet, and here\u2019s another category where BW Plus Soho knocks it out of the park. One morning they served breakfast burritos, which had never sounded good to me before, but boy was I wrong if they are all as delicious as the ones Isaac the breakfast guy made. They were amazing! And like everyone else there, Isaac was super nice and genuinely solicitous about making sure everything was great, and it was! I even accidentally ate a vegetarian breakfast burrito made with imitation meat, and until I realized what it was, between you and me, I liked it! They have many delectable options in their beautiful breakfast area, and as always, it was complimentary with the nights stay. What a way to start my day! Hats off to Isaac and crew.\nThe one negative I can say is there are only around 50 rooms, and with the wonderful experience one has staying there, you can imagine those rooms sell pretty fast, so book in advance. Thank you Tommy and staff of the Best Western Plus Soho for my best hotel stay ever! I will be back, I hope sooner rather than later!","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

It needs a mattress topper otherwise the springs can be felt when sleeping ( and she doesn\u2019t weigh much). \n- 3 of us in the room but towels for only 2 people were supplied.  Asked for more towels but only supplied extra towels for 2 more days (we were staying 3 more). \n- we could not change the air conditioning as the control unit is locked behind a Perspex box. The room was really cold when we first arrived and the thankfully the box was unlocked so we could set it to heat and 70. The next day the box was locked and set to 74 and cool which was ok.\n- breakfast buffet was very hit and miss.  First day was good with plenty of food. The next day there was 1 bottle of fresh milk left, no fruit yoghurts and no more available as apparently they were waiting on a delivery. One cereal container had run out and was not replenished. The next day we could see the milk delivery on the floor and we waited for it to be made available for guests to use but it never was. I had to ask for 2 bottles but none was ever put out for the other guests.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":23753531,"title":"Excellent place to stay if you want a clean, comfortable, spacious room with accommodating staff and new, modern room","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-04-04","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Best Western PLUS. \n\nI selected this hotel because the location was ideal, being easy walking distance to where I needed to go. It is set right around Chinatown\/Soho and plenty of nearby shops, restaurants, subway station, etc. it\u2019s great for anyone looking for the Chinatown shopping experience. Very walkable and easily navigated for even the novice NYC visitor. The hotel, I believe is pretty new, or at least recently renovated. Very modern, city chic decor which was pleasant compared to the dated design choices you see in some hotels. The color palette and patterns are calm and non-stimulating. \n\nThe rooms are especially large for what you\u2019d expect to find for this price point in Soho. I stayed in a single queen room and had plenty of space to move around. Bedside desk with chair which was great for getting some work done or dining in.  Closet area with plenty of hangers and clothing bags for garments as well as a shelf above, ironing board\/iron and luggage stand. They truly optimized space in the design of this room. Platform bed with trendy lighting underneath, as well as trundle style drawer on either side of the bed, one of which had a safe. Bathroom was gorgeous, glass shower door, bowl sink, comfortable modern toilet and adorable glass shelves for toiletries. Smart TV with options for cable as well as some streaming services. I used Netflix and had no issues. Multiple locks on the door as well as covered peephole made me feel safe. No window view, but to be expected in the area at this price. It is worth mentioning that I did have a large window with two sets of privacy shades, one which allowed filtered light and one which provided black out, which is great for getting sleep during the day. The bed was very comfortable, clean linens, soft fluffy pillows that are easy to adjust to level of preferred firmness. \n\nI ordered in food delivery and front desk called to ask if I\u2019d like the delivery brought to my door or if I preferred to come down to the lobby to grab it myself. It\u2019s a minor detail but something I appreciated. I also had a friend who visited while I was there and they had him wait in the lobby for me to confirm I was expecting a guest. Again, minor detail but in the interest of safety for a solo traveling woman I appreciated this. \n\nCheck-in was quick and easy, taking only a few minutes which was nice because I was on a time crunch when I first arrived. I did call ahead to request early check-in and was told it was an option, for a fee, based on availability, but they offered the option to hold my bags if my room wasn\u2019t ready. When I arrived they were able to accommodate early check-in, thankfully. I was checked in at front desk by Erika Ascanio, who greeted me with a warm and welcoming smile. She was very pleasant and helpful, answering any questions I had. There\u2019s something to be said about encountering professional hospitality after a long trip, and Erika certainly was able to provide that. \n\nAfter the first night, I had a mid-morning obligation and went out for a few hours. When I returned I found that my room had been made up. Bed was made, towels restocked, trash emptied, surfaces wiped down etc. I was glad they\u2019d made quick work of using the time I was gone and it was refreshing to return to a clean, tidy room. \n\nI stayed for one more night and then checked out early the next morning to return home. I was helped by Thomas Carpenter at checkout, and he was just one of the nicest people ever. Very personable in a genuinely authentic way. He made it a point to remind me of their complimentary breakfast, which I would\u2019ve gladly taken advantage of had I not been eager to get on the road. He also gave me his business card for my next stay. The friendly interaction really set the tone for my day, and I was able to leave the hotel and get on the road for a long drive in a good mood thanks to his kindness. \n\nAll in all, this hotel is ideal for travelers that don\u2019t necessarily want to pay overly high prices, but still want to get the NYC vibe while having a clean, safe place to lay their head that\u2019s in a great Manhattan location. I\u2019ve stayed in a few different hotels in this same area and this one ticks all of the boxes for affordability, comfort, safety, and space. The genuinely lovely, friendly, helpful staff is icing on the cake. I would recommend staying here, and will be booking here again when I return in June. ","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"SOLO"}
