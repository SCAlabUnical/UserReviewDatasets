I'll start with the good. Staff and Location were excellent. Now the bad, toilet leaked horribly in both rooms. In one is soaked the carpet and we had to switch. In the other, engineering was able to repair mostly with minor leaks after. When you took hot showers the walls around the toilet and other areas 'sweat' and you couldn't touch any. We also had an unexplained leak in one of the window sills. Out TV stopped working and engineering had to come in for about an hour and fix. After that, my hubby would duplicate the process when it conched out. The AC stopped working at random times and the room became a sweat box. We adjusted temperature, settings etc but nothing worked. We got tired of calling engineering and had to open a window (27th floor) to let in the freezing 40 - 49 degree weather to survive.  We also were leaving a hot room sweaty to go into a freezing NYC temp. This made us sick and Im stilll nursing that cold a week later. I expected better from a 4star hotel. I could forgive it being outdated, limited (1) outlet, etc but this was a horrible experience. I think the location of this hotel is its saving grace.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

That wasn\u2019t bad because we went and grabbed some brunch down the street.  We got back and promptly were able to check in.\nNow comes the fun part.  We were on the 50th floor with breathtaking views of the city ( my favorite part ).  The ac really did not work the whole time we were there and had to make do with having the window open but of course that made for a huge wind tunnel.  The pillows were quite lumpy but the bedding was quite perfect.  \nWhen taking the elevator, sometimes they worked and other times they did not.  Half the time they never lit up so you could never know which floor you were on.\nAlso to note, the concierge desk closet to elevator, the Asian gentleman was quite rude to my husband.  My husband went to inquire about the gym and he was quick to cut him off with telling him he needed a key as if to presume we weren\u2019t guests of the hotel when he could\u2019ve found that out and provided the correct information.\nThe other thing that wasn\u2019t great was the fact there was no restaurant on site at all.  A restaurant would definitely be beneficial to the hotel and bring in a lot of money.\nIn conclusion I\u2019ve read past reviews with regard to the ac and then us having to deal with that is quite shocking to be honest with replies from the hotel saying the issues are being fixed when they are not.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Check in is not until 4pm and they mean this - no chance of checking in any earlier which to me is a really late check in when check out is average at 11am. The room itself was old, dated and dirty. The shower had no power and would fill up with water and not drain properly, this meant I had to keep stopping and starting the shower. The hair dryer was full of dust and dirt, unusable. We stayed at the hotel for a week and not once did someone hoover the room or properly clean it - towels were replaced daily but that was it. I think a week stay would require at least a basic hoover of the room. I didn\u2019t find the staff overly welcome - I asked about having a fridge in our room (there was a clear gap where the fridge should have been) and was told to contact maintenance myself who work normal working hours, this isn\u2019t ideal as during these hours we would be out exploring the city so we just went without. The gift shop that sells snacks is overpriced - go to the shop across from the hotel for better value snacks. The only positives were the location and view. We had a nice view of neighbouring buildings from our room and the location couldn\u2019t be better for Times Square and Broadway. However, I still would not recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Although a refrigerator is not promised, we were under the impression that one would be provided upon request, however after several requests over our 4 day stay we did not receive one due to a short supply of refrigerators to accommodate all guests. There was also no microwave or coffee maker\u2014 neither were advertised but still inconvenient not to have. When checking in, we were told by the front desk we had to wait a little longer because they were \u201cfrantically cleaning rooms.\u201d This is where our concerns began. When we entered the room, we found what seemed to be pubic hairs left in the shower and other hairs left in the bed sheets, which we called and had our sheets replaced by a very nice member of housekeeping. This housekeeper also informed us that there would only be heat, so it\u2019s best to keep the windows open and turn off the thermostat. The tv in the room would freeze after a few minutes of playing, where youtube and other tv channels would not load. We called to report this and a maintenance man, Garry, was sent. He was super nice and helpful, he brought us a tv from another room, but it still didn\u2019t load. It seemed to be a hotel wifi connection issue, not something he could fix but he still tried. The shower drain did not work properly, leaving us in a tub full of water by the end of our shower. It took about 15 minutes to drain after the water was off, but what appeared to be the moldy lining of the pipes came up out of the drain and left residue on the floor of the tub (photo attached). After being outside all day with no allergy issues, upon entering the room each night we quickly became severely congested and kept sneezing. We requested a hypoallergenic room, but we were informed they didnt have designated hypoallergenic rooms because they don\u2019t use feathers or harsh fragrances. When checking out, we voiced our concerns to the rooms manager, Rackie, who was condescending and short with us. He informed us that if we were to have communicated with the front desk in person, then these issues would have been logged. We had made several calls via the room phone to report these issues to the front desk, but Rackie said these calls were not logged. After suggesting that we could provide the times that we called so he could backtrack the phone log, he quickly asserted that it was \u201ccommon sense\u201d for us to have come to the front desk to speak in person instead of calling.

Adjustable air conditioning. Very good bedding, beautiful view from the 27th floor.\nAn exceptional welcome from Daniel. So far the staff had been incredible despite the fact that one evening the heating came on by itself without being able to stop, as well as during the first shower when the water came up and many hairs. All of this was fixed by the hotel immediately. However on the fourth day at reception when I asked for the loan of a pair of scissors 5 minutes. A member of staff refuses it to me not for security reasons but not because \"people don't bring them back, it's not a service provided by the hotel\" (4 STARS) and I am even advised to go to the local pharmacy will buy me one for myself. The manager clearly looked down on me, I gave my room number and indicated that I was not leaving until two days later. That it was just for nail glue.

Stayed here a number of years back. The room, whilst dated by modern standards was a nice size, the bed was comfortable and things worked. The temp of the room was an issue as it was often too warm but with no ability to put on the AC. Apparently AC is only available in the summer and not this time of the year, so had to have the window open which meant you got all of the traffic \/ street and siren noise. They seem to be missing an opportunity here as there is now no bar or restaurant or anything in the hotel, however the areas where these previously were remain and seem to be not used. In the middle of the busiest place of the world it seems a lost opportunity to me ! There are fortunately plenty of places surrounding the hotel of course. \nI\u2019m guessing at some point the hotel will need an update but overall you can\u2019t beat the location if you want to be in the centre of NYC.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This was by far the best experience I have ever had at a hotel. We arrived Saturday morning earlier than expected (10:00am) since we had spent the previous night in New Jersey by American Dream. Upon arrival , my daughter and I were greeted by Jenny at the front desk. Jenny was inviting, had a smile and began interacting with my daughter who was extremely excited to be in NYC. We were there to explore Times Square the first day (Saturday) as well as some other places NYC city had to offer. Sunday we were seeing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child around the corner on 214 W 43rd street. I did not expect our room to be ready since I was so early and the plan was to leave our bags and go out and enjoy ourselves. As Jenny began my check in, my daughter was filling her in on all the fun stuff we were going to do together. Jenny was so patient and inviting to her the whole time. Not everyone is great with kids, but Jenny truly knocked it out the park. Jenny then looked at me and asked \u201cIs it just you and your daughter\u201d in which I replied \u201cYes. I don\u2019t really get to spend as much time as I\u2019d like with her since I work a lot. I wanted to treat her to some fun with her dad and figured this would be a special getaway for us both.\u201d This was also my first time in NYC. I\u2019m a firefighter so i tend to work many hours, sometimes gone for 3 days at a time, and don\u2019t see my family nearly as much as I\u2019d like to. Jenny was very taken by this I could tell. She verbalized how sweet that was, and how meaningful this must be for my daughter. As Jenny was checking me in, she confirmed I booked a double bed room for two nights. I confirmed that was correct. She then asked me to wait a moment and walked into the office. At this moment I took a second to look around the lobby. The hotel is very clean, has a nice gift shop and is decorated elegantly. It\u2019s also in the heart of Times Square, less than a minute walk from the the main area. Jenny came back, and explained to me that she had just spoken with her manager Elli. She said \u201cElli and I were both very taken by your story and think it\u2019s such a special occasion you are here and want to make this as special as we can for you and your daughter.\u201d I responded \u201c I appreciate it, but just being here with her is special enough.\u201d Jenny then said \u201cWe have a room ready for you (which as early as it was, I was very pleasantly surprised) but since it\u2019s just the two of you, we\u2019ve put you in a king bed instead of the double full. My manager Elli has also approved a complimentary upgrade for you. A king suite with an amazing view.\u201d At this time I was completely shocked. I expressed my gratitude to Jenny. She again explained to me how nice it was to see me there with my daughter and they wanted the best experience for us. She said my story was very touching and they were more than happy to upgrade me. I was given my room keys for room 5201. I expressed my thanks again and headed to the elevator. To my surprise, there are 52 floors and it appeared our room was on the top floor. We headed up, got off the elevator and walked\nTo our room. When we opened up the door my mouth hit the floor. We had a full separate living room area, with two couches, a huge tv, a refrigerator, sink and microwave. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. A large full bathroom was just off the living room area. My daughter ran over to the window and screamed in joy \u201cDaddy come look at this!\u201d I went over and again JUST WOW! The view we had of Times Square was absolutely breathtaking. We then walked though a pair of double french doors which opened up to another full bathroom ahead of us. To the left of the bathroom was a beautiful king size bed, tv, arm chair and another amazing view. We were in a corner room so had two different views of Times Square. We could see the New Year\u2019s Eve ball from the bedroom. It was just unreal. I never in my wildest dreams could have pictured myself in a suite like this. My daughter ran around for what seemed like an hour , just so excited , taking it all in. I told her how lucky we were to be in a room like this. She screamed \u201c OH THANK YOU EVERYONE!\u201d Again, I want to add how clean the suite was all around. After a half hour of getting settled in, the phone rang and it was Jenny from the front desk, making sure we were satisfied and I once again expressed my upmost gratitude to her and Elli. She said it was there pleasure and to call if I needed anything for my stay. The cleaning staff was stellar, we\u2019d come back to a tidy and organized room that was cleaned and smelled amazing! The next day, we passed Jenny in leaving and she had a teddy bear and a box of chocolates for my daughter. I mean, as if they couldn\u2019t be any nicer! Overall, if you were to take out the upgrade, I\u2019d still be giving the hotel 5 stars. I know this was an extremely long review but not enough compliments, gratitude and words can be said for the experience I had here with my daughter. Memories I will never forget and cherish forever. Thank you Jenny, Elli and the rest of the staff at Millennium Hotel. I am forever grateful and was blessed to have this amazing experience.l with my daughter. See you all again this Summer with the rest of the family who can\u2019t wait to stay and meet you all! \n\nForever grateful,\nBryan P","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

At $600\/day with tax ($3000 for five days), this was the most expensive hotel we have ever stayed in. Also one of the most disappointing. We arrived late at night and woke up early on our first day. We went to the front desk with a list of what we thought were simple requests.\n\n1. We asked for outlets next to our double beds. The only place in our room where we could plug in our phones and other electronics was in the bathroom. \n2. We asked for a coffee maker. \n3. We asked for a second bedside lamp since we had two beds and one lamp to share between us (the hotel charged us an extra $50\/night for twin beds). \n4. We also asked for help with turning on the TV. \n\nThen we went out for the day. We were gone for the entire day. We did not put a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign on our door. We came back in the evening to wet towels and unmade beds. No one had entered our room during the day to bring in any of the things we asked for and no one had cleaned our room.\n\nThe following day a staff member came in to set up the TV.  It took two more days to get a coffee maker and also two days to get an extension cord that one of the hotel service people plugged in behind one of our beds so we could get power in the bedroom for our phones. We never did get that extra lamp for the second bed. I do not blame most of this on the front desk staff. The concierge and front desk folks were nice and efficient. It's just a really badly run hotel. I do have a problem with a hotel that does not have outlets and bedside lamps and daily cleaning in their basic business model.\n\nThere were other issues with the hotel. \n\nThe whole hotel \u2013 elevators and hallways \u2013 seemed a little run down. But not as scruffy as our room. Our room had ceiling stains, peeling wallpaper, a gouged desk, a badly cracked sink and tub, and a few other unidentifiable stains.\n\nThe hotel cafe was closed and there was no place in the hotel to sit. The hotel does have a lobby, but, except for two short backless benches facing the check in desk, there is no place on the property outside of the hotel room to sit. No place to wait. No place to go while other people may be trying to sleep while you are awake.\n\nWe had another day when the cleaning staff arrived just as we were changing for dinner. Maybe staff who work in the morning are hard to find in New York, but I\u2019ve never stayed in a hotel that did this poor a job of meeting basic cleaning requirements.\n\nI wrote all of this in the survey that the Millenium emailed me. I said that it would be nice to have some kind of refund for our pretty awful experience. They offered $5.\n\nThis is the hotel\u2019s reply to my survey and negative review. It made me laugh:\n\" From all of us at the Millennium Broadway New York Times Square, thank you for completing our survey. We truly appreciate your feedback. It will help us improve.\n\nAs a token of our appreciation, get USD$5 off your next stay \u2026\n\nThank you again, and we hope to see you soon!\n\nBest regards,\nVikram Sardana\nGeneral Manager\nMillennium Broadway New York Times Square \"","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I've stayed at the Millennium Hotel before and it is going downhill.  The bathroom had a broken toilet paper holder, so the rolls were on top of the toilet and they must have changed the actual toilet at some point because it was so big, you could not open the door all the way as it was hitting the toilet. Bad planning by someone, that's for sure.  When I checked into my room, I looked around for plugs so I could use my laptop and charge my mobile phone. No plugs available on any wall.  I had to pull out one of the night stands and luckily there was an extension cord for the bedside lamp and it had an available plug that I could use to charge my phone.  I first started staying at the Millennium when it first opened, the beds and pillows were very comfortable. Somewhere along the way, they changed the mattresses and pillows. If you like a bed that is hard as a rock, then you will enjoy the new mattresses. The pillows and pretty hard too, not soft and comfortable.  As far as I can tell, the room was lacking two lamps, one on the desk and a standing floor lamp. I base this on the fact that I went to the rooms of two different friends who were also staying there and their rooms both had desk lamps and floor lamps, plus the photos of the available rooms show the lamps as being in the room. I mentioned this to the front desk but they didn't seem to be concerned. They just mumbled some sort of sorry about that.  And since my last stay, they have instituted a daily \"resort fee\" of $42.00  I was only told about the resort fee when I arrived, it was not mentioned anywhere that I could find on the booking site.  I asked the front desk clerk what amenities were included in the resort fee and she informed me that it was WiFi and the workout room.  I was not happy about it as I never have time to use the workout facilities at any hotel I stay at. I think it's just a ripoff of their customers. I will never stay at the Millennium in the future.","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Previous reviews leave you a bit dubious but at the end of the day in New York a good nights sleep is all that is needed. Rooms could do with more plugs but it is an older hotel so if there are 4 people in a room you need to share plugs. If anyone says anything about it being in a dodgy area it\u2019s not.

I am noticing that the complaints are because people arent simply READING when they book. No where does it guarantee a fridge (but you can absolutely request one) and most places in the city are going to have resort fees so I suggest people pay attention and budget accordingly before complaining and giving a lesser review then deserved because they couldnt be bothered to research their accommodation sufficiently.\n\nMy husband and I stayed at this hotel last week as a getaway for our 15th anniversary. Upon arrival, we were greeted by Daniel (aka Danny the Beard) at the front desk. Check in was simple and fast and Daniel was incredibly helpful. Anything that we needed for the stay, Daniel was our man and delivered every single time. While yes, the rooms are a little outdated and their were some carpet stains, it was clean and comfortable and the location, views and staff can't be beat. We had a small issue with access to our room, but someone came and had the battery in our key card changed within 10 minutes. \n\nJust outside the doors (without ever having to cross the street) is Hudson Theater, a 24 hour McDonald's, 24 hour Walgreens, Popeyes, gap, old navy and RiseNY. There is 24 hour security\/concierge staff stationed right by the elevator entrance as well at front desk staff available for your needs any time of the day or night. \n\nMalik I believe his name was (the 3-11 door man) was very helpful and came through with some really solid information for us. Our housekeeper (didn't catch her name, but she services the 39th floor) was also wonderful. \n\nIf you're considering a stay at this gem in the heart of Times Square, STOP and book it! Don't forget to stop by the front desk daily for the fabulous breath of fresh air that is Daniel and see his daily beard changes! Oh, did I mention that Daniel is amazing?!?!","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Over the course of a mere three-night stay, we were subjected to two fire alarm incidents. The first proved to be a false alarm, yet the disruption to our peace was significant. Just when we thought we could put that incident behind us, the alarm went off again due to an overheated HVAC unit. Upon inquiry, we learned that this was a result of the hotel's long-standing disrepair. Safety should always be paramount, but it's evident that this establishment hasn't been keeping up with essential maintenance.\n\nBeyond the alarming safety concerns, the overall experience was underwhelming. Our room felt like a snapshot from decades ago \u2013 and not in a charming, vintage way. The wear and tear was unmistakable, with outdated furnishings and an air of neglect.\n\nThe breakfast, which many hotels consider a chance to shine and satisfy their guests, was a lackluster affair. The selection was limited, and the quality of the food was subpar at best.\n\nTimes Square deserves accommodations that live up to its vibrant reputation. Regrettably, Millennium Times Square falls far short of the mark.

I then had to go downstairs myself and ask reception for help. An operative turned up and whilst he was nice and polite you could tell he was obviously very burnt out and tired. He showed us a \u201ctrick\u201d to get the shower fixed\u2026 a trick? For an upgraded room it\u2019s not good enough. He couldn\u2019t fix the lights in our room as he didn\u2019t have the lamps or facilities so we had 1 table light in our our entire room. All but one socket and usb port worked as well but he also couldn\u2019t repair that. Again, for an upgrade is this good enough? No.\n\nThe bath after I cleaned it myself!! Drained so so so slowly, I had a bet with my partner to see if would have drained by the time we returned in the evening. So if my partner had a shower I then had to stand in his shower water as I used it - again, not good enough for an upgraded room. \n\nThe bath tap was also so wobbly and hanging off of the wall - I asked the operative about this and again he said he can\u2019t fix and it should be fine. \n\nWardrobes didn\u2019t close properly as the doors were broken and the iron didn\u2019t work!

I\u2019d like to challenge our upgrade fee and facility fee as no one wanted to answer the phone to be (which was also FILTH) and the wifi is rubbish. Better off just using your 5G.\n\nAlso, so many other guests walking the floors and outside the lifts in their underwear, staff just seemed to ignore which was so weird. \n\nAir con in the room was poor, smelt bad and barely worked. Just what you want in 37 degree weather. \n\nFor a city view upgrade (which by the way was just a view of an office block opposite) if I had chance of a preview I 100% wouldn\u2019t of taken it nor would I recommend to anyone. \n\nI\u2019ve never left a bad review before but this stay was just all round disappointing, especially for a 30th birthday and really basic without the basic price tag! \n\nThe only good thing I have to say is that the location is good and the bed was surprisingly comfortable (minus the hairs that weren\u2019t ours) ","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Two blocks from two different subway stations and right in Time Square\/Theatre district.   This was our third stay.  We have also stayed in several other chain hotels within 5 blocks of this one but very glad we came back to Millimium.  We had room 5101 (deluxe) with an amazing  view of the city skyline and time square. The room was a generous size with huge windows. The bathroom is a bit dated but OK and the rest of the room was fine (had a mini fridge).  We could hear some faint noise from time square at night but that typically ended before midnight and was very quiet in the morning.  I don\u2019t recall that from previous stays so it may depend on room location. The hotel doesn\u2019t have a restaurant anymore but there is a deli across the street (cooks) that has breakfast so that was easy and inexpensive. The hotel does have a small gift\/sundry shop with snacks\/drinks. A nice feature is that the hotel has doors on 44th and 45th so it saves time depending which direction you need to go.  We love seeing shows so that is a huge draw for staying here and its a pleasant walk to Central Park along 6th\/Avenue of the Americas or quick walk to subways to go to all the other NYC tourist areas.

The attached pictures will speak for themselves, but I would like to relay my story so that I may, hopefully, save the hard-earned dollars of other travelers from this dump of a hotel. \n\nWe arrived with excitement on a Thursday only to be met with extreme disappointment by our accommodations. There was lint, dust and stains on the walls that appeared to have been there for a very long time. In the bathroom, from ceiling to floor there was some form of mold, grime, dirt, stains, crud, you name it, it was there. We found a dirty towel hanging in the closet, along with someone's chewing tobacco; trash and a dirty sock behind the desk (which we wouldn't normally inspect, but somehow felt compelled to do so after seeing the rest of the room), stained and worn-out furniture, a broken lampshade on a flickering light, I mean, the list goes on and on. My son took a shower that night and he said the tub - which wouldn't drain - filled with yellowish water...ew!\n\nWe called the front desk and the night manager said there were no other rooms available that evening but, they would move us to another room on Friday. We asked to speak to the director, but she wasn't available so we requested for her to call us. She never did, even after following up with the manager the next night, again asking to speak with the hotel director.\n\nThe second room was equally disgusting, as you will see by the attached photos. The tub did not drain in this room either and the toilet took almost 10 minutes to refill its tank. By the way, the beds in both room were horribly uncomfortable (very, very hard) with pillows that felt more like stacks of cardboard than pillow material.\n\nDo not be fooled by the photos on the website either. Even the \"My Millennium\" app states this location serves a breakfast on the weekends, but be warned, there is NO restaurant, NO lounge, NO bar, NOTHING. They have a fitness room, but none of the other amenities advertised exist here. They closed during COVID and never reopened, as the story goes. However, the hotel will charge you \"facility fee\" (aka, \"resort fee\") of $34\/day for the use of the wifi, fitness room and their \"business center.\" Who needs a business center nowadays?\n\nUpon checkout, the front desk noticed there was a credit to our bill and apologized for any inconvenience. (We were given a pittance of a credit for our troubles.) I relayed to her all the items we encountered, and she put me in touch with the Assistant Director who stated, \"I wish you would have told me and I could have made it right.\" Really? We reported the conditions, asked to speak to the hotel director (twice), and they put us in an equally disgusting room and I'm supposed to: 1. Spend my vacation chasing down the director and 2. Expect the hotel would do any better when they replaced one repulsive room for another? Also, I overheard another guest two windows over from me while I was checking out, tell the front desk that while he was showering, dirty water came out of the shower and filled the tub with brown water. He showed her pictures he had taken.\n\nThe neglect extends beyond the rooms, as well. The hallway fixtures are cracked in similar fashion to the lampshade in our room, the wallpaper is peeling in various places, the elevator mirrors have graffiti scratched into them, the carpets are stained throughout many corridors.\n\nFor what this hotel is supposed to be, it is rundown, shabby and in dire need of repair, renovation and updating. Spare yourself the trouble and avoid this hotel at all costs.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Great Location and Water Pressure is the ONLY thing going for it. Everything else is just horrible.\nTake a look at the pictures attached. Rooms are filthy. Dust everywhere. Stained Carpets. Walls have dirty marks everywhere on them. Electrical LIVE wires hanging out of lights which is a real concern. Television hasn't worked for the whole time we have stayed here (5 nights). Service Staff came to repair it but was too STONED on weed , didn't care and gave up and Literally went home! Every day House Keeping would come and the only thing they did was make the bed and remove the towels. They never cleaned, they never replaced the towels! Every day we had to call house keeping to request for towels.\nWifi was slow and kept dropping out in the room. Take a look at the pictures of the TV and WIFI Router! Look at the picture of the taps in the bathroom. Dirt, hair shavings etc. It hasn't been cleaned in months! Paint and wall paper pealing from nearly every wall. Skirtings have about 3mm of dust on them. Mould Mould and More Mould in the shower! Furniture is old and chipped.\n\nSeriously...... for the $$ you pay for this room per night with the taxes then added on top, it is an absolute rip off.\nLike I said in the headline, great location..... couldn't ask for a better spot.\n\nWould I stay here again?..... Certainly NOT.....\n\nNote: I am NOT a picky person when it comes to hotels, resorts etc...... I'm far from it.

If you want to hear doors slamming all night and if you want to hear everything happening in Time Square - stay here. Sleep is almost impossible with the very loud noise coming from all angles. Almost everything in the room is ancient and broken - not to mention filthy. The cleaning staff banged on my door every early morning asking \u201cwhen are you leaving\u201d even though I had the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door and spoke to the front desk about it numerous times so I wouldn\u2019t keep getting woken up. No apologies by the way. The phone in my room didn\u2019t work so being on floor 25, I had to go all the way downstairs whenever there was a problem - and there were many problems. The drain in my shower was pulled out when I arrived. When I showered, I had to stand in my own filth since nothing would drain. I had to wash my feet\/legs in the sink as the water didn\u2019t drain until the next morning. My towels, cups, etc were never replaced. They made my bed and that\u2019s all. The elevators weren\u2019t working because the light to go down was out so I always had to go up before going down and with 50 floors, this took a lot of waiting time. Once I checked out, I left my bags for a few hours and came back in the afternoon needing to use the washroom. The Manager on duty was useless. Thank goodness Trinity the concierge was there to attempt to fix the problem. The main floor women\u2019s washroom was flooded so the only option was the men\u2019s washroom. As I entered, the toilet was covered in feces. The manager couldn\u2019t have been older than 25 years old and he wasn\u2019t only not helpful, but he didn\u2019t care at all about my seeking help. I will say that the door man Mark and the concierge Trinity (just hired a week ago) were fantastic. They\u2019re the only ones who stopped me from completely losing my mind. I cannot say enough about Mark. He did the work of the entire staff, running everywhere to make sure every guest was taken care of yo the highest caliber. Give this man a raise!!!  The group of men who would regularly assemble near the concierge area were rude and useless. I believe they were security but hard to tell given they were in suits like all other staff.  Whenever I asked a question, I was told to ask Trinity as they then turned their back and continued socially talking among themselves. These were not hard questions (e.g., what street is that road outside the door). \nI\u2019ve left a message for the General Manager with no response. It was very difficult getting his name since the young and inexperienced Manager on duty wouldn\u2019t give it to me. I hope the GM will soon contact me for a full refund and compensation of some sort because this trip was 5 years in the making and was supposed to be my first break in a very long time. I\u2019m told the Premium Millenium hotel next door is much better BUT I will be the judge of that shortly if the GM rights this wrong. ","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

We were told it would be a few hours until this is ready, not ideal after 14 hours of travel. We accepted not to have adjoining rooms, but at least have it on the same floors. The process of checking in took 30 minutes. \n\nWhen we were going to the room, the outdated d\u00e9cor flowed through this hotel. The hallways were stained and scratches down the walls and all over the doors. It did not look appealing or safe. \n\nUpon  entering the room, I was met by a 28 degree blast of heat coming out the air conditioning, which Is awful. I would later find out that the aircon would randomly turn on during the night and heat the room.\n\nThe 1970\u2019s d\u00e9cor had unfortunately followed me into this room, with big clunky broken furniture with missing handles and scratches all over them. The only remaining piece of the wardrobe was a shelf and 4 different colours of white walls in its place. \nThe bed had no duvet, just an old, tired beige blanket. \nThe bathroom was mouldy on several tiles, with damage to the bathtub or shower basin \u2013 couldn\u2019t tell which it was. The wall surrounding the mirror was baked in dust and was frankly horrid. \nThe rooms didn\u2019t have any basic facilities or amenities, such as a coffee machine, kettle, fridge, pen paper, and information about the hotel etc. \n\nWhen I departed the hotel, a charge of $120 dollars had been placed on my card. After contacting the hotel the informed me it was a facilities fee. I expressed my dissatisfaction at not being informed of this at either arrival or departure. \nI would like to know what the facilities fee include, because there is no bar, no restaurant, no gym no room service. \n\nTo sum up this hotel shouldn\u2019t be a 4 star, it is in need of a serious refurbishment and modernization with the basic facilities reopening. I would not stay here again. The only positive is the location, which can be a little noisy when the aircon starts and the window needs opening. \n","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"NONE"}

They held our bags as we arrived 2 hours early (Check in is at 4pm) and didn't leave for the airport until late. (5pm) They were all extremely friendly and courteous and the bellhops were great, they sorted us an SUV to get us to JFK instead of us trying to get a big enough uber or yellow cab.\n\nThe hotel is in a prime location, although it can be noisy at night but we didn't notice it to be too bad as we were on the 44th floor. It has an entrance at either side so you can enter both streets. It has a Duane Reade next door for snacks\/drinks etc. And an Irish Pub near both entrances. Highly recommend O'Connolly's!\n\nOur Safe wouldn't open and they came and fixed it within 10 minutes. We also had a fridge and we asked for a kettle which they provided us with straight away.\n\nThe room, whilst it could have done with a spruce up, was not dirty by any means. The beds were clean, and comfy. The floor was clean and the bathroom was immaculate. Even though some of the grouting on the tiles were discoloured, it should by no means be enough to put you off. My cousin and her husband upgraded their room to one on the 47th floor before we arrived and they're room was fantastic with a great View of Times Square.\n\nI've been to New York 4 times, I've stopped at The Row, The Roosevelt and The Lexington and this hotel was just as good.

They were black and very plain, so definitely not an easy task\n\nAnd that's only a fraction of what he had to do.  Since the entire call was over an hour and he made so many attempts, called so many services, and tried various options, I can only remember and write half of what he did for us.\n\nEvery time we were placed on hold, he frequently updated us on his efforts, made sure we hadn't disconnected, and informed us of his next attempt to locate them.  In case we did disconnect, he gave us his direct line to bypass going through the front desk.\n\nHe then made every effort to ensure that the coats were easily labeled and recognized by security so we could pick them up after the weekend\n\nAbsolutely showed us the epitome of what hotel hospitality can be.  The definition of above-and-beyond and by far the greatest hotel employee experience I have ever received in my years of extensive traveling and hotel stays.

Friendly staff but could do with some improvement.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-01-23","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"The hotel is a little bit dated. I imagine this hotel was modern and amazing in the 90\u2019s\/ 2000\u2019s. That being said, in New York a hotel is purely a base for sleeping and showering. Although it is dated, we found it very clean (I\u2019d rather a clean old hotel than a dirty new\/ modern one).  The views from the room we had (50th floor) were amazing, the staff at reception, security, the little gift shop that sells sweets and drinks & the cleaners were all very friendly. The location is ideal for tourists as your 30 second walk from the steps in Times Square & we walked to the empire state building in about 10 minutes (obviously stopping to get pictures along the way as tourists do). \n\nPros:\n\n-close to Times Square and other tourists attractions \n\n-clean\/ smells nice.\n\n- a shop inside the hotel that sells snacks and drinks so you don\u2019t need to leave the hotel.\n\n- friendly staff \n\n- comfy beds & a TV that has Netflix.\n\n- views from the rooms.\n\nCons:\n\n- as mentioned above a little dated.\n\n- we had a crack on the marble next to the sink & some of the wall paper was peeling off in the bathroom. Which if you didn\u2019t see it or had children who didn\u2019t know that catching your hand in something like this could hurt you , then I imagine this would be an issue for you. \n\n- the room was very warm and \u201cstuffy\u201d the air con wasn\u2019t great. Which wasn\u2019t too big of an issue for us, with it being January. however be warned if you visit in July. \n\n- when we arrived there was only one big towel and one towel for hair (for 2 people) This issue wasn\u2019t sorted until 8am the next day. However I consider myself a forgiving person and wouldn\u2019t hold this against the hotel and would still stay at this hotel again.\n\nFeedback for the hotel:\n\nThere is a bar\/ restaurant that advertises a mix of Thai\/ Chinese\/ Japanese food in the hotel? Why was this not open\/ in use? It would have been great for us when we landed to grab a bite to eat and a beer or it would have come in use for us on our last day as we checked out at 11:00am and pick up wasn\u2019t until 2pm. If this was open we would have happily eat there, drinked there etc, until our pick up. and we wasn\u2019t the only ones on our last day that were just sat around waiting doing nothing etc waiting to the pick up. there is obviously a need for it and a way to make money in future.\n\nI\u2019d also recommend they review the marble in the bathrooms etc to make sure there are no cracks as it could potentially cause an injury. \n\nAgain as mentioned above I would happily stay here again when we revisit New York. Yes there are nicer hotels out there, but if your on a budget and get a good deal then by all means go for it.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Had a view of the Chrysler Building from our room on 50th floor!\n- The area was brilliant. Literally a 30 second walk to Times Square. McDonald\u2019s on the corner, Starbucks next to 45 St exit. Couldn\u2019t ask for any more. Short walk to 5th Av etc. \n- Staff were very friendly from the maids to the staff on reception \n- The hotel is clean (most important of all)!\n- Beds are huge! Didn\u2019t hear my fianc\u00e9 snore once \ud83d\ude02\n- The rooms have a joint shower\/bath, bath isn\u2019t very deep but enough to be able to have a soak after walking around all day!\n- Lots of subway stations close by.\n\nCons\n- Hotel was a little dated, but we didn\u2019t really spend much time in the hotel. Literally just a base for sleep \n- Air con in room could be better! We stayed in January and the room was still very hot. We kept the windows open and air con off as the settings just weren\u2019t cool enough. We\u2019re from the UK and NYC did have a warm(ish) January but I imagine that if you\u2019re from a warmer part of the world that you may appreciate the air con not being cold!\n- After check out we had to wait a few hours for our transfer to airport. Left our cases at the hotel storage room to get breakfast but couldn\u2019t go far incase we got stuck somewhere and didn\u2019t arrive back. Everyone had the same idea as us, around 25 people waiting in the lobby for transfers, taxis etc. I think the hotel would make a lot of money if the bar were open rather than people sitting on the floor.\n\nTips\n- Ask for room on a high floor\n- TIP! We don\u2019t have tipping culture in the UK but it\u2019s essential for workers in the US especially in the hospitality sector\n- Get a weekly metro card (think it was around $30). Can get subways to literally everywhere. A 1 mile taxi ride cost us $25 so we\u2019ll worth the money. If you have an iPhone you can use maps which will tell you where\/when to get off if you put in your location. Didn\u2019t feel unsafe on the subway once, lots of police around \n- If you do get a taxi use the Curb app! Better than Uber with price increase when it\u2019s busy. \n\nExcursions\n- Buy the sightseeing pass via the app! So many attractions you can get into using this pass including all the main tourist attractions (Rockerfeller, Empire State, Tour Buses, Sightseeing cruises etc.) \n- If you miss out on seeing the Statue of Liberty use the Statten Island Ferry, it\u2019s free and they\u2019re every 30 mins! It goes right past Lady Liberty\n- We went to a Knicks game at Maddison Square Garden which was an amazing experience! Foam fingers the lot! \n- The Deli across the road (44 St exit) is brilliant. Don\u2019t go to Virgil\u2019s, I have another review why!\n\n","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Just a stones throw from Times Square and surrounded by bars and restaurants it\u2019s certainly in the thick of the action! No doubt that\u2019s some cause of the high nightly rates when I stayed but it\u2019s a shame the rooms didn\u2019t match the same great aspects.\n\nChecking in late one evening had a little wait but the single member of staff working was friendly enough and the actual process fairly slick. It\u2019s a large lobby area for an imposing first impression and there\u2019s a number of fast lifts serving each of the floors. My room was a standard affair on the 36th floor.\n\nIt certainly struck as feeling pretty dated. The lighting was really dim, relying on only a desk and floor lamp and none of these, including the bathroom lights could be controlled from the bed, so navigating at night was interesting. There was a charging socket on the bedside lamp, but other than that no obvious electric sockets in convenient places throughout the room. There was no mini bar nor kettle \/ drink facilities, and the doors to a lot of the cupboards were broken, which just added to the tatty and dated feel.\n\nThe bathroom was pretty spacious and had loads of storage space around the sink. Again it felt in desperate need of a refurb and the bath was pretty dirty. The shower was powerful but took some time to get the temperature as needed and the towels were adequate.\n\nA couple of very good things were the air-conditioning, which worked well without being overly noisy, and the iron which was a delight to use. Perhaps the biggest negative with the room though - the noise from outside! Throughout the night the wail of sirens, car horns, people etc was so loud in the room it made for a very poor nights sleep. When making a phone call the other person commented they thought I was actually outside given the sirens, and this was 36 floors up.\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting to stay in such a prime location then it should be on a shortlist, but the quality of the room didn\u2019t justify the price being charged and I didn\u2019t leave wanting to return again.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I am sure back 40 years ago this place was nice.  But it is now dirty and worn out like a old used up truck stop.  Maybe worse.  I was here for business and had no choice.  I will never stay there again.  Who ever owns that place should be ashamed to run such a filthy nasty hotel and take peoples hard earned money. Go elsewhere.  \n\nAll my compliments about the staff are genuine.  They are very kind and helpful people.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

If you are ok with that then sure it is a great location in heart of Manhattan. We got a room on 20 ish floor and the room reminded me of a asylum setup with a spooky crib and walls with water marks. I immediately asked for an upgrade which they provided and was a much better room but had ac problems. We reported it 3 times and they couldnt fix it. Their service guy told us it is what it is. Ended up with a tower fan and 75 plus temperature during day time with 2 kids. Kids will wake up in the middle of the night crying because they are sweaty. Took it up with Expedia and all they could do is provide a refund for the remainder nights and leave us in the middle of our trip with no accomodation. It was even horrible to hear how front desk lied to Expedia that they did not receive any ticket from us to fix the issue. They had the audacity to charge reset fee as well. Their representative called us and threw a horrible attitude. Told me they can refund the resort fee is that makes me feel better. Her Attitude sucked. She was talking as if she is doing me a favor. \nHotel probably would have earned 5 stars from me but this ordeal was a different level. Maybe because of pandemic hotel staff forgot how to treat customers and be a good host. \n\nAvoid them if you can. You have better choices like Westin or Marriott right around the corner if you can afford it.\n\nExpedia is another clown company. Avoid them like a plague. You will be out of luck if you run into these issues. Manager mentioned to Expedia that they could have changed the room if I would have asked. Well we did and no one bothered to respond on the ask.

Its location is superb as it is just off Times Square where \"all the action is\" and surrounded by various theatres, restaurants, cafes and shops. There is even a supermarket close by.\nWe were warmly greeted by Simon C on Reception. Check-in was very quick and simple. When Simon heard that our trip was part of our wedding anniversary celebrations he upgraded us to a King and also gave us a complimentary box of chocolates. So kind and thoughtful.\nOur room was on the 34th floor and it was on the quieter side of the building at the end of a corridor. The room itself was very large with plenty of storage. However it was very apparent that it needed some TLC. There apparently used to be a fridge which had been removed and the cupboard door was loose; the wardrobe doors did not close properly and were damaged; the safe did not work (when I reported this to Reception I was advised that there was a problem getting the necessary parts); there was no tea\/coffee making facilities but after a call to Housekeeping they provided a kettle so that I could make our obligatory cups of tea in the morning; the curtains and nets were very worn and some of the fittings were broken; the bath had been patched several times and the paint was flaking off; the grouting needed replacing; when having a shower the water did not drain away properly so you ended up having a mixture of bath and shower (which was great for our feet which were weary from walking miles each day!). \nHowever, despite this, we were more than happy with the room! It was clean and tidy, more than adequate for our needs for our stay in New York. It was serviced every day which was nice.\nThe on-site restaurant was not open when we were there but there are so many different choices within a short walking distance it was no problem. \nThe staff at the Hotel are all very helpful and friendly.\nTiffany dealt with us when we checked out, and we advised her of the various issues in our room in case they were able to deal with them prior to the next guest checking in. She advised us that the hotel is due for a refurbishment soon. It must be hard for the front-line staff as it is not their fault that the hotel is \"tired\".\nLike everywhere else, the hospitality business has been hit the hardest by the Covid pandemic and there were many other hotels and restaurants that are still not open. \nI could not give this Hotel or its rooms an excellent rating due to my comments but still rated it as very good based on its location and particularly its staff.\nThanks to everyone for making the last hotel stop of our holiday so enjoyable.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

We consequently emailed the hotel to seek some clarification\/ reassurance. Two emails were sent, no response received to either.\n\nOur concern lead us to check nearby alternatives, all of which were considerably more expensive compared with the rate that we secured with a booking late in 2021. We consequently decided to take our chances.\n\nHaving not visited for a few years we were shocked to see how far downhill the the interior of the hotel had gone. The hotel interior can only be described as shabby, definitely not shabby chic! While our room was kept clean by housekeeping the state of the furniture was terrible with drawers on the desk broken, woodwork chipped\/marked and curtains\/net linings hanging off. We reported the curtain problem due to light shinning in at night, but it was never fixed. Additionally, one of the reading lights on the bed headboard was not working. This too reported, but never fixed. A Four Star Hotel that cannot fix curtains or a light, not at all impressive, especially when the hotel never provided any feedback or an apology.\n\nOur friends had a similar room which had glasses in the bathroom, we had none. Requested that they were provided, with two paper coffee cups subsequently supplied! \n\nThe bathroom, although kept clean, had what we referred to as a novelty toilet. It was obviously a replacement unit but had been fitted offset with one side of the cistern close to the wall and the other side 2+ inches away from the wall! Began to speculate that housekeeping had replaced it as it was not something that would be expected from a maintenance professional.\n\nApart from the lady who checked us in, who had the personality of a wet fish, a number of the members of staff were instrumental in our decision to not check out early. Particular thanks to Syeeda (who we noted from an earlier review was the \u201cgo to lady\u201d if you have a problem), Shelley who mitigated the situation to persuade us not to check out early, Pat (lobby) and the singing Doorman on 44th Street (sorry did not get his name). The good service that we received from these few staff members has resulted in an \"average\" rather than \"poor\" overall service rating in this review. \n\nFrom what we understand a refurbishment project is scheduled for next year with two floors being taken out at time to facilitate this. If we ever return we will be checking that our room has gone through the process and it is nowhere near those where work is still in progress!\n\nWe speculated that an executive decision has been made to cut all but essential maintenance expenditure pending commencement of any refurbishment project. Until then, after seeing recent management responses, the impression is that they just let the front line staff take the flak from guests, then just indicate that something will be done when responding to reviews.\n\nOn the website is a tab \u201cTravel safe during Covid 19\u201d, buried away in this is a generic statement \u201chotel amenities and services may be limited\u201d. As of early May this includes no bar or restaurant. The absence of such would have at least caused a pre-arrival email apology or letter in the room at other 4 Star Hotels that we have stayed at. \n\nIf you are considering staying at MTS, hope this helps with your decision-making process, do not believe all the glossy photos shown on their website. \n\nIt is hoped that someone from the Millennium Copthorne Hotels Group reads this review and intervenes at a corporate level to undertake a review of the MTS management system, and maybe check to ascertain whether the maintenance staff were laid off at the peak of the Covid pandemic and someone had omitted to rehire them!","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Hotel itself was dirty and our room was gross. The maid service and doormen were really sweet! I wanted to buy one bubble tea but I wasn't sure if he'd want it since I forgot to ask! This gets 2 stars because of them! Otherwise it'd be 1 (wish there was a 0). \n\nIt clearly hadn't been cleaned well, if at all honestly. I don't even know if the desk had been sanitized down. \n\nWe found a long streak of dried blood on the sheets when we finally went to go to sleep that night (11:00PM). It was on the sheet under the top blanket. Took photos and brought it to the night manager who simply said \"we couldn't verify it was blood, so we'll call it just a red stain\". Offered me new sheets or new room - it was already 11:20PM by then and we were EXHAUSTED, so we said new sheets. She said a maid will be up right away. 30 minutes pass, no maid. So I call down. She apologize and said that \"theres only 1 maid, so there was a delay.\" I said that we could make the bed ourselves and meet the maid anywhere. We were just exhausted and needed to sleep. She said that the maid was on her way up right now, so we waited. They said they'd take of the facility fee for a night (which is $30).\n\nNow it's midnight, no maid. 5 past midnight now and fiance then goes down. He gets the same response, but from a different person this time. So we wait again. 15 minutes later a doorman finally comes and just hands us sheets so we can make the bed ourselves. And we also found a used condom and lots of trash behind the bed when we went to change the sheets finally. \n\nIn the AM we talk to the day-time manager. Mind you, I have photo evidence of the stain AND time stamps. I show this manager everything and he tells us that he'll take off a second day of facility fees and dismisses us. Once we go to check out 2 days later they said that only 1 day worth of facility fees are taken off. When I explain 2 days should be, he just says nowhere says 2 in the notes, just 1 so he was only going to take off for 1. NYC was exhausting so we just said whatever and left at that. \n\nThe way this was handled was awful and it was beyond disgusting (not to mention a biohazard - that stain could have a number of possible infectious diseases) having to deal with this situation.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

The cleanliness wasn't great and the bathroom walls had massive clumps of dust on. Considering dust takes a while to gather it's concerning how long that has been completely missed and not cleaned. The sheets had marks on them even when they were changed each day there would be a different mark somewhere else.\n\nJust like other reviews suggest, the elevators were a nightmare. Really slow and always massive queues when you just want to come back and get to your room, one day we waited 10 minutes on our floor for the elevator (49th floor so not really a just take the stairs situation).\n\nThe above wouldn't have really made much of a difference the main reason this is an awful hotel and why I wouldn't stay again or recommend is money: they take $100 per night deposit (the rooms are falling apart as they are so not sure how we could even do $400 worth of damage but that was fine we get it back no issues) they also take $35 per night resort fees that you get absolutely nothing for. They try to say wifi is one of the things but it was down on two separate occasions for us.\n\nI noticed when I checked out someone was checking in and was given a whole speech on what was available such as gym, wifi, shop etc - we had none of that when we checked in so weren't even aware of what the hotel had but the worst part was 2 American guests checked out while I was there and both of them said \"I was told the resort fees would be waived\" no questions asked the staff just agreed so makes me think resort fees are only payable if you're a foreign tourist.\n\nWhen I checked out, I luckily looked at my bank and on top of the deposit they had taken a random amount of money from me, I queried it and NO ONE could explain what it was or why it was taken and that it would most likely go back. \n\nI've since been in touch with them and they've said \"our system automatically authorized that amount while running the night audit in error\" - so it's a bit concerning they keep your details and are able to take money from you during the night. I got this back in about 2 weeks and instead of a nice gesture of refunding the resort fees like they did for American guests they offered me a 50% refund of resort fees that I still haven't received and they're blaming my bank.\n\nIn summary, stay there if you want to be in Times Square and don't mind it a bit dirty but keep an eye on your bank as I imagine a lot of people don't even check and they're keeping random amounts of money from their guests. If this does happen, be prepared for the weeks of back and forth and having your emails ignored for ages for nothing to be offered for the inconvenience.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

We stayed here in June 2019 and it was a fantastic stay. This time, we arrived on a cold Winter night in February 2022 and found disappointments after disappointments. When we first got to our room (number 2917), the beds neither had a duvet nor a blanket, only a fitted sheet and 2 flat sheets. The bathroom had no towel floor mat, and the bathtub was clogged, couldn\u2019t drain. The floor area around the base of the toilet was badly stained yellow, it looked as if that area has collected a lot of urine over time. The drawers under the TV wouldn't close, and the upper hinge on the door to where the small fridge used to be, was broken. The safe was already locked, meaning we would need it unlocked the next day for our use. Not feeling good about the room, we still decided to stay in it because it was already 2am after a long flight and we had already unpacked our suitcases. We called housekeeping that night for the blankets and towel mat as they were immediate needs. The housekeeping lady on the phone said they've always provided triple sheets only, no duvet or blanket ever needed to be provided. (We were here 2.5 years ago and there were duvets). However, she said she would have someone bring us the duvets and the towel mat. 10 minutes later someone came and brought us the duvets, but they forgot the towel mat. We didn\u2019t want to bother them with another late night call, so we used one of the towels as a mat. The next morning we called housekeeping about the safe being locked, that we needed someone to unlock it for our use. A tall gentleman in a dark gray\/black suit came to try and unlock it but it wouldn't lock again properly, aka the safe was malfunctioning. He apologized and recommended we either request for another room or to use the safe at the front desk. We called the front desk and explained the situation, the front desk gentleman said no one but a locksmith can be able to fix the safe, and the hotel had no locksmith; basically he implied that we lied about the gentleman who came to our room to attempt to fix the safe. Why would we lie about it? He then told us to use the safe at the front desk. We asked how big the safe was because we needed it for our work laptops. He said the safe was only for small items like money and jewelries, no laptops. So he said if we still wanted to switch the rooms, then come downstairs with our IDs and he would try to find another room, but he had to warn us that this hotel had a lot of rooms with a broken safe. When we came to the front desk, we asked that if the same category wasn\u2019t available, we would like an upgrade because we didn't like size and amenities of the room we were in. Maybe he thought we wanted a free upgrade so he answered right away that he had no more room to upgrade. (We did a mock booking on the website prior to that, and found the next category was still available). We said we were willing to pay extra for the upgrade, he was reluctant for a second, and then he still said no, probably to save face? First he implied that we lied about the locksmith, then he assumed we were greedy asking for a free upgrade. Wrong! He then gave us the key cards to another room, same category, to check it out before switching to that room. So we did check it out. Although the safe in that room worked and there was no yellow stain at the base of the toilet (looked cleaner), the bathtub was still clogged, the hinge on the door to the fridge area was still broken, and we would lose the round table. Since we had already unpacked everything, it wouldn't be worth it to pack and unpack again for a room that is not any better, so we decided to stay in our current room, and tried to carry our laptops with us every time we went out since we couldn't use the safe. Someone did later come and unclog the bathtub, and brought us a fridge and coffee maker per our request. It was still an art to open and close the door to the fridge to make sure it wouldn't fall on our toes. Regarding housekeeping, we didn\u2019t get our room cleaned everyday, we stayed 6 days and only got cleaned the first 3 days. Was it because we forgot to leave some tips on the 3rd day?","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

First of them, it was that I stayed at your hotel several years back and at that time it was a delightful experience. The second one is the fact that I was under the impression you were part of the Hilton Hotels, which gave me some \u201ccomfort\u201d level per say. I like the location of your hotel, but not even the location superseded the entire experience this time around. We could have stayed at the Marriott Marquis or the Grand Hyatt, or any other hotel in the area. Little I knew that the hotel it was before it is not today. Anyway, after I made the reservations, I called your reservation team to see if they could match an offer I found in the internet which it made a difference in the total amount of over $300 in the entire reservation. The person that I talked (I think her name was Jennifer) told me that there was nothing that she could do for me and told me that I could cancel my reservation and booked with the other place if I wanted to. Now, I was taken by surprise how she was so cold about, but I should have listened to her and do it.  To be honest, that it is not a customer service approach that I was not expecting, but I understood much better when I got to the hotel why they are take such an abrupt and rude approach to the customers, since most of them at the counter were like that. To be honest, the hotel was a complete chaos. I even asked her about the tower next to the hotel, called the Millennium Premier New York Times Square. She proceeded to tell me that the rooms were much smaller, with limited services, and that it was more business-like atmosphere and more simple as a hotel. Little I knew that perhaps that would have been much better than the location we stayed at. During my call, I also mentioned that this was a special weekend since it was my 18th anniversary and I choose the hotel, which usually I am not the one making the reservation or picking the hotels, this time I did. But I went by my previous experience several years past. I even sent an email with the rates I found to see if they could do anything about it and to see if they could adjust the rate; but my emails were never answered. I was going to talk to a manager over there, but there was none available all the time. Good way to deal with the issues at the hotel, by not facing them.  \n2.\tCheck In: Usually at the check in stage, you can gage and realize how your stay it is going to be, by seeing how well trained and hospitable the staff members are. The gentlemen that started our check-in was a complete character (I said \u201cstarted\u201d because we arrived early, and he told me that there was nothing he could do for us). I have to say that he was rude, as like he was doing us a favor attending us. I wish I got his name but unfortunately, he did not wear a name tag. All I can tell you is that he was wearing a grey suit and he sounded like somebody from India or Pakistan (or the countries of that area which I am able to identify since I have a large clientele in that part of the world). He had the same facial characteristics as well. I always saw him on the first window to the left at the check-in counter (hopefully that will help you to identify him). Anyway, every question I asked, it was answered like I bothered him.  It got to a point that he told me that the check in was at 4PM and not to return before then\u2026 hugh? After leaving my house at 4AM to go to the airport to take a 3-hour flight and waiting on a cab for over 1 hour in traffic, that was not what I was expecting or needed to hear, he is not by far anything remotely to be a person customer oriented. Perhaps a more amicable tone or service would have made a lot of things easier, and I wouldn\u2019t be writing this letter now. At the end of the day, we are paying for the service you supposed to provide, or not?  \n3.\tRoom and bathroom: I cannot tell you when the last time was, I stayed in a room like the one they gave us. It is very far from the pictures in the internet. Forget about the fact that we asked for a possible view of the Empire State, or a view at all. The view was horrible. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and hard as a rock and my wife has back problems. As a matter of fact, upon coming back to Miami, she had to go to a specialist for her back, compliments of that bed. The furniture was old, stained, burnt in some places and broken\u2026. BROKEN! The light fixtures worked when they wanted to work. The bathroom light fixture was not working correctly, it worked when it wanted, and it looked like a horror movie flicking as it did sometimes. The bathtub had mold on it. Wallpaper was coming out of the walls. The shower curtain was ripped. It was a nightmare really. I do not remember when the last time was, I stayed in a room like this one, perhaps never. I went downstairs to complain and get another room and they told me that they could not move us because they were completely booked. My wife and daughter realizing my frustration were supportive, but they should not have to go thru what we did. This was a special occasion and I truly feel bad about the entire room experience. The room was far below from what you advertise, and I would not recommend it to anyone, honestly.\n4.\tAir conditioner at the room: after the first night, we tried to get the A\/C going. I suffer from a condition where my body is hot most of the time, a sort of hyperthyroidism (we have the A\/C low at the house all the time where we stay). It didn\u2019t seem to work, so I went to the front lobby to talk to somebody to assist us (since they don\u2019t answer the phone when you call them). I was told by the person at the counter (a person with a beard which he was wearing Christmas decorations on it) that the A\/C is off until June at the hotel. They proceeded to tell me that the hotel system they have it can only work as a heater or the A\/C. What?? I have NEVER stayed in a hotel that this took place. What sort of hotel uses a system like that? Then the attendant proceeded to tell me to open the windows that the cool breeze should take care of the air circulation\u2026 hugh? And that it should be better the following night since it was going to be colder outside. Now, do you think I paid the amount I paid to stay at this hotel for somebody to tell me to open a window and be sweating in the room? Is this for real? What hotel has a system so backwards like this one? In what century are we?  \n5.\tElevator: There are many elevators at the hotel, and they work divided by top and bottom of the tower. Since we were staying at the 37th floor, we had to use the elevators going to the top floors. I remember we had like 5 or 6 assigned to our part of the tower, which seemed to be great! On the second day of our stayed, in the morning; no elevator will come to the 37th floor. We waited for over 35 minutes (yes 35 minutes) and there was only one coming, fully packed the 3 times it opened in our floor. The day of the incident, we had a reservation; therefore, after waiting for so long, my wife said to take the stairs\u2026. from the 37th floor??\u2026. crazy idea since she and my daughter were wearing boots, with heels. But out of frustration and her insistence we did since we could not be late to the reservation we had. Once we reached the \u201clobby\u201d floor (but not at the lobby yet), there were some people waiting there as well since there was no signs to tell us how to get to the lobby of the hotel. After a while of opening doors, an employee looked at us weird and directed us to the lobby. Little I have to say about how infuriated I was at that point. 37 floors down and my wife and daughter wearing boots and exhausted (nevertheless to say sweating). That was not going to end up well and it did not for them (they had cramps in the legs, were not feeling well).  But when I went to the front desk after the incident, unfortunately the same gentleman of the time we did check-in was there. When I told him about the fact that we waited for 35 minutes and needed to take the stairs down, in a very daring, uncaring voice he said; \u201cwell everybody is doing that\u201d\u2026. I am sorry, but what?? . I told him that not all the elevators were working, and he started arguing with me (obviously he is not the one going down the stairs). He picked up the phone on a very daring way and call somebody who told him something that he did not want to repeat (but his face said it all) and looked very cynically to me and said that they were all working\u2026 not going to tell you what I was thinking at that point; but I was not happy. Then he proceeded to tell me if there was something else that I wanted to say, I should talk to the manager; which I immediately requested; however, he said that the manager was on a meeting, without even checking. Now it seems very off to me that you offer me to talk to a manager, when I cannot!\n6.\tManager at the hotel: after all the issues we had, and even telling the front desk about them; we didn\u2019t even get to talk to a manager, not even a call. I even went down to ask for the \u201cghost\u201d manager on 3 occasions. Every time the manager was not available, neither got a call back, or a message, nothing! This is how the hotel treats their guests? My reviews are not going to be kind, but I will give you the chance to make this entire situation right. I did not pay over $1300 for 4 days for this!\n7.\tRestaurant: you advertise that you have a restaurant (Bugis Street Brasserie and Bar), but you don\u2019t advertise that it is not open; as a matter of fact, you don\u2019t even mention it when you arrive at the hotel. You should mention to the future guests that it is not the case and that you are not able to provide breakfast at that location either. Curious enough, the person that I talked to at the reservation line told me that the Millennium Tower did in fact provided a continental breakfast to their guests. How is that possible? A cheaper hotel doing that? Your reservation staff discourages people like me to go to the other hotel, praising this one is a much better place; but you don\u2019t even provide breakfast, or make it available for purchase for the guests\u2026. And your rates are much higher\u2026 what is the reason?  \n8.\tHilton Hotels: you advertise that you are part of or are an affiliated hotel to the Hilton Hotels and you are not. As a Hilton member, I called them, and they were not able to link your hotel with their chain. The only thing I could think of was the fact that Mr. Clarence Tan held or hold a Senior Vice President Development position with the Hilton Worldwide organization and somehow that transpired (incorrectly) to your hotel, since he is part of your Board of Directors. However, as per Hilton itself, they have no records of having this hotel as a member of their organization. Perhaps there is a mistake on their part, or it is being advertised incorrectly by your organization (false advertising?). I guess my question to you is if you are, or not an affiliated member of the Hilton family of hotels. And if in fact you are not, why is it being advertised as being one?   \n9.\tWi-Fi: Is there really wi-fi at the hotel rooms? Because if there is, it was definitively not working on the room. Only at the lobby. It would be good if you don\u2019t advertise wi-fi if you really only have it at the lobby of the hotel.  \n10.\tHotel rating: Your rating as a 4 star hotel should be reviewed since after reading several articles for the classification, I don\u2019t feel that this hotel qualifies for the rating for all the reasons I mentioned for starters. This hotel does not deserve that rating\u2026. they are far from it. I read in an article about the classification of hotels, and they said the following about 4-star hotels: \u201c4 star hotels will have more room options than 3 star hotels since they also offer suites. All rooms and public areas will have Wi-Fi or another internet connection. They will also have superior bedding, linen, and extensive amenities and have 24-hour room service. The staff will provide an excellent service and have careful attention to detail. Comfort and convenience of the guests are the main concerns of the guest.\u201d Also, they offered the following chart:\n \n\nAfter looking at this in detail, I am not quite sure how our hotels qualify as a 4 star hotel. If you could let me know, for sure I will take the time to try to understand it. But you do not have wi-fi in all areas of the hotel, or room service, or superior linens, or bar or spa or 24-hour room service\u2026 or well, A\/C or working elevators. \n\nOn one of my \u201cvisits\u201d to the front desk, I was looking into cancelling the reservation and I was told that I would be penalized with an additional night to do so. At that point and considering that I was leaving early the last day, I desisted to cancel the reservation and decided to stay. I want to thank you for making our 18th anniversary memories and unforgettable one. It was by far, probably one of the worst experiences I had in a hotel in a very long time, perhaps since I was in college, and I am already 52 years old. \n\nSo, after all what I wrote I ask your organization to make this right and fix this situation and provide us with the experience we should have gotten for the amount we paid. Please read my letter in detail. This is not something that it was an oversight. This is a way the hotel is being run. I picked this hotel for my family and to celebrate this special occasion and regret every day I did. Please consider all that and make this situation right. \n\nThank you for your time and consideration on this matter. Hope to hear from you soon with a positive outcome.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

After removing the blanket to dig inside the bed, I found this bug inside. I searched for the phone to inform reception and housekeeping. I kept searching for the phone and thought I was too tired and could not see the phone in my room. I disregard what happened and killed the bug as I was too tired. After four hours of sleep, I came down to the reception to highlight that I do not have the phone installed in my room. The staff told me that the phone was ringing and better to check it again. I told them about the bug I found inside the bed and informed me that next time inform them immediately to take action on the incident immediately. I went back to the room and took photos\/ videos of the room to prove to the hotel staff that there was no phone installed. Apparently, when I came down to show the proof, hotel staff seemed to be unhelpful and informed me that someone would come to install the phone. I waited for three hours and nobody came. I got upset and went to sleep. Next day, hotel staff came early in the morning banging my door to check on me for my wake- up call as I was not answering the call. I informed him that staff last night was very unhelpful since nobody assisted me on my concerns. Worst experience as a first timer in this hotel. I did not expect this experience from a four star hotel. First, cleanliness was poor specially this time of pandemic. How can I assure that hygiene is maintained during Covid time. Second, staff was very unhelpful. If you cannot solve the problem, at least, say the truth that you cannot fix the problem. Third, no phone was installed in the room. How impossible is that?? Staff looked like I was lying or making some joke about the phone. Nobody assisted me when I told them that no phone was installed. No service recovery was done. If guests liked this hotel, not for me. I had a very inconvenient stay in this hotel. Never going back.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

But we will give it a try. \n\nWe arrived at the hotel and after already having to wait a bit we were helped by a staff member. We got room number 4616. After having travelled about 20 hours from Europe to the US we were absolutely ready to take a shower and a nap. We came to the room, opened the door and the whole room was a mess. It was not cleaned yet. Disappointed we walked down to ask for a cleaned room and not a used room, and they understood the problem and we got a new room. Not only is this very unsatisfactory but also unsafe because of Covid contaminations. We got a new room, and that is where the real problems arose. The room was on a constant temperature of 85F and all we could do was sweat through the night without using blankets. We filed a complaint and they told us the problem was going to be fixed with the airconditioning not working. Nobody ever came. Then at night when my girlfriend wanted to take a shower, the door from the badroom could not open anymore. I was outside to get some groceries and she completely panicked as she couldn\u2019t open the bathroom door anymore. What if a fire broke out? We wouldn\u2019t want to think about these consequences! Then after having another night in our sauna-room we went out completely tired to try to enjoy the day outside. When we came back, the room wasn\u2019t cleaned, the door wasn\u2019t fixed and the airconditioning wasn\u2019t fixed either and the new problem arrived. The whole room smelled like marihuana! We are no smokers and the smell was so strong we could almost get high from it. Imagine having kids? Other problems were leakage in the bathroom, and a sink that was constantly dripping throughout the night.  \n\nHaving problems with the room is one thing, not having staff solving issues is another thing.

Almost shabby, and not \"shabby chic.\" Chipped and scratched furniture throughout, a tub I wouldn't set foot in because it was so stained and badly in need of reglazing...and there were two little silverfish having the time of their lives in the bathroom. So much for all that \"COVID\" cleanliness. The customer service leaves a lot to be desired as well. They put me in a bad cab that apparently works with the hotel.

Save your money and choose more wisely than I did.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

How the hotel over booked and I already paid - is beyond me. We walked into the room- at the Manhattans\u2014\u2014it was completely dirty. So dirty, there was even a ladder in the tub and spots on the wall. I have pictures for proof. We booked through Priceline and they did nothing. We did not want to stay at this hotel. We paid for a 4 star and this other hotel was closer to a one star. We were pretty much in the cold streets of NYC, freezing, wondering if our issue would be resolved by Priceline and\/or the hotel from 7:30pm-4AM with our luggage because we were told numerous times that someone would follow up!!!!! They never called me. I continued to follow up. I never needed to use Priceline Customer service until now and I have been booking with them since 2005 but when I did need them I was given absolutely no assistance, I was even hung up on. Since Priceline was NO assistance-I relied again on the hotel. A manager at the Millennium Hotel- Rachel, was there. She eventually got us a single bed that \u201cmagically\u201d was in a way nicer hotel than the previous one offered. The room was tiny but tolerable. We were soooo tired and stressed out but hey- we finally got the room at 4am the next day!! Although we got a single bed, we needed a double bed, so I had to sleep on a rollaway bed. Since Rachel got us the room, she saw our stress she told me repeatedly I would receive a refund for a night\u2019s stay. I still have not received it. Every time I called and spoke with Rachel, I was given the run around and never called back. It was a nightmare of an experience and I truly will never come back to this hotel. I will post a negative review on every outlet to let people know this is how they treat people. Absolutely No thanks to Priceline. And a partial thanks to Millennium-Im completely disappointed in the whole experience. My friend and I are from VA and this is how we were treated.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We were checked into our room and realized that the thermostat was not working. On calling maintenance, it turned out the room was missing the whole air conditioning unit and nobody knew! The front desk guy was helpful and referred the matter to the Manager. The Manager took a little while and when he finally came around, we were presented with only 2 options - take a similar room in the older, more run down, lower class Broadway hotel or cancel - at 5.00 p.m. in NY with no other hotel booked. It seemed like we did not have an option. To his credit, we were upgraded to a Suite but the condition of the hotel as a whole and the Suite made it feel like a downgrade. I am not sure how many stars this hotel claims to have but 2 would be generous. The living room had 1 half of the day curtain completely missing. The dark curtains had holes in them. The curtains in the bedroom had holes in them. The cushions of the sofa were so old that if you sat on them, you felt the base of the sofa and the cushions never sprung back up after one stood up. The jacuzzi did not work. The shower in the bathtub did not work. We were left with only the small shower stall. The throw cushions looked like they had been around since 1970 and we weren't sure if they had ever been washed. The carpets were dirty. Light fixtures were missing bulbs. It was a complete rubbish room passed off as a suite. Housekeeping was random. Some days we would get 2 bottles of water, some days 1 and some days, none. Replenishing of towels and floor mats was also a daily surprise with no consistency at all. The corridors of the hotel were dark and dreary with peeling paint on the doors. I was reminded of the Shining and had to actually ask the bell boy if the floor was haunted or even let out to anyone else. All in all, it was a horrible experience. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Perhaps a Motel 6 would be better.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The bedding left something to be desired.....flat pillows and an old \"quilt\" that looked more like a mattress pad.

Take this with a grain of salt.\n\nThe check in process was smooth. I booked directly through the hotel's website. Upon arrival I asked the front desk clerk for a room above 40th and I was given a room on the 50th floor. The view from my room was amazing. The room itself is simple and outdated. There aren't any perks or razzle dazzle, but of course I knew I would be getting what I paid for. The material of the wallpaper is starting to show signs of aging thus making it look like there's spiderwebs when there's not. I imagine there's a simple enough fix for that. There were some rips on the sheets and a hair on the blanket, but I just called and I asked for another set. I laid the new set on the bed. I wouldn't take a bath in the tub though. Be warned that the tub takes a while to drain initially, but after like 10 minutes or so it'll drain just fine.\n\nIf you are looking for 5 star views in a 3 star room, this is it. Book this place.

Read this story! \n\nNew York City\u2026always an adventure.\nFirst let me say we have stayed at this hotel many times a LOVE it. The location is perfect for our needs, and the  staff throughout the building is incredibly friendly and attentive. \nWe always feel the Millennium Hotel staff treat us like family. Truly!!\n\nDuring our July visit, we were in a beautiful suite on the 50th floor. We had 2 appointments to meet with clients there one morning. However, at about 5 am that morning, we heard what sounded like tapping  on our windows.  Impossible right?  Who could be tapping on a 50th floor window?\n\nA seagull could.  \n\nOutside of our windows is a shallow deck, then AC units.  So it\u2019s basically a runway with a wall on both sides \u2026 50\u2019 by 3\u2019 wide\n\nA seagull flew down into this area and got trapped.  He couldn\u2019t fly out because his wing span was too wide and kept hitting our windows. Thus the window knocking at about 5 am.  \n\nWe listened and watched as this poor gull paced back and forth, unable to make flight from that small area. Finally, \n\nThe windows in this hotel are low to the floor and only open about 6 inches outward. We couldn\u2019t climb out to help this pacing bird in distress. \nIt was KILLING us that we couldn\u2019t help. I was able to put a cup of water out for him\u2026but that was all we could do.\nDuring this time, I took a video of the frantic gull pacing back and forth and some still shots. \n\nFinally, at 8AM, I went down to the lobby and explained this dilemma to the security guards at the desk, while showing the video and photos I had taken. \n\nThey contacted the Millennium Hotel maintenance team and within a half hour, three wonderful maintenance men joined us and crafted a plan on how to free (our now) friend\u2026who we named Johnathan) aka \u2018Livingston Seagull\u2019\nThey decided do get a piece of wood and slip it out the window creating a ramp up and out of the space to the ledge, where hopefully our Johnathan would take flight.\nAnd it worked! He\u2019s FREE!!\nThanks again to all the Millenium staff who answered the call to help.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I booked this room using a virtual credit card like I always do to keep my personal card info separate.

(I'm still confused by that) He also told me the deposit was $100 per day. (Not what I had been told just the previous day) I politely asked to speak with the manager and it got worse. This lady began to tell me that none of the hotels in the area accept virtual cards and I was out of luck.  She then said they could do a credit card authorization form. I agreed however she took 3 steps and turned back and said \"on second thought\" they couldn't do that neither. I asked her specifically what I was suppose to do with my family.  Her response....\"That's not my problem\".  Luckily I was able to get online and found the Westin Hotel in Times Square, which did accept virtual cards by the way, and allowed me to book, did not charge a \"resort fee\" and the location was better.

Apparently, the hotel was closed. With the Lincoln tunnel quickly approaching I grabbed my phone and opened google maps to find another hotel, the Millennium Hotel was my first choice due to its location. \n\nWhile on the phone with reservations I explained to her that we needed room to accommodate 3 people with 1 in a wheelchair. I wanted to book a room with 2 queen beds for the 3 of us. She said they couldn't guarantee the room would be accessible but we could get 2 rooms with king beds or a suite with 1 king bed and a couch. 2 rooms were out of the question so we reluctantly booked the suite on the 51st floor. \n\nPros:\nLOCATION!\nThis hotel is located steps from Times Square and 15 - 20 minutes walking distance from Rockefeller Center, The Empire State Building, and The Edge all the places we wanted to visit. The hotel lobby was very clean and the staff was very nice. Our bed was very comfortable even though 3 people had to sleep in it. The suite was big enough that our daughter could navigate in the room. The views from the 51st floor looking down on the city below were nice. We could see Times Square where the ball drops. We heard no noise from our neighbors. The linens were clean. Discounted parking was offered. Bottled water left in the room daily.\n\nCon's:\nThey wouldn't let us get a room with 2 queen-size beds because our daughter was in a wheelchair. The toilets were far too low for an average person. Occasional sirens sounds from streets below. The mini-fridge is super small. The second bathroom could use a shelf to hold toiletries. Bathrooms not wheelchair accessible however this didn't matter to us since we transfer our daughter from her wheelchair to bed or toilet. The cost of our stay was a bit more than what we had budgeted for so we only stayed 2 nights.\n\nAll in all, we had a pleasant stay and would stay here again. Thank you Millennium for making our stay memorable.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

We've always had a great stay here. Knowing this, I booked an overnight stay w\/ my family 2 nights ago. It is listed on Expedia as a 4-star hotel and was still called Millenium Premier a Hilton Hotel on their website. As soon as I paid, I received a confirmation email that stated \"We are no longer owned by Hilton, but we strive to their same standards of service.\" This couldn't be more of a case of false advertising if they tried. We checked in around 7 pm and went up to our room. I could NOT believe how gross the room was (pictures provided below). 4-star hotels are supposed to have nicer than usual furnishing. The dresser and nightstand looked like someone found it in the trash. The door was falling off the dresser, and they removed the mini fridge from all rooms. I had bought milk for my son, and had to keep getting ice so it didn't go bad overnight. Not one plastic cup to use, or any glasses that hotels usually have. The carpet was so filthy I wouldn't let my children walk around w\/out their shoes on. There were no wash cloths provided in the bathrooms. The A\/C didn't work well at all. The mold & mildew in the shower was out of control. The faucet in bathroom sink moved every time you turned it on. We wanted to check our bags in the morning and were told they don't provide that service. I have never had this happen at any hotel I've stayed in in NYC. I would NEVER stay here again and advise anyone looking for comfort, cleanliness at a 4-star hotel to look elsewhere. I also complained about the situation and was told they would address my concerns. I never heard from anyone about my complaints.","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

This hotel shouldn\u2019t even be considered apart of the Hilton brand honestly, and was by far my worst Hilton experience ever. Traveling with my kids, I was greeted with a pungent odor of marijuana throughout the hotel, especially on our floor and surrounds rooms. The smell was so loud that it gave my kids a headache and I was honestly afraid we would get second hand high. Throughout our stay, it seemed as though the walls were paper thin as we couldn\u2019t sleep due to yelling and screaming from neighboring guest in their rooms or hallways. When that wasn\u2019t keeping us up the loud vents would take over making it difficult to sleep. The interior was extremely outdated but the bathroom drain was coming out and looked molded and gross. No hairdryer and lack of basic amenities that took over an hour to finally get delivered to the room, after calling 4 or more times. We also would have to wait 10 minutes or longer in the mornings to get down from our rooms as the elevator seemed to be working on 2 functioning elevators which with covid was a problem since it was encouraged to limit the amount of people in an elevator at a time.

I was with high hopes that the hotel would be very high end due to the cost of the rooms.

(Some what okay)  \nCons: \n- The rooms are furnished with old furniture that are a bit run down. \n- Some lamps did not work and very little outlets were available. \n- The washroom was clean but the air vents were full of dust and not wiped down. \n- No extra toilet rolls were offered or water were left daily in the room. ( two water bottles are given daily, however you need to go get them at the gift store. They are just regular nestle water bottles) \n- Over all the rooms were fair but still could be more new and functional as advertised in their photos.\n\nThe review is lengthy but I wanted to kinda share over all the hotel was not super bad or super good. It was a 3\/5 with some room for improvement. It\u2019s NY and you get what you pay for.

The room was nothing like the pictures, the beds were hard as a rock, and on top of it all, the were dirty and definitely not cleaned.

Erhald Sula (the overnight manager) wouldnt even give me his name or card, the NYPD officer present was the one who had to enforce Erhald to give me his info, the officers also couldnt believe what was going on and suggested I contact the Better Business Bureau, so that should give you an idea of the crap show theyre running at Millennium Times Square New York (not to be confused with the Millennium Premier hotel) Its a shame because its a beautiful hotel with a great location..

Anyway, when we arrived to check in as I waited in line 4 guests came downstairs to complain about complications with their rooms. I was immediately concerned. \"low water pressure, brown water coming from the sink, no heat\/ac, dirty sheets\". One guest even demanded a refund and left a few minutes after checking in because her thermistat didn't work and they wouldn't send maintence to help her or answer her calls at the front desk. Upon checking in the lady at the front desk informed me that although I booked and paid in advance for a Queen suite they were all sold out of those rooms and proceeded to change my reservation to a double bed suite.. whatever at this point I'm already here so I accepted it. I get up to the room the windows have smeared hand marks allover them, the remote for the tv had dried sauce or food stuck to it, the shower had hair leftover from the previous guest, the water pressure was very low and the drain stopper was broken and coming out from the tub, I was very skeeved out, plus.. we're in a pandemic, things should have been spotless. Luckily the bed was comfortable and the tv had netflix. When we were getting ready to go check out on Sunday we waited 30 minutes, possibly longer for an elevator. We were on the 29th floor. There were signs on the wall that stated only 2 people per elevator due to covid. Each elevator that did come had at least 6 people in it. Not worth the money, if you pay for parking with the hotel you're better off parking on the street or paying a parking garage directly. The hotel gives you one parking voucher, if you decide to take your car out at any point you then have to pay full price to re park, they also send you to a parking garage 4 blocks away.

The window had numerous forehead prints on the window in different sizes and height, which can only mean that the room was not thoroughly cleaned and must have been overlooked numerous times. \nThe smell of marijuana in our room was overwhelming, even with the attempt to  mask the smell with some sort of odor eliminator. \nOur room had no hot water 2 days in a row after 11:00am. I also had a friend in a different room on the 31st floor who said the same. \nOur room was very dated. I\u2019m really surprised that Hilton put their name on this property without renovating beforehand. The carpet was so old and dirty that it looked sticky. The mattress feels like something purchased at a Walmart. SMH \nThe room did not have blankets nor comforter at all. I called the front desk for a blanket and it was impossible to reach anyone. The front desk and concierge lines were not being answered. I tried reaching the front desk for about 20 minutes before calling from an outside line (my cellphone) and asking for reservations in order to contact the front desk which was answered by a female staff member at 11:30pm on 2\/12\/2021. I then asked for a blanket and she assured me that it will be right up. That did not happen. I waited 1 hour and 8 minutes before I called on the in-house line for the manager. He apologized and said he would send the blankets up immediately. Not even 10 minutes later the blankets arrived. I want to thank this manager. We appreciate him. Thank you, sir. We also overheard numerous other guests say they could not reach the front desk. This was also the center of our conversation at dinner with our friends from the 31st floor who also had issues calling the front desk for assistance. \nSecurity was a major concern to us. I wear a Rolex and my wife wears expensive jewelry which is clearly visible. There were no security measures in place to make sure only guests were entering the hotel. Not once did security stop anyone or ask to show any proof of their stay. This is amazing to me. I could not believe that this was happening. Yes there was security by the elevator in a booth, but not once did they ask anyone for proof. Your video surveillance system will attest to that. We stay in many hotels and resorts across the globe and here in the United States that you have to show your key or use it in order to operate the elevator. \nOverall this place was definitely not worth the inconvenience which we endured or the security concerns which did not make us feel comfortable. I had a large amount of cash on me and did not even feel safe to put money in the safe. That\u2019s how seedy this place was. Please do not offer us anything to come back to this hotel.

I booked my reservation online through priceline approximately 20 mins prior to getting to the hotel. The lady asked to see a photo ID, so I showed her my driver\u2019s licenses and then i pulled down my mask so she could match my face to my ID. She immediately told me to pull my mask back up (raising her voice as she said it). The rude *ss lady informed me that she could not see my reservation yet; that it takes approximately 30 mins for it to show up in their system. Now keep in mind, i booked approximately 20 mins prior to going inside the hotel. She told me that i would have to come back later to check in. So, i politely asked her if she could point me in the direction to where the restrooms are, and she did. She gave me a card key to access the restroom on the main floor. I went back to the front desk to return the key card and a different lady ( the pregnant one) was standing up there, so i handed her the key card. As i was fixing to walk away i heard my phone getting an email. As i opened up the email, it was from priceline letting me know that my room was booked with my conformation number provided. So, i turned around and the nice lady was still there, so i asked her if she would check once again. She did, and informed me that my reservation still hasn\u2019t come through yet. As she was telling me that, the rude *ss lady walk up behind her and immediately said: \u201cIs that the same one that i was looking up?\u201d, and i told her that i had just received an email stating that my room had been booked. She immediately began yelling at me, stating that she had already told me that it would take approximately 30 mins before it would transfer into our system! The nice lady stepped back as the rude lady was yelling at me (at customer), and i told the rude lady she didn\u2019t have to be rude, and i walked away. I came back approximately 40 mins later and this time i got a male to help me and he informed me that the reservation still hadn\u2019t come through yet, but that give him a min and he would fix it.

The  lobby was pretty a little dark with all the black marble floors. We were lucky enough to get a conner room on the 44th floor with amazing views of the city. Sadly the room was dated and the bathroom seemed old. The mattress was great and comfy but I noticed the bed sheets were all ripped up at the Conners and when I checked closer I noticed the mattress had no zipper protective cover. That kinda shocked me. Being a native New yorker knowing the issues here in the city I was really surprised. The blanket and pillows also seemed in bad shape and after two days nobody from housekeeping ever showed up to clean the room so I cleaned the room myself. The bathroom only had two towels it was okay but I think for the price they shouldn\u2019t have torn bed sheets on the beds.

Whoever they hired to Photoshop those photos must be a magician. \nBEFORE YOU BOOK, know there are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms. \nNo coffee makers. No cups!! \nOkay, continuing: I walked in, just one employee at the counter and a long line, so there was a wait. No refreshments anywhere. No carts to help transport your luggage to your room. I get to the room, it\u2019s hot as hell, the thermostat needed new batteries. New batteries didn\u2019t help the temperature, but worsened it?? How, right? It was blowing HOT AIR after new batteries were installed! Thankfully, I was moved to a different room, though sadly, still hot as hell. Since I was ready to explore Times Square by then, I had to just suck it up and sleep in underwear with my friend in the same room (awkward) for the 3 nights I was there, in the hard ass beds. \nThe hall ways were stained and smelled strongly of smoke, cigs and marijuana. I could hear my neighbors clearly having sex. I could hear the skin slapping, so the walls are nonexistent. \nI was highly embarrassed when my friend asked, \u201care you sure this is 4 star? I want to stay at a 2 star and see the difference,\u201d since it was me who picked out the hotel. Everything was falling apart in our room. Missing handles from the drawers, broken class closets, phones from 1990, which were dirty. Trash in the ice room. Stains on the floor in our room. Garbage from the previous occupants in our room. No vending machines that I could locate. So bring water with you!!! \nIn summation, this hotel needs a SERIOUS face lift! However, it was ridiculously close to Times Square, so if loud and rambunctious young adults and crack heads prowling all night by your window is what you\u2019re looking for, you\u2019re in luck!

Despite that review, I was hoping that the hotel remedied this issue considering the fact that they were still letting people book Times Square View rooms.  Once I got there, I was given a Ball Drop View room, which, okay, technically has a piece of Times Square in view (specifically the ball) and would be pretty cool...on New Year\u2019s Eve. It just wasn\u2019t what I booked, and the fact that I was given a different type of room with no notification upon check in was what bothered me the most. When my boyfriend inquired about the situation at the lobby, the receptionist got defensive and said the room had a nice view so we shouldn\u2019t be complaining, and my boyfriend reiterated that, sure, it may have been nice, but it literally wasn\u2019t what I had paid for. The manager then came in and told him that the Times Square View rooms weren\u2019t sanitized. All I wonder is..why? If someone books a room a couple weeks in advance, shouldn\u2019t that be enough notice to have one of those rooms prepared? And if not, shouldn\u2019t you do the courtesy of letting them at least know you couldn\u2019t fulfill your promise? It just feels like bad customer service and like we were the ones in the wrong.\nOverall, the hotel was pretty nice: they do have a coffee\/tea maker in the room, the bathrooms were nice (they have a separate tub and shower!), the thermostat worked and was adjustable, and the robes and slippers were certainly a nice touch. So I guess the takeaway is...come to this hotel if you don\u2019t care what view you\u2019re gonna get!","travelDate":"2020-08","tripType":"NONE"}

They normally offer both savings and amenities most brands do, or are comparable. This usually includes free WIFI, coffee maker, refrigerator and sometimes either lounge access, complimentary breakfast or both if the property permits. \n\n After looking online for a good location and available dates I booked the Times Square Millennium Hotel on W 44th Street in NYC as it looked nice enough in the pictures and the location was great, literally around the corner from Times Square. Hopefully they paid the photographer well as pictures can be very deceiving (the room was where pictures are most deceiving but we\u2019ll get to that a bit later)\n\n The lobby was nice and clean, and check-in was quick and easy. The person at the front desk upgraded me to a room with a better view and I was very happy with the hotel and looked\nforward to seeing my room. But once I got to the room, it took all of 2 steps to see the severely damaged furniture and tables with jagged laminate and moulding. Both reading lamps on the headboards were hanging off, the empty cabinet where the refrigerator and the coffee maker were taken out of the room. In the bathroom black mold was visible in the light fixture and vent above the sink. After I called the front desk and was transferred to housekeeping I was told the refrigerator was something that was in limited supply and I would be put on a waiting list to get one. The same was true for a coffee maker. When I asked to speak with a manager about the mold, furniture and electric, I was told he would be in tomorrow and there was nothing that could be done. \n\n The next morning when I went down to the front desk I met the hotel manager and explained what condition my room was in. I asked him to go view the room but he declined and told that my room would be changed later in the day and that I would be notified when it would happen. It appears I waited for nothing, as I never received a call or at a minimum a serviceman to fix the electric that was hanging off the headboard. \n\nEventually when I did check-out, I spoke with a different manager and was told the hotel was due to be renovated in 6 months and there was nothing to be done. That although they were part of the Hilton chain, they weren\u2019t owned and therefore not subject to Hilton policies. My guess this is to include a bathroom free of mold, furniture you won\u2019t have to worry about getting stitches, electrical lights that aren\u2019t coming off the wall and appliances that are in short supply. But I have to say the biggest disappointments as the indifference by the staff. At no time did anyone come to even look at the problem let alone come to solve it. There are other hotels in the area that offer better deals for less money. ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It didn't include anything other that what should be included anyway, like Wi-Fi and the fitness center. It did not include breakfast. I showed them my booking through my corporate travel site which did not disclose this fee. They reluctantly removed it. Please don't add on these junk fees!

Generic food and a staff with an attitude. The restaurant was 80% empty and they would not let me sit near the window as it was a \"4 top.\" It was still almost empty at 8AM when I left! The good news is that the front desk was very good, the location is quiet even though it is near Times Square, and the rooms are a good size.

There was nothing like walking out of the hotel and being immersed in the essence of New York City. We were literally steps from Times Square, from Broadway, from an endless list of shops and restaurants - location was perfect. We splurged for a Times Square view and weren't disappointed. We were high enough (36th floor) that the noise and traffic from the street weren't too bad as well.

The rooms are tired and not that clean. There is grime on every corner and I won\u2019t go barefoot on the carpet. However, the linens are all clean. There is a serious lack of modern amenities for plugs or USB ports for charging. We have an extension cord on the night stand that provides the only visible usable plugs. \n\nFor the price, I\u2019ve stayed in better and in worse. I\u2019m giving this an average at best review. The location is terrific. Staff is great, but serious renovations are needed to freshen up the rooms. ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}
