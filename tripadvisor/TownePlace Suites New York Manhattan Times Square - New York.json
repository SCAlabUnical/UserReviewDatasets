The room I had faced the back so only other properties, which made it VERY quiet. Not sure how it would have been in the front, but this street does seem quieter than most overnight. But all streets have trash pickup on some days which is super noisy and very early. I didn't partake in the breakfast so cannot rate that.  Front desk staff - all three I interacted with over 26 hours, were super kind and helpful. I'm a titanium member for reference on hotel experience. Shower pressure not great but acceptable. Smartly designed bathroom with sliding door to not take up too much space. Oh, and no real desk in the bedroom, but there is a small table you can move to sit in front of the mini-sofa and use like a desk. A little more space is dedicated to the kitchenette than I would have preferred, but someone actually cooking might have appreciated that. \n\nTo my comment in the title, the elevator is one of the slowest I've experienced.

I had trouble with my booking through the app and had to call the hotel directly to make a reservation.

Mixed review. I found the room to be very comfortable and quiet, and the hotel is in a great location very close to Times Square but quieter than any hotel I've ever stayed at in the area. The service was not great, though. I felt like the front desk yelled at me when I arrived because I didn't know the entrance was locked - I didn't have a key yet, since I hadn't checked in before it was locked. A little later in the evening, I noticed the door to the pantry in the lobby was open, so I went to grab an apple. While I was waiting for a friend in the lobby eating the apple, someone from the front desk came over and yelled about the pantry doors being open, telling the other person at the desk how the pantry should be closed. I felt really embarrassed to be eating the apple because there were other people in the lobby - I just didn't know the pantry was off limits because the pantry doors were open when I waiting for my friend. Also, I bought a 5000 bonus points package and the points were never credited to my account. When I called the hotel, they had no ability to add the points and redirected me to Bonvoy's Titanium line. When I called Bonvoy, they seemed confused about why the hotel couldn't add the points, saying it's the hotel's responsibility.

Very convenient location, a block or less to a subway station. The front desk staff (Daniel) was outstanding. He made us feel very welcome. The rooms include a kitchen, but, as is typical of New York hotels, the room was fairly small overall. The room was very clean & housekeeping kept it that way. Breakfast was fine, pretty much the typical type of thing that you find at Townplace Suites. The workout room was pretty minimal & had no spin-type workout bike, so I didn't use it. One thing that we were happy to take advantage of was that the front desk had umbrellas to loan out. It poured rain while we were there, so it was great to be able to borrow an umbrella! They must have quite a few, as there were several of us asking to borrow & we all got one. In addition to being close to the subway, this location was within a mile of a Whole Foods, Target, the Barclay Center, the Brooklyn Museum & gardens, as well as lots of places to eat.

I find it unprofessional and disrespectful to rent an expensive King size room with such creeping problem. It ruined a part of our stay, because after a busy day in the city, we didn't look forward to coming back to our roomnor could properly rest. And we stayed 5 nights. One expects much more from a Marriott hotel, and it is an enormous disappointment with the brand. Management violated all principles of proper hospitality when, despite the horrible circumstances of the rooms close to the elevators, they decided to ignore the well-being of guests and rent those rooms regardless of the utter and absolute discomfort the cracking noise brings to guests.

When you booked, they will send you a warm welcome email detailing the breakdown of charges for each day. However, they will ignore all that and blatantly overcharge you. The frontline staff are trained to lie and tell you that they will refund the difference in a few days. But they will ignore all your emails you send to ask about it.

Breakfast buffet every morning, and cold water and coffee and tea were always available. Robert at the front desk had the room decorated for my birthday. I was able to walk about 10 minutes to Whole Foods to stock up on food supplies, and I ended up making-and-taking most meals. Gym downstairs is well-lit and open around the clock.

Room size was perfect in terms of USA sized rooms and staff friendly. Only 1 big negative- lifts are a nightmare. Plan extra time whenever you need to go somewhere. I do question if they switched off 1 lift for cleaners and staff, would it move quicker for guests. Too many cleaners jumping in lifts stopping at each floor whilst guests are inside it. Not good as you get a lot of guests annoyed by it who just want to get in the lift and exit. Other than that, superb stay and would definitely recommend again.

I wasn't able to go and cancelled on 4\/29 which is well within the alloted cancelation window to not be charged. I woke up on Sat and checked my emails and there was a bill from the hotel and I was charged for the stay.  I called the hotel directly and after being placed on hold for over 10 minutes I was told that I needed to call back at 10 and speak with the mgr.  I called back at 10:10 when I was told \"she was running late\" and I'd need to call back again.  I had to leave for work so I didn't have time to do that.  I decided to call the 800 number for Marriott and have them help me.  The person I spoke with there took all my information and said he could see the cancellation in the sytem and prepared a case to send to hotel.  He told me to check back on Wed, which I did.  When I called back the person I spoke with said that the person who I originally spoke with shouldn't have taken the info as because this was a special rate I needed to deal directly with hotel.  I had to call the hotel's direct number multiple times as they had it routed to reservation line who couldn't put me directly through.  I finally after being persistent reached a woman named Marie.  I told her the problem and she said she didn't see that I had cancelled the room and that's why I was charged.  Funny that the person at Marriott was able to see it but she couldn't.  She was not a pleasant person to talk to as she condescendingly asked me if I had a cancellation email from Marriott (probably hoping I hadn't saved that.) which I had because I save evrything.  She asked me to email it to her, which I did immrediately while I was still on the phone.  I asked her how I would know it was reversed and she said she's email me.  I heard nothing all day after I spoke with her, not even confirming that she had received my email.  This morning I emailed her again (as trying to reach the hotel directly by phone is a task in itself) just asking her if she could please respond to me and confirm that she received my email and took care of this.  The whole day has passed and once again no response.  I called the Marriott 800 # back to enlist their help.  I was put on the phone with a supervisor who agreed they couldn't do anything because it was the type of rate I needed to take care of with hotel directly.  I reminded her that that is why I'm calling because they are not responding to me.  She called hotel directly for me and gave me the name of front desk person she spoke with who said he will bring it to attention of mgmnt and get it resolved, I'm hoping this happens as I have spent far too much time on trying to resolve an error on the part of the hotel.  I understand that mistakes happen but the fact that there was no effort or communications trying to resolve this has me not very happy.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

The lobby team was so friendly and helpful - from the very beginning! When we arrived it was Sunday morning so my only expectation was to have our luggage held since it was so early but we were actually able to get our room! Wow! Never had that happen before and it was so appreciated as the teen promptly fell asleep. The room was clean ( I like to wipe down surfaces on arrival). The kitchenette wasn\u2019t something we needed other than using the fridge but I could see how it\u2019d come in handy for a longer stay. Breakfast was a nice bonus and that too was even better than I expected. Each morning they had a rotation that included some sort of hot carb (French toast, waffle or pancake), some sort of meat (sausage or bacon), some sort of egg (tiny egg bites, egg circles) along with other food options like yogurt and oatmeal. Definitely came in clutch but it was best to get there on the earlier side to have the most options although the staff did refill hit items periodically. Safety wise I felt absolutely fine - they do have someone standing at the door mid afternoon onward to let people in (or you could use your card key). The neighborhood wasn\u2019t terrible either as you\u2019re still very much in a touristy area with Birdland across the street and another hotel next door.

There are Broadway shows a plenty in the surrounding area, activities, you name it.\n\nThe best thing about this hotel for me was the staff though. Robert, Andrise and Yarellyn were fantastic staff members that made us feel welcome every time we came in from our adventures! It all started with Robert who, when we arrived, was able to accommodate my multiple requests at arrival and the whole time conversated with us about what were we planning on doing in New York.

Yarellyn was also very social and really made us feel welcome towards the later nights.

Since we were out a lot, the view didn't bother us, but we were concerned about possible noise. Luckily, it was quiet maybe because we were there on Sat and Sun only.  The room was clean and modern, but the top kitchen cupboards were hung way too low, making it difficult to access the water faucet or coffee maker. Also, the rod in the wardrobe closet was installed so low that there wasn't enough height for jackets or shirts. I assume these are unique to our room as it was an accessible room but I don't know for sure.\n\nThe breakfast was adequate, not great. I'm not a big fan of pre-packaged breakfast sandwiches and such, but I enjoyed coffee and pastries. Also, the dining area was rather small and definitely didn't have enough tables to accommodate the size of the hotel.  \n\nThere were a few minor issues, but overall I liked  the TownePlace Suites. It is a clean and modern hotel conveniently located near Times Square. The room size isn't too bad for NYC and having a kitchenette is special. It's a great choice for anyone who is looking for a mid-range hotel in a great location for sightseeing.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

But the whole experience left us wishing we had booked elsewhere. We are accustomed to small hotel rooms in NYC, and for just two people it would be okay, but we got it because it was a \"suite\" with a fold out sofa bed for our 9 year old daughter. First, the fold out was awful. She managed to sleep without complaint, but there is no way an adult could bear the thin \"mattress\" that is the bed. Second, there was construction (jack hammering?) starting at 7 am and continuing until 6 pm everyday but Sunday. Third, when we flushed our toilet, it made a horrible banging sort of noise. When we informed the staff we were told that maintenance would't touch the toilet, told that by the maintenance person who was standing there. A simple \"We'll look into it\" would have sufficed, but they wanted to argue that we were wrong. We were told upon arrival that we only got housekeeping after three days, and I must say that I never once saw any housekeeping staff during the whole of our three days. So no fresh towels, trash emptying, bed making or even checking in. There were plenty of other hotels with similar prices at which we could have stayed, and we now wish we had chosen better. Not much better than a hostel, I'd say.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

The location was good. In the heart of the theater district with 2 coffee shops on the street, shake shack on the corner and a ton more restaurants on 9th street. The room is nice, no real closet and a very small(kinda useless) couch. With a kitchenette you would hope for some kind of table but any meals we prepared were eaten on the bed unfortunately. The bathroom is very nice with a lot of shelf space above the toilet and under the sink. Be prepared for an extremely slow elevator and stairs are not a option(we tried taking them down for breakfast but there\u2019s no lobby stairs entrance, goes to the outside in an emergency exit). Breakfast was a build your own bag breakfast; included oranges, a few oatmeal options, packaged croissants and muffins, yogurts and coffee. House keeping comes every 3 days and lastly no luggage holds so if you have a late flight your check out day be prepared to have your luggage with you around the city or head to the airport early. We were able to request a checkout for 1pm but of course is not guaranteed pending reservations. \n\nAirport tip: flew into Newark and the easiest\/cheapest way to get into the city was taking the Coach USA bus. You can buy a round trip ticket for $30 online or pay $18.50 cash to the bus driver and it drops off\/picks up at the Port Authority which is a few blocks away.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we got back to our room Friday night the people next-door to us were playing loud rap music and talking loudly, yelling all night long. I attempted to call the front desk multiple times and never got an answer. My husband and I were up all night. The next day he went down and spoke to the front desk person who told him that they were many complaints about those people and that they had been spoken to. We were hopeful that Saturday night would be better. We got back to our room at midnight. The same people next-door were playing loud rap music and talking\/yelling\/laughing loudly.... so loudly that we had noise canceling headphones in and it still sounded like they were having a party in our room. We waited until about 1:30 am to call the front desk. They assured us they were sending security. I\u2019m pretty sure that never happened as the noise level never changed it got worse. We called the front desk again at 2:30 and this time I believe they did send someone as I heard a knock at their door, but again the loud music and yelling went on. We finally got up at 3 am and decided to make our 6 hour drive back to Maine as it was evident we were not going to be able to sleep at all. We stayed at the hotel for two nights and were completely unable to get ANY sleep. The lack of concern shown by staff was disappointing.  Not to mention the fact that despite the no smoking signs posted throughout the hotel the entire place reeked.   When we got home I immediately emailed Marriot.  It took 5 days to get a response from the hotel and it was just a generic apology.  We don't typically complain much but did expect some type of compensation given the fact that we paid for a 2 night stay in a hotel and got zero sleep.  Not at all what we expected from a Marriot.","travelDate":"2020-09","tripType":"NONE"}

There is also room service through Butler, which we have used before and think are great, so that was definitely a plus.\n\nThe huge issue we had was that there was pet hair everywhere in the room. It wasn\u2019t something we noticed at first, but after dropping an item of black clothing on the rug, it was covered in pet hair when picked up. We then noticed  it more frequently, and even saw it on the nightstand phone. By the time we left after just two nights, we could see hair flying as we shook the blanket out. The biggest issue it raised for us was how well the room was cleaned prior to us arriving.

Especially negative ones. This is not meant to bash the property but to warn others like us who might be considering a stay here in the present conditions. The world, and New York, are changed post COVID. We understand that. This property has beautiful rooms, with an equipped kitchen, were able to kindly check us in early, and the staff seem to genuinely want to help, however I think they are not equipped or trained to handle what is happening here.\n\nMy husband and I, in our mid 30s, were traveling from out of state due to me needing abdominal surgery at Sloan Kettering for a rare cancer, and had a week stay here (had never stayed at this specific property prior). We travel to NYC every 3-4 months for appointments, and typically pay $250-300 per night, and the price now including taxes was less than $100, surely because of decreased tourism and increased vacancy. We were surprised to see the hotel full, and wondered who would be traveling? Maybe medical providers?\n\nThe bad: marijuana smell pervasive through the areas we went in the hotel, and also in our room.  We don\u2019t smoke, and the hotel claims to be smoke free. We stayed in the 6th floor. The smell was not only in the hallways, but in our room as well. We could see a haze when we opened the curtain and sunlight came in. Would usually start in the afternoon and into the night, but sometimes as early as 10 am. We had many conversations with the front desk, asking them to address it. They were certainly tired of us calling, we were also tired of having to call. They stated they couldn\u2019t do much about it, they couldn\u2019t accuse anyone of smoking. I asked if they could knock on doors, check for smell, etc. they agreed to call each room on the floor and remind them of no smoking. It actually did help that day, but started right back up the next day. The staff member told us that the fire alarm in the room should go off if they were smoking, unless they had been tampered with. Clearly likely multiple people were smoking, and the windows do open allowing for some of the smoke to go out, but the thought of rooms with kitchenettes having smoke detectors potentially disabled was disconcerting to say the least. We asked to change rooms, they said they could not as they were full. We then noticed the lobby smelled strongly as well as the first floor of marijuana. So strong. But not outside on the street. There is one HVAC unit for the hotel. \n\nThere were also times of isolated shouting and yelling at night, but I had earplugs so that didn\u2019t bother me as much. \n\nThen there were 2 parties on 2 separate nights lasting until about midnight, the worst with probably 15 or so teens or 20 somethings in one room, with loud music. I don\u2019t know for sure, but the desk alluded that may have been broken up. \n\nThere was also very loud music playing from several rooms on our floor during the daytime. \n\nThen on Saturday night the room next to us developed a shouting match between a male and female at 9 pm, and it shook me up terribly. Banging into the walls, screaming, crying. We called the front desk to report the situation and ask for security, they said they don\u2019t have security. I asked if they could call 911, and they said they would send up the houseman to verify our report first before calling. We waited about 5 minutes, all the while the screaming continued, with more bumping and slamming sounds, and the woman said probably 100 times take your hand off me, leave me alone etc. I was genuinely afraid for her safety so we called 911 ourselves, and called to tell the front desk that. The situation continued while I prayed for a safe outcome and we waited for the police. The gentleman from the front desk called to tell me the houseman confirmed our report and the couple wouldn\u2019t answer the phone or door, and they would be asked to leave after police arrived. Eventually around 930 police arrived and everything seemed to end peacefully. \n\nNow on Sunday, the marijuana smell ramped up again, and just before noon the fire alarm went off. \n\nNow, we move into the realm of conjecture. The gentleman at the front desk did tell us that their clientele has changed since the prices of the hotel dropped so significantly, resulting in new issues they have not had to deal with before. My guess is that many of their guests are using this as longer term housing due to the fact that there is a kitchenette in the room. At less than 100 per night including all fees the \u201crent\u201d for a month at this hotel would be below average rent in manahattan, and also not include steps of background check, deposit, etc. required in a typical apartment situation. The issue comes in that I don\u2019t think the staff here is capable of making the situation here any different. They seem to be understaffed, and frankly, I agree that they should not have to compromise their personal safety to uphold the usual standards of the hotel. But it is jarring to walk into this situation that feels like a flop house. \n\nWhat did we do? We had many conversations with several different front desk staff who genuinely cared and were trying to help, but were not able to bring about any resolution. We also asked for the manager\u2019s information to reach out and see if they were able to help- we were given the front desk manager\u2019s information rather than the GM (not sure if this was by design), and left a voicemail but were told she was off, so when we didn\u2019t hear back from her we were not surprised, everyone is entitled to their time off. We were not given any other recourse after many complaints. Unable to switch rooms. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t we leave? Several reasons. I had just had a 4 hour abdominal surgery. It was difficult to even walk, I was not allowed to lift. We had had $125 of groceries, water bottles, etc. delivered on the first day by amazon. I was unable to help my husband with moving all this to a new hotel, and it wAs too much for him by himself. Also, we are not sure- it may be like this everywhere in the city right now! So we kept waiting it out. \n\nI know management typically responds to these reviews- I don\u2019t want a response! We reached out many times. I don\u2019t want an apology, or a refund, or a credit, nothing. I understand times are hard and maybe they are just doing what they need to in order to stay viable. I just want to warn people- I wish someone had written a review to warn me. I also think they should hire security to assist their staff.\n\nI understand that these things do not bother everyone- is so the hotel may be a good fit. Would definitely not recommend for families with young children or older people.\n\nAll I wanted was relative quiet and for non smoking rules to be enforced, but alas.

Makes it hard to come home from a day out and shower before going to a show if no fresh towels etc! They also point out that unless staying more than 7 days, this service is a \u201crefresh\u201d - so things like beds are made but sheets not changed. However, the coffee filters were never checked and replaced - not the sugar, creamers etc. No general cleaning of bathrooms or floors done - just make the bed, swap towels and toiletries by the looks of things. On two occasions, we were in our room in the afternoon and someone from housekeeping simply scanned their card and walked in - without knocking or announcing themselves! Sure ... we could have put the do not disturb sign on the  door - except we needed to be disturbed to get room serviced ... just not so rudely! Simple solutions perhaps - have a sign to put on the door saying \u201cplease make up my room\u201d (rather than simply do not knock or pet napping versions!); get housekeeping more consistent and timely ... and knock before entering any room! They are small fixes in the big scheme of things! \n\nThe second lost dot is for breakfast. We experienced the good and the bad. There are not even close to enough sitting spaces for the guests. Maybe remove the tv cabinet and add in four more chairs? Reconsider the use of the big lounges and see if something smaller would work to allow more tables and chairs. There are no options one full - other than return to your room and eat in your bed! \n\nOn some days, there was a lady on duty who constantly cleaned tables, re-stocked supplies and ensured everything went well. These days were a pleasure and that lady is to be commended. On her days off, no-one did this until I had to go and ask them to! This was met with grunts and a general grumpiness ... but is it really too much to ask someone on staff to open the cupboard below and refill the pastries when they run out? Or top up the fruit ... or make fresh coffee as needed. \n\nSimple solution here too ... every morning we watched two or three staff members come in and help themselves to some breakfast. I have no issue with this ... good on the hotel for supporting their workers. I do have an issue when a guy takes the last beagle for himself back to reception but makes no effort to top supplies up for paying guests. When a staff member gets their food, make a rule that they check everything and top up as needed as part of this process. It\u2019s a very easy thing to do .. and would make a huge difference. \n\nI guess to sum up our experience, it gets back to first impressions last. We arrived at 8pm after almost 30 hours of travel with two flight delays. We stood outside the front doors with a back and carry-on each trying to open the doors manually whilst two guys chatted behind the reception desk. It was not until we had almost finished opening the second door that one of them made an effort to show us where the automatic door button was! We didn\u2019t expect a full bellboy service, but seeing three people struggle with luggage and taking your time to assist in showing the trick to the doors set the tone for the stay ... so much potential ... but just comes up short each time! \n\nWe would stay again ... but would warn others not to expect perfection just because you pay a high price ... it is NYC cheap ... but has it limitations too!

I'm a frequent Marriott traveler and love that they have properties like this that are good for families, especially in NYC. \n\nThe location just cannot be beat- this saved us so much money in transportation costs as we were right in the middle of everything. Even with a young child, I felt totally comfortable walking from the hotel to\/from many activities, day and night. \n\nThe rooms- okay, it's NYC. The rooms here are small. We were expecting that and it wasn't a huge deal. Three of us fit into a standard room (1 queen & 1 pullout sofa) relatively fine. It did require some side-stepping when using the bathroom in the middle of the night but it was workable given that we weren't in the room very much. \n\nEverything was CLEAN and housekeeping made sure we had everything we needed. The kitchenette was a nice touch and made it easier to store leftovers. \n\nThey contract with a company to provide room service, which was surprisingly good and VERY surprisingly affordable. Charged right to the room and fast delivery. \n\nBreakfast was great. It's more or less your standard hotel-issue breakfast, but to be available every day with hours that extend into late morning was a big bonus for our trip. In NYC, that's probably a $50\/day savings for our family of 3. Hot water seemed to run out frequently and on busy days another waffle machine would be nice, but overall very pleased. \n\nWater is available all day long so we were able to keep our refillable bottles topped off. \n\nWe were in the South tower and overall enjoyed it as there weren't many rooms on each floor so waiting for the (single) elevator) wasn't too bad. When it was bad, it was easy enough to take the stairs in this relatively short (for NYC) property. \n\nBut I need to recognize the staff- they are AWESOME. Our son got sick in the middle of the night on our first night, and the front desk staff was quick to send up new sheets\/towels\/bedding and take the old stuff away so that we could all get back to sleep. It was an adventure in an already tiny room but the team made it a lot less of a problem to have to deal with. \n\nI would have no hesitation in staying here again. It made our quick trip very enjoyable and allowed us to do a lot without spending a ton. Thank you and we will be back!","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

She helped me so much by telling me not to worry that they would take care of me.  They wouldn't charge me for the room if I wasn't able to arrive but they would have one for me if I was able to arrive in time.  There was so much in the air and Marie just helped me so much with my stress level because it was one less thing I had to worry about.\n\nUpon my arrival to the hotel, Michael provided me all the necessary information (even though it was 1:30 a.m. and I just wanted to go to sleep).  He was friendly and knew about my conversation with Marie.  He was kept up to speed about my situation and welcome my daughter and I to the hotel.\n\nThe next morning we were able to meet Marie in person and she was so friendly and down to earth.  She checked my reservation to make sure everything was correct.  I had some problems with my initial room and she quickly offered to have me change rooms.  She gave me plenty of time to switch and made sure my stay was comfortable and I was happy with everything.\n\nMy daughter and I then enjoyed breakfast and met Aminata who was also amazing.  She was so friendly, started brief conversations with us, assisted us when we needed something, etc.  She was so great and was such a friendly spirit to start our mornings off with.\n\nWe stayed a week and I would definitely consider returning to this hotel just to see these friendly faces again.\n\nAlso, the hotel is so close to Time Square - it's within walking distance.  The subway entrance is only 400 ft away and extremely convenient.  There are grocery stores (Whole Foods, Food Emporium), great restaurants, and dessert places nearby.  If you're going to see Frozen, the theater is on the same street!  Aladdin in just a couple streets over.  We're in the Theater District so it couldn't get any better and more convenient.\n\nOne thing - the rooms are TINY!  I went only with my daughter and we barely had enough space.  There isn't much closet space and no where to store your luggage.  The fridge is a mini fridge but it was sufficient.  Counter space is limited.  Ask for a room that isn't a corner room.

Mama Mia is worth a look and so is bare burger. \n\nWe had a room in the main building which faced the road. We were on the 6th floor and we could hear the road noise.

Be sure to look for the secret doors that will take you directly out to the street.  Much quicker than waiting on the slow elevator.  The two things I didn't like was the squealing in the pipes or fan (not sure which) that would come and go.  Also, where are the chairs?

Unfortunately, we found out that it has not yet been completed despite it being advertised on their website.  This may sound minor, but we could've stayed at the AC for about the same price (on this trip, including parking), which we feel is nicer hotel overall with a great rooftop lounge and restaurant.\n\nNot the fault of this Towneplace, but valet parking at the AC was less expensive than the \"self park\" garage closest to this Towneplace location.  ~$80 w\/ tips vs $134 for ~28hr (SUV) at both.  I'd suggest finding another garage, because we witnessed one driver spin the tires of a Camaro 4 different times as we waited for them to bring ours.  Just imagine what is done when people aren't standing around watching them move vehicles.. \n\nComplimentary breakfast was very basic, but similar to other Towneplace locations that I've stayed.  More pull up tables needed, and people were waiting for staff to restock certain items.  It was incredibly crowded the on the Sunday morning we ate there.  It still adds some value to the hotel.\n\nRooms are on the small side, but clean.  Material choices are generally nice, but we did have a couple problems with our room (shower doors couldn't contain all of the water, and sliding barn door fell part way off).\n\nGood location, with many food choices within two blocks.

The breakfast in the morning was basic, but was good. At night, they do have some coffee, water, and hot chocolate (which being it was cold during our stay, this was really good.)

We were not sure if this was because we were given a handicap access room or not.  So we just ended up eating our dinner on the bed.  Also, the area that can be used for hanging up your clothes was a little confusing.  There was a bar to hang things up, (obviously being a handicap access room, the bar was lower, so we understood that...however, we found that the bar was useless because the shelf below was so close to the bar that unless you were a child or a little person, the items didn't hang properly. Only other thing was that I had booked my rate way in advance.  Well our plans changed and we ended up being able to stay an additional night.  When I called the hotel I asked if they could honor the rate that I booked originally.  They said no, and that I would just be able to book the additional night at the new rate (rate was almost $100 more.)  So I waited until just before we left and saw that the rate had gone down a little bit, so I did book. I then called the hotel again and got an agent that combined my reservation so that I would not have to change rooms (that was nice).  \n\nOverall I would definitely stay here again and recommend to other friends.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Chris checked us in and was really friendly and couldn't do enough for us throughout our whole stay. The room was perfect and a nice size, this was our third trip to NYC and this was by far the best room for size and facilities. The kitchen area was really useful for making a cup of tea and snacks. The bed was comfy and the room was quiet. The TV was great being able to use your own Netflix was a good touch after a long day sightseeing and shopping. The bathroom was a nice size with a decent shower. Couldn't fault the room at all, it's all brand new and well thought out. I've stayed in the Roosevelt and the Pod previously and this far surpassed both of them on every level. Having breakfast included as well was great because I've found previously that this isn't usually the case with New York. We're not early risers, so usually went down for breakfast between 9 and 10 and found there was plenty of choice- waffles, porridge, bacon, eggs, muffins, yoghurt and it set us up for the day nicely. Being able to come back of a night and grab a coffee on your way back to the room was nice as well. \nOverall our stay was perfect, couldn't fault the hotel in any way. Some people have complained about the lift being slow, but it seriously wasn't a big deal I think people just like to complain about something- first world problems!

Noticed a very artsy crowd more than business.\nPros:\n- Location: right in the heart of the action. Theaters, movies, stores, restaurants galore. Any type of transportation right there. Easy to walk to anywhere. Uber safe.\n-Premises: spotless. Very clean. I'm a germaphobe so those things are very important. Nice kitchenette with everything to cook and eat. Small fridge. Nice TV with lots of options (Hulu, Netflux, Youtube included).\nMy room was at the highest floor (7th) and in the back. So zero city\/street noise. Was very pleased. The buildings in the back are not so close and not higher. So that's great for privacy and you have some view of some NY nice buildings! Nice big windows: very luminous room!\n-Friendly and helpful staff (front desk and security) . Come to you and really try to solve your issues. Let me check in at noon.\n\nCons:\n-Room is small but expected from a brand new hotel in NYC.\n-Breakfast: basic at best, not a lot of options at all for a Marriott. But nice\/clean\/modern breakfast area. Served till 11.00 am though!\n-Waiting\/sitting area is not separated from breakfast area.. So during breakfast hours, those eating and not eating are all in the same area.\nIncident:  Because of the Polar Vortex, my plane arrived at 3.00 am in JFK from Paris. I got to the hotel around 8.00 am. I was very exhausted from a long trip and the jetlag. I was told I had to wait until at least 11.00 am to get a cleaned room. Which I understood completely. I tried to hang out and walk around, but it was freezing outside and I could barely stand on my feet (exhaustion). I went to the sitting\/eating area and I just fell asleep naturally (my body was really out of it). I was sitting and I unconsciously fell asleep. An attendant (the somewhat tall, AA, heavy set lady taking care of breakfast) woke me up loudly, abruptly and rudely saying \"Ma'am, you can't sleep here!\". I have never heard that in my life and I travel a lot. If you cater to travelers, this will certainly happen. Exhausted travelers fall asleep even if they are not deliberately trying to, which was my case. So from 9.00 am to noon, I felt literally tortured, because I had to force myself to stay awake. Sorry this is inhumane. The bigger hotels do not have that appalling policy. That attendant treated me like I was some non desired homeless person. It was such a bad experience. Felt very uncomfortable and humiliated. That has to be corrected. This hotel is not cheap, so please do better.\n\nOverall: good hotel (as long as you are not exhausted). They deliver what they are supposed to offer.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room is not huge, but we're use to that.  We stayed here before getting on a cruise and it wasn't far for us to walk to cruise terminal from hotel (20-25mins).  The hotel is approx 5 mins walk from bus terminal and approx 20 mins from Penn Station. We took the train from airport.  It was very busy since it was over the holidays so it was difficult to walk anywhere...you definately need to pack your patience. There are alot of restaurants close by, close to Hell's Kitchen area and having a mini-kitchen in room was great since we could warm up food, make food if you wanted to since they had everything in kitchen, coffee\/tea (provided), including a dishwasher.  The hall ways are small and elevators aren't the fastest, but we didn't have any issues with it.  Breakfast was good enough to start the day, although they did run out of some stuff. Staff at the front desk are friendly and very helpful!  Not alot of room to walk around in the room, not alot of storage and if you do eat there is no table in room. The tv channels are great, including HBO on demand. We would stay here again!","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Everyone was very friendly, offered parking assistance, made restaurant recommendations, opened doors for me, said goood morning, good evening and good night! Always asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. And again that was on three shifts with three different sets of staff members! \nRoom was a good size for the city, clean, and the kitchenette is fabulous! Bathroom was a good size, could actually move around. Our room was right next door to elevator and didn\u2019t hear it once, and noise from street was almost non existent, the soundproofing was wonderful for a room in the city! Location is perfect to see a show. With plenty of excellent restaurants and bars in walking distance. \nBreakfast is included and although I didn\u2019t have anything as I had that fabulous kitchenette, everything was well stocked, looked fresh and kept clean. \nBut overall it was the staff that won me over! (and the clean room) I\u2019m bad with names, but honestly it\u2019s not necessary because every person who was on duty from January 6th through January 7th was a pleasure to speak with. \nDefinitely will be returning the next time we are in to see a show.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had to pack heavier than normal due to a mixed bag of weather during our trip, and we had just enough storage space for the contents of two roller bags.  Our backpacks were not unpacked. It is a tight squeeze with the twin sleeper pulled out.  We only used the coffee maker and refrigerator in the teeny yet well-equipped kitchen. No desk space if that is a requirement for your stay.\n\nEveryone we interacted with was very friendly and helpful, so service is five stars. The breakfast was good, but if you need to eat a lot of fiber you should bring your own prunes. There's not a ton of space in the breakfast room so there are opportunities to form new friendships at shared tables.  There is some modular furniture in the lounge area, but more table options during breakfast hours would be useful.\n\nThe hotel is constructed in two towers, and we were in the back tower so used the funny little hallway other reviews have referenced.  We didn't find it to be a problem, but it could be for those who have mobility issues or an abundance of luggage.\n\nNoise insulation from outside the hotel is very good, but we found there was a lot of noise from inside the hotel. Between earplugs and active days, the noise didn't keep us up.\n\nLocation is excellent, with lots of great restaurants nearby.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Its all brand new.  The staff are all very nice, requests for extra bedding and bathroom supplies were fulfilled in 5-min.  The room (queen + a sofa bed) is typical NYC small, you will be disappointed if you think you are getting a suite.  The sofa bed was fine for a couple of nights but re-think that if you are staying longer.  Nice bathroom with no hot water problems, towels are plentiful, thick and fluffy, average toiletries.  The windows open, the tv is easy to operate.  There is a pretty well-kitted out kitchen and we appreciated the small fridge.  Nice and quiet room overlooking other rooms and the Intercontinental next door.  The heat worked fine.  There was only one elevator to the second building where we stayed but it was efficient with no long wait times.  The rate I secured was very reasonable.\nTHE BAD: there are apparently two separate buildings here, but they are joined by a very, very, long walkway to the elevators.  This is inconvenient, although of course they are restricted to the existing lot.  The lobby\/breakfast area is far too small.  The breakfast is not that great, although the lady working the area was very pleasant and even came around to take away dirty plates; there was no oatmeal on one of our days, and even though it was only 9:00, it was never replenished.  Plastic cutlery and paper plates should be a big no-no now, I don't know why Marriott is going this route.  Regarding the room, there was no desk area or drawers, just a small little portable table, which was not very useful.  The bathroom has no hooks, not one. There were too many stray hairs (that were definitely not ours) that made their way into the bathroom from the carpeting in the room.\nOverall, it was nice to stay in a new property, and would recommend it.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We found check in running very quickly and our room ready early using the Marriott Mobile Check in through their app. We were in the section called the \"Tower\" separated by a long skinny hallway from the main building. The hallway was way too narrow requiring you to occasionally wait if a cart or service wagon was moving through from the other direction. Unfortunately, this looks like a fault that can not be corrected. Once in the Tower, there seemed to be only 4 rooms per floor so it was very quiet and the elevator waits were very short.  The room itself was very nice in color, lighting and decor. Lots of outlets for chargers and something I have not yet seen in any other hotel, a multi-connector charger located next to the clock just in case you have left yours behind.  We only spent one night, so I have no impression of housekeeping other than the room being clean on arrival.  The quirk is in the bathroom. Spacious and well lit by New York standards, there was no provision for hanging a used towel. No bars, no hooks, nothing.  We provided the desk our comment about this during our quick and effortless check out and they noted it into their system but also indicated that it had been reported many times before and they are working on a solution.  Breakfast also looks promising but is not running well yet.  There were 2 staffers in the room but when we arrived with no apparent crush of business ahead of us, they were nearly out of eggs and breads.  Water pitchers were empty, no napkins were available and I was unable to locate any butter. \n\nI loved the location, only a block from many theatres, yet fairly quiet, and just a few blocks from dozens of Times Square and Hell's Kitchen restaurants.  I would expect that everything except that connecting hallway will be improved with a little experience under their belt and I will absolutely look here again when heading back to the city.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}
