The housekeeping staff were 100% amazing as were the doormen. One of the front desk staff was very helpful providing  options for dinner choices when the concierge was not available. Great location. \nThe bad: the individual who checked us in barely made eye contact or smiled and was not welcoming at all. The bathroom had a gaping hole behind the toilet which made my daughter very  uncomfortable. Sure it wasn\u2019t anything nefarious but why would a luxury hotel put guests in a suite in this condition especially when hidden cameras are something people are concerned about? We noticed this on our first night and didn\u2019t want anyone coming into the room to investigate so late at night. I called the front desk, relayed the issue and asked to be contacted the next day to resolve our concern. No one ever followed up. We used a towel to block the hole for our stay. \n\nTip: The view from the Luxury suites with two beds is a bit rough.

Less than 10 were genuinely memorable experiences. The Kimberly in NYC was a welcome addition to that select club. The service, from the doormen to bell desk to check in and concierge, were at a level you would find at a hotel charging 3x the price. The room was lovely and well appointed, and even quiet by NY standards. We were in town with our high school aged kids for a tour of Columbia U., and they (a hard to impress duo) were very pleased as well. Will certainly return soon, next time without the kids, so we can enjoy the 21+ rooftop lounge and it's great view. Don't hesitate to stay here next time you are looking for a place in NYC.

My only complaint was the rooftop bar would not let us come in with a 19 year old, even though food is served there. We could enter the bar in the restaurant downstairs, which was confounding to us. The rooftop bar also had a rule against sneakers, which I thought was ridiculous, given that my party\u2019s shoes that day consisted of Golden Goose and Gucci. Oh, well!

Upon arrival, we received very attentive service from the doormen and porters who took our luggage into the hotel while we dealt with the taxi driver and then reception for check-in. They would always greet and open doors for us during our stay, always happy to answers question or just chat. Not used to such white glove old school New York service, it definitely added to the hotel's charms.\n\nEarly check-in wasn't an option, so we left our luggage and went out for the day. The hotel said they would notify me when the room was ready. While we were out, I missed their call but they didn't leave a voicemail or text me, so I had to call back to confirm the room was ready.\n\nWe were pleased with our very spacious and clean one bedroom suite with separate living area and sofa bed. It was nice not to be on top of each other and we felt very comfortable. There was also plenty of drawers and closet space, more than enough for four people. We also took full advantage of the kitchenette (fridge, microwave, toaster, sink, plate, glasses, cutlery), purchasing bagels and cream cheese from Essa-A-Bagel and other groceries for breakfast and snacks from Trader Joe's. I did go to the Starbucks down the street for coffee too impatient to try figuring out the coffee machine but my husband used it a few times.\n\nTo address some of the issues from other reviews, we did have one bathroom sink that drained slowly. Probably needed some Draino, we didn't think this was a big deal. We liked the toiletries provided, plus Plackers, bandaids, ear plugs, etc., and that housekeeping provided clean towels everyday if we needed them. For some reason, no matter how many times I changed the AC temperature, it would revert back to super cold. My family didn't mind because it was very hot in New York during our stay so I gave up. \n\nWe also found you need super human strength to open the balcony door. It's old and heavy. I had requested balcony furniture online and over the phone, so was disappointed not see it set up upon arrival. Housekeeping was happy to bring it up when I called, but sent two guys to set up a small table and two folding chairs who we had to tip. We faced the building next door (where people slept in full view with their shades open) but still enjoyed sitting out there if we could the door open.\n\nThe hotel is in a safe area with plenty of stores and restaurants nearby. I agree it's close to attractions but when you have RA like me and it's blazing hot outside, places feel farther to get to. I would say it took us 15 minutes to walk to Bryant Park and 20-25 minutes to get to Times Square. However, the subway is five minutes away and we used it frequently.\n\nOnly my husband went to the rooftop lounge to check it out and he said the staff were not very welcoming when it was clear he wouldn't be paying for anything and just wanted to look around. They serve free pastries and coffee upstairs for guests during set times.\n\nOverall, an excellent stay with lovely staff and only some minor grievances. I definitely recommend the hotel if space and access to a kitchen is important.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Our suite had a small kitchen area and living room, with a separate king bedroom. The linens were lovely, and robes\/Nespresso machine were provided. Toiletries provided were an upscale brand. People at the front desk were friendly and kind. If I had to find fault, the lock on the door to the balcony was broken, and the bedroom door could not close all the way (the door seemed just a touch too big for the frame).

Never got an email confirmation but had the reservation details printed just in case (sure glad I did).  Emailed the hotel a few days before our arrival to make sure everything was fine. Got a computer generated reply with a different reservation number, wrong number of guests and more expensive nightly rates.  After pointing this out, and many back and forth exchanges, all of which were answered by the hotel reservation department in the most terse manner (no proper salutation\/greetings, acknowledgment of their mistake or reassurance that they would fix the problem), was finally told that a manager would look into it. Was left under the impression that nobody really took time to read the email and attached documentation (i.e copy of my initial reservation details) and was left feeling like I was begging for a rebate whereas I only wanted to hotel to respect the initial terms of the reservation.  In the end, received no apologies for the mistake, simply another computer generated confirmation with the right price this time, but the incorrect number of guests (one adult instead of 2 + child).  Was a little worried that this would be a problem once we got to the hotel (it turned out front desk staff was very accommodating), but just did not feel like wasting more time of my precious vacation arguing or looking for a different place. \n \nWhile the hotel experience in itself was really nice (we had the luxury one bedroom suite which was comfortable and very spacious) and the service provided on site was impeccable, I would be hesitant to return given how poorly my reservation was handled pre-arrival.\n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

On this June visit, I would like to give a shout out to MD at the front desk. The room we booked didn\u2019t have a good layout for our needs on this particular stay so he offered us a change and made sure we had the best room for this trip. A big \u201cthank you\u201d to him for the great, no hassle customer service. Our new room was comfortable for us and the balcony with a view (we had a high floor) was nice. You can request balcony furniture if you\u2019d like to spend much time sitting out there. The beds (including the generously sized pull out sofa beds) are comfy and the rooms have plenty of closet space. It\u2019s great to wake up and enjoy a cup of coffee, easily brewed in room and a NYT delivered to your door all while lounging in one of their comfy robes. The doormen are helpful, friendly and upbeat, and the housekeeping staff accommodated our request for extra towels and added bath products. This is not a new hotel and some of the furnishings could use a bit of a spiff up, but it\u2019s a well located, elegant lady of a hotel where staff wants your stay to be as comfortable as possible.  Try Upstairs at the Kimberley for a light filled breakfast experience.

On our first call we were instructed to call back in 30 minutes because the person who handled reservations was on break.  We called back a little over an hour later and were asked to hold but were hung up on.  On our third attempt we were informed that we couldn't be helped over the phone and must go online to cancel then rebook our reservation.  I called back and spoke with a \"manager\" who when asked for his name responded that he was the manager but did not initially give a name.  When pressed he indicated his name was \"Homan\" (not sure of the spelling).  He indicated he would cancel my reservation.

Both suites had spiral staircases up to the bedrooms which was a unique feature. We walked to dinner, walked about 20ish minutes to Broadway & back. Upon our return, we were delighted to find a chilled bottle of Prosecco &  chocolate covered strawberries awaiting us, complements of The Kimberly! Our celebration continued, my sister will not forget this special birthday.

I was not sure whether to choose a hotel closer to Times Square or stay at The Kimberly but we were not disappointed. The location was great and was not as hectic. Harry, the doorman was so kind and we will remember him forever!! We did not spend a ton of time in our room but it was very cozy. We had to change rooms due to no hot water and banging pipes in the first but our new room was much nicer (we were given a suite)! Large rooms for New York! The beds in the second room were especially comfortable. The rainfall shower was awesome, I was expecting very little water pressure but I was surprised that it was amazing! We had a balcony but we were on a low floor facing the building behind, it was chilly so we would not have used it anyway plus it was much quieter facing inward than towards the street. The room price is reasonable when you take into consideration the level of service. \n\nOnly minor complaints for which I would not take away any stars for, 1. it was obvious when our housekeeper changed. Our first one did a great job and left us extra towels when I asked. The second one did not leave the towels when I left a note asking them to and I also had to ask for the toiletries to be replenished as I had used all of the body wash. 2. Really seems to be an issue I have in almost every hotel I stay in, it is impossible to get the room temperature comfortable.

I spend a lot of time in the city and always stay on the east side. We stayed at The Kimberly about 8 years ago and had a lovely stay, although it was only one night. Because I generally go to the city to see my doctors, I usually just choose a cheaper hotel, one of  the chain types. But this time I wanted to stay somewhere nice and make a really nice event out of it for the birthday weekend. I chose a king suite and surprised my husband with the suite (along with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries which I ordered online when I checked in and which was delivered moments after we got to our room. The  suite was beautifully appointed, very clean and looked to be well maintained. No worn or tired furnishings. There were two closets with big plushy robes, slippers, umbrellas and a shoeshine machine, the likes of which I haven\u2019t seen in years. There is also a full height cabinet with a small bar with all the major liquors, wines and champagne, fridge with sodas and mixers, sparkling and still water, coffee maker, snacks, glassware and bar sink. We made full use of it! The bathroom was very large and well stocked with L\u2019Occitane bath products and even a scale. The living area was very comfortable, especially the comfy couch where we would have after dinner cocktails and watch a movie under a cozy blanket. We did not eat in either of the two lobby level restaurants however we did take advantage of the rooftop bar called Upstairs which is enclosed with glass walls and roof and provides a view of the Chrysler building. They also serve small bites dinner menu and breakfast. We had the breakfast buffet and the offerings although pretty standard were delicious. It\u2019s really a beautiful space and during the summer the glass roof and walls retract. It\u2019s a lovely hotel and I\u2019ll now be staying there regularly. The best thing about the Kimberly is  their staff who are all very friendly and take care of any request, big or small with such a pleasant and friendly attitude. From the minute we arrived until the minute we left, the staff was there to serve. We used the service elevator because it was right outside our room and there were usually housekeeping or maintenance staff using it. They were all so kind and pleasant and sincere and always struck up a conversation. From bringing us ice without us having requested it to bringing us water bottles while we waited in the lobby one afternoon, to the doormen who insisted on assisting us with our bags even though they were small and easily handled by us, every single  member of their staff was attentive, friendly and helpful. We will definitely be returning time and time again. I actually can\u2019t wait for the next time.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a King Suite that included a balcony, wet bar and kitchen conveniences such as refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher and even plates & utensils! The bed was plush, sofa was a pullout and 2 TVs between the rooms. Bathroom was a little small, but can\u2019t complain because it was updated and marble. L\u2019occitane toiletries. Very nice. Lots of closet space too. Basically, an NYC apartment. The doormen and front desk personnel were super professional and made sure we had everything we needed. I love that this hotel offers valet parking, which is a major convenience given the NYC streets and driving. On the top floor of this hotel, there is a restaurant and lounge where we ate breakfast every morning. It is a buffet and offers omelet station, french toast and the usual other finds. We went here twice-simply because the service and seating is quick and convenient, and the food is SO good. The omelets and french toast are stand outs. \nAs for location of this hotel, it is a straight shot down, a few blocks from Rockefeller, St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and other landmarks. Though it takes a bit more walking to get to Times Square, this hotel is in a quieter, more upscale neighborhood. Duane Reed, Starbucks and bakeries are within a block. Recommend Schnipper\u2019s for lunch and dinner-it\u2019s a fast-casual place that serves good burgers, salads and kid-friendly foods. Located around the corner, great for take out after a busy day.

We called the Kimberly hotel and are transferred to the front desk--someone who is actually at the hotel with whom we can share our problem. I tell the wonderful Dusty our situation and she gets us a room, a decent price, and is there waiting for us. We had no luggage and they got us tooth bruses and paste, extra towels, sent housekeeping upstairs to make sure we were settled and had everything we needed.  Wow. Our room was beautiful and immaculate.  The towels and bathmats were the very softest I have ever experienced at any 5 star hotel. That might seen small, but considering how many times you go into the bathroom during your stay and how comforting it feels to dry yourself off with a sumptuous towel rather than a stiff and hard one--it makes a difference.  It really is a special hotel.  ","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The appointments were what my parents would call \"classy\". It was in the part of town we needed to be. Our room was in the 151 building, not the main building at 145. That has a separate elevator and is the building that currently has the Empire Steak house. If you have never been to Manhattan, you have to know there is no \"quiet\" area. There are vehicles and sirens at all hours. The higher up you are, the less the street noise is. One thing that just does not fit in the streetscape is the temporary pavilion for street dining. That just looks trashy. Somebody maybe thought that has merit during the pandemic. It is time for those to go.

My gfs and I wanted to celebrate a bachelorette weekend in NYC.  We stumbled upon The Kimberly when we were researching best rooftop brunch in NYC.  It went from just brunch to the focus of our weekend! \n\nFirst off, The Kimberly is centrally located in NYC on 50th Street, easily accessible to anywhere you may want to go in NYC. There is a lobby cafe, the Rooftop (more on that later), Bistango (an Italian restaurant), Burger House & Bar, and the Empire Steakhouse.  There are ample places to eat on-site so if you don't want to leave the hotel, you don't have to. \n\nWe stayed in a 2 bedroom\/2 bathroom suite.  All of the rooms at the hotel are spacious and beautifully appointed. From there, after a brief respite, we made our way to the Rooftop. The Rooftop offers expansive views of NYC with a glass-encased rooftop which is partly retractable during warmer months. There is nothing better than starting out your weekend in NYC enjoying the sunset with cocktails and snacks.  The food is excellent-we had sliders, truffle fries and mac and cheese.  The menu is expansive.  The breakfast buffet is excellent. We ordered meat and cheese plates for the room-all beautifully presented and excellent.\n\nService was top-notch and exceeded our expectations.  When you enter the hotel, you are greeted by uniformed doormen, all courtly, courteous and professional.  Front desk service is excellent and very responsive.  Everyone at the hotel went out of their way to make our weekend great.\n\nI can't say enough about how wonderful this hotel is. I'm sure it is THE place to be, not just for business but for any and every celebratory occasion.  New Year's Eve-here I come!","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I chose it over the other numerous luxury hotels on these couple of blocks along Lexington primarily because the rates were similar, but did not require a non-refundable reservation.  So a plus right off the bat.  \n\nWhat was good:\n1. The doormen, especially Ralph, were just the best.  Very attentive and very friendly, they also anticipate your every need.  In fact, the one bad experience I had regarding lost laundry was resolved by the door staff\n2. The room was spacious and clean, and the little kitchenette is a bonus for those staying more than a night or two.  One strange thing was that there were no stirring sticks or spoons or anything to stir the complementary coffee with, even there were pots and pans and glasses and full condiments for the the coffee\n3. Relatively spacious bathroom, plus the l'Occitane shampoo, soap etc.  But for some reason housekeeping only decided I needed one replacement for the shower gel, which is only good for one shower's worth of washing, even though I stayed 4 nights.  Soap and shampoo were sufficient\n4. Big pillow top bed.  Also kudos for noting my pre-arrival request for something thinner and cooler than a big fluffy down comforter, which for all its luxury is simply too hot for me\n5. The room was in kind of a corner (but windows on one side only) next to the emergency stairs and separated from other rooms by the elevators, and the closest room was across the hall.  It was apparently a complementary upgrade and resulted in privacy and quiet nights for sleeping\n6. The rooftop bar was a very cool place for some cocktails, and the bartender knew what he was doing\n\nNot so good:\n1.  Staff other than doormen were largely indifferent.  One specific instance: I sent out laundry the morning of my last night, and when I returned late that night it had not been returned.  I called housekeeping but since it was around midnight the front desk answered and said they will look it into in the morning and have it back to me by 10 am, but it was not very reassuring.  Next morning at 10, there was no sign of it being returned, and since I needed to check out in a couple hours I was getting concerned so I called housekeeping again, who again said they will \"check\" in a rather indifferent manner.  But Ralph the doorman came through and was up with the laundry within 5 minutes of calling\n2. The \"view\" was of the apartment building next door, but I realize this is Manhattan so one cannot be too choosy unless paying a hefty upgrade","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

One of my criteria for a hotel when we go away for more than two nights is a hotel room with a living room area so we can stretch our after a day of exploring whatever city we are in. The Kimberly Hotel fit the bill with a living room and a balcony on the East side of Manhattan, a few minutes away from Grand Central. \n\nWe are NYers but having moved away to another state a few years ago, we were eager to get back to our city but a little nervous about the size of the room we would be getting for the price and the noise level. We have stayed in other hotels for short stays in the city before and usually they are tiny. We were exceedingly happy to find that our room was very spacious with a separate living room and bedroom, with a little kitchenette, microwave and fridge included. Check in was easy and the Manager on duty the night we checked in was very friendly. \n\nThe room, as we said, was a pleasant surprise. The beds were comfortable and there were more than enough closets with robes, slippers and umbrellas for use during our stay if needed. The only \"complaint\" that we had was that the AC is very loud so if you're a light sleeper, this would have bothered you. We are not so the AC was just background noise.  We did not hear any other hotel guests in other rooms during our stay. The balcony unfortunately overlooked an alley and directly into a hotel next door so not very fun but that was okay. If you get a higher floor, the balcony may prove more enjoyable. We were on a floor below 10th so not very exciting. This is a traditional style hotel so if modern decor is what you prefer, you may find the rooms a little too old-fashioned and dated for your taste. \n\nThe hotel is conveniently located near Grand Central Station and it's Manhattan so there are many dining and public transportation options available within a stone's throw away. It took us about 45 minutes to get to and from LaGuardia during rush hour via ride share service. \n\nOne minor quibble was our request for some additional paper coffee cups and napkins to be re-stocked in our room on the fourth day or our stay. That request went ignored. \n\nWe would definitely love to stay here again on a return visit.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

The bell staff was seriously the friendliest I've met in years and had good suggestions for every question.  Really a great team!  If I was asked to list what I want in front lobby staff, I would just send a photo of these people.  \n- The room was large and comfortable.  The kitchen had everything we needed - fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee maker - and a dishwasher!  Our kid said the shower was the best she ever had.  We had three giant closets, and the beds were comfortable.  The room temp was fully controlled by in-room thermostats.\n- The room was cleaned each day.  None of this silly pandemic stuff eliminating room cleaning until you check out.\n- The location is very good.  You may prefer to be closer to Times Square, but there are plenty of good restaurants in walking distance and the street out front is easy for pickups.\n\nThe bad:\n- We showed up 1\/2 hour before check-in time and our room wasn't ready, so we walked around the area and came back one hour AFTER check-in time and our room still wasn't ready.  It was finally ready 70 minutes after check-in time.  Not a huge inconvenience, but we were already tired from traveling and needed to get into our room.\n- We were charged $13 for minibar items we definitely didn't use.  I think we were charged because of bottles\/food wrappers in the trash for items we brought in ourselves.  I notified the front desk clerk, but he just shrugged.  I wasn't going to argue over $13, but I don't like paying for something I didn't use.\n- I left an expensive phone charger in the room when we checked out.  Only 3 hours later I came back and they said the room was already cleaned and no charger was found.  They accompanied me to the room to let me look, but it was gone.  I definitely left it in the room.  Ok - this one is 50% my fault for leaving it when we checked out, but still I would hope a high-quality hotel would make sure personal items like this are returned.\n\nWe had a great visit to NYC, and the hotel was very good.

The front desk was helpful and friendly with questions and arrangements ahead. The valet parking was a breeze. The doorman who went out of his way, literally, running a block away to get us a cab. The housekeepers were sweet and accommodating for my down bedding allergy.. The in room dining experience was awesome. The delicious, well presented food was only the beginning. There were two polite and friendly servers that placed a white tablecloth on our dining table and set us all up - one time for a full breakfast, one time for a light, late dinner and one time for just a bottle of wine and desserts. We had cocktails and appetizers one evening and a delicious dinner the next evening in the lobby level Bistango. Hostess and servers were wonderful and even remembered what kind of wine I had the first evening so I could order again the second night. We didn't have ideal weather, but really enjoyed chatting on the balcony with cocktails for hours.

On the two treadmills on one the TV was stuck on a children's cartoon channel and the other was clunky, grainy and had a limited selection of channels. As a heavy duty gym user this was disappointing.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

You are close to many midtown sights including Grand Central, Rockefeller Plaza, and Times Square but far enough away from the noise and touristy bustle.\n\nOur room was HUGE. We had a double suite, which included a full kitchen (with a dishwasher!), a dining area with table and chairs, a sitting room with a sofa, chairs, coffee table and desk area, an outdoor balcony, a bedroom with 2 beds, and a bathroom. The size of the bedroom alone was bigger then most NYC hotel rooms, but the whole suite was enormous! And there were FIVE closets. Five!\n\nEach room was lovely, although the balcony had no furniture so it was hard to enjoy, and the bathroom was on the smaller side with dim lighting. There was also a peculiar beeping noise in our room that would randomly sound throughout the time we were there. Not sure where it was coming from.\n\nThe room was very clean and pretty well maintained. The bedding was very soft and comfortable; each bed had 2 soft and 2 firm pillows to choose from. Towels were ample. There was a nicely stocked mini bar, a variety of snacks, a coffee maker, and nice extras like umbrellas. \n\nView from our balcony on the 26th floor was nice, but we were on the back side of the hotel so couldn't see the Chrysler Building.\n\nThe rooftop was fine, but drinks were overpriced and it was very crowded the night we were there. We didn't go to the breakfast served up there. Ordered a couple of beers from room service one night and it was a bit slow.\n\nStaff was a mixed bag, but the concierge (forgot his name) was the shining star.

Turned out to be one of the best decisions of the year.\nPros - \n1. Excellent location within walking distance of usual tourist hot spots like Times Square, Broadway etc\n2. Very reasonably priced for such a premium location\n3. We stayed in a bedroom king-bed suite and was very impressed with the space, the kitchenette and especially the bed\n4. The stand-out feature was the courtesy of each member of the staff; very professional and yet polite, dignified and warm - been ages since I experienced this old fashioned courtesy - and believe me, I travel a lot across the world\nCons - \n1. The rooms and the carpets are old; it's for you to decide whether that is part of the charm or a flaw\n2. There is an Indian restaurant just opposite the hotel and every time we went out to the small patio, the smell was overwhelming. I do not mean this to be a discriminatory comment - I am from India after all - but the smell was offensive.\n3. The bathroom does need an exhaust fan\nOverall, loved our stay and intend to make this our default choice for future trips to the Big Apple.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We ate outside (they have heaters) and dang if we did not choose Bistango every night we were there. Food is so fresh and there are no stuffy waiters. We just showed up when we wanted. No schedule.  It was good impromptu dining. We walked the 5 mins to an informal concert at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The day before Halloween we walked the 10 mins to Rockefeller Center and enjoyed the Day of the Dead costumes and art work . You can walk to Moma, you can take a quick subway to the Met. You can take the subway to Battery Park to head out to the Statue of Liberty. I never heard another guest at night. Yes, the decor could be fresher but the bathroom was sparkling when we returned everyday.  Beds were comfortable.

We tried Room Service a couple of times after very long work days, and had to wait almost an hour each time for our order to be taken. When we contacted Housekeeping, it took over 2 hours for them to respond to our request. We were told by the Concierge that we could order a taxi at any time from the front desk, but when we attempted to, they said it was only for airport travel. We were late to our appointments twice because of this. The room was extremely small and stuffy for the amount charged per night. They also charged for wifi. I would consider this a \"hidden fee\" because there was no mention of this when we checked in. What hotel charges for wifi in the 21st century? The experience was definitely lacking this time around. We probably won't return next time we are in NY. I will say this though, Harry is Amazing!

The front desk staff was very nice and the requests I made in advance for a late night arrival were done to a tee!  Its really the furnishings & amenities that harken a different era. You have to pay for Wifi by device, there is an old 16 bit iPod charger station instead of a place to charge a modern phone by the bed and there was even an executive businessman shoeshine machine with the red & blue heads in the room.

There are only two elevators, and that can be a bit of a pain when things are busy.  But, that said, the rooms are clean and comfortable.  I did not visit the rooftop bar\/restaurant this trip, so I will not comment on them except to say in past visits that has been a very desirable place.

Beds were comfortable and the room was cleaned every day. Ice was brought up to the room promptly every night. The rooftop bar was a delight and the bartender there was friendly and didn't make us (an older couple) feel out of place among the mostly younger crowd. The location was perfect for visits to Central Park and the museums. The large hotel room was perfect for our family of four and our thirteen year old said that the pullout bed was one of the most comfortable he had slept in. He said it didn't have that bar in the middle most pullout sofa's have. The bathroom was small but serviceable with a rain shower that was quite good. There was absolutely no noise on our 24th floor. The room even had a balcony. My wife used the exercise room and said it was excellent. This was our sixth stay in New York and this was the best hotel we've stayed in. We've spent twice as much for a hotel in the past with half the space. With each stay there was always something negative to say, but there wasn't anything negative to say about the Kimberly.

We loved the heart-shaped tub, but the whirlpool jets didn\u2019t work and there should have been some grab-bars to make it a bit easier to get in and out of the tub.\n\nThere were no room service menus in the room when we arrived. But we called for some and they arrived right away. The food was delicious. And there was no dessert menu. So we called again, and then immediately a dessert menu was delivered. And the desserts were excellent!\n\nThe breakfast area on the top floor of the building has a lovely view of the local area. We discovered that there was no complimentary  breakfast. In a non-pandemic situation, we learned, that there would be a breakfast buffet. But we\u2019re not quite out of this yet, are we? So, not a big deal. \n\nBut it was another thing about the breakfast that annoyed me. The menu said \u201cfresh squeezed juices.\u201c So I ordered a fresh grapefruit juice. And the juice that arrived was obviously fresh out of a can! So I politely said to the waiter \u201cExcuse me, this isn\u2019t  fresh squeezed. Do you have any fresh squeezed juice?\u201c And then waiter dutifully returned with some lovely fresh squeezed juice and apologized.

Wolfgangs Coffee is delicious  - I know coffee :) and no hotel coffee has ever met my standard of coffee taste except this one. The room was so spacious. The hotel has a 1930\u2019s vibe and it is breathtaking. I have stayed in many hotels but the Kimberly is by far the best I\u2019ve ever stayed in. You get what you pay for and much much more! It\u2019s in Manhattan but away from all the noise so you get a great nights sleep in their comfortable beds. The door man was always smiling and making small talk , making sure we are taken care of . Sadie at the front desk was our go to person , she\u2019s one lady I will never forget :) so nice and welcoming !! She made sure that when We left the hotel at night,  housekeeping would have cleaned our room by the time we came back. No matter the time! The terrace upstairs is breathtaking with its views and they even give complimentary snacks even if you don\u2019t buy an alcohol beverage!

Having stayed at other hotels over the last couple of years, we always had a rushed hotel experience, nothing special and mostly disappointing.  Then we found The Kimberly Hotel.  I almost hesitate to share our experience because we want to keep it our secret.  However we feel that they deserve to be recognized as the superior establishment that they are.   Hands down, it was a superb encounter from start to finish.   From the moment we checked in, every single staff member was warm, kind, helpful, and knowledgeable.  Special recognition should be given to Gregory,  Kirt, and Sedia.  We enjoyed lunch twice at the Bistango and our food was not only beautifully presented but excellent as was our server, Erin. \n She was smart, charming and knowledgeable and she made our dining experience even more enjoyable.   We enjoyed drinks at the Upstairs which has beautiful city views and highly recommend a visit there after dark.  One of our best experiences was finishing an evening at the Empire Steakhouse with after-dinner drinks.  The steakhouse is in a beautiful venue, an old opera house, adjacent to The Kimberly.  It was another beyond compare experience which includes wonderful conversations with the owner, Jack and manager, Deca.   Their generosity and kindness capped off a birthday evening for our daughter.  Though they were no longer serving dinner they surprised our daughter with a complimentary birthday tiramisu along with candle and sang happy birthday to our daughter.  Our only regret with the Empire Steakhouse is that we didn't have dinner there, a mistake we will remedy next time in NYC as the reviews for the food are outstanding.   Onto the accommodations at The Kimberly.  We stayed in an Executive One Bedroom Suite and once again thrilled beyond words.   From the decor and bookcase filled with an interesting variety of books, to the comfy couch and bed, everything about it was lush and a level of its own, not to mention clean clean clean, setting another high standard against COVID.  We felt that we could easily live in the room.  Another premium level of service worth mentioning that is that each time we made an extra request for something, towels, conditioner, etc. we had it in minutes.  I don't remember a  time that any hotel was that efficient when we have made extra requests.  Another fun aspect, not necessarily the highest priority but important, was the efficiency of elevators at the hotel.  There are two and they always arrived so quickly!  We cannot count the number of times we have had to wait for elevators at hotels.  Too many.

I heavily research all accommodation and this delivered. Great size suite for a small family, with kitchen, living area, bedroom and good size bathroom. We had a lovely suite facing the front of the hotel\/street (definitely request this if available as the other side is not as nice). Noise was not bad and the bed was divine and a beautiful sleep was had. Gregory the doorman is fantastic and my son still talks about how much he liked Gregory to this day. \n\nThe major downside we had was my daughter left behind a teddy bear which is very sentimental to us. They didn't contact me to advise it had been left behind but when I contacted them they said they had it. I asked for it to be sent back to us due to the sentimental value. They said I would need to send through my credit card details which I have never been asked to do at other hotels but then they came back with a quote of $200 AUD for a small stuffed teddy bear to be posted!! I said I would arrange a courier to pick it up instead (which I did) and I never heard back from them. \n\nI called, emailed and contacted via Instagram and still to this day have never been contacted back. I spent thousands of dollars staying at this hotel for several nights and I feel so upset that they didn't bother to get back to us even though they have been updating Instagram regularly. I understand there has been a lockdown but we still haven't been contacted back since March. Great hotel but I still don't know where our teddy is at!

I really have mixed feelings on this hotel.  There was definitely good and bad at this hotel.  \nGood: \nRoom size: We had a 1 bedroom suite with 2 bathrooms.  The price for this size room is great and the size is good for a family.  The bed and sofa bed were both comfortable. \nLocation: The proximity of the hotel to major attractions is great. Within walking distance is Rockefeller center, Times Square, Grand central station, and Central Park. \nBad:\nCleanliness: In our first room, one of our the toilets was dirty and a dirty glass was left in the bathroom.  Upon finding this we promptly requested the room to be cleaned and were offered a new upgraded room and a complimentary breakfast the next morning.  \nThe next room also had a dirty bathroom.  Because it was after midnight, we decided to address it in the morning.  We then requested the room to be cleaned two additional times. Finally we had to point out the excrement stains on the toilet to the housekeeping staff before the toilet was thoroughly cleaned.  Further, we had to move a chair to accommodate the pull out sofa and found a leftover candy wrapper. Then found an eye glass case under the bed while we were doing our \u201cfinal\u201d sweep of our room before leaving. I understand a room will never be cleaned to my at home standards BUT there should be some standards.  \nThe elevator broke once while we were on it.  Luckily our family and another group did not get stuck on the elevator.  \nThe presence of a hotel manager was non existent.  It appeared that the front desk staff managed the hotel during the shift. Upon checkout another customer was upset and was voicing his concerns.  The concerns didn\u2019t even seem to be acknowledged.  \n\nThis hotel has A LOT of potential, but right now is failing.  If you are considering this hotel based on price I would consider looking at another comparable option. \n","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The only room that was not large was the bathroom, which was, we felt sub-par, in terms of space. It was nicely appointed though with great water pressure in the shower.  Clearly the hotel was an apartment at one point, as there were also three(!) closets for storage and clothes. \n\nThe other bonus was a lovely deck off of the living room which provided some fun views of mid-town and the East River in the distance. \n\nThere is a great doorman to greet you at all hours and a 24 hour front desk as well as pretty decent room service. \n\nI found the staff to be courteous, responsive and on top of every detail and request that we made. \n\nThe decor of the room was a bit dated, but absolutely clean and not worn out at all. \n\nLastly, the location is amazing....right in the heart of midtown and only a block away for the 6 train.

I\u2019m not really a fan of boutique hotels and while there may be things to like, this hotel would not have been my first choice.\n\nCheck-in: Often, Front Desk people make or break a hotel for me. I had the pleasure (and I use that term loosely) of interacting with Christine. No hello, no smile. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d was her initial statement. She was so practiced with her delivery that she ran through the information as though it was another weary been-there-done-that performance. I asked her to repeat her soliloquy. When I requested a room on a higher floor, we reached an impasse because she said nothing else was available except a room on a lower floor. (Note to travelers: There\u2019s ALWAYS another\/better room with a better location.)\n\nRoom: The initial room was unacceptable for a number of reasons. I am aware of the space issues in NYC and buildings do abut one another and you may not have any type of view. I\u2019m fine not having a view, but I\u2019m not OK looking across to an apartment building where I could almost touch and see everyone and what they\u2019re doing. Likewise, they could peer directly into my room. I would have to keep the drapes closed at all times and as it was, there wasn\u2019t much natural light. I returned to the Front Desk and after an extended discussion with my friend, Christine, I opted to wait for Kurt (the manager on duty) to return from his lunch break to discuss a different room option. Eventually, I landed on a lower floor with a view to 50th St. and the buildings across the street were at an appropriate distance. As an aside, some people think you want a bigger room. No, I always want the room I reserved. (Or in some cases, the prepaid room.) A bigger room doesn\u2019t always mean better so I always stress that I want the room I reserved. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nNote to travelers: If you make a hotel reservation using Hotels.com or Expedia or one of the other after-market online services, you\u2019ve made a choice based solely on price; and it doesn\u2019t matter if you are Preferred\/Gold\/Premium user of those after-market sites. As such, the hotels see that you made a choice based on price and you\u2019ll likely get the worse room (location, size, and, e.g., view to a wall) in the hotel. Sometimes you might get lucky and get a better room, but that\u2019s rare. My reservation was made by someone using Hotels.com, and that was beyond my control.\n \nThe room itself was, I think, European in style. If I remember correctly, all the rooms are suites and only about 4 or 5 (maybe 6?) suites per floor. Not sure when the last update occurred, but I think it\u2019s time to renovate the rooms. They feel a bit worn\/used and rough around the edges. The room was quiet (except those early morning NYC garbage trucks, but not much anyone can do about that, but I really didn\u2019t care). The living space had a desk (a good thing!), a couch, table, and a chair. The living space also had a sink, dishwasher, microwave, and a coffee maker (though, it hadn\u2019t been thoroughly cleaned in a long time). On the small table was a mini bar of sorts with food items and on the first day, I had the nuts and M&Ms (which were never replaced while I was there). Off the living space was a balcony with plenty of room. However, the door to the balcony was old, frayed, and almost impossible to open and close. Where is maintenance?? The bedroom had a comfortable king bed and a loud A\/C. The bathroom was of sufficient size and the better news was that the bedroom had two closets \u2013 plenty of storage space. Housekeeping was a bit annoying. I dislike stepping into the hall and if someone from housekeeping was also in the hall, they pounced: \u201cAre you leaving your room?\u201d Well, the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign was on the door so that should have been a clue. This happened on more than one occasion. \n\nService: Likely the worst Front Desk hotel service I\u2019ve had in a long time. (The doormen and the Concierge I encountered, however, were really friendly and helpful \u2013 kudos to them.) Watching the Front Desk, as I sat in the lobby one afternoon, was amusing. Christine and Andreanna (sp?) seem like (tongue in cheek) the most helpful desk attendants I\u2019ve experienced in quite a long time. Never smiled (except when it was a smirk) and not particularly helpful when asked questions. One day (I don\u2019t know who answered the phone and maybe it wasn\u2019t one of them), I mentioned that the bottled water had not been refreshed in my room. \u201cNo problem,\u201d the person said on the phone, \u201cwe\u2019ll send some up.\u201d Thirty (30) minutes later, I went to the front Desk to get it. Christine hands me one bottle. I asked for a second one and she hesitated. Really? Water?? After that, I picked up bottled water at Duane-Reade. I have little patience for that type of behavior. After that interaction, it was best to avoid the Front Desk whenever possible.\n\nService at breakfast was the worst. Breakfast takes place on the top floor penthouse. I step off the elevator and enter the space. No one is there so I can\u2019t figure out if I\u2019m supposed to seat myself or wait for a ma\u00eetre d. Finally, I just started looking for a clean place and then, poof, out of nowhere I hear \u201cMay I help you?\u201d I ordered from the menu, which seemed to throw the waitperson off track. He reminded me that everything on the menu was at the buffet. Thank you, but not everyone wants to do a buffet. Then, the order of scrambled eggs was really a bad; unscrambled and more like a badly folded omelet. Same thing the following 2 mornings. On my last morning, I went next door to the diner breakfast. In retrospect, I should have done that all mornings and saved myself the grief.\n\nWe (members of my team) also had a late afternoon social hour at the penthouse. When we entered, I saw one other group so the place was not crowded. When we told, whoever was near, that we expected about 3 more people, she gave us this disgruntled look, pulled a \u201cReserved\u201d sign of a table and motioned us to sit down. Sorry. (Not.)\n\nUpon check-out, I was expecting the nuts to be on the final hotel bill. They weren\u2019t so I mentioned it to the desk attendant. He created a separate bill only for the nuts. Maddening.\n\nJust a not-so-good experience. As I mentioned to a co-worker as we headed to the airport, some hotels work for you; others do not. Let\u2019s just say they\u2019re probably glad I won\u2019t be back. :-) And, please, Kimberly Hotel, no need to follow up with any canned responses. I acknowledge it was a bad match. Let\u2019s move on.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The rooms have everything you'd expect - quality linens, comfy beds, good pillow selection, flat screen TVs,  - plus some really nice extra touches such as a throw blanket, umbrellas, lots of closet space, a large safe, an electric shoe shiner and buffer and even a shoe horn!

The general areas of the hotel were beautiful. We stayed in a one bedroom room executive suite on the 16th floor. Our room was very spacious. There were three closets! Only the bathroom was very small in comparison to the rest of the room. For such a nice hotel the room needed obvious renovations (pictured). There was what appeared to be water damage on some furniture, holes in the bed sheets, the handheld shower was leaking and there was a weird stain on the bathroom door to name a few things. Also the rain shower head was also leaking, which meant if you were using the handheld shower freezing cold water would periodically drip directly on to you. The sliding door to the balcony was extremely hard to open. We didn't bother asking for a new room when we noticed these things as I had already requested a room on a higher floor when we arrived and was told this was the only room available. We arrived on Wednesday night and went out early Thursday morning. I put the housekeeping request on the door and we were gone for a few hours. When we returned our room hadn't been cleaned but it wasn't a big deal because we had just checked in the night before. I wasn't well so we stayed in until Friday evening. When we left on Friday evening we put the housekeeping request on the door again and told the Front Desk staff we would be out for the evening and were requesting our room be cleaned. When we returned several hours later the room once again had not been cleaned. I called down to the FD and was advised that housekeeping went but the DND was on the door. We had left it on accidentally but I would think the request PLUS the fact that we directly requested service at the FD would over ride this. The FD rep said they could send someone up then. When I queried what we were supposed to do while the room was being cleaned she said \"I guess maybe go Upstairs and have a drink?\". So in a way we had to pay for our room to be cleaned. When we returned to the room we noticed the housekeeper had not removed our room service dishes but had wrapped them in a white sheet and left them on the dining room table. The dishes were not removed until the next time we ordered room service. Aside from that we had a pleasant stay. The beds were comfy, the bellmen and door staff were always helpful and pleasant, the room service was tasty and the area felt safe.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

We had a 2 bedroom suite which was on the top floor. The room itself was great, the sofa pulled out and was comfortable for my 6ft 5\" brother, the master bedroom was huge and had a lovely en-suite. There was also another bathroom which was just as nice as the en-suite. Both bathrooms included L'Occitane toiletries too which was a lovely treat.We also had a little balcony which was nice to spend the mornings and early evenings on.\n\nDirectly above us was the bar, when we first arrived we went straight upstairs for a drink. The 3 men in our group were told that they weren't allowed in as they were wearing shorts, we was also told it was a private event but we can sit in the corner if we wanted to.... Not really! We then found on the Friday night that there is a DJ from about 11pm-2am! We weren't given any advance warning of this, we found out about it when we returned to the room as asked reception what was going on. We paid a lot for what I believed was one of their best rooms and this completely ruined our stay. I'm not a party pooper, we do like a drink but when we've been up early and exploring NYC, we did just want bed! As it was we gave the bar a go on the Saturday night, we was going to be kept up anyway so may as well join the party, this time we were dressed appropriately and smartly. The dress code is smart however there were a lot of groups in there that had obviously spent the day exploring NYC, hit the bar early and not left as they were very casually dressed. I wouldn't normally complain about this but as our group had been turned away for wearing shorts why were these allowed in? Also, the DJ was rubbish! He was playing all sorts of music genres that just didn't flow or make sense so we had 1 drink and moved on.\n\nThe staff on the front doors were wonderful, very friendly, chatty, helpful, they really brightened the place up. I found the reception staff a little bit short and abrupt, like they couldn't be bothered and they'd rather you left them alone.\n\nI'm not sure I would return to this hotel purely due to the rubbish late night party!

The level of staff attentiveness is unmatched; the room decor is exquisite, and the sweeping views of the East River and the Chrysler Building from our suite were magnificent!!  The rooftop lounge offers extraordinary ambiance with its panoramic and stunning views of the Big Apple.  In particular, Bijou at the Front Desk was so concerned about my Mom's comfort during the check-in process as were Bellmen Jose and Gregory.  Because of them, my Mom immediately felt like a queen the moment she was greeted at the hotel's valet-parking area.  Our breakfast servers Arian and Javiar (rooftop lounge) were truly delightful and also treated my Mom like royalty!! Peter and Dusty (concierge) were beyond helpful both during the trip-planning process and during our stay, as was Ava at the front desk (who kindly and cheerily responded to a number of my questions).  Bellman Ralph was exceptionally helpful as we closed out our stay!!  Last and certainly not least, Marcia in reservations was most accommodating in booking our 2020 reservations, as my family and friends have decided to make this our annual destination for my Mom's subsequent birthday celebrations!!  While we look forward to our stay in May 2020, I know we will be back at the Kimberly before then to celebrate other important milestones.  The special birthday dinner was enjoyed next door at the Empire Steakhouse (fabulous food, ambiance and attentive staff there as well)  Do not pass up the opportunity to stay at this exceptional hotel and make lifetime memories for you and your family and friends!!","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

While in some regards this was charming, other aspects of the hotel are in need of some TLC.\nWe stayed in a suite for a long weekend.  Other members of our group were also staying at the hotel and we were all checked in shortly after arrival, including one guest who arrived early in the morning.  It's always nice to get checked in right away after any flight.  The front desk staff was friendly as were the bell men at this time and for the remainder of our stay.\nOur suite was decorated with bespoke furniture.  Some was amazing such as the chest of drawers in the bedroom but other pieces like the sofa were probably in need of being replaced or reupholstered.  We didn't care for the old looking carpeting but loved that our room had a balcony and kitchenette closet.  We felt like we had plenty of room to spread out which is a rarity in New York City hotel rooms.  The bathroom, however, was still quite small.  Although the furnishings appeared to be relatively updated the bathroom is still little and there is just not enough room to put your things.  In addition, if one were inclined to take a bath they would be quite cramped.  The width of the tub bottom was certainly smaller than an average household bathtub.\nMy biggest complaint was probably the cleanliness.  There were some areas of the bathroom which I could tell had not been properly cleaned before our arrival and there were no spare rolls of toilet paper.  The hair dryer handle was sticky I suppose from a prior guests hair product.  Worst of all, when we were looking around for a lost sock, my husband pulled a sock from underneath one of the chairs, and this sock did not belong to us.\nI also did not like that there was no changing table in the restroom off of the lobby.  In addition, my infant son was not welcome in the upstairs bar area in the evenings; not that we were hanging out in a bar with a baby but we like to meet for a drink before going to dinner.  It was disappointing that this was not an option for us.  It is a lovely space.  They do allow children in the area in the afternoon where self service tea and pastries are available.\nThe Kimberly is charming but the rooms are in need of a little extra care.  It is a more traditional hotel rather than the boutique-modern style most hotels seem to be going for now.  You will be respected as a guest and won't feel cramped as you might at another NYC hotel.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I went to the bar to simply get a glass of ice for the room and was given the ice, tipped the bartender, but was quickly shown the elevator as I was not appropriately dressed (I had black sneakers), jeans, and was otherwise dressed  appropriately, but was not YOUNG or PRETTY. The rooftop bar, at night is my one complaint about an othersie AMAZING property. One person told me on the phone the v=bat=r and hotel are separate businesses. It may have been rented out for an event, though it did not look like it was. If so, they could have met me at the elevator and indicated it was a private event, not shunned me back down to my level. But, no worries, the View (rooftop at the Marriott Marquis is happy to take our money for a much better view of the city). So Upstairs, is GREAT in the morning, but families, old, people, and ugly people must stay in their lanes, so to speak, at night, on the rooftop. Sad.\n\nKudos: My #2 in all of NYC! Would be happy to live here. Love the L'Occitane bath products!\n\nSuggestions: Rooftop bar at night should be for guests, first. Water, coffee, tea in lobby might be a nice extra.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was very clean overall except for the bathroom, a bit dirty around the shower but nothing too much. The radiator ( this and the grumpy checkinstaff make it 4\/5 and not 5\/5) makes a lot of noise. Impossible to sleep through i you would want it on while sleeping. If this is also the airco, I imagine it getting pretty hot in there in the summer. So that might be a problem. They should fix it, because this is an insanely nice hotel and the radiator just doesn't fit in for some odd reason :)\nBut overall: would definetly recommend!!

Plenty of cupboard space for clothes and luggage. Separate bedroom. Small but sufficient bathroom with a 2nd vanity outside the bedroom in a small hall (very handy). Good gym. Excellent staff who were very helpful. Lovely aquarium in lobby. \nWe had a balcony which was too noisey to sit on as there was an airconditioner on a neighbouring roof top. But we could see the top of the Chrysler Building from our balcony. Traffic noise also meant sitting out wasn't the thing to do (level 20 from memory). I didn't hear traffic at night, but my husband could hear sirens sometimes. Think that is unavoidable in NY!\nSlightly less busy area of Manhattan but still walking distance to Times Square and theatre district. We generally took the subway (2 blocks away) or an Uber to a show, but enjoyed the walk back to the hotel afterwards. Easy walk to 5th Ave for shopping and even to Central Park. \nNot a huge range of shops in the streets close to the hotel, but a few multi purpose stores where we could pick up food for our apartment (Walgreens, Duane Reade etc) & some restaurants of varying price ranges (even cheap options like Starbucks, Panda Express & McDonalds all within a block or so)\nTrendy rooftop bar that also provided free snacks\/coffee during the day if we were around. Bottled water provided daily in room.\nHigh end accommodation at a reasonable price compared to many hotels in NY.  You will find cheaper places to stay, but not necessarily anywhere of this standard of luxury in the price range and with this amount of space. Book well in advanced and the rates are much friendly.

Having arrived at Newark airport we had pre-booked a Dial7 taxi which got us to the hotel in forty minutes...brilliant! Check-in was fast and we were given complimentary wi-fi. Just a note here regarding wi-fi...we found it pretty poor; it frequently dips in and out which was annoying. \nWe stayed in room 7J. The room was so spacious. It had two double beds with beautiful soft bed linen and cosy down quilts. There was a table with two chairs to relax on with a glass of wine. A coffee machine (no kettle), lots of tea and coffee supplies, complimentary still water, a fridge and a microwave. The bathroom was lovely...metro tiles from floor to ceiling, a rain shower over the bath, lots of towels and L\u2019occtaine toiletries which were a treat to use. \nOur only negatives were...insufficient cupboard and hanging space for the four of us. The wardrobe was quite small with little space to put our things in. The windows are single glassed and the noise outside was evident. Construction work across the road occurred late at night which was noisy! I used the ear plugs which were supplied. \n\nTake the lift to \u2018Upstairs\u2019 the rooftop bar. They provide complimentary coffee, tea, juice, pastries and fruit from 11am to 4pm weekdays. This was a lovely touch and the views are wonderful.\n\nWe ate at two places near the hotel which were just ok:\nSpice Symphony which is across the road from the hotel. Nice ambience and attentive staff but average food. This place gets rave reviews. \nThe NYC Luncheonette which is up the road (right out of hotel). We were underwhelmed with the breakfast we had especially as it has good reviews. \n\nPlaces we ate at and enjoyed:\n\nWest way Diner in Hells Kitchen - busy but efficient with lovely breakfast options. Our children loved the Chocolate Nut Blast French toast :)\nFive Napkins also in Hells Kitchen. Great burgers. Make a booking as it gets busy.\nPure Thai Cookhouse in Hells Kitchen - wonderful food, tiny restaurant which gets very busy.  If you have to wait for a table pop across the road to Jaspers Taphouse. Great selection of beers. We had a meal in here on one of the nights...good food, particularly the loaded nachos. Karaoke on Wednesdays is a laugh!\nRubirosa in Little Italy - book if you can as it is always busy. Beautiful pasta dishes and pizzas.\nLevain Bakery which is not far from Central Park - to die for cookies which are huge and like nothing you will have tasted before.\nSan Marzano in East Village is a busy, noisy restaurant with tasty inexpensive pasta dishes. You can choose any shaped pasta and sauce for $10! Cheap for NYC. We ate here twice and loved it. Brussel sprouts, Fuji apple and pecorino cheese starter is a must. The garlic bread is yummy too. \nDonught Plant in Grand Central - if you like donughts you will love this place. We got our donughts and coffees and stood at a table and watched all the comings and goings in this fabulous station. \nOther options for breakfast are Bubbys near The Highline and Clinton Street Baking Company. Both are really nice places. Clinton Street Baking Company open at 8am and quickly fills up. \nFinally! We bought a one week Metro pass for the four of us which cost $32 each. You can buy these at any subway kiosk or ticket machine. So worth it and it makes getting round the city so easy despite the metro being a tricky one to get your head round!\n\nEnjoy your trip - this was our second holiday in New York and it won\u2019t be our last.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

And the adjacent one, which looks older and the views are dissapointing (interior views) as some travelers have shown in their pictures. Location is perfect for visiting New York, and the area is very safe and quiet in the night, though there are some restaurants around. \n\nIn the first moment we were given a room in the adjacent building which I would rate with 4 points (nice and big room, good bathroom, good clean service, but dissapointing views).\n\nDuring the fourth day the elevator got of order in the evening and we complained about the situation (our room was on the 4th floor). The reaction of the assistant to General Manager Mr. Jorge Garciadealba was simply perfect. He apologized for the situation and invite us to dinner. Next day the elevator continued broken so we were changed to a suite in the main building, and I can only say it was incredible (very big, nice views...).\n\nTo be honest, should I have stayed the whole week in the first room, I would rate the hotel with 4 points. But rooms in the main building deserve clearly 5 points.\n\nLet me again remark the treatment of Mr. Garciadealba which was what a traveller always expects when there is a problem: apologies and solutions. That is Client Focus! 5 Points.\n\nRest of the Hotel employees were very nice as well but do not remember their names only nationalities (Venezuelan in the Italian restaurant, Mexican in the breakfast roof restaurant).

Room service was delicious the two times we ordered it and the food was very reasonably priced. We stayed in Suite 7F and it was perfect after a long day of adventuring in the city.

I\u2019ve never stayed in a 5 star hotel, the Kimberly is a 4 and I have no idea how they could improve upon that because nearly everything was perfect.

Once again, the Kimberly did not disappoint.\n\nThe Kimberly is a boutique hotel, so the lobby is a little small, although very nice.  The rooms on the other hand, are large, well-appointed and wonderful!  I reserved the Deluxe 1 Bedroom King Suite and was given Suite 6F which has a separate living room and 2 sinks in the bathroom.  This gave us so much room to move around, as well as allowed us to sit and enjoy leftovers from restaurants and the free bottle of wine and cheese tray that the hotel provided me as a return guest. The suite did have a balcony, although there\u2019s no reason to use it as there\u2019s no view since every building around the Kimberly is tall.  All of the rooms that I\u2019ve stayed in at the Kimberly contain either a separate kitchenette area or a built-in kitchenette that has a microwave and refrigerator.\n\nThis time, I booked the Kimberly via the TripAdvisor website about 2 months in advance and received a very good rate that included a free breakfast buffet on the rooftop lounge for 2 each morning.  As expected, the breakfast buffet was wonderful with an omelet station, fresh cut fruits, bacon, sausages, eggs, pancakes, French toast, juices, etc.  It\u2019s certainly enough to keep you full until dinner.  We also visited the rooftop lounge at night where the view of the Chrysler building is stunning and the drinks are excellent.  We had a wonderful dinner at the Empire Steak House, located in the Kimberly, which I highly recommend as the fish was fresh and delicious and the atmosphere is wonderful as well.  What a great stay we had.\n\nThe Kimberly is centrally located (on East 50th between 3rd Ave and Lexington) so we walked almost every place we visited including a walk down to 42nd and Broadway to see Aladdin, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Shops on Madison Ave, Saks 5th Ave to see its spectacular Christmas lights show, and so much more. \n\nThe front desk staff, manager, doormen and baggage helpers at the Kimberly are all very friendly and helpful.  I've never had an issue with any of them, as each time I've stayed at the Kimberly, they were all wonderful to deal with.  Next time, I\u2019ll take my husband for a visit to New York City and we will certainly return to the Kimberly.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The staff give a generally uninterested in their guests vibe.\nOn the morning of the wedding, the bride called down for a bottle of champagne. Now, given how much money she was spending at the hotel and the occasion I would have expected this to have been sent up without having to be asked. However not only did we have to ask, but they told us they were too busy and would send when they had time.\nThe wedding itself was very stressful given the venue was meant to be ready at 4 and on arriving at 3.30 we were told it would be half past and they had barely started setting up. This would have been fine had they offered a solution, which they didn\u2019t even pretend to do but instead sent 25 paying customers out into the cold to find their own arrangements. Or we could sit at the fish tank if we wanted of course (!)\nThe hotel is very well situated for Lexington Av., Times Sq etc and the subway link takes you to most locations fairly quickly.

We stayed at The Kimberly from Oct 27-Nov 1. I\u2019d called the property a few weeks before our stay to let them know we were celebrating 20 years together, and to request a high floor with a nice view. When we checked in, the woman at the front desk wished us a happy anniversary, and informed us that our WiFi would be complimentary. When we got to the room, they had left little treats for us! It\u2019s little touches like this that make The Kimberly special. Our room was a luxury one bedroom suite. The furniture was traditional, but lovely. It was huge, with separate doors to both the living area and bedroom. There was a little wet bar with a mini fridge, sink, coffee pot, and microwave. The bathroom was big, with a nice, deep tub, rainfall shower head, and a handheld shower head attachment. There was mouthwash, q-tips, cotton balls, L\u2019occitane shower gel, shampoo, soap, etc. The floors were heated, which was a very nice touch!  A lighted makeup mirror, scale, and hairdryer were also included. The bedroom featured a flat screen tv, an adjustable, king sized bed, large closet with a safe, iron, and bags for laundry. There was a dresser, and the nightstands also provided plenty of drawer space. The balcony was a fantastic addition, such a special thing to have in NYC! It offered a great view of the GE building, even a tiny glimpse of The Chrysler building. We asked if we could have a little table and chairs to enjoy it with, and they were graciously provided. The bed was so comfortable, and there were plenty of pillows. The living area featured a comfortable love seat, desk, small dining table with two chairs, and a flat screen tv. There was a little mini bar with snacks, and although we never utilized it, the prices weren\u2019t too outrages. There was also an extra closet. All in all, the room was perfect, and I have not one complaint! We also loved the location. Central Park, MoMa, Carnegie Hall, Times Square, Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center, Columbus Circle, and the subway were all an easy walk from this hotel. The service at this hotel was wonderful- friendly, but unobtrusive. The rooftop bar\/restaurant, Upstairs at The Kimberly, was very nice, with great views. We enjoyed complimentary to go coffee there every morning, but never had breakfast there. It was too pricey- $29 per person. I just couldn\u2019t justify spending that much when there were so many great little breakfast places\/ diners mere steps from the hotel. Maybe we\u2019ll try it during our next stay. The Kimberly Hotel is not the fanciest, or most expensive hotel I\u2019ve stayed in, but it\u2019s definitely the best. We are already planning a return trip, and cannot imagine staying anywhere else!  ","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The rooms are huge, especially by NY standards and very clean. The beds are extremely comfortable and amenities are top shelf. The rooms also come with the very welcome fridge with room for things you purchase or bring back instead of being crammed full of overpriced mini bar fare most people don't touch. Shoe polisher, ear plugs, umbrella, robe and slippers, microwave? All in the room. And the entire staff was friendly and helpful. I very much look forward to returning to The Kimberly in the future.

Door men were so helpful and friendly. Reception is small but amazing with golden paintings and furniture and a massive tropical fish tank. We were on 3rd floor. Not much of a view but the room was large and beautifully furnished with a side kitchen. Towels and toiletries changed every day and bed made. Our kids were in a separate area using a different lift on the 5th floor. Again room was smaller but good. The best in my opinion was the roof top bar on the 30th floor. The weather was hot while we were there and they opened the large windows so you really felt part of NYC. Service was great as was the atmosphere. In the afternoon from 4 to 5 they do free coffee\/tea and little cakes. The area is amazing. Bath and Body Works just 7 mins round the corner. As was Rockafeller Centre which we went to , no queues got in straightaway about 9.30 am. Views are amazing. Got the subway down to 9\/11 and also Battery Park for the ferry to Liberty Island and Ellis Island. Very good trip. We got scammed at the subway early morning. a chap with an official badge and a key to open the big iron gate took us through and activated Metro Cards for us at $20 each....$80 altogether then he pretended to activate the cards. We were got to 9\/11 we checked them in the machines and they were all out of date. Never thought we could still get scammed! Beware only go to machines or the people with yellow coats on.

Off of the living area was a balcony that over looked E 50th St.  The view was of buildings across the street, but we could see traffic below.

This gave us the opportunity to take a walk to stretch our legs after a very early start (4am UK time) and 7 hour flight. We were told by a female receptionist that we had been upgraded to a suite, but on our return were re-assigned a different room in \"the tower\" by a male colleague, however this appeared to be a standard room based on a review of pictures on Oyster (single room and kitchen extension, with no balcony or seating area). Now I don't usually pay much attention to this sort of thing, but given that this was our wedding trip and had told the hotel of our plans (we enquired about a wedding photographer recommendation, plus post-wedding lunch) we were somewhat disappointed. I hadn't expected to be upgraded,  but when a carrot is danged in front of you.....\n\nWe were on the 9th floor adjacent to the elevator shaft, and in fairness there was no noise from the elevator during our 5 night stay, The room was spotlessly clean and well appointed with a large flat screen TV, plus kitchenette.  We could have done with a few more hangers bearing in mind the length of our stay (why have a large wardrobe, but only enough hangers for 50% of the space?) but we decided to make do with what we had. The room had a very limited view over the rear courtyard, but someone has to have it right?\n\nThe bathroom was also spotless, but felt a little small, the sink area had very little space around it for storing assorted toiletries, so we were constantly moving items from the shelf below to the sink and back again. \n\nOur main gripe with the room was the very noisy air conditioning unit. Although we stayed during a heatwave (96 degrees), the unit was horrendously noisy and often disturbed sleep. The hotel really needs to look into this.\n\nThe roof bar is great....lovely views to Chrysler and Rockefeller Buildings and a good vibe. Slightly expensive, but that's not unexpected in Manhattan.\n\nConcierges were consistently friendly, cheerful and helpful and the main foyer and other public areas are spotlessly clean\n\nwifi charges were a downside....$5+ per day.... wifi is routinely offered free in UK now\n\nWe breakfasted in the adjacent New York Luncheonette diner, and this was both convenient and excellent value for money with a wide range of choice. Plenty of bars on 47th street within walking distance. Subway was one block north, to travel up and downtown; 3 blocks further enabled crosstown connections - all very convenient.\n\nAs mentioned above, we were to be married on July 3rd, and we were overjoyed when we got back to our room that evening to receive a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries from the management; a lovely gesture that was very much appreciated.\n\nWe enjoyed our stay, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a value hotel in Midtown, but I can't help but think that the rough edges in the hotel did start to add up, mitigated only in part by the lovely wedding day gesture.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Never have I seen so many helpful and cheerful staff in one hotel.  From the doormen, to the front desk to concierge.

Our room was clean, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was HUGE with L'Occitane products. We ate at both restaurants, which were delicious. We will stay again.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Upgraded by front desk to a duplex without even asking.  Good central location.  Room very nice with comfortable beds.  Only negatives that keep it from being a 5 star were the street noise (probably universal in NYC) and that housekeeping did not clean our room one day.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Do not let the combination of a seemingly good deal and good location lure you into the bate and switch we are experiencing. \n\nReservations lied about room I prepaid for, stuck us and our kids in townhouse side of building after guaranteeing they wouldn\u2019t. This after having NO room for us whatsoever at check-in time. Front desk people barely cared, offered to split up my family into different rooms, maybe find a new room for us  tomorrow, or maybe charge me less. Hardly useful concessions for tired family of 5 fresh off long a flight just wanting the quality room they paid for and were promised. \n\nWith no other option that wouldn\u2019t blow up our tight schedule, we took the townhouse room and deeply regret it. Nothing is as promised. Our room is a really loud, wonky, apparently renovated old apartment looking out filthy windows at the adjacent filthy building and HVAC machinery. \n\nDon\u2019t stay here. You\u2019ve been warned.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The suites are relatively reasonable and roomy. And the midtown location very convenient. The only negative for us was the a\/c was hinky and in July that can be a problem. That is the only reason I\u2019m not giving it a perfect score. But the staff was very friendly and addressed our concerns swiftly.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Servizio ai limiti del 5 stelle, camera con due letti queen non enorme ma sufficiente, Bagno piccolo ma pulitissimo, servizio ineccepibile e molto friendly. Hotel veramente di categoria superiore. Se acquistato con un\u2019offerta diviene un must. Per alcune riviste uno tra i primi 100 alberghi al mondo.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}
