It was a relaxing and quiet oasis in the midst of NYC madness. We had a king room on the 9th floor and the traffic noise was bearable overnight. The windows could use proper curtains as the light comes round the edges on the blinds but in March this wasn\u2019t a problem for us. The Bookmark lounge was a nice space to relax in and the coffee was great. The snacks were ok but not much variety. Protein bars and fruit were the only choices but you could buy out and bring bagels back in as some people did. \nThe proximity to all the sights of the city was key. We could pop out for a walk or for dinner and we used the buses to travel any further. Central Park is a good 30 minute walk away but 5 minutes takes you to Grand Central Station (Shakeshack burgers are awesome here) so plenty of choices to walk or not to.\nThe only downside was the price of drinks in the rooftop bar. We like a glass of wine after dinner but ( as everywhere in NYC) the cost is astronomical so we never used the bar and it\u2019s such a shame as it looked beautiful. \nOverall we would definitely recommend the Library and the staff were really nice and helpful.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Overall, our stay was pleasant but there is definitely room for improvement - especially at this price point. \n\nUnfortunately like so many buildings in New York, The Library is covered in scaffolding, so it\u2019s not possible to see how truly beautiful it is. But its location in midtown New York and  right next to Grand Central Station is pretty much perfect, and well served by subway connections. \n\nAfter around 18 hours of Transatlantic travel, check in was efficient if not overly welcoming. Weary after our travels, it would have been nice to have been offered assistance with our cases to our 7th floor room, but we were left to our own devices without so much as an offer of help, as we were when three of us checked out with two cases each.\n\nOur bedroom was pleasant enough with plenty of space for storage and a comfortable bed, but the bathroom was extremely small, in need of updating, with a rather sad shower over a very shallow bathtub. Strangely, taking up even more space in a small bathroom, was a tired, rusty and completely unnecessary stool. \n\nThe second floor Reading Room was useful to grab a coffee and a snack, but otherwise, completely underutilised. We\u2019ve read in earlier reviews that this used to be used for breakfast and for a nightly happy hour - neither of which are part of the current offer. Every mention of these on TripAdvisor has been countered by hotel management for reasons around post-COVID business remodelling, and that they were no longer sustainable. At the prices the hotel charges, I am somewhat doubtful that these excuses still hold water. Even a nominal charge to cover either would make for a much improved experience. Certainly, the current meagre offerings hardly justify a $25 daily \u201cResort Fee\u201d.\n\nSure, breakfast is available at the hotel\u2019s neighbouring restaurant, but for around $33 for an orange juice that wasn\u2019t fresh, a cup of tea that wouldn\u2019t fill half of my tea mug at home and some berries and granola, this hardly represents good value for money. As a result, we chose better and cheaper local options every day.\n\nConversely, the rooftop bar was a pleasant space to spend a couple of hours, and the staff were friendly and helpful. \n\nSo, sadly, I doubt we\u2019ll return. There are other options available in similar price bands which offer much, much more in terms of welcome, facilities and overall hospitality. Never at The Library did we feel like welcome guests (paying a considerable amount of money for our stay).\n\nI imagine this review will be met with the typical responses by the hotel management, rather than seeing it as constructive criticism and a genuine opportunity to improve.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We got a great rate booking direct for two rooms and they made sure we were side by side (was a little bit disappointed not to be upgraded to co-joined rooms as we were staying for 10 nights). The good things - the location is amazing, the staff lovely and the rooms are quiet and a good size by NY standards. The hotel is looking a bit dated and tired, and the beds were not great. Bathrooms are OK - most newer hotels ditch the silly shower over bath arrangement now though. No exhaust fan (a gripe for most USA hotels - bizarre, must ruin their bathrooms). The library rooms and the small selection of included snacks and drinks was lovely. There is a restaurant on site but only average - we usually walked up to Jo and the Juice for a better option. They were good about accepting some small packages (had another hotel charge me to do so - what the actual?). Rooms were too warm - and staff advised only option to cool them was to turn off aircon all together (and open a window which we did).\n\nSome extra NY tips - make sure you get the 7 day subway pass not just a 10 trip one (live and learn, not easy to navigate purchasing options on machines and not many staff to help - I travel a lot and use public transport a lot, NY could improve this). We used the free NY greeter service - lovely older lady showed us around for about 5 hours - great service for getting comfortable with directions on the first day (we just paid for her lunch). Winners for our teenagers were: natural history museum, Harry Potter on Broadway, eating at lots of cool restaurants, the Library and the High Line walk.

I\u2019m writing this from the 2nd room library, enjoying some coffee and a snack whilst admiring the amalgamation of various midtown architecture, in a quiet reprieve. We asked this time for a higher room, and they gave us the highest non-penthouse floor (12). We also enjoyed the 14th floor Bookmarks bar for late night drinks, also taking advantage of the free cheese board for guests which was a nice touch. The staff here is quite friendly, also not the norm for the city after my several years of coming up here. Connected to Madison and Vine, you can also get nice drinks there most of the day. It\u2019s a short 10-15 minute walk from the heart of Times Square, 20 mins from the Theatre District, and also close to Zucker\u2019s on Lex which is always a staple for us insofar as a bagel breakfast is concerned. If I had to pick some negligible thing I wish were rectified, and this isn\u2019t major, it\u2019s that their agreement with a local gym (as the hotel doesn\u2019t have one), is always closed on Sunday which is a bummer, particularly for weekend guests. The agreement is apparently for only one Blink fitness as alas, the other one we called didn\u2019t have an agreement. Again, not a major problem of course, though working off some of the tasty city food would have been a pleasant option, particularly as there is a $25 resort fee per night to my knowledge. \n\nAll that to say, we thoroughly enjoyed the property as usual, and as people who are loyal, repeat customers to establishments we prefer, we\u2019ll likely be back in the late fall\/early winter for our third time.","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I decided to book this hotel for end of year because of its great location and raving Tripadvisor reviews. We travel to NYC often, so we know what to expect from hotels in the city. We were not impressed by the Library Hotel and won't be going back.\n\nThere are positives for the hotel though, the first one being the aforementioned location. If you visit New York during holidays, you want to be in Midtown, close to where it all happens, but not in the middle of it (although we have stayed close to Times Square in some occasions). The area around Bryant Park, which is lovely during holidays, is our favorite.\n\nThe hotel also has a beautiful library theme, which goes well with its location in Library Way, just a few steps from the NYC Library. Every room has a topic and books that go with it. Plus, there is a great common room with lots of books, coffee and refreshments 24\/7.  This is by far the highlight of the hotel, which also has a reasonable rooftop bar (which I am sure is more charming in the summertime).\n\nSo far so good, so, what did we miss?\n\nFirst off, we missed the quality of service we would expect for a hotel where we paid over $500 a night. The service was so non-existent that they didn't even help us in with our luggage when they saw we were struggling with our suitcases as we were coming back from a long international flight. They didn't help us on our way out either. Overall, it felt like the service was minimal and very impersonal.\n\nSecondly, the rooms, and the hotel as a whole, are pretty dated. Everything, from the bathroom installations to the TV or the elevators are what you would expect from a decades old hotel that has not been renovated at all. But, it is not that charming-old that we have seen in other hotels in NY. It is just plain old. I get that the library theme goes well with \"old\", but this is a bit of a stretch.\n\nAgain, not a horrible experience, but you can definitely do better for that price range in the city by either going to a more modern hotel or a classic but charming one.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Most to note is the cleanliness.  The hotel used to be one of the cleanest we've stayed at in NY but it is no longer.  Old tattered carpet, that wasn't vacuumed and is past the prime of shampooing, unknown mess on the lampshades  the bathroom needs a DEEP clean, remove the old leather bathroom stool--it's filthy and unsanitary, the mirror that comes out the wall is disgusting. the carpet is coming up along the wall.

However, the front desk staff made a real effort to try to find me a room and I was able to check in and enjoy the day in NY. I had a queen (second size up) on the 10th floor and it was very comfortable. The second-floor reading room was also an excellent facility for coffee and all-day snacks. The restaurant works well for casual food and drinks. It would be hard to improve on The Library and this has now become my favourite hotel in NYC. ","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

The best part of the hotel was location!!! 5 min walk to Grand Central station where you can catch the subway or train to pretty much anywhere in Manhattan and all the boroughs of NYC. We also walked a ton - 30 min to Central Park, 30 min to Hudson Yards, 8 min to Bryant Park, 10 to Times Square\/Broadway shows etc.. It really is perfect for Midtown and also a little bit quieter since it\u2019s off Madison and not 5th or Broadway. \n\nThe hotel is nicely done. We stated in a Deluxe King room. For NYC hotel rooms, pretty spacious. Bed super comfortable, nice sheets, good desk area, a safe, and a decent size mini fridge which was stocked with water each day. The TV is pretty small and limited channels, but we didn\u2019t watch it much anyway. There are darkening shades too to keep it dark to sleep if you need. Nicely decorated with books for the theme of your room. The bathroom has nice products to use, but the towels are super scratchy and rough. Not sure if they are just old or cheap, but that could be improved. As well as the shower curtain for the shower\/tub. It was too short so hard to keep in the tub when showering and not have water all over the floor. You definitely hear street noise, but that is NYC!\n\nThere is a restaurant in hotel, Madison and Vine, that will provide room service and also has breakfast, lunch and dinner. We only did breakfast there one day and it was good. There is a cute rooftop bar on the 14th floor that from 2pm on serves drinks and if you order 2 drinks, a free nice cheese plater. Small, but quaint little area. The 2nd floor has all day access to coffee, tea, sodas, water, fruit and a few other things. We were here when it was in the 90s with humidity so HOT so we loved being able to grab as much water as we needed. \n\nOverall would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again. Only other mention was one night we got back at like 1 am and there is no doorman or lock or key access to walk in the hotel; felt a little unsafe, but there were no issues. There was someone at desk so they would see, but seemed kind of easy for someone to just walk in and go right up the elevator no matter who they were! Staff very nice and the concept of the hotel makes it feel boutique and personal versus some high rise big chain hotel.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was traveling with my adult daughter.  Finding rooms with two beds in Manhattan is extremely difficult and we also needed to be a short distance from Grand Central Station, coming in on the Metro North line and daughter departing the same way.  Room was billed as a \"junior suite\" with a rollaway bed in a sofa.  I expected a second room with the sofa, silly me. The extra space was a niche the size of a wide closet, perhaps 4 feet deep.  \n\nOh well.  The design conceit is fun:  every room has a selection of books, a different theme of books to every room.  The selection in our room would have been worth browsing\/reading if we weren't running non-stop.  The irony is that the hotel is about a block from the NY Public Library, which we could see down the 41st St. from our room.\n\nA bit of a walk to the theatre district but tolerable, a trade-off we made for the proximity to Grand Central.  A short walk to the Bryant Park and Times Square\/42nd St. subway stations, which we took advantage of.\n\nI didn't discover the second floor lounge until the last day, when I went to print out my boarding pass.   Comfy room, filled with books, offering water, sodas, light snacks.\n\nMy biggest annoyance:   we were told up check-in that the Bookmarks Lounge, a rooftop area, offered a cheese board if you ordered two drinks, soft drinks included.   We went up there after theatre and discovered that the kitchen closes at 10pm, making it absolutely useless as a post-theatre place.  When I went to down to note a complaint, I heard the lounge being mentioned to another couple checking in, with no mention of the 10pm cut-off.  When I complained, I was told that we were told about the hours upon  check-in.  I denied this and pointed out that the couple who had just checked in hadn't been told either.  My only ding on the staff, which otherwise were quite pleasant and helpful.   \n\nRoom service is via the Madison & Vine restaurant in the same building, right off the hotel lobby.  Alas, it closes at 11pm so, again, if you want something post-theatre, make other plans.  Even the Algonquin closes earlier than I would like though I could get a drink and a dessert if I didn't dally.\n\nI'll strongly think about reserving at The Library Collection again whenever I'm in the City.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

But it wasn\u2019t the same as before. We got the impression they were trying to claw back whatever losses they made over the pandemic. When we arrived there was initially no one to help us with our bags. On checking in even though we had pre booked with a credit card they took another swipe. It turned out that this reserved amount, over $3,000 stayed on our credit card for 30 days long after we had paid the bill for a similar amount in full. Despite e mailing the hotel twice the reserved amount stayed on my credit card account effectively reducing my available credit. The rooms were fine and the hotel was well located. But the service and value which previously made the hotel special were gone. We were a party of 6, my wife and I, my son and daughter in law and their two kids aged 7 &9. When we booked they told us two rooms would meet our needs with two children being able to sleep on a pull out bed (a sofa bed). However the hotel described the pull out as only sufficient for one child. As a result we were persuaded to book an additional room which we subsequently didn\u2019t use as the pull out bed comfortably catered for the two kids. Despite requesting a refund or even a reduction for the unnecessary room the hotel wouldn\u2019t entertain the idea.\nPreviously the hotel provided an excellent complimentary continental breakfast in the library room, although they still offer tea\/coffee, fruit and snacks a breakfast is now provided in the Madison and Vine restaurant. I would strongly recommend hotel guests eat elsewhere as the standard of service and value for money at this restaurant was very poor. We struggled to get the staff to serve us even though it was not busy. The portions were small and the tea and coffee required several refills as the cups were small with each refill charged for. We ate the next morning at the Brooklyn diner which although having a reputation of being expensive was around the same price but with significantly better food and larger portions. In summary we won\u2019t be back as the Library Hotel we knew now only exists in our memories and there is better service and better value elsewhere in New York","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

(Before during and after). They arranged a chauffeur service to and from the airport which was comfortable. As it was our anniversary, they had arranged for a chilled bottle of wine in our room upon arrival, with a cute card attached. We appreciated this gesture. \n\nThe hotel is in a good looking building, it\u2019s not to tall and there are few rooms. This leads to a relaxed feeling as it\u2019s not bustling with people and there was never any noise between rooms.\n\nLocation is super central, one block from Grand Central and you should be able to see New York Public Library out most windows. Follow the lovely New York Library   way going there as it is on the steps of the hotel entrance.  Bryant park lies behind the library and has loads of free and fun activities. The Morgan Library is also very close by. \n\nThe room we had (delux) was a bit dated, but larger than we expected from the pictures. Room was clean and the wardrobe big. (Please note we are not American so our view on size might differ). Robes and slippers were included. The toiletries did not smell super masculine, which is a plus. \n\nThere is a nice room you can grab some snacks and drinks from 24\/7. This is handy, but in our opinion the selection was disappointing and most people will need to go out to grab breakfast elsewhere. There is a restaurant on the fist floor of the hotel but would not recommended this as service is bad and prices step. Much better and cheaper options right by. \n\nThere is a cute rooftop bar called bookmark.

Also, while the staff is warm and welcoming, the housekeeping quality is inconsistent (forgot to replenish toiletries and didn't wipe down mirrors). \n\nAside from the room, we enjoyed the 24HR lounge (clean, cozy, and well-stocked) and the rooftop bar (Bookmarks), where the drinks are good (highly recommend Gone with the Gin) and hotel guests get a complimentary cheese plate. Overall it's a good bang for your buck and a very positive boutique hotel experience! ","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We stayed for five nights. It's 3-4 blocks east of Times Square so you can avoid those crowds if you want to. It's half a block from Grand Central Station so you can get anywhere in the city easily.\nThe staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The 2nd floor club room is spacious\/comfortable and well stocked with drinks and snacks. They serve good coffee instead of the garbage you get at most hotels. They have a full bar on the 14th floor named  Bookmarks that has excellent cocktails and we never had any difficulty finding seating. \nThe rooms are extremely comfy and they did an excellent job of putting lots of storage space in. Think good size closet and plenty of drawers so you can actually unpack. The bathroom has plenty of space of and the hot water is immediate and it has strong water pressure. This is not a huge hotel which means that you won't find yourself waiting 10 minutes for the elevator, and yes, that is a common problem in many NYC hotels. They also have an extremely convenient luggage storage system in place after you check out and you still have access to the 2nd floor club room that day. As a result, even though our flight home was at 7:30PM, we were able to fully enjoy our last day in the city. This hotel understands that just because you have to be out of your room, it doesn't mean your trip has to end that minute.\nThis is absolutely going to be my primary hotel in Manhattan going forward. With their combination of location, service, and comfort I have nothing bad to say about it. Five stars in every category.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

While the hotel offers no breakfast we did find fruits and granola type bars and a variety of teas and coffees in the snack lounge.  A breakfast would have been nicer but since the pandemic many places have discontinued that.  There is a great place across the street called Essen where you can get hot breakfasts to go and lunches and fruits and snacks and it is super fresh and they are so accommodating and helpful.  We did that and ate in the snack lounge on the second floor.  The bathroom was clean and had a tub\/shower combo and we had counter space by the sink and a long glass shelf for our toiletries plus a glass ledge behind the door for our flat iron and hair products....plenty of room.  We had a super large desk in the room to eat on or put makeup on and a small but adequate tv.  The one glaring negative was the bed.....the worst and most uncomfortable bed.  The bed was extremely sunken in and was like both of us were sleeping in a hole....it was obvious the springs were shot on it.  The one biggest positive is the extremely helpful attitude of all the staff - they will do virtually anything to accommodate you and make your stay a pleasant one.  For example - this neighborhood is in the business district and as such it is very crowded mornings and late afternoons as people get to and leave work.  It is impossible to get a taxi on your own and the apps are sketchy.   If you go to the main desk they will get a cab for you within a few minutes and if they are not busy they will run outside and flag down the cab and open the door for you.   We cannot speak highly enough about the entire staff.  Due to the horrible, extremely uncomfortable bed we cannot give the hotel five stars but rather only four.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This was to be our first visit since he passed, and we decided to branch out a bit.  After perusing hotels online for quite a while, we decided on the Library Hotel - loved the theme of the books.\n\nI arrived on a Wednesday - entered a lobby full of books - and went to check in.  (Admittedly had trouble getting in the two doors - no doorman around.) The staff was particularly friendly and accommodating - not something I'm used to in NYC.  We all wanted a little more room -- so we booked two Junior Suites -- a bit higher priced -- but with a fabulous view of the NY Public Library - lots of space - and a lot of light.  The bathroom was larger than most I've encountered in the city.  The bed was super comfortable - my aching back appreciated it - and the room had a sitting area that was inviting.  I was in the Fashion Design room -- and had a blast looking primarily at the picture books!\n\nMy son arrived with his girlfriend on Thursday.  They were given the Astronomy room - another suite, virtual duplicate of mine, with the same views and light.\n\nThe Madison & Vine restaurant downstairs serves a decent breakfast, lunch, and dinner -- I think we had at least one of each meal.  The convenience of an eatery in the building was much appreciated.\n\nThe 2nd floor reading room was available 24 hours, with water, coffee, fruit and snacks.  Available to all.\n\nWe went to Bookmarks, the rooftop bar, on two occasions -- I loved the \"Gone with the Gin\" cocktail, my son preferred the 'Gatsby' and his girlfriend tried a bunch of different things.  I was told that if you're staying in the hotel (Bookmarks gets a lot of business that is not staying there) - you receive a complimentary cheese tray if you order two drinks.  We were thrilled with the quality of the cheese tray.\n\nEvery employee with whom we engaged  was friendly and helpful.  \n\nWe loved the location, easy walk to theater district, and to many other sites.  FYI, it's well worth it to sign up for the free tour of the Library!\n\nWhen, in the morning,  we reported a problem with a slow draining tub -- voila - it was fixed.\n\nWe will definitely be back -- IF they have room!  It's a small hotel and my son tried to book a return trip in October -- alas, no availability.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

There were some noticeable changes on this occasion , largely due to the Covid situation.

If there was a disappointment , it was the offer of breakfast and evening canap\u00e9s & fizz,  which is the foundation of the Library Hotel Group offering. I thought breakfast boxes could have been delivered to room in replacement of the full offering in the reading room. Discounts could have been offered for breakfast and dinner at Madison & Vine to counter the closure of the morning and evening fizz by the hotel , maybe even put 1 bottle of fizz in room as a gesture as the wine & cheese offering was stopped. Maybe even a discount in the rooftop bar for residents that paid for the benefits , but we're not able to have them. This will not stop me staying in the future when I hope things are better for the hotel and staff. The room we were upgraded to was wonderful , the views splendid , but as I said earlier the ethos of the Library Hotel Group was those additional touches which were reflected in the price.

Overall, we were disappointed by the carry-through of the overall theme. While our room had plenty of books to choose from, we felt the Reader's Lounge could use some more book options. The website boasts over 6,000 books in the hotel, and we found that what hotel guests truly have access to, is a bit more limited than that. The refreshments were quite lovely however, and well appreciated. We absolutely adored the Bookmarks Lounge, the drinks were delicious, as well as the complimentary cheese board. We were not overly thrilled with Madison & Vine however. They claimed that Sunday evenings & Monday mornings were times that they suffered food shortages. For example, Sunday we were given one out of four options for dessert. Monday morning, anything with mixed berries, became blueberries. Also, we were given the impression that we had paid for 2 vochers for a breakfast buffet, only to be informed that this was discontinued by the restaurant some time ago. (We figure due to Covid-19). Someone may want to update this in your system to prevent future confusion and disappointment. While our meals were enjoyable, they were nothing to write home about.

This was our first stay at the Library Hotel, having stayed in different places in Manhattan during our other visits.  The location is quite central to just about anything you wish to do; you're a block from Grand Central which means you can easily connect to the subway headed downtown to the Village, Soho, and on into Brooklyn.  You can take the same lines uptown to the Bronx or to Museum Mile.  You can also take the shuttle to Times Square.  \n\nThe hotel is relatively small and that's a great thing.  I'm a big fan of small boutique hotels, and this is one of the best ones we've ever stayed in.  The service is very warm and friendly from the moment you enter.  Every one we interacted with was professional, friendly, and genuinely interested in making our stay as pleasant as possible.\n\nFor a book fiend, this place is awesome.  Books everywhere.  Each floor is devoted to a subject area and each room devoted to a subject within the floor area.  For instance, the Arts floor had rooms devoted to music, photography, etc.  The room will have numerous books based upon the name of the room.  On the second floor is a lounge area where you can serve yourself some coffee, tea, or soft drinks.  Lots of books in that room, also!  Every evening when we'd return from dinner we'd hit the lounge for some tea to wind down for the night.  The rooftop lounge is fabulous; great view of Madison Avenue.\n\nWe had a wonderful stay here, and we look forward to returning to NYC and staying here once again.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Even before the trip, the booking team went out of their way to answer any questions and try to fulfill some requests (requested certain themes as a choice of rooms). I also let them know it was our anniversary. Not only did they remember and grant my first choice of room (mysteries!) but we also arrived to a lovely card from the staff and a bottle of wine on ice. \n\nThe room (a suite) was super large, very clean, had amazing views of Madison Avenue and the 5th Avenue library (all suites do since they are all along the same side of the building) and was beautifully appointed. The room was mystery themed so all of the books were mysteries and the art was mystery themed as well. The bed was super comfy, the air conditioning was great, and the bathroom was lovely. I was surprised at the low level of noise we experienced despite our corner room facing Madison Avenue.\n\nThe staff was lovely and despite covid taking away their normally complimentary breakfast (this was back in August of 2021), there were two spaces in the hotel for guests that were great. The rooftop is absolutely gorgeous and you can enjoy a drink inside or outside (they gave us a certificate for a complimentary cheese plate with the purchase of one of the rooftop lounge's library themed drinks). There is also a lovely library lounge full of books, with a piano, and an endless supply of water, snacks, fruit, as well as a coffee machine which made espresso drinks (cappuccino, espresso, latte, etc) which is available for guests 24\/7 which is awesome. \n\nMy only gripe would be that the bathtub was very slow to drain (like 20 minutes to drain fully from full) but honestly, that is to be expected since the building is historic and the pipes are probably old like most older buildings in NYC. But really, this was all inconsequential because the pros made up for this one very minor con.\n\nIt's a splurge, the suite there, but so entirely worth it.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Firstly, it is a \"Boutique Hotel\" with the warm and cosy ambience this title implies (and with very comfortable beds, too.).Then the location is ideal, especially for the first-time NYC visitor! The charming Bryant Park, featuring the Bryant Park Grill at which we dined almost daily, is just a block or two away with the beautiful NYC Library on the same block as the park and the historical Grand Central Station down the street from it. Also, from the Library Hotel's inviting little patio enclaves are majestic views of the Empire State Building and the beautiful Chrysler Building both of which are close walking distance. As an added bonus, adjacent to the hotel is the delightful Madison and Vine restaurant for easy, delicious and relaxing dining. Rob, the hotel manager, handled us with kindness and grace and the other hotel personnel were all professional, kind and helpful. I might add that during our NYC visit we stayed at two other hotels, the Refinery Hotel, which was a huge disappointment for us and that I recommend for the young only with their very popular though extremely loud, crowded rooftop bar also showcasing amazing views. And the other one being the high-quality, beautiful and equally comfortable to Library Hotel though very expensive in comparison, ! Hotel Central Park, in which we had a wondrous park view. My husband and I were most satisfied and content with the quaint and cozy Library Hotel and will be returning to NYC sooner rather than later because of this wonderful find!

The rates are usually pretty high, so we weren't able to check it out until recently, when we spotted a rate we could manage for a few nights.  \n\nWe enjoyed our stay at this well-located hotel with lovely public spaces (a well furnished 2nd floor lounge as well as a rooftop terrace) and thoughtful amenities (the lounge is stocked with bottled water, soft drinks, an espresso machine, snacks, etc), covered by a nightly fee in addition to the room rate (not called a resort fee, but similar).  \n\nOur room was mythology-themed, which was quirky and pleasant, and we had a swell view of the Public Library.  The room was not otherwise too special.  The TV options were limited, but we took advantage of the hotel's DVD library and watched a movie. Staff were friendly, though not always too knowledgeable (we arrived late, after the hotel bar had closed--when I asked if there were a bar nearby that would be open, I was told no--not in midtown.  This was false.  Google found me a few open bars within blocks, including a really lovely one on the next street).  \n\nThe bar upstairs--when open--is a great destination also--terrific views and atmosphere.\n\nBecause of COVID, room cleaning service was only by request; we did request service once and it was well done.  \n\nWe are really glad we had the opportunity to check this place out.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Reopening post-pandemic gave the opportunity but the stay was disappointing because of poor sleep quality.\nOn reservation I did request a quiet room, which was accommodated by housing us on a high floor.  Unfortunately this is a very narrow building and all of the rooms are street-facing, and the height was no match for trucks backing up, stupid loud motorcycle revving, etc. on a Saturday night.\nEar plugs of course worked for that but the mattress here was another challenge to contend with.  I am picky when it comes to mattresses, but even on mattresses I don\u2019t like I can generally sleep. The Library mattress was in a class by itself and I never achieved a comfortable position over two very long nights.

Inside this pocket of tranquility and hospitality, up you go to your room - mine was on the 11th floor - to discover the perfect nest to perch within for your trip to the city.    Filled with books (my room theme was Paranormal), high-end toiletries, pillows, and bathrobes, it's tempting to stay inside instead of exploring the magic of the city! Add to that DVDs to be checked out in the lobby, a Reading Room filled with snacks, fruits, hot and cold beverages, and best yet, a rooftop lounge for a private perch in the daytime, only to be transformed to a cocktail lounge, Bookmarks, at 4pm for literary cocktails and charcuterie boards.   Ah ... you've arrived!\n\nCovid protocols being what they are, the daily wine and cheese reception is not running nor is daily housekeeping (by request only), but the hotel is making up for that by offering 20% off daily rates and a very generous cancellation policy.\n\nTake advantage of this chance to experience The Library Hotel, on Library Way no less, just off Madison Avenue,one block from the NYC Public Library, beautiful Bryant Park, and Grand Central Station.  Because that's what this boutique hotel offers you - an experience - not just a place to stay.  \n\nSpecial mention to Billy, who made me feel welcomed from the moment I arrived.

Each room is a bibliophile's delight, well stocked with dozens of books for reading during your stay.  My wife counted 94 in the bookcases of our room, 905.  That number is significant because in the Dewey Decimal System the low 900s is the Geography section.  And sure enough, books on travel abounded, featuring classics like Mark Twain's \"Life On The Mississippi\", Paul Theroux's \"The Great Railway Bazaar\", Frances Mayes' \"Under The Tuscan Sun\" and Christopher Wren's delightful \"The Cat That Covered The World.\"\n\nIf geography is not to your taste, try the varied collection in the spacious, comfortable 14th Floor lounge.

Our wedding had 25 guests and was the most wonderful intimate wedding on their enclosed rooftop 14th floor area. The Poetry Garden was the perfect ceremony location with beautiful outdoor views and gorgeous lighting, while the Writer's Den was wonderful for our reception, right on the same floor with a long single table set up, enough room to dance, and was a beautiful space to begin with so we didn't need to do much to decorate. Margo was a dream to work with, always communicative and so helpful on the day of. No need to hire a DOC here -- Margo went above and beyond to help us set up, handle delivery with vendors, pass on our tips, coordinate our music timing, etc. The waitstaff and bar team were absolutely amazing, and the lead bartender was very knowledgeable, friendly and approachable. The rooms at the hotel were gorgeous and the staff left us presents in the form of chocolate and champagne on our wedding day. The outdoor patio was available for us to take pictures in the middle of the winter while it was snowing and you can see the New York Public Library from there. I highly recommend this space for anyone looking for an intimate wedding venue with catering and bar provided in-house. We visited a few other venues and none compared.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Duke was awesome. Our Love room was clean & nicely decorated according to the theme. It was quaint, yet larger than expected. We even had a balcony facing Madison and the public library. 2nd floor serves breakfast, snacks & drinks throughout the day and wine & cheese in the evening. All included in your hotel costs.

It is no surprise that all the reviews are so good and so positive, from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave the experience is fabulous. All the staff are lovely and so helpful. Special mention of Duke who is an absolute star and made our holiday! We were celebrating our marriage after fifteen years together and booked The Love Room, the only room with its own balcony with stunning views across to the Library and down Madison Avenue. A celebratory bottle of bubbles was waiting for us on arrival and a lovely card such a kind thought. The room is lovely and the bed super comfy with great linens. En-Suite well appointed but a little cold underfloor heating would have solved this problem. The Cheese & Wine and Breakfast options are great and the availability of drinks and snacks throughout the day is a great plus too. The only tiny criticism is that our room was ready for a bit of re-decoration, one of the blinds was badly frayed at the edges and needed replacing.

The breakfasts and the cheese\/wine are not to be missed.  Great way to start the day and wind down at the end of a busy day. Wonderfully themed to books and the NYC Library just up the street. The rooms [we had 2] were very small.  You could sit in the bed, watch a very small tv, read but there was really no place to sit other than a desk chair.  The location was great and people were nice.  Would I stay there again?  No.  I would go to a hotel with more room space.  It's okay for a weekend, but for a week?  Too little space...even if you are out all day touring about. People are nice but we had very little interaction with anyone all week.  Clean, convenient, and nice amenities with the breakfast and the wine\/cheese evenings.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

But I just don't get why this hotel is SO popular.It has very nice rooms are that comfortable, at least the ones I stayed in. They're stylish although a bit dark with the with the wooden book cases and cupboards. Strangely, the back of the entry door ( the side facing inside the room) is quite ugly. It's not really so much industrial chic but institutional looking and clashes with the rest of the decor. My main concern, though, is the noise. I'm not talking about street noise because this is New York and that's a given. I'm talking about the loud air conditioning and heating equipment and the noise of the plumbing when used by those in rooms above or beside. It's quite dramatic and it was an issue both times I stayed. It's an older building that's been resigned but I had to wear earplugs to sleep. No big deal but at a fairly pricey hotel that's always a disappointment. The location is amazing - steps from Grand Central Terminal. I'd like to stay there again but doubt that I will due to all the noise in the buildings mechanics!","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Le petit-d\u00e9jeuner sucr\u00e9 est servi de 7 heures \u00e0 10 heures 30 dans the Reading Room , ce qui est pratique pour visiter.

The hotel is lovely in an older building it\u2019s on the corner of Madison & Library way. Every room has a theme and is filled with books to match. We booked The Love Room, the only room with a small flowered terrace with a breathtaking view along Madison Ave. It\u2019s the best room in the house and we stayed 6 nights.\n\nThe room was of a decent size with ample space for a NY hotel we stored two suitcases with no difficulty. The bed was sublime the pillows excellent. There was really no street noise so I\u2019m guessing the windows are double glazed. The bathroom had a bath with overhang shower, which I find a bit slippery to get in and out of. A small but adequate bathroom which included the toilet. Had the usual toiletries. Everything was very clean housekeeping did an excellent job. There is a room safe and plenty of hangers.\n\nLocation is everything and this location is first class. There is a continental breakfast and wine and cheese every night included in a $25 daily resort fee, this used to be included in the room rate and the Library Hotel is definitely NOT a resort there is NO pool. It\u2019s a shame they have added this daily \u201cresort fee\u201d to the tariff its a bit of a rip off.\n\nMy only complaint would be the room service food from Madison & Vine the restaurant attached but not owned, to the hotel. This food is cafeteria standard at best. Plus the blinds in the room are tatty and need replacing.\n\nThere is a roof top bar and the hotel staff are exceptional. Plus there is 24 hours, tea, coffee, fruit and pastries and a heap of books. They have extras like a foot of books which I got, mugs, flowers, chocolates and champagne.\n\nBook the Love room it\u2019s divine.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel website was clear and transparent about the size of the petite room, so I went in expecting a closet. While the room was small, it was cleverly designed with windows, shelves, lights, mirrors and glass to make the space not feel like a closet. \n\nThat being said, it would still be very crowded for two people, tall people, large people, or people with a lot of luggage. I am 5' 4\", and lying on my stomach, my toes were at the end of the bed. There was one small counter that fit my airline carry-on roller bag. That is all the luggage you can fit. If you bring a larger bag, your only option will be to open it on the bed, and then you will have to close it back up at night to put it upright on the floor so you can use the bed. The hotel tries to be clear about the room size on the website, but I'm trying to be a little more blunt about it. If there are two of you, if you are tall, if you are large, or if you come with a big bag or bags, you won't fit in the room.\n\nThe bathrooms were small, but very nice. Great hot water. TV small, as others have noted, but I did not use the TV. No problems with WIFI. Breakfast and wine\/cheese were great! Of course not like gourmet dining, but awesome that they are provided, and included in the resort fee. I definitely got my $25 resort fee worth of breakfast, water, juice and cookies throughout the day. \n\nThe BIG ding on this place - the elevators. There are only two small, slow elevators that hold a maximum of 7 people (without bags) servicing 14 floors. At check-in at 3pm, there is a long line of people with bags waiting to use the elevators. That can be understandable. But at 5-7 pm, there is a long line of people waiting to use the elevators to go to the roof top bar. The area immediately in front of the two elevators is very small, and I do not appreciate being a paying, staying guest, but having to wait outside in record heat to be able to access the lobby, the elevators and\/or the stairs (I was on the 4th floor, and more than good with using the stairs, but the stairs were even hard to reach during peak times) because people on dates are crowding in front of the elevators to get to the bar. I don't know how you remedy that, but maybe have the doorman or someone trying to do some kind of triage to get staying guests priority access to the elevators? I almost went for only a 3 star rating just because of the elevators, but really loved everything else, so went with 4 stars.\n\nAs noted by others, staff were great.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Being in NYC, hotel rooms are characteristically on the smaller size and come at a price.  The hotel itself is a narrow building typical in NYC, so every room has the same street view, and there is no advantage in being higher.  We were located on the fourth floor and regularly took to the stairs for a bit of opportunistic exercise.  (If you do this you will see some clever artistic wall decoration at the lower levels.)\n\nThe hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly, and eager to do their best in the circumstances.  They were genuine in their efforts to make our stay as pleasant as possible.\n\nThe hotel has some nice innovations - most notably the second floor which was set up as a pleasant space for refreshments and to gather yourself before moving on to the next activity.  This room served as the breakfast venue (continental style - very good) and as a place where you could get yourself simple refreshments at any time of the day (including fruit - how good is that!)  There was also complimentary drinks in the evening, which was also a nice touch.\n\nThe room itself had a comfortable bed and all the normal amenities one expects.  It does of course have books in the room as a themed touch - which provides a curiousity if you have some moments to yourself.\n\nOverall I thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good clean room in NYC.  Being near Grand Central Station it is well located mid-town and within easy access to most NYC amenities.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's a smallish hotel 1 block from NYPl. The location is fantastic. Close to times square, 5th ave, theaters, shopping, Bryant park etc. I think we were there during a quiet time, I can see the elevator being slow when full.\nOur room was clean and comfortable,  but really small. I've probably stayed in 20 different NYC hotels,  I think it would rate in top 5 smallest. The bed especially,  it was supposed to be a full size bed, but just barely.  It wasnt a particularly comfortable one either, just ok. Trying to watch Wimbledon on the tiny TV was difficult. Lighting in bathroom was dim. That would be easily remedied if the magnified mirror was lighted.\nPet peeve alert....only 1 hook to hang a towel, and it was a hook that was a nob, looks nice, but towels or anything slip right off.\nNoise level was typical NYC. We were on 11th floor and noise was light background. If you are particular about street noise,  dont stay here. However we found noise from AC to be really annoying. We had to shut it off, but it got hot real fast as this was july.\nNow onto things I loved....\n Free breakfast!! Bread, fruit, cereal, hard boiled eggs. Terrific!!!\nFree happy hour...cheese crackers veggies  wine, prosecco, superb!!\nStaff very friendly , helpful and attentive\nWindows  in rooms open  for fresh  air! I love  that! Good sized fridge in room with complementary water!! Yey!\nAdorable rooftop bar... we loved it there...pricey...of course\nLocation!!! Just cant be beat...and around corner from grand central.\nIf our bed had been sized to fit 2 people, I would bump up to 5 stars","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were here for 4 nights, in an executive room, which was reasonably large with views out onto the street and to the national Library. There's no tea or coffee in the room which at the start my husband ( A tea-aholic) thought was awful, but was actually better. There is a Reading room in the hotel, where breakfast is served, and there is tea, coffee, danishes, biscuits, water etc on tap 24 hours a day, and its a beautiful room to sit down and rest those weary legs as they will be very weary from all the walking that you'll be doing in New York City. \nBreakfast is a continental, but they have boiled eggs and toast as well as the usual fruit danishes cereals and even porridge, but it was super and kept us going to well past lunchtime. \nEvery day from 5-8pm or was it 4 -7pm they have wine and cheese, white wine, red wine, or Prosecco with nuts, biscuits and again danishes, and you can basically drink as much as you like.

The Library is an old hotel with small rooms, but these disadvantages are more than outweighed by its considerable advantages. \n\nThe staff is completely friendly and helpful.  The beds are excellent (which must be small in the small rooms) and the rooms are warm and cozy, with the temperatures easily adjustable.  This is a vertical hotel with 14 floors and six rooms on our 9th floor, which I assume to be representative.  The first floor has reception and the bistro, the second has the pastries (available all day), the continental breakfast and the 5-8 PM wine and cheese event. The top floor has the Bookmarks bar, but we did not check this out.  \n\nThis hotel is very special because of its library theme.  Each room is named after a category in the Dewey Decimal Classification system.  Ours was Oceanography.  Others on our floor are Ancient History, Twentieth Century History, Geography and Travel, Asian History, and Biography.  Our room contains five bookshelves with about 20 books each, in which each book is appropriate for the Oceanography theme.  Making these bookshelves up must be a huge task and then ensuring that they don\u2019t get mixed up another huge task.  This must be a labor of love on the part of the management.  I spot checked a few books and found publication dates mostly in the 1990s.  The bed cover reads \u201cBook Lovers Never Go To Bed Alone\u201d.

This time, I was on the Religions floor, in the German Religions room. I did find a book to pick in, but I got a free novel when I checked in so divided my time between the books I brought and that one.\n\nYou can walk to the New York Public Library, where your room card gets you a discount in their gift shop. The theater district is a healthy walk away as well. \n\nIf I had any complaint (aside from not wanting to leave) is that their address is listed as 299 Madison Avenue but the taxis and the airport shuttle can never find it because  the entrance is on 41st Street!

We were on the 11th floor (Philosophy!) which was far enough up to not be troubled with street noise, we slept soundly as there were no banging doors, noisy guests or elevator noise.. bliss. \n\nThe complimentary breakfast was plentiful, fresh and there was a great variety to enjoy with your complimentary newspaper in the lovely ambience of the Reading Room, overlooking Library Way, with a view of the NY Public Library. You can make use of the Reading Room and enjoy complimentary drinks and snacks 24 hours, as well as prosecco, wine and cheese every evening from 5-8pm. Things like this make the hotel a comfort you look forward to returning to, rather than just a place to sleep.\n\nThere is a business centre with two internet pcs and printer, with free use. The hotel has a very popular restaurant, Madison and Vine and room service is available at a very reasonable cost. There is also a roof terrace, bar and lounge.\n\nThe hotel is in a great location, very close to Grand Central, Bryant Park, Fifth Avenue and the subway all within easy walking distance.\n\nThank you so much to all of the Librarians for making our latest stay in beautiful New York City a memorable one. We will see you again.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Because our room window directly overlooked Madison Ave, there was some traffic noise, but it did not bother us.  We chose this hotel because it was close to Broadway, it is across from the NY Public Library, and close to the Morgan Librayr.  It was about a 10 minute walk to Times Square.

The hotel is conveniently located in mid-town and easily accessible to the subway, the bus lines, and walking paths.  The hotel is small, elegant, and immensely comfortable.  Our room (deluxe king) was plenty big for the two of us, and the bed was so comfortable!  The room and the bathroom were spotlessly clean, and the room smelled fresh and inviting.  Having worked in libraries most of my life, I loved the theme.  We spent a great deal of time just reading the titles of all the books that lined the shelves in the room and in the lounge.  The second-floor 24-hour lounge was one of the highlights of the stay.  Coffee, tea, snacks, were available at any time and was well-stocked and kept spotlessly clean.  I noticed a few visitors dealing with their jet lag in the early morning hours when I visited the lounge.  I think that this lounge is one of the best features of the hotel.  The top floor garden lounge with the beautiful bar was also a great asset, and a nice place to \"get away from it all\" during the day, but seriously busy after the bar opens at 4:00 pm.  I highly recommend this hotel for couples or singles.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"NONE"}

I could not fault this hotel.  It was amazing in every way.  The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable.

So relaxing, especially with the subtle background music.  The breakfast was perfect for us \u2013 juices, cereals, bagels and bread (which the staff were happy to toast for you), and the fresh fruit cocktail was delicious.  You could also pop in to the Reading Room at any time for a tea\/coffee and a biscuit or a piece of fruit just to chill out.   The staff were also fantastic.  The reception staff (so friendly and helpful with any advice we had), all the girls who worked in the Reading Room (were just lovely and so attentive), the staff in the rooftop bar, the guys who worked on the door and the cleaners.  The location is ideal.  Just round the corner from 2 different subway stations (Bryant Park and Grand Central Terminal).

The Library Hotel is sort of a \"Book a Book\" hotel and the room will follow. I selected a room on the 10th, the General Knowledge floor. I didn't expect to find Marie Kondo's \"The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\" book here; but the laden shelves \"sparked joy\" to a bookworms heart, none the less.\n\nThe Library Hotel is the strongest knowledge-based hotel I have encountered. The rooms are elegant; a bit tight, but bookworm friendly. Nothing is more comfortable than to curl up with your blanket before you start reading. Staff are prepared for service and amped up to satisfy the needs of the guests.\n\nAfter a taxi cab kamikaze tried to run me over at an intersection, it was refreshing to escape the hullaballoo of the NYC treadmill as I entered the Library's peaceful surroundings. War and Peace comes to mind.\n\nWhat better way to start the day than to enjoy the complimentary breakfast and what better way to finish the day than to enjoy the complimentary managers wine and cheese.\nReading books and practicing your library skills makes you hungry.\n\nThrow in a few NYC landmarks and this was a great clothbound, mental vacation.............\n.........Life is good when you're a Bookworm in the Library Hotel.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We now don't bother to look at any other hotels as we know that the Library is just perfect. We like to walk everywhere so the location is perfectly in the middle of everything that you could possibly need to do uptown and downtown. The breakfast and cheese and wine are an added bonus and so convenient and well looked after by the friendly kind young ladies working in this area. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the rooms very pleasant. We sleep with the window open despite the cold outside and I really am not bothered by much noise even though I am a relatively light sleeper. The bar upstairs is nice for a late night cosy nightcap and sadly we have never been in the summer so not sat outside on the roof but I'm sure this is amazing with the Empire State Building lit up between the buildings. We usuallly always eat in Madison and vine on the first evening when we arrive and are tired and this is always good, great burger and a good glass of wine to prepare us for our busy few days ahead.   A special mention goes to bubbly friendly Duke on reception concierge who was extremely helpful with numerous questions from running routes to help with the subway and restaurant recommendations, he did this happily and enthusiastically and all of his tips were perfect.

Buying a weekly metro card is great if you want to use local buses or subways . The subway shuttle between Grand Central Station and Times Square is good for those who wish to experience Broadway theatre- using this shuttle can let you leave the hotel 30 minutes before curtain up in most theatres.Staff at Library hotel very helpful and personable. Extremely easy check in and check out . Not the cheapest but if you include the free breakfast, all day coffee and biscuits along with the nightly cheese and wine , not as expensive as it may seem.

We stayed in room 303, on social sciences floor, our rooms theme was economic theory.  There were at least 125 books In the room and even for a somewhat sleepy subject of economics there has to be something of interest to everyone who stays in this room.  I picked out at least one book from each reachable shelf to leaf through.  This small but very quaint room has a full sized bed with two types of pillows one down and the other poly filled.  While I would have preferred a memory foam pillow, again the Hotel chose the pillows well.  The television is small.  The storage space is good sized closet and drawers.  The bath room was good sized, smaller lip rise on the tub making it easier to get in and out of.  During the day, the 2nd floor library sitting room has snacks (nice cookies, some danishes, and fruit).  At 5pm the wine and cheese items come out.  The only negative here is my lack of willpower so I over ate the snacks.  They have a continental breakfast, with real fresh hard boiled eggs vs store bought from weeks ago. Fresh orange and grapefruit juices, little cereals I had fruit loops some 40 years after the last time I had it.  They also have coffee and tea, hot cereal packages more danishes, bagels, croissants, bread for toasting, etc.  The hotel has a bar and sitting room on the 14 floor with very nice views.  It was chilly on Feb 14th but very nice and very comfortable.  The view out the windows of 303 was to Madison and 41st streets.  When the room got too warm after showers in the morning, it was nice to be able to crack the window open for some fresh air.  \n\nI am a picky traveler and I appreciate all the finer touches this hotel offers.  I looked for something to knick pick on but could not find anything.  I will stay again at the Library Hotel in Manhattan.

As we've gotten to know the city and area a little better, we still find this hotel to be our top choice - central location, fast elevators, quiet, clean rooms, helpful staff etc. \n\nTwo minor incidents occurred this trip but definitely not deal breakers.\n\nI did find it interesting that one night we had leftover dinner (fish) and we kept it in the mini fridge. The next day, we couldn't leave it out for the cleaning staff to throw out because it smelled awful. I left a $5 tip, with a note on the nightstand, asking to remove the bag from the fridge and please discard. When we returned later that day, the tip and note were gone, room was clean, but the bag of day old fish was still in the fridge. That evening I was lucky enough to catch the cleaning woman who came to turn down the bed. I asked her if she could throw away the bag, which I had in my hand. She said, \"I don't understand English\". I was surprised that she didn't know what I meant. Luckily, I knew Spanish and told her it was \"basura\" and she was more than happy to remove it from the room. I suppose she didn't understand my note. If the cleaning crew doesn't understand English, it might be helpful for the hotel staff to teach them basic words or to instruct them to show another employee a note clearly left for them and ask them to translate if they don't understand. \n\nOn our last day, we checked out and had time to spare before leaving for the airport. We left our four bags, and two winter coats in their storage room. We returned and picked up our belongings with the help of hotel staff. We were about 40 minutes into our ride to JFK when we realized we left our two winter coats in the storage room. Too late to turn back. It's our fault that we forgot our coats although I'd like to say it would have been nice for the hotel staff to have given us everything when he handed us our belongings. Again, our fault. They were kind enough to ship us our coats after I forwarded a prepaid FEDEX label to them and they packed and shipped it immediately.\n\nAll in all, we still love the Library Hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Very central but without the madness of Manhattan. \n\nLots of great places for dinner nearby. \n\nStaff were all excellent. \n\nRoom size was very reasonable fir NY standards and especially so the bathroom which was very well equipped with shelves, accessories etc. Quick tip - for the shower, press the small difficult to find button under  the tap\/lever!\n\nThe 7-8pm wine, olives and cheeses were great. \n\nBreakfast a bit lacking - I recommend going into Grand Central Station for breakfast.

My review will second what others have written: this hotel has a great location and a stellar staff. Yes--the rooms are small, but they are designed to make efficient use of space. Instead of feeling cramped, you feel comfortable. In fact, comfort is the defining aspect of this hotel. The intimate feeling of the place, enhanced by staff who make you feel at home, to the continental breakfast and happy hour (both included in the price of the room) are comforts I have rarely found together in a mid-price NYC hotel. One reviewer described this hotel as a \"haven,\" and I agree. For example, it rained solidly on one of the days we were staying there, and if NYC did not beckon from outside, I would have been content to stay in our room all day and read. Those books are not just there for decoration; they are part and parcel of the hotel stay. I have only one recommendation: install a grab bar in the shower\/tub. I am getting older, and since I plan to ALWAYS stay in the Library Hotel when I go to NYC, I will probably need that grab bar in a few years! ","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The morning continental breakfast was plentiful and the service was impeccable Afternoon wine and cheese was exceptional, also with attentive service. We loved the boutique aspect and concierge-level service. Also, it was very quiet. In a loud city, that is a plus. Our previous visits to NYC always had us at the Waldorf-Astoria.

As might be expected between two related siblings, the service, accommodations, amenities and intrinsic fit up quality are cast from the same mold. The rooms are smallish but with ample baths, well turned out, each in its own style, each offering comfortable common rooms providing Continental breakfast, snacks and non-alcoholic beverages 24\/7, with wine and cheese each evening, all presented with well-oiled precision by equally accommodating hostesses.  Garages available at most attractive rates-Casablanca\u2019s literally attached. No grand gathering lobbies, rather perfunctory and efficient, absent any glitter.\n\nSo, with costs generally the same, location and flavor perhaps the basis for a choice. On the one hand, Library in a less vibrant neighborhood, near to Grand Central Station, with seasonal attractions of the skating  rink and tree at Rockefeller Center, the lights of Fifth Avenue, along with shopping along Fifth and Madison, as well as the pot pourri of shops at Bryant Park, all within easy walking distance. In general, the scope and density of attractions close at hand a fair bit less here than five blocks to the West in the Casablanca neighborhood. \n\nAt Casablanca, just around the corner from Times Square, a decidedly more vibrant neighborhood, with the bustling theater district with associated restaurants and multiple visitor venues all near at hand.\nAs to flavor, the chosen names pretty much say it all. \n\nLibrary decidedly almost institutional-a hotel theme perhaps not unexpected with location just steps away from the majestic New York Public Library- but sensual delight limited here by legions of neatly shelved books central to the d\u00e9cor. Rooms are solid and substantial, reflecting a quiet, simple modernity-although hallways somewhat dark and claustrophobic-arms outstretched almost reaching wall to wall-with stark industrial metal door frames punctuating the path. Common room continuing the theme-orderly tables lined up regimental style, with perimeter seating, all well done, but all presented with just a touch of monotony painting a picture-dare I say- bland. Room TV\u2019s an afterthought-screens of many laptops larger. Complimentary computers in a typical chain hotel cubicle. \n\nCasablanca, within a similar shell, has hit upon a theme conjuring a faraway escape, setting the tone with an expansive Moroccan cityscape ascending the entry stairway wall, promising adventure just above. Rooms here benefit from a wide range of outfitting options to reinforce its theme. Wooden shades, rattan and other trappings with Northern African motifs, wood moldings reminiscent. Hallways with tigers standing guard, wall coverings and trim in style, common room with niche areas large and small, large screen TV\u2019s, computer area tucked in, seating areas enveloped in the theme in multiple configurations- more living room than Library cafeteria \/reading room rendition.\n\nWhile both of these hotels have earned their ratings, there is always room for improvement. At Library, the coffee maker requested with our reservation was nowhere to be seen. While two robes were found, as usual, just one pair of slippers found. At Casablanca, there were some shower hardware issues and tile maintenance was not up to the standards highest ratings demand. A hint of wear around the edges.\n\nAll in all, irrespective of the inherent characteristics of bricks and mortar and location, each of these hotels offer a level of service likely to accommodate the most demanding traveler.\n\n","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"NONE"}

Billy really took the time to find a restaurant for us in the theatre district by the theatre where Mean Girls was playing. He suggested Victors Cafe and it was very good. I really appreciated that he took the time to  find a place that suited us. All of the employees are super friendly and helpful. As others have said, the rooms are tiny but we were  in our room only to sleep. The bathrooms are bigger than many in NYC hotels so that was a bonus. We enjoyed the proximity to the subway and also the convenience of being able to walk to many places. It is a little bit quieter in this area so that you can actually sleep at night. The breakfast and the wine and cheese are a nice bonus that you don\u2019t find in New York often. I did think the rooms are a little worn but they were very clean and housekeeping was very nice and kept our room clean. I called down for an iron and ironing board and they said it would be up in five minutes and it was! Some places would have taken 30 minutes for that to happen so great service.

We loved it.\nThe breakfast each morning on level 2 was adequate and helped us start our day well. The drinks and cheese in the afternoons were a lovely treat and a great way to catch up with what the other guests were doing if you felt like talking.\nUpstairs the writers den was a lovely place to end the day in front of the fire on the cold New York nights that we experienced.\nThe only downside was that the wifi was very slow and sometimes would drop out altogether in our room, however it was very strong in the reading room and wirters den areas. While somewhat frustrating it wasn't the end of the world and didn't ruin our stay.\nIt was certainly a treat to have drinks and snacks available all day and were quite welcome to warm up with after being out in the rain all day.\nI loved the free books that were available at the front desk and the guys at the desk were kind enough to let me bring a few extra back to Australia for gifts.\nI loved everything about this hotel and would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Many New York hotels, including a couple I like, nowhave these. They are controversial, maybe illegal, and hurt both the city, and the  hotel helpdependent on tips. For those unfamiliar with them, they are a bait and switch - like tactic that makes price comparisons harder; and they sometimes force the purchase of unwanted features.

We searched long and hard before choosing our New York City hotel. Many fantastic reviews helped us decide on the Library and we are SO very glad we did.The location on Madison Avenue is perfect, so central for absolutely everything. There are many things that make this hotel stand out, one of those being the staff. So friendly , helpful and welcoming. From the moment of check in right through until departure, they could not have been better. The concierges and reception staff, doormen and the lovely girls who were there at breakfast and during 'Happy Hour' (3 hours lol) were just lovely.Breakfast was provided free of charge and it was a perfect start to our day. Wonderful selection and the girls so willing to toast bagels etcCoffee is very good and is available 24\/7....along with cookies and fresh fruit etcI do not know of any other hotel in NYC who provides as much as this Library Hotel Group doThe evening reception between 5pm - 8pm EVERY night is exceptional.   Cheese, crackers, crudit\u00e9s & dips and other snacks along with free flowing Prosecco, wines.... hard to beat.  Our bedroom was large, by NYC standards, kept spotlessly clean by the staff. It was very tasteful indeed and we immediately felt right at home from the minute we arrived. Fresh bottled water continually topped up twice a day. There was even a fridge in the room which would be wonderful in warmer weather. All in all this hotel is wonderful. Staff are a real asset, the complimentary tea\/coffee and cookies and pastries are most welcome after a day spent out walking around. The hotel even provides take away cups so you can bring a coffee up to your bedroom. We would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again or any of the hotels in this group. We have previously stayed in the Lotte New York Palace, a 5* hotel close by and it doesn't compare to The Library in respect of staff and service.Many thanks to everyone for a wonderful holiday.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Most hotels don\u2019t really have a cozy room open to hang out in at all hours of the day\/night, so this was such a great perk. During the cocktail hours at night and breakfast in the morning, we were also surprised to see what a wide range of snacks, food, and drinks they had. The wine was great, and the view of the historic NYPL library from our table made for a perfect experience.\n\n\u2028We were also able to check out the beautiful 14th floor with its sweeping rooftop views and garden terraces. We felt right at home, and unlike most rooftops or bars in NYC on a Saturday night, it wasn\u2019t overly crowded or loud, so we were able to relax on a comfy couch by the cracking fire enjoying our wine as we chatted away. All the details were lovely, and I found myself thinking how beautiful the rooftop area must be for weddings or even bridal showers. \n\nAs a complete bibliophile, I loved seeing the sheer amount of books covering almost every wall throughout the hotel, and I loved how our room had countless library books neatly organized in every nook and cranny. The room itself was very spacious (a rarity for other hotels in Manhattan which are notoriously tiny). Even though I went with my husband, I would definitely recommend it to friends and family and can\u2019t wait to come back!","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We took a chance & stayed in a hotel we hadn\u2019t chosen before. It\u2019s a little off the beaten path - not right in the middle of Times Square where some of the competing hotels were located (and where we usually stay). I thought this would be a problem but it wasn\u2019t - it was PERFECT! Walking distance from Grand Central & an easy walk to Times Square. But since it\u2019s set back, the side streets are quiet & the hotel is peaceful. The customer service is phenomenal. They had a special box of chocolates & a card to congratulate us & welcome us in. We did choose a few upgrades like the romance package but the coziest white noise head phones, down pillow topping for the bed & others amenities were at no additional charge.\nThe breakfast was wonderful - nice spread of fresh NY bagels, fruit, eggs etc. Cocktail hour included a nice wine selection, fruit & cheese. The beautiful outdoor rooftop bar with city views was a gorgeous & peaceful place to unwind. WiFi & business center with internet and printing all included and although no gym on site - a pass to the local gym was included.  The rooms were a decent size for this part of NY, comfortable & beautifully furnished. Our room was an Asian theme - but each room has a different theme & style which would allow every stay to have a different experience - that is a unique approach. \nUltimately - it was hands down the nicest hotel I\u2019ve stayed in for NYC (and we\u2019ve visited the Top 5 trip advisor rated hotels at this point in addition to several other 5 star hotels - this one is #1 in our book). Not just the beauty, cleanliness & originality of the theme but the warmth and genuine kindness of the workers and the included amenities - for NY this is truly special and hard to beat.

Maybe it just didn't suit my tastes, but after reading the reviews and paying a pretty high amount for the room, I was disappointed.\n\nI travel a lot and think I have a pretty good feel for hotel standards in NYC (I also really appreciate a great hotel at any price range).  I stayed for two nights for business and was hoping for a nice boutique hotel experience in midtown.  I booked a larger room on the 12th floor (the highest floor with rooms - I think the 13th floor is a rooftop bar that I did not have time to visit).  There is not a lot of privacy in the room unless you close the window shades (the surrounding buildings are a lot taller and it felt like I was in the middle of an office complex conference room panopticon) and although I could see the actual library down the street from my room, I had to keep the shades closed at night. It's definitely not a view property.\n\nThere were a lot of positives: nice size room for NYC, great location, excellent service, awesome roomservice food from the restaurant on the first floor, and great coffee in the breakfast room (I didn't have time in the morning for a continental breakfast but it looked like a nice spread of fruits, juices and pastries).\n\nThat said, I was a disappointed with the place.  The hotel was not super clean (the carpets in the elevator were not vacuumed and the bathroom had lots of little corners that have been left to collect dirt and grime).  The decor is pretty worn and showing it's age, and the finishes - cabinetry, tiles, tub, taps, etc - are pretty utilitarian and somewhat banged up.  It's a 3-4 star hotel by global standards (4 star amenities, 3 star rooms), and it literally looks and feels as if you were to put a bed in the middle of an older (and not very charming) university library. That may be the appeal of the place, but to me it felt like the hotel just needs a facelift.\n\n","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

So many great things but tops would be The Reading Room where the breakfast and happy hour happen. It's a second floor lounge with a piano, small tables, chairs and banquette seating. A nook with a fabulous coffee machine keeps everyone coming up for their favorite beverage-- there's a spigot for coffee, hot milk, espresso, decaf espresso and more! The complimentary continental breakfast includes pastries, scones, fresh fruit, yogurt, hard boiled eggs. The happy hour is available for three hours every evening.  There were interesting wines and always Prosecco. The Reading Room is open all day for coffee, tea,  cookies and a quiet place to read the books that are found throughout the hotel.  Also very accommodating was the small bistro and wine bar Madison and Vine connected to the Hotel. Although the King room was not large, it was well-designed with lovely dark wood built-in furniture and ample counters and drawers, plugs, mirrors and light. The linens were as would be expected in a fine hotel and the bath had good light and shelving..On each of our four days there, housekeeping had completed service by the time we returned in the afternoon. Also the turndown service was always done after we had left for the evening so it was very unobtrusive. The location around the corner from Grand Central was ideal for taking the subway all over town. For taxis and Uber we found that walking a few steps to Madison was better than waiting on Library Way. Finally, a real pleasure was returning after a fun night and having a night- cap at the Roof Top Bar on the 14th floor.

The only real negative is that even the better rooms (Queen) are still rather small. It\u2019s not cheap but just about acceptable for Big Apple.

The continental breakfast was very good, particularly the fresh fruit salad and first-rate coffee machine, which produced lattes and cappuccinos on demand.

We were able to check in a little early and they also gave us a discount on a room upgrade. (Later they even sent up a bottle of prosecco for our celebration.) \nEach room has a book theme. There are even free books in the lobby (publishers' advance copies)  and books in all rooms and elsewhere to borrow.\nWe appreciated the free breakfast and evening wine-and-cheese gathering on the second floor. That room is also open 24 hours a day and stocked with other snacks, a great place to duck in to relax and enjoy the comfy environs.

The rooms, like most in NY, are on the petite side so would suggest a deluxe room for more space. ","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was hellishly hot this past week in NYC, and the air conditioning was top notch. Comfortable bed, adequate water pressure, and enough electric outlets all made room 1201 a perfect place to return to after trekking through Manhattan.  I had drinks at the rooftop bar, the blood orange cocktail was quite tasty. There was some construction noise, but I had no difficulty sleeping. I found the continental breakfast sufficient, I tend not to expect a feast when it is free. Cereal, fruit, bagels, and pastries provided plenty of options. It was lovely to walk one block from Grand Central rather than taking a cab or hauling luggage around the city. Great location, so many books, and a nice attention to detail on the part of the staff made for a great stay.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

The location is perfect - a very short walk from Grand Central Terminal even for a person like me with a very cranky knee. The included breakfast is more than satisfying, a three hour wine\/cheese happy hour pleases everyone each evening, and use of their reading room 24\/7 offers a welcome retreat whenever you need it.

Very clean, comfortable bed with crisp white linen, spacious bathroom with good products.  Not an especially spacious bedroom, one armchair provided that restricted movement around the bed, a small issue. Good to have a window that opens, too.

We loved our 'Music' Room on the 7th Floor, which is The Arts floor. Perfect for my daughter, who is a performing arts study, who loves musical theater and sings!\nThe room was big in NYC standards and beautifully decorated. We loved the books in the room to browse. Daily water bottle replentished and chocolates on turn down were great.\nDaily breakfast is inlcuded in the room rate, and you can enjoy it in the Library.  There were plenty of options and the bagels were excellent! We don't eat a cooked breakfast, so the 'continental' spread of cereal, fruit, yoghurt, pastries, bagels and toast were ample for us. Along with juice, tea and coffee. Tea and cofee are available throughout the day too.\nWe had friends also staying at the hotel and on a number of afternoons we met up at 'wine and cheese' after our busy days out. Even though my daughter doesn't eat cheese, and is far too young for wone, she loved the afternoon ritual and meeting other people. She would take a book or journal down and reflect on the day, enjoying the social experience and snacks.\nThe staff were warm and friendly and very helpful. We are low maintenance, so dindn't need to interact often.\nWe loved the Roof Top bar and had New Yorkers meet us there for drink and they loved the venue too!\nWe also had dinner at Madison and Vine prior to the theatre one evening, and the food and service was very good.\nOn departure we both selected a book to take home which was a part of the special arrangement the hotel had with Simon and Schuster. Very generous and a lovely perk.\nThe Library Hotel is so located - Central Station, New York Library and Bryant Park are all within two blocks walk. You can also walk to Times Square in 15 minutes, or take the Shuttle direct from Grand Central. Being on the corner of Madison Ave & 41st Street, it feels like it is just one block away from the true 'hustle' of Midtown, which was lovely. \nWe even found good coffee at Blue Bottle opposite Grand Central.\nI was so delighted with our choice of The Library Hotel.

This boutique hotel has everything you would wish for, the staff are very helpful and friendly, and the hotel in both public areas and rooms is clean with tasteful decor.  As indicated by the name it has a Library theme and books are in abundance everywhere if you have time to read whilst on a visit to New York! We had a petite room which as expected was compact but perfectly adequate and  the standard of decor and cleanliness was high. So everything you hope for in a hotel but don't always get; however what makes this hotel stand out are the extras they provide.  Namely a complimentary breakfast of various cereals, juices, bagels, pastries, eggs, fresh fruit & yoghurt.  Coffee is available in the breakfast room all day as are pastries, fruit and biscuits.  Then each evening they serve cheese and wine with various nibbles.  These finishing touches really do make a difference and we enjoyed coming back to the hotel to relax with a coffee or wine between our explorations of New York. In addition there is a very fashionable roof bar full of ambience on a warm July evening however prices were expensive.\n\nSituated close to Grand Central Station we found it the perfect location.  Having enjoyed fantastic food on our cruise, eating out wasn't our priority whilst in New York, however we ate at twice at Pershing Square which is just a few steps away and had enjoyable, if not cheap (but what is in New York?) meals.  We had a bit of a wait on one occasion and although we didn't make a fuss they insisted on free drinks and desserts as an apology.  We also ate at the restaurant attached to the hotel, The Madison and Vine and although we just had burgers and fries, these were good and service friendly if not the fastest but they were very busy. \n\nOverall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a stay in New York.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We stayed in the \"fine arts room,\" on the seventh floor. Though the bedroom was tight, especially with our two large suitcases, the appointments were all very nice, as was the bathroom. Further, the hotel features a large library (naturally) with a selection of books, complimentary coffee and tea in real cups (these little things matter) all day, pastries, and free breakfast in the morning. It also is attached to a restaurant, Madison and Vine,  which--bucking the trend of hotel\/restaurant combinations-- had delicious food and drinks on the evening when we were too tired to wander far from home.

We entered the hotel and received the warmest and friendliest welcome from bellman Bastian. He directed us to the check-in counter were Duke greeted us as if we were his long lost family that he'd been missing for years. We can truly say that Bastian and Duke gave us the friendliest welcome we've ever received at a hotel. And we've stayed in a lot of them. Duke served as concierge as well. He gave us a city map and pointed out points of interest such as restaurants, entertainment, and transportation. He explained how to use the subway which can be intimidating to tourists but his directions were on point and we used the subway for most of our sightseeing. It is the most efficient and economical way to travel in New York.  Our room was small but most adequate. The bed was very comfortable. One of the highlights of the hotel is snacks are served on the second floor throughout the day so you can get coffee, fruit, and danishes. From 5-8PM, wine and cheese assortments are available. The continental breakfast served every morning is spectacular. The lounge staff is simply amazing. They poor your drinks, remove you used dishes, and they make sure food, drinks, and snacks are replenished. They all are very friendly and professional. As we were celebrating  our Anniversary, the hotel sent up a complimentary bottle of wine and a very nice greeting card congratulating us. Unfortunately, we are both non-drinkers. As we didn't want the wine to go to waste, I asked Bastian to return it to the front desk with thanks. Bastian, brought back an array of non-alcoholic drinks to accommodate us. He went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure our stay was amazing. He is such an engaging personality that we took to time to converse with him for awhile each time we met him while entering or leaving the hotel.

The coffee in the second floor dining area was sub par. And, there was no Half and Half in a container. Why? Had to go to Starbucks. Overall, I would return.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a junior suite for a group of three and it was very pleasant, comfortable and clean.  We even enjoyed the fact that the thermostat allowed us to run the fan continuously at low, medium or high.  This really made a difference for us, as it was a constant soothing sound to block out other sounds and help us sleep better.  We appreciated the breakfast provided and the availablity of water and snacks at all times.  The 3 hour afternoon appetizers and drinks were also nice.  And who isn't soothed by the presence of so many books?  The location is very convenient;  close to Grand Central Terminal, library, broadway shows...  The staff is friendly and we won't forget doorman Boshton (Sorry--I'm sure I'm spelling his name incorrectly!), who made an amazing, Herculean effort to secure a cab for us when we checked out during rush hour.   I would be pleased to stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It is a hidden gem when staying in NY.  Just around the corner from Grand Central Station. One block from Bryant Park and Within  walking distance of Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and Broadway.  But you will want to be back by 5pm to take a break and enjoy their happy hour with great appetizers of cheeses, fruits and wine. Breakfast is great also.  The rooms are unique with the Library theme.  We will be back. ","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The turn down service, chocolates and weather forecast were lovely thoughtful touches. \n\nThe free breakfast and evening cheese and wine were great, if you wanted to save money on eating out you could probably pretty much survive on the food at the Library. (Truffle fries and cheesecake from room service were delicious). \n\nThe location is perfect, with Grand Central around the corner and the delightful Bryant Park very close. \n\nWe hope very much to come back to The Library and will be recommending it to everyone, thank you for helping make our stay in NYC so fabulous.

We recently spent a week at the Library and we enjoyed our stay very much. To mention just a few of the reasons why: attractive and quiet room in tip-top shape and sparkling clean, excellent mattress on the bed with primo bed linens, decent shower with thoughtful touches in the bathroom like a stool to sit on and a magnifying mirror, cute bar on the rooftop with a lively crowd, prosecco and brie every afternoon as you gaze out the windows at Midtown Manhattan, friendly helpful staff ready to bring you a movie or hail you a cab or point you to a restaurant. We'll be back!","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had three rooms, and all enjoyed the themes (ours was Mysteries) and related books in the rooms.  Our junior suites were well appointed, and the size was very comfortable.\nThe location was a big draw for us.  Located in Midtown, we were two short blocks away from Grand Central Station, a only a few blocks away from Rockefeller Plaza and shopping on Fifth Avenue.  We were even able to walk home from the theatre district one evening after a show.\nWhat sets this hotel apart from all the others is not just the themed rooms, but all of the delightful \u2018extras\u2019.  A substantial Continental breakfast is included with the rate, and coffee and light refreshments are available throughout the day (also included).  In the late afternoon (3-6, 4-7 or 5-8), substantial snacks (vegetables, cheese, crackers, olives) and wine are available to guests, also included in the room rate.  They even give you a free book upon checkout!\nThe rooftop is a lovely retreat, and the staff is personable and helpful.\nI highly recommend the Library Hotel if you a looking for a unique, well appointed hotel in Midtown!","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We were offered cold refreshments on arrival, while a very friendly and helpful gentleman called Duke, checked us in and gave some great advice on what to do while we waited for our room (Didn't wait very long once we had ventured out - roughly 1hour).\nAll of the staff at the Library Hotel are very accommodating - especially the ladies on the breakfast shift over the last 5 days. \nUpon booking this hotel, we always like to check previous reviews and are pleased to say we were not disappointment! This building has so much character, a roof top bar (not inc. with hotel room), a wine and cheese hour (5pm-8pm) and over all a great atmosphere. It's in a perfect location to walk to NYC Library, Grand Central, 5th avenue and Time Square. Our room was cleaned daily, and in the evenings the maids would pop in and make the room comfortable - this included a little weather report note on the bedside table - the little things that make this place so perfect! \nWe must give special thanks to Billy on reception. We went out for a lovely date night - dinner and a show - and he recommended an amazing steak place just 5mins walk from the hotel. We can honestly say it was one of THE best meals we have ever had - not just in NYC - Benjamins Steak House Prime. It made our evening that extra special  as he called ahead to book us in and made the restaurant aware of our evening plans. \nOnce again we can't thank the staff enough for a warm welcome, brilliant knowledge and a truly lovely stay. I have no doubt we shall stay again in the future.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The perfect place for a school librarian to spend an anniversary! We didn\u2019t let the hotel know as there was no need - everyone was treated in a kind, calm, respectful way and having a glass of wine and cheese early evening was fabulous.  Just round the corner from Grand Central and easy to walk to Broadway, MoMA, Empire State, UN.  We ate in the restaurant, attached to the hotel on our last evening and enjoyed our meal there too.  I had wondered if the petite room might be too small but it was fine - I think that the bed size is similar to a UK double but it was incredibly comfortable and quiet.  One of those hotels you will hold in your memory.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}
