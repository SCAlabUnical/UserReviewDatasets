For our 7 nights stay I knew we would spend some time in the room.\n\nWe got an approximate 20 square meter room with a sitting area consisting of an armchair \nsandwiched between a bed and the desk. The room was dark like a cave with a windows to a deep atrium.\nThe area was reasonly quiet but the vents in the room was running all the time - thats something to get used to.\n\nWhen I did a complaint about the room by telling that I expected to get a room that (to some extent) fitted \nthe description found on Booking (22 square meters isn\u2019t 33 square meters!). \nI was told: \"we have no 2 floor plans or room layouts that are just the same - configurations and square footage may vary slightly\" ... \nbut by 10 square meters! and they didn't know anything about a seating area.\n\nI just didn\u2019t get what I paid for. Then I expected to pay for what I got. But there could be no question of a decline in the price.\n\nOne of the most disappointing hotel stays I have experienced in the US.  \n\nMy recommendation for the hotel - get the descriptions on Booking sorted out.\n\nLocation is great!

When I checked in we had to deal with the annoying kiosk check-in. When I pay for a hotel room, I am expecting to pay for the experience of someone doing that for me. \n\nAnyways, we get checked in and head out. We woke the next morning to a phone call accusing my wife and me of smoking in our room. I have asthma, she is a cancer survivor, so suffice it to say we do not smoke at all. I mentioned this and they said their engineer came up and said it was us. So either he was too lazy to do his job, or he's a terrible engineer. I invite them up to have a look. He comes up and doesn't even come in. Says that he can see it's not us now. \n\nAs I am leaving for the day, I ask if we can change our housekeeping from the Express to Full for the next day. I am told no, that they have already set it for the weekend, so we are screwed. Sounds like BS to me. Anyways, we keep noticing the smell of smoke and I keep telling them that I am not going to be blamed for this. \n\nThen the next day, we get in and take a nap. I awake to find hotel staff standing in our room. Despite the DND sign. The guy runs out of the room. I jumped up and ran after him thinking that he was up to no good. I corner him by the elevator and he says that he was looking for another room. Sure. After that, we start locking everything up when we leave. \n\nAfter that, the WiFi is horrible, the TV channels barely work, and trying to get your luggage out of luggage storage takes forever. \n\nI had decent expectations coming in and they crapped on all of them.

The location is excellent, the staff were friendly and accommodating, and the room was clean and comfortable. However, there was one minor issue that prevented me from giving it a full five-star rating.\n\nThe hotel's fitness room, while convenient and well-equipped, is located on the same level as the guest rooms. Unfortunately, this means that any noise generated from the fitness room can be heard in nearby rooms as well as on the floors above and below. During my stay, me and my fellow traveling companions were awoken both mornings at 06:00 AM by the sound of exercise equipment, which was very disruptive.\n\nI believe that having designated quiet hours for the fitness room could help mitigate this issue. This way, guests who prefer a quieter environment can rest undisturbed, while still allowing others to enjoy the fitness facilities during appropriate times.\n\nDespite this inconvenience, I would still highly recommend Club Quarters Hotel, New York, World Trade Center, for its overall quality and convenience.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"NONE"}

I am an avid walker and from this location, you have fabulous access to Battery Park City, Hudson River Park, the Brooklyn Bridge, and all the neighborhoods in Lower Manhattan. \nOn my first visit, I made the mistake of booking the cheapest room... Take my advice and spend a bit more to ensure a room with a view (This is critical!). The rooms are rather basic, but they are clean and well-appointed with a comfortable bed and bedding. The windows open a crack so you can have fresh air. Many rooms offer a kitchenette, a mini fridge, and\/or a small pull-out sofa. Furnishings are continually updated... On my recent stay, the pull-out sofa was brand new and the mini fridge was new -- It even had a nice freezer compartment! The rooms are very soundproof and quiet (although depending on the layout of your room, you can sometimes hear noise from the hallway and nearby rooms). If you are lucky enough to have a room facing North (9\/11 Memorial site) or East, you will enjoy floor-to-ceiling windows.

There was plenty communication backwards and forwards as I had to change my dates adding an extra night and then decided to take an extra guest. \n\nOn arrival we were met by London who welcomed us and said Krystin had a room she thought we would like better than what we had booked. We had booked a suite so we were shown that and an interconnecting family room which essentially was a double room with a bath and kitchen area and a connecting twin room with walk in shower room. We opted for the latter\u2026this was most definitely an upgrade and gave us more space and privacy. Thank you Krystin for arranging this for us. \n\nWe loved the hotel the staff and the location was fantastic\u2026so quiet and calm compared to the madness around midtown. I can\u2019t tell you how nice it was to come up from the subway near the hotel and not hear sirens..horns and people. Everywhere is easily accessible via subways\u2026you can walk about 15 minutes from the hotel to teach states island ferry. \n\nCouple of good eateries nearby\u2026we visited bills burgers across the road\u2026nice food but extremely loud music which wasn\u2019t great. We visited George\u2019s diner which was nice but zazas opposite was a much nicer diner inside\u2026beware portions are gigantic. We also ate at Morton\u2019s steakhouse next door to the hotel\u2026very expensive if you are from the UK bit amazing food and wines. \n\nThe 20th floor bar at the hotel is well worth a visit\u2026service was great and the views are amazing. Although the bar is shut until 4.30-5pm you can access the area and sit and enjoy the views. There is also a terrace on the other side of the floor which has views over to Brooklyn. \n\nWe will definitely stay at this hotel again when back in New York and we highly recommend it. \n\nThank you to all staff for making our stay such a great one. Every single member of staff we came into contact with was welcoming friendly professional and just lovely! \n\nHope you guys all enjoyed the English chocolate bars we kept dropping at reception every day.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":1595302,"title":"No-frills, mostly self-service hotel in downtown NYC","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-08-25","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"This high-rise hotel is conveniently located in downtown Manhattan. It has 25 floors. The rooms, gym and rooftop areas are only accessible to those with a hotel card key. We appreciated this security measure. \n\nThere is a rooftop bar but we did not go there. Instead, we went through the gym to an open air rooftop space with chairs etc for guests\u2019 use.  While we were there, we saw a small group making a dance video (the video-makers told us it was not a formal photoshoot).\n\nOur room was described as a suite on the hotel website. There were two sections - a sleeping area and a living area - connected by a small passageway. The bathroom, situated between the two sections, opened onto the passageway. \n\nOne quirky feature - the main door of this room\/suite opened into the sleeping area (typically, in a suite with a single entrance, one enters the living area first). \n\nThe sleeping area had a queen size bed, a built-in cupboard (with hanging space, drawers, a small safe, and small ironing board) and a flat screen TV on the wall at the foot of the bed. The bathroom was quite large (comparatively) and had a toilet, a sink, a walk-in shower area (no tub) with a shower curtain (not the typical glass enclosure). There were no facial tissues or shower cap. The living area had  floor-to-ceiling windows on 2 of the 4 walls. It had a couch, a flat screen TV on one wall, a small desk area with a chair (the lamp on the desk did not work), and a \u201ckitchenette\u201d with a fridge, microwave (both small) and Keurig coffee maker. There were no utensils\/cutlery\/dishes, paper towels or cleaning supplies in the \u201ckitchenette\u201d, and the only sink in the suite was the one in the bathroom.\n\nOf the people we met at the hotel, the housekeeping staff were the most helpful. We met some of them in the elevator and in the hotel corridors. They told us about the various hotel amenities, the card key access to the elevator, the gym, the filtered cold water available on each floor etc.\n\nPOSITIVE ASPECTS: \n-  Reasonably comfortable room\/suite. \n-  Walking shower with detachable handheld showerhead\n-  Free filtered water in bottles on each floor. \n-  Splendid view of some downtown landmarks from the floor-to-ceiling windows on 2 of the 4 walls of the living area\n-  Helpful housekeeping staff\n-  Direct line to Curb (NYC taxi service) from the front desk\n\nNEGATIVE ASPECTS: \nOur first impression when we entered the hotel was that our stay would be excellent and merit a 5-star TripAdvisor review. However, that impression changed as our stay progressed. There was no concierge-type figure we could consult about area restaurants and attractions. We did not see any bellhops to help with luggage. Our interaction with members of the front desk staff was minimal. They seemed harried and defensive (even when they were not busy with hotel guests). After a couple of attempts, we went to the internet for answers to our queries. \n\nThe overall self-service ambiance and paucity of human interaction caused us to wonder if perhaps the hotel was still using Covid pandemic protocols (though no one was masked and we were not asked to show our vaccination certificates!). Since there was no mechanism to address our concerns, we decided to check out after 2 nights (we had intended to stay 4 nights). \n\nIn summary, though this hotel was not a good fit for our needs, it  will probably be suitable for those seeking a no-frills, mostly self-service, downtown hotel.\n\nSUGGESTION: \nThe hotel could post a list of instructions, amenities etc on the website . The checkin & checkout process could also be done online. Requests for services could also be made online. In that way, guests could bypass the front desk staff.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Traveling with an autistic child, you have to consider levels of noise, crowds, etc. After lots of research, we decided that staying in the WTC area would be our best bet so we booked a 1-bedroom suite in this hotel. Honestly, I think the hotel is underrated. I didn't see many reviews that reflected the OUTSTANDING level of service from staff: friendly, supportive, and, in our case, very understanding and accommodating to our child's needs.  Additionally, the hotel is very modern, clean, you find water dispensers everywhere. It is walking distance to  A LOT of attractions (Brooklyn Bridge, Battery Park, Wall District), plus all the WTC memorials, a shopping mall, and a subway station that has all the lines to take you every where. It was an amazing experience and I think it all started with the support from the staff in the check-in desk (Rajiv and Adonis) who were supportive and understood our need for a more isolated location and lots of privacy during our stay.

They put me by a family. Yay!\nThey will not even fake try making you feel at home or welcome. I spent 40 hours travelling to get there, 2 flights cancelled, 1 delayed, a missed connection, I arrived completely worn out and they made me feel even worse.\n\nThe TV was se t to wake up someone called James Witt at 5.45 am. It kept turning itself on no matter how many times I turned it off. The plug outlet is embedded in the wall so there was no way of forcefully shutting it down. No one came to fix it until 10 am. I received no apologies from anyone. I called and came down to ask for help and they kept telling me to wait in the room for the technician. Absolutely ruined my morning.\nA\/C does not stop blasting cool air until the temperature reaches 60\u00b0F. No way of turning it off either. You can set it to your preferred temperature and then it will keep turning on again and again loudly to blow warm air onto you.\nOh and you have to pay a deposit again even if you\u2019re staying in the same room. And they say they will release the money after 7 to 30 days because that\u2019s all we need, leaving money at a stupid hotel for ages. Most ridiculously stupid system I have ever heard of.\nThe bathrooms are disappointing, shower curtains are only okay at home or in a hostel. The carpet had more stains than I could count. \nThe gym is in shambles, the peloton bike looks like it was found in the streets.\nAnd last saddening detail they never ever switch off the lights in the hallway. Yes, they aren\u2019t windows in the halls but motion detectors do exist. So you will have a lovely ray of artificial sunlight pouring in from under your door all night long. Saving Earth ? Why?\nFinally they do not refund you or agree to rearrange your booking when your flight is cancelled or delayed unless you let them know at least 24 hours in advance which is pretty much impossible. So do not ever book a first night with them unless you love wasting money.\nI am a generous tipper but I will not be leaving a penny this time.\nWill not come back again.

We had a wonderful time in New York but were somewhat disappointed by our experience at this hotel. \nIt's location is great. It's in a really quiet area very close to World Trade Center and within walking distance of the Statue of Liberty. The hotel itself is modern and the facilities are good. We were mainly disappointed by the service received overall. \nAfter 15 hours or so of travelling through time zones we arrived to check in at around 5.00 pm (check in was 3.00pm). I could sense something was wrong as things seemed to be taking too long. It became apparent that rooms weren't ready. The hotel was 'at capacity' which confused me as surely we were part of this capacity? The receptionist suggested an hour wait which was totally unacceptable. After a discussion or two a room was found and we ended up waiting for around 15 minutes. During this time, and over the next day or so I witnessed many guests have the same issue and I'm pretty certain we didn't get the room we'd booked. \nAlso, I've been to many city hotels so I'm aware that house keeping isn't always a given. But at this hotel you literally have to take your own 'trash' out and request clean towels or extra toilet roll (bit embarrassing). The hotel seems to suggest texting these requests? Confusing. Anyway, I had to ask reception 3 times for toilet roll and towels before I got any. I found little things like this and running out of coffee really annoying as life in New York is so fast paced. I expected better. \nOverall, we had a good stay and things could've been worse I guess. My advice would be to stay if you get a good price. ","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I work in customer service, and I wish I could take him home and hire him. He is a phenomenal asset to this hotels staff, when we were scared and worried he did everything he could to help us even though there were other clients he had to help in the meantime he did not give up on us. I have been to New York many times, and I\u2019ve never experienced such a kind soul who is so willing to help others even when it is not his issue or the hotels issue. Spencer I send you the praise of a 1000 voices, you are the greatest employee I\u2019ve ever encountered in a hotel. If you ever move to Georgia, find me for a job. I do want to mention the other staff working that day, while I spent most of my time with Spencer the other staff was amazing too. The allowed us to use their restroom and relax in the lobby while we waited for a bank confirmation. They were kind, and patient with us while we worked out our problem.

We have stayed here many times now, and do not consider any other options when we are planning our trip to the Big Apple. \n\nHere\u2019s what we like about the hotel:\n1.  LOCATION:  It\u2019s located in Lower Manhattan, and overlooks the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.  Rooms on the higher floors of the hotel will afford fine views of this national memorial, across to the soaring heights of the One World Tower.  We love this location as it\u2019s a relatively calm and peaceful spot, away from the frenzy and noise of a Times Square Location.  It\u2019s very close to a number of subway stations, and within  easy walking distance to many sights any visitor is likely to include on the sight-seeing itinerary:  Wall Street,  the Charging Bull sculpture, the Oculus, Battery Park (for ferries to the Statue of Liberty), Chinatown and Little Italy, the South Seaport complex, and the Brooklyn Bridge.  The rest of Manhattan is just a subway ride away.\n2. ROOMS AND HOTEL FACILITIES:  The hotel offers extremely comfortable rooms at very reasonable prices.  It offers a variety of room options, including  cosy and compact club  rooms   for the budget-oriented  travellers, standard rooms offering a very good level of comfort, superior rooms (some have a terrace, others have a view of either the city or the National Memorial), and one-room suites with additional seating area and kitchen facilities including a sink, microwave and coffee maker.  Our room, on the 18th floor, was the latter type.  It was  very spacious, comfortable, very clean and fresh, and with superb views across the National Memorial to One World.  For all rooms, bottled spring water is available from dispensers near the rooms, as are ironing boards and irons.  In the bar area downstairs, a coffee machine provides hot drinks to hotel guests.  The hotel has good wifi for connectivity, and rooms have plenty of power sockets for charging devices.  When we stayed in December, COVID-safe procedures were being carefully followed; room servicing and change of towels were by request only; this was more than acceptable. Social-distancing was required, as was the wearing of masks in all public areas.  The doors to rooms had a COVID-safe sticker across the doorway to confirm to guests that the room had been serviced safely and correctly.  We felt very safe and secure here, during this difficult COVID period.   As expected, the hotel's 20th floor restaurant was not open, but there are a myriad of fabulous places to eat in the hotel's immediate vicinity.\n3. THE STAFF;  We were warmly welcomed by check-in staff,  Such a welcome always creates a comforting feel to guests, ensuring that they are respected and cared for.  Customer Service Manager Kevin Chan was on hand to ensure that his operations team was working efficiently and smoothly, and to provide first hand information to his guests.  His knowledge of the local area, and of New York City in general, is outstanding.  If you need directions, help with restaurants, sightseeing, getting a COVID test, finding a spot for a late-night pizza, he is your person.  Thank you for the care and attention you gave us during our stay.\n\nWe will be back, without a shadow of a doubt.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I first stayed here for 3 nights in late May. My visit was solid but with a few minor kinks. In fairness, the city was just reopening from Covid and the weather was horrendous (pouring rain and unusually cold). \n\nI returned for 3 more nights in October and WOW!!! The hotel hit it out of the park. First of all, I splurged on a family suite (2 adjoining rooms each with their own bath)  Having an exterior-facing room that faces East, North or South makes a huge difference. I love the floor to ceiling windows (they even open a crack for fresh air!). \n\nClub Quarters is not a luxury hotel but the location is excellent (one block from the 9\/11 memorial and Oculus WTC - super convenient to the PATH station and access to NJ), the hotel feels modern and clean. It is a larger busy hotel that seems to attract groups and global travelers. The hotel has a comfortable lobby and two extraordinary rooftop terraces. \n\nI highly recommend this hotel for singles, couples,families and or groups. \n\nThe bedding was very nice - crisp white sheets with a comforter and excellent pillows. Many rooms come with a mini fridge, sink and microwave oven. The shower is basic - I appreciate the hand-held feature. \n\nThe rooms are very quiet. I was across from the elevator and could hear anything from the hall. The HVAC system is very quiet and easy to use. \n\nAs of October 2021, due to continuing Covid restrictions, there is no daily housekeeping service. The staff goes out of their way to quickly send additional supplies as needed (clean towels, trash pickup, coffee refills, etc. )\n\nI highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

When I told the front desk, they attempted to put the blame on me and my devices, but agreed to move me to another room. The TV did not work, the chromecast did not work. Not a great first impression, but things happen. \n\nThey \"upgraded\" me to another room (one with a fridge). But funny thing, when I moved into the room, the fridge wasn't working. I told the staff, they said that they will check in the morning, which makes sense as it was a bit late, but that I'd be charged for having a nonworking fridge for the night. One of the wall outlets did not work, so they said to just move any machines that I needed to use to the one working wall socket.

I felt so paranoid that this room hadn't been cleaned one bit and had to leave. \n\nI noticed that even though they \"seal the doors\" for cleanliness, but if you just open the door and close it, the seal doesn't break at all, it looks the exact same as if it were just put on the door. \n\nThey DO NOT clean their rooms, and despite their \"text concierge\" assuring me that I wouldn't be charged the fee as I literally fled, they decided to back track the moment I followed up. Maybe some of the rooms are cleaned, but not in the room I stayed. I think the fact that they lied to me about refunding me was the worst part. They are not a trustworthy hotel. I cannot recommend this as a place to stay for anyone.","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

Essentially, if you stay for less than 7 days, they will not clean your room. I found this so odd!\n\nSo we had multiple issues here. The TV did not work in our room, twice, so we moved three rooms. Apart from that, on check out, I left some items in the room by mistake which they could have easily informed me about rather than essentially keeping for themselves.\n\nWhen I called them only a few hours later to ask why they didn't let me know, they were not bothered and seemed unaware that this had occurred. I had family staying in the same hotel who were also not contacted about this.\n\nI've sent emails for the past week, and am yet to receive a reply from them.

And then when getting on the elevators many people were in the lobby trying to get on them but the policy is 2 people or 1 family but even with policy many people still got on with me and my husband with no mask or big families and workers in lobby never said anything. Ridiculous. Now everything was clean but it states that the room was to be cleaned every day but nobody ever came in our room to clean and it was very obvious with trash accumulation and no new sheets. Another thing is that the tv works terribly. We would go on Netflix or YouTube and 3 minutes into watching something it would go back into the Home Screen. It was a very terrible experience with the tv. Another issue is the bathroom, it is extremely small and the shower head was leaking so water went all over the floor. And there is no room service whatsoever and the reason I chose this hotel is because it claimed to have room service! And I called the front desk many times and it never was answered so I had to go all the way down to ask if they had room service and of course they were just talking with nobody in the lobby so it\u2019s a bit confusing why the phone was never answered.

I am giving all the information because I meet so many people that I've since forgotten the names of the staff that were so nice to me. It was four of them (magnificent four) A very sweet lady who checked me in with blonde hair but I can't remember her name. A pretty black girl that I think handled like security, cool Asian guy maybe his name was Kevin and the over night audit black guy that I think name was Arthur. I was going through a lot but I pride myself on optimism and the hope that kindness will some how make a way. It paid off because my stay at the Club Quarters was excellent. The entire staff were so friendly and really catered to my individual needs. I had moved from Atlanta to New York just the day before and was being mistreated in my situation by a really awful person. I was down by definition but not in spirit. I had prayed that God would surround me with angels and he did. The entire staff were so warm and loving, funny and charming professionals. I have tattoo art on my face so I get profiled a lot in my day to day life especially in Atlanta even though I've never been to jail and pride myself on being a benefit to the human race. I dealt with none on that nonsense with these good people. They treated me with the up most respect. Often times if I'm walking down the street or sitting somewhere having a coffee people will come and talk to me. So I had met a few people on Christopher street in the village and then got approached by another coming out of 711 and they all followed me back to the hotel. Their spirit felt good and I'm a friendly person who was pretty along at the time so I said to myself why not. The staff never judged me or them, we never caused a problem and they never treated us like we did. We simply had a good time and my spirit was lifted. I honestly thank God for them, I'll never forget it. I've been all over the world and stayed at all kinds of places but this experience truly stood out. Thank you so much for the staff and the Club Quarters for having the knowledge to employ such a wonders team of beautiful individuals. I hope one day we meet again, hope this isn't tacky but my Instagram is @darrellworld2020 if I can do anything for any of you or the company don't hesitate.

It\u2019s less than 5 min walking from Wall St, the 9\/11 Memorial, Trinity Church, St Paul\u2019s Chapel, the Charging Bull and a few other NYC landmarks.  It\u2019s a 10-15 walk to Brooklyn Bridge, Battery Park, and the Ellis\/Liberty Island ferries.  It\u2019s surrounded by at least 5 subway stations (WTC, Cortland St, Rector St, Wall St, and Fulton St) which means you have options when moving all over the city at any time.

The room shapes are interesting\/creative, and great views (highly depends on the room). The bathroom\/shower were clean and ordered, however the toilet paper was really dollar-store cheap. There was only one shower towel. The mattress was clean, but old and too worn out. I understand the hotel is refreshing mattresses. \n\nIf you're next to an elevator, you'll hear it all night. If you're next door to another room with a fertile couple, you could be listening in to a late night rump. Some doors are very close to each other, so you'll easily hear them slam. \n\nAll of this said, this is not terribly expensive for what you get, and location to the World Trade Center memorial, but just be ready to switch rooms, in some cases. Most rooms are nice, but there have been a few exceptions to me. \n\nThe restaurant upstairs is nice, as is the roof-top sitting area. Breakfast was really good, but a little pricey, not that this should deter you. Just don't order the $7 bacon on the side unless your meal just isn't filling enough. Service is great. \n\nBring exact cash for the vending snack machines. Snacks downstairs are decent, and coffee isn't bad, either. \n\nEverything in the hotel is hidden on a floor, so just pay attention. \n\nFinally, don't forget your keycard to use the elevator.

The stay started off poorly the moment my assistant and I checked into our room. It smelled terribly of feces. We paid to upgrade to a different room which turned out to be very nice. It was very clean and spacious. Problems began to arise on day 2 of our stay. We had a \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 sign on our door, however housekeeping still took it upon themselves to bang on the door. I was a little annoyed with this, but decided to let it go. \n\nThe day that we were scheduled to check out, housekeeping came banging at our door a full 2.5 hours before the required check out time (the do not disturb sign was on the door). I yelled out several times to notify her that we were still in the room. Instead of leaving, She actually opened the door and tried to come inside! Her opening the door ended up exposing me (who was fully nude and in the middle of changing my clothes) to about 5 or 6 guests who were in the hallway!  \n\nI of course was extremely angry! I told her that we were not ready to check out as yet. I immediately called down to the front desk to tell them about what happen and also to request a late check out time of about 30 minutes.  The person at the front desk told me it would be ok and that he would notify housekeeping. The same house keeper came knocking at our door a few minutes later (about 1.5 hours before checkout ) and asked us again when we would be leaving. I informed her that we had requested a late check out. After 30 mins, my assistant went out into the hallway to get water. The house keeper saw her and asked again when we would be checking out. At this point we both started to feel harassed. 5 minutes after my assistant had a conversation with the housekeeper, a male came banging at the door demanding to know when we would be checking out. This was approximately 1 hour before the required checkout time! After that, housekeeping came to the door again about 30 minutes later to ask the same question! We felt extremely pressured and harassed to get out of the room.\n\nWe called for the bellman service (as we had a lot of bags to move). It took the Bellman 30 minutes to come to our room with the luggage cart. When we were finally able to check out, the front desk girl told me (very condescendingly) that I am checking out late. I was extremely baffled by her tone and remarks. I informed her that I had requested a late check out hours ago. She seemed hell bent on chastising me. She then took it upon herself to tell me that I checked out later than I had initially told them I would be. I told her that the Bellman was 30 minutes late bringing the luggage cart! I decided to bring up the issue I had with house keeping to her. She didn\u2019t offer a single apology and frankly didn\u2019t seem to care. I felt like she just wanted me to shut up and get out.\n\nI felt extremely attacked and angry after that encounter.  Her attitude and disposition was so disgusting. What made matters worse is that I decided to call the manager to complain about the incident so that no other guest would have to face that level of embarrassment. I called twice and the manager never returned my phone call! \n\nOther terrible experiences we had at this hotel:\n\n*Bellhop did not offer to assist us with our luggage. Even the front desk rep (hispanic female) saw me having a hard time trying to pull the heavy cart and refused to offer me assistance. I literally had to ask for help, even then I was told that I could do it myself!!!\n\n*A different front desk clerk (black female) refused to acknowledge my assistant when she was waiting on line to ask a question!\n\nI\u2019m not sure what is going on with the staff and management at this hotel, but they really need to go in for serious training.  Our experience was deplorable!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Easy walk to Battery Park for trips to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, and close to subway stations, shops and restaurants.\nThe staff were friendly and helpful.  Rooms are comfortable and a decent size compared to the typical cramped NYC hotel room.  We visited in early July, when temperatures were in the mid 30s centigrade, and humidity 80-90% - so we were very grateful for the efficient air-conditioning in our room.  Communal areas, e.g. elevator lobbies, were hot and stuffy however.\nThe restaurant on the 20th floor has an outdoor seating area with fabulous views over the WTC memorial pools.  Breakfast is expensive, and the (slightly cheaper) continental option is poor value for money, with little to choose from.  However it's worth having breakfast at least once just for the view!\nWe were initially given a room on the 5th floor with a tiny window onto an internal courtyard, which was dark and dingy.

I can honestly say that his customer service and subtle mannerisms exuded nothing shy of professionalism. Now when you go upstairs to the rooftop bar, you got Dominique, one of the bartenders working. I can say that he made me and my friends feel nothing but welcome, was a great conversationalist, and knew how to do some amazing twists on conventional cocktails.

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":1595302,"title":"Our FIRST choice of hotels when visiting New York City!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-06-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This comfortable mid-range hotel is now our first choice for accommodation when visiting New York City from London.  We've stayed here many times now, and have never been disappointed.  Here's why we like it:\n1.  Rooms are very reasonably priced.  We generally select a superior room, as they offer very spacious accommodation at affordable prices.  New York is not usually known for its spacious hotel rooms, so this is a bonus for any stay in this city.  The hotel also offers cheaper Club and Standard rooms; these are not minuscule by any means.\n2. The rooms are light, bright, well equipped and extremely comfortable.  Our corner room on the 15th floor had windows on two sides; it afforded great views of the 9\/11 memorial and Museum, and  the One World Trade Center tower  looming skyward behind it.  Views aside, the room was spotlessly clean and neat, with a contemporary, relaxed feel.  It came with a microwave, coffee maker, fridge, and various pieces of crockery, glassware and cutlery, as well as a desk and comfortable sofa from which you could enjoy the beautiful view.\n3.  Like most Club Quarters hotels (and there's a number of this chain in New York City), it offers a few little extras:  reusable water bottles with spring water on tap, complimentary drinks and snacks in the evening, and speedy wifi.  There's irons and boards available from a closet on each floor.\n4.  We love the location of this hotel.  It's slightly removed from the frenzy of Midtown Manhattan, and thus presents a much calmer approach to accommodation in the city.  That said, it's not in a cultural wasteland, as there are significant New York City sights at  its doorstop. The hotel overlooks the 9\/11 Memorial and Museum and the One World Trade Center Tower.  The stunning Oculus, Wall Street, and Liberty Park (for the Statue of Liberty ferries) are short walks away.  Nearby is Brookfield Place with an abundance of eateries and retail outlets.  But like most of New York, everywhere in the city is really accessible by the subway network, and the hotel is only a short walk from a number of subway stations and lines.\n5.  The hotel has excellent accessibility to Newark Liberty International Airport via the PATH train which connects Newark - Penn Station directly to the World Trade Center.  The connections to Kennedy International take considerably longer, but are possible. \n6.  Where the hotel excels, and probably our major reason for choosing this hotel, lies with its outstanding customer service, delivered by its people.  Staff are welcoming, friendly, professional and efficient, and extremely knowledgeable.  Customer Services Manage Kevin Chan deserves and accolade. His help with everything, from sights, restaurants, and onward reservations at another Club Quarters hotel, was exemplary, and is exactly how other hotels should be dealing with their clients. \nSee you on our next visit to New York City.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room had a kitchenette with microwave, fridge and coffee machine (which we could not work out but the free coffee in the lobby was great!)  We used the kitchenette for breakfast and some snacks, it was very basic - only crockery & cutlery so you cannot really 'cook' but fine for keeping a stock of snacks for hungry kids.    Our 2 kids were on the sofa bed and the room easily had enough space for 4, we all had a comfortable and quiet nights sleep, although we would have liked an in room safe.  The location was great, quieter than mid town but a few different subway lines close by & an easy walk to Battery park for the ferry cruise to Statue of Liberty.  The snacks and free water was a great extra (although I guess that is what the resort fee covers), we had drinks at the bar on the 20th floor but did not eat at the restaurant, we also went to wine at 5pm a few times and that was great after big days of sightseeing, the staff were all very friendly and helpful.

Actually it is one building for two hotels with two different names so you never know where you are. The location is great, although a very touristic area in NY, everything around was quiet and next to a convenient shopping and dining area, and close to subways. I was given a room with the worst possible view, I think it is the one they keep for solo travelers. Rooms don't have a safe box. Instead you have to come all the way down to the lobby with your things in front of everyone and get locked in a tiny tiny room. Oh, but you do have a yoga mat in your room, everyone knows that is much more important. The capsule coffee in the room is really awful, but that is not to blame on the hotel, coffee sucks all across USA. Anyway they could offer Nespresso or DolceGusto instead. The building has two terraces, one facing the WTC with an expensive restaurant with expensive breakfast, another one with seats but where nobody cares for so if you want to enjoy a drink you have to go yourself to the opposite side of the building and ask for it. \nSome of the lobby staff are ok, but others are not that friendly, they just seem to want to get rid of you soon. Also they should take a look every now and then to check that not all children of one family take over the computers for guest use. A couple of times I found cups and plates lying on the floor in front of the elevator that remained for days without any staff to remove them. The wine event every day is nice but it could be relocated to a later hour or make it last longer. I appreciate the coffee, soft drinks and snacks in the lobby.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

If you are in a pinch and must have that location, be prepared to \"rough it\" and pay for the privilege as this hotel relies heavily on its prime location to convince clients they are getting a good deal.

It`s near from 3 subway lines, and for us that was a differential (even though we prioritize walking over getting subway). As we got the Air train from JFK to the city, it was very easy to arrive in this hotel.\n\nWe got blown away with the room! First because it is quite larger in comparison with most of hotels in NY. We were granted with a king size bed, and our room had a breath taking view from 9\/11 Memorial. Sheets and towels are in excellent quality. \nPlease note that the room has minibar as well!! This is a great deal, and again, most hotels in NY don`t offer this benefit. \n\nOther points that must be highlighted as well: unlimited chilled bottled water, coffee machine in the room, hair dryer, iron and ironing board (this was excellent as well!! we had to use in some of our clothes), 24\/7 gym (I personally got amused by this, since I work out daily), the \"snack attack\" table (another excellent touch CQ!! congrats for this great table full of snacks, beverage, and coffee machine all for free), free wine from 5pm to 6pm (we enjoyed this so much, specially those rainy days after long walks around manhattan).\n**Free Wi-Fi with outstanding signal!!** They also offer a space with computers so you can check your e-mails, get your boarding pass back home, or just surf in the internet.\n\nThe rooftop has an outstanding view!! We visited it in our last night stay in the hotel and had some drinks. It is a very calm and pleasant space.\n\nTravellers, sorry for this big text, but we really loved this hotel and wanted to express to you how satysfied we got. If you are in doubt, choose the option that will be the best cost benefit to you!! CQ Hotel will definitely be this number one option and will blow away you as we are.\n\nCongrats to all the staff for the great amenities, service and overall experience.

The man at the front desk said he was unable to check me out because the system would not allow him to. He advised I would get an email the following day. I did not. I then called the hotel to explain my situation and asked to be credited for the night I did not use. They acknowledged I only stayed one night and credited only the service fee and directed me to call Amex Travel for the additional credit for the one day I did not use. Amex advises the hotel needed to authorize the credit. After waiting a month Amex received no response from the hotel and I proceeded to dispute the charge. I was told I could not be credited for the one night I did not use because the hotel stated I didn\u2019t advise I was checking out and called the hotel two days later. The hotel already acknowledged on record I did not stay the second night with the refund of the service fee and due to their incompetence and unwillingness to be fair they have lost a customer:","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

My room shower was leaking a lot. Personally I don\u00b4t like big soft mettress and pillows, they hurt my back, and because of that i couldn\u00b4t have a proper rest. I missed a concierge service, there are few people at the front desk, sometimes only one, so it's hard for them to help the guests on more complicated matters, and they show some irritation when this is asked of them. Except in the reception and the ground floor, the interior of the hotel is too hot. Because off the lightness, the shower curtain always sticks in our legs.

Is it normal to check and make sure that your bed is made properly at this type of property? I think not. I also found myself sinking down every night between the two single beds that were pushed together into a king. Additionally, I found a previous guest's extra suit jacket buttons on the desk next to the coffee maker tray--yuck!!

He told us we had to ring the bell. Clearly we had no idea that there was a bell and then he went on to make rude comments that it was right in front of us. We checked in on the opposite side of where this employee was and I asked the person assisting us if he could then show us where the bell was for future reference.

Over the years I have grown to love the Club Quarters Brand even for personal travel.  This particular hotel is within a 10 minute walk to my office and within a 10 minute walk to a number of excellent restaurants.  They offer several perks that I don't receive at other hotels such as free wine from 5-6pm in the lobby, an espresso and snack bar throughout the day, and fitness equipment in the room.  Since the last time I stayed here they started offering a grab and go breakfast service for under $8!  The breakfast options are very filling too.  The only negative is the rooms only have showers, and the bedding isn't comfortable.  I highly reccomend Club Quarters and specifically the World Trade Center location given the quality and price.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The sink in that room is cracked completely in half. I felt underneath and it seems to have been repaired with caulk or something similar, and the sink is watertight. Nonetheless, it was pretty unsettling to have to wonder if the sink would leak, and not in line with the impression the hotel seemed to want to make.\n\nThe bed in my room was a Murphy (folding) bed, which was a little surprising. If that's the furniture choice, however, I do recommend that when the room is cleaned the bed should be lifted up and carpet under the bed vacuumed. That was not the case; there was dust and scraps of paper under the bed.\n\nMore minor, the lighting above the bed wasn't working well. There are two holes for lights in the headboard\/cabinet, but only one opening had a light. The dimmer switch to control them is in poor condition, and the one light did not dim, it flickered. Also, water pressure was low and hot water was not very hot at 7am.\n\nOn the plus side, the bed was comfortable and wifi was strong.\n\nI was really puzzled by the relationship between Club Quarters and the World Center Hotel. They are in the same building. Their doors from outside are right next to each other. Their lobbies are back to back. And when I got my key and went upstairs, I had to walk past the World Center Hotel's elevators to get to my room, which was above the World Center's lobby.

Free snacks, soda, wine for a hour a day, you can do your own laundry if need be, and the rooms are awesome due to the views! I have stayed here in the past before because I love the hotel so much, the views are spectacular and love that some of the rooms have the glass wall basically to look out. The rooftop is awesome. I was super bummed though to find out there will be a huge massive tower building going up infront of Club Quarters, the views will now basically be staring right at a building (so kiss any view goodbye unless you pay more to have a suite and have the 9\/11 memorial view). Of course this is nothing the hotel can do anything about, but seeing this was ALWAYS my go to hotel and have never had a issue, I am deeply saddened I will have to now look for another spot. Again, this is nothing on the hotel itself, it is out of their control where building decide to go up. But the view and glass lookout wall in the rooms were my main reason for always staying here. I will always love this place, and I made sure to appreciate the view one last time. Thanks for everything CQ!","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we first arrived they took my card and took a \u2018pending\u2019 payment which was 25% more than the cost of the stay. This was removed when we checked out and we were charged the proper amount, however there was no communication to why the card was charged this much - I can only guess a safety deposit.\n\n2. We booked the thanksgiving dinner at the hotels restaurant for 8PM. When we arrived we were seated and our drinks order took, then when we came to order the thanksgiving meal which we had RESERVED, we were told they had sold out.

Was in town with my husband to see my son. Selected this hotel based on price and reviews.  Below are pros and cons:Pros:-great location.  Literally right next to the 9\/11 Museum and fountains.   Had a great view directly overlooking the fountains.  -had an upgraded room that was spacious-loved the free snacks and sodas\/coffee in the lobby-loved the fact that the only extra charge for room service was $2.50Cons:-Bedspread had stains on it -bed was hard as a rock-doors to bathroom and sitting room were foggy glass - so if you were sleeping you would get light from the sitting room.  And the glass door to the bathroom provides very little privacy.  -no exhaust fan in bathroom -hotel has 2 names which was very confusing and I still don\u2019t know exactly which one I stayed in. -upon arrival found that the electric outlet for the coffee maker was broken.  Requested it be fixed 3 times.  Only had someone show up after I said don\u2019t worry about it we were leaving the next day.  Told them face to face not to send anyone else.  10 minutes later mantienance was at the door asking to fix it.  It was almost comical the lack of concern they had for taking care of this issue or respecting my wishes.  I had to order room service coffee at my expense.  Asked at checkout if they could take that off the bill.  I got the same answer I got during my stay about the broken plug \u201cwe will look into this\u201d.  My guess is they won\u2019t follow up nor could care less.  -came back in the evening on the second day to find our breakfast dishes still sitting in our room.  Called down to ask if someone could please come take it away and reminded them to fix the plug.  Came back from dinner and it was still there (and still broken outlet) What\u2019s wrong with this place?  I\u2019ve honestly never seen such a lack of concern for satisfaction.  They honestly asked like they could care less. If you stay here be prepared to be treated as a inconvenience rather than a valued customer.  ","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It's within walking distance of several other subway stops, the seawall along the Hudson River, Whole Foods, shopping centres and great restaurants.  You really won't need a car while staying here.\nThe hotel actually shares two names, Club Quarters and the World Centre Hotel.  You can access either hotel via the front doors or through the lobbies.  There are four elevators helping to get you to your rooms without delay.  There is a lovely lounge area where you can enjoy complimentary coffee, soft drinks and snacks throughout the day and drink some free happy hour wine (from a vineyard on Long Island...it's pretty good too!) from 5:00 to 6:00.  There is a business centre and a meeting room open to all guests.  On the top floor there is a restaurant\/bar with outside seating.  The view from there is quite breathtaking.  We didn't eat at the restaurant but the menu looked inviting.  One terrific bonus was the water station on each floor.  Bottles are provided for you to fill with filtered water.\nYou can become a member of Club Quarters which gives you special hotel privileges but it's not necessary, you still get good perks.\nThe rooms are small but clean and comfortable.  We had one overlooking ground zero, the new WTC buildings and the memory pools.  The view was really spectacular but also very sad when you stop to think of the destruction that occurred there just 17 years ago.  \nWe had no trouble with check in however when at reception I requested a room away from the elevator.  When we went up with our luggage to the room, it was located directly across from it.  I called the front desk and the clerk was happy to change us to a different and much larger room. The maid service was great and the staff are all very friendly.  My only real complaint would be the towels.  They were so rough they felt like sandpaper.  Toiletries were provided and there was a Kureg coffee maker (with coffee) and a small fridge in the room, along with two flat screened TV's, a desk and a sofa bed.  The king sized bed was very comfortable, linens clean and fresh.  All in all, there was plenty of room for two people to live comfortably for a week.

I\u2019ve read a bad review or two about this hotel and honestly I have no idea what they were complaining about. I loved this place. It\u2019s amazing how a great hotel can be the cherry on top of a great vacation. \n\nWhile they don\u2019t offer a free breakfast, they do offer many cool freebies. They have an automatic coffee machine in the lobby that grinds up the beans and makes you a fresh cup of coffee or expresso. They put out chewy granola bars in the morning. They have these devices that will dispense peanuts, m&ms, wasabi somethings, and snack mix. I think they have a wine social thing around 5pm-ish. They have a fridge with free cans of soda. They have free laundry room machines with free detergent and Bounce dryer sheets. I think they have an exercise room, but who needs that in NYC?  \n\nThe room was Goldilocks. Not too big, not too small, just right. Nice queen bed with crisp white sheets. Pillows were eh...ok. Blackout curtains. Nightstands with plenty of outlets to charge devices. Desk to shoot off some emails. Wall mounted tv with plenty of channels to watch while you\u2019re resting your feet. Nice bathroom with plenty of counter space.

Right around the corner from a \u201cI Heart NYC\u201d souvenir store and many tasty restaurants. Short walk to Brooklyn Bridge too. \n\nI will always try to stay at CQ on future trips to NYC and any other cities I travel to. \n\nIf I had to nitpick something...it would be the coffee they provide in the room. Nasty K-cup coffee. Doesn\u2019t even taste like coffee. Maybe bring some K-cups you like if you\u2019re into that. I\u2019m coffee snobby I guess. ","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

Unusually empty in the streets during the evening (though it felt safe.)  A much different experience than staying in Midtown where you are surrounded by restaurants, coffee places etc.If you are going to visit the WTC Memorial, this is an excellent location for your stay.

A couple staying more that two days would have difficulty finding enough room for their clothes.\n\nThe man who checked me in was pleasant, informative, and efficient.\n\nWhen I got to my room, there was a big bag of trash and a big bag of recycling inside. It\u2019s a small thing but possibly indicative of other management issues. \n\nThe elevators are slooooooooooow. Part of the problem is that the building has four elevators but only two are supposed to be used by hotel guests. And one morning one of the elevators was off line for maintenance. But even when the elevators are running, they are very slow for such a tall building.\n\nChecking out, the online system did not work. It was especially frustrating because it let me enter all the information into the system but then wouldn\u2019t accept the \u201cGO\u201d command. So I went to the lobby to checkout and nobody was there. I had a meeting to get to, so I called afternoon to have them send me a receipt (since previously I tried to add my stay to their app, but the system couldn\u2019t find the reservation).\n\nIn sum, enough things went wrong on this stay that I\u2019ll definitely check out one of the many other hotels in the area on my next trip.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

On every floor there is a (free) self service chilled water station so you can fill the provided bottles or your own container. This is so convenient and saves me easily $15-$20 a day because I don't have to call room service or go find a store to buy drinking water. Downstairs is a little food and refreshment station where you can get coffee, cappuccino, fruit, peanuts and other snacks etc. Recently they added a happy hour with wine at 5:00 pm which is also free of charge and unheard of at a hotel in New York City.

However, when I checked back there was a different receptionist (Andrew) who told me the room would not be ready for ANOTHER 30 min. When I booked the room I was told check in was at 4pm\u00a0 but now I'm waiting for an hour for a room I guaranteed for a certain time.\u00a0 When I inquired what was the additional hold up Andrew told me it was because they didn't have many suites and the previous people checked out late.\u00a0 I asked for a manager and Andrew said he was a manager I asked for a card with his name on it and he gave a 8x11 blank sheet of paper with his name drawn on it in obscenely large font.\u00a0 I didnt even mind waiting but it is beyond disrespectful how Andrew handled the situation. We were a party of four from out of state and 2 of them were senior citizens so as a MANAGER he should have been more hospitable and considerate. Again, I understand the situation with waiting for the room but what I don't understand is how a manager would treat a guest like this and a guest that had already paid. Frankly, after my interaction with Andrew I would not have stayed at the hotel if I had not already paid.\u00a0 While we were waiting Andrew did give a complimentary breakfast for 2 but as I already stated I had a party of four so it did little to assuage the situation. When we finally checked in and let another receptionist know about our experience she did apologize but it's hard to get the distaste from your employee's classless act out of my mind. When we got to the room I called down to get extra towels and spoke with Kevin who gave impeccable service. The next day 8\/18 at around 3pm I called the front desk from my room 4 or 5 times over the course of 30 min and received no answer. I went outside to the hallway phone by the elevator and none other than Andrew picks up I asked for towels. I advised Andrew of my attempts with my room phone but similar to his apathy from the previous day he did not acknowledge what I said about no response when I called from the room and simply said I'll send towels to your room. In closing, each incident is understandable I get that other guest check out late I get that the front desk could have been busy and no one was able to pick up but how Andrew handled these situations i do not understand nor will i tolerate his actions and that what has escalated it to the point of me complaining to an associate when I checked out.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Close to several subway lines, WTC, Oculus... Hudson River Park, etc.  I would like to highlight the service of Albert at the front desk.  Our daughter came into town for our second night and he kindly switched our room to one that would accommodate three people comfortably.  We had our own private balcony\/patio with furniture that overlooked the WTC pools, Freedom Tower and even a view of the Hudson River for fireworks on the 4th of July!  Each interaction we had with a front desk employee was extremely pleasant but Albert definitely went above and beyond.  Thank you!","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We got an upgrade to a suite on the 17th floor with a view of the WT memorial. Because the room wasn\u2019t ready yet we also got a voucher to spend at the restaurant on the 20th, where we also enjoyed the view and the burgers with fries, very good timing!\n\nThe room was big, with an extra space with a fold out sofa and floor to ceiling windows with an amazing view, we slept with the curtains open! The bed is comfy, and the sofa bed although a bit thin was too.\nThe view is so amazing and you find yourself coming back to it whenever you are in the room.\n\nThe hotel has excellent extra\u2019s such as free soda\u2019s and nibbles like m&ms and peanuts, apples and oranges, free coffee and tea and wine o\u2019clock with free wine.\nThe small kitchen area with fridge, plates and spoons\n\nThe location is great. You are straight next to the memorial, one world observatory and the oculus, walking distance to the free ferry to see the statue of liberty.\nAlso places like hudson eats  where you can very easily taste different kinds of foods are very close ( eatily and a le district) and great for kids!\nThe subway is a few minutes walk to the oculus. The financial district with the walks along the river way walk more relaxed than we expected and we were surprised about the amount of people walking around in the evening.\n\nWe loved the fridge and kitchenarea to have our cornflakes at in the morning.\n\nThis hotel has really made our stay in new york extra special.

Only 2 blocks from the Rector St. subway station for the #1 train uptown. Special touches at CQ include 5-6 Happy hour with free wine and snacks every day, a water station with water bottles to take with you on your excursions, and a big fruit bowl in the lounge for replenishing your energy. Rooms are very nice, larger than we expected; our Junior suite was plenty large enough for us and our 12 year old grandson on the pull out bed. We will stay here again even if our trip only includes mid-town and uptown, it is so easy to grab the subway and half the price with more room and amenities than a mid-town hotel.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}
