Try to get a high floor away from the elevators to avoid the street noise.  There is a nice coffee shop right across the street from the hotel called Seven Grams and Essen offers good informal breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals.  I was not overly impressed with the Italian restaurant adjacent to the hotel and would rate is as average; however, there are plenty of other excellent dinning locations close to the hotel.  The Westville restaurant was quite good and reasonable and within two blocks of the hotel. I recommend this place especially if you can get a high room with a north facing view and are planning to stay in SOHO.

This was at 2:59 PM on August 28 \u2013 the day prior to my leaving for NY.\n\nThe employee I spoke with assured me there was no construction going on at the hotel and, \"All of that was old news\". I explained my work needs and she assured me she would place me in a room far away from any sort of neighborhood construction noise.\n\nUpon checking in at approximately 2 PM on Tuesday, August 29, I was directed to my hotel room. The room had scaffolding outside my window and one of the first noises I heard was a jackhammer.\n\nI phoned the Bonvoy Customer Service line where the person I spoke with told me that since  I had \u201calready checked into to hotel so now there was nothing he could do about this\u201d. He actually said to me that \u201cYou should have complained before you checked in\u201d. I did enlighten him to the fact that I could not see &\/or hear my room \"before I checked in.\" and he responded with, \"Sorry but that\u2019s the policy\". (I had tickets for the theater so I could not pursue this conversation longer.)\n\n(Side note: The security lock on my door would not close securely so I had to prop a chair against it that night before bed.)\n\nThe next morning, I called down for room service so I could have breakfast while working. I was told there was no room service. I asked if I needed to go downstairs to breakfast and I was told there was no breakfast. This is in spite of having room service menus, breakfast advertisments, etc. in the room. \n\nI asked if he could please call one of the local shops or restaurants that delivers and he told me I would have to call Uber Eats or GrubHub. I\u2019ve spent too much time in NY to know that every hotel has their close \u201cfavorites\u201d that the hotel uses for both employees and guests.   \n\nAt this point I again called Marriott Bonvoy Customer Service where \u201cThey value my long relationship\u201d. I spoke with a young man who told me I could check out of the hotel but I would forfeit my 209,000 points for all 5 nights. I was transferred to a Supervisor who was apologetic but still insisted that I might get reimbursed for the remaining 4 nights but not for the points I\u2019d spent on this first night.\n\nI asked if she could assist me with finding another hotel for the remaining 4 nights and she did find a couple hotels in the $400 - $600 price range. I asked that surely she could find a discount for me since I was in this bind through no fault of my own. She offered a couple AAA or ARRP discounts but clearly did not actually *try* to assist me. After this waste of a call, she didn\u2019t apologize for not assisting me but told me, \u201cThank you for being a valued Gold Elite Member\u201d.\n\nNot being willing to stay in a Marriott-affiliated hotel after this fiasco I ended up spending $498 per night for a room at another hotel which met my needs - meaning no construction and with room service.\n\nI have filled out every Marriott form, contacted various customer service phones and emails, and have only been given the run-around. I've been told that they \"Will take care of your situation', but now, over ONE MONTH later I am still out 209,000 points for less than 20 hours in a terrible hotel.\n","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

The location is superb - walkable to all of mid to lower Manhattan, easy to find, and with relatively quiet street noise at night. The room was larger than expected, and the bed\/pillows was remarkably good for the price-point. Front desk was friendly and efficient, and had free water bottles on offer. The clerk was also more than helpful in storing my suitcase on my last day and retrieving it quickly on request. The associated restaurant had a nice outdoor bar with good Happy Hour specials. Bartender Jora (name I may have wrong, but she was a beautiful young Albanian woman)) poured a mean gin & tonic and was super friendly and storied.  This place is a gem.  My only complaints - stingy on the thin bath towels, no individual toiletries, and miniscule bar of subpar soap took away from the otherwise pleasant showering experience.

A beautiful view of the city from the top floor of the Hotel !\nMy girlfriend loved the room and the view.\nKudos Chris..Thanks..!\n\nHad a fantastic time walking the Village and remembering the old spots. Stopped by SOB's on our way back to the hotel, and realized that I'm getting older, as there were just kids standing in line. The Door men didn't even know who Phyliss Hyman was. Oh.. She packed the place back in the 80's. Doorman told me he was born in 1990..Ha..\nBack to the Hotel.. Girlfriend loved the view, and a great night of sleep, after a great evening out.\n\nHit breakfast the next morning, and saw Chris again back at the Front Desk during check out. Again, the guy seemed to have everything under control as some European guest were checking out and end.\n\nWas a quick one night stay.. But, the upgrade, simple hospitality, and cozyness of the hotel will be in my memory banks for a long time. \n\nI've been to two other N.Y. properties since.. Both nice.. But, not memorable.\n\nTo the hotel Management- Chris is a keeper.. Hope it works out well for him and the Hotel.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We are so excited to get settled and get our little one to sleep because it is her bed time and the front desk people tell us that they sorry for the inconvenience but that they overbooked us and that they have no room available.  Mind you I never received any email or call absolutely nothing!!! It is mid December so it is freezing outside and there are no hotels available within a 100 mile radius. I am crying with my tired two year old baby girl in hand. My husband is frantically calling all hotels in the area and it is not until almost midnight when we find a Quality Inn that can take us in for the night all the way in Jersey in a very dangerous part of town. I felt sick to my stomach putting my daughter in danger and my husband felt awful doing this to his girls but we had no choice. It wasn't till 2am by the time we got to the hotel and were settled. We called Hilton which we are reward members with and they stayed on the phone with us for an hour desperately wanting to help us find something.  Thank goodness they did and we were able to check in the next morning to a Hilton in the city. I can tell you that I never write reviews but I felt inclined to do so.

The front desk, cleaning and restaurant staff were very pleasant, and I felt that had I had any special requests, they probably would have helped me out.

The fan was extremely loud, but worked to effectively block any and all noise. The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of outlets. The bathroom was very, very small, with a counter that wouldn't fit much on it and an odd faucet setup that made it virtually impossible to wash one's face without getting water everywhere. But, the water pressure was excellent -- better than home! There are only two elevators, which often meant a bit of a wait. The lobby gets cramped easily during popular check in and check out times. The fitness centre has good equipment, but not much of it; however, I didn't really see more than one person there at any given time, so probably not an issue.

Also, the hotel is close to many Deli shops, grocery places, restaurants and also from the Hudson River Front. \n\nThe room and my stay:\nMy room was on the 17th floor with a fantastic view. The room was very clean and the staff would regularly clean it daily and refill the complementary provisions and bathroom accompaniments. The room consisted of a big bed with soft pillows and quilt and a comfortable study table. On the front facing wall, there was a big glass window from where I used to enjoy the mornings. A coffee maker and complimentary coffee making ingredients would help me to burst my stress after the day at the office. There was sub-zero temperature in New York with snowfall during my trip.

Water was complimentary for me and I never faced any issue in requesting for as much as I required.\n\nThe bathroom consists of a bathtub with 24 hours of hot water supply, a toilet commode and a wash basin with mirror. The provisions include soap, shampoo, conditioner, towel, napkins, toilet paper, cotton, etc. There are plug points for hair dryer\/shaver.\n\nEach room has electronic keys which are assigned to the guests during check-in. The hotel also has an ATM machine, a snack vending machine, and a complimentary ice-vending machine in the basement apart from a convenient small gym.\n\nThe staff is very professional and helpful. They are soft-spoken and always smiling.

They offer very healthy breakfast options at reasonable cost.\n\nI loved the fact that the whole hotel premises is a no-smoking zone.\n\nI would definitely recommend my friends to stay at Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan SoHo Village and if I am again traveling to New York, then I would also look forward to staying again here.\n \n\nSigning Off\nHiral Amodia\n(TheHeeBee)","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The charm ends in the lobby, though.\n\nIt's Manhattan, and an older building at that, so one expects small rooms and bathrooms. One does not expect an old, uncomfortable mattress and a badly engineered bathroom. Example: the single towel or bathrobe hook is located directly above the light switch (so if a towel is drying there, you have to grope around for the switch) and behind the shower door opening (you have to exit the shower to fetch your towel from either the toilet seat (the handiest place to put it) or exit the shower and close the shower door to get your towel off said hook.

I had a great meal at the hotel restaurant and would say that their pizza is some of the best I've ever had, even in NY City.  Stop by for pie, but find another hotel.  \n\nThe no-frills room I had (306) was horrible for two main reasons: 1) It was designed for handicapped access, which sounds good but the floor was uneven throughout the entire room; I can't imagine how a person in a wheelchair could navigate that without getting caught in ruts - what were they thinking?. 2) The temperature control is useless; the bathroom and heater were on the opposite sides of the room and the bathroom was FREEZING, to the point that I was shivering even before I got in the shower even with the heater on its highest setting for 5 hours. All it did was heat up the closet (which is half-sized, by the way; if you have a long coat or dress, it will crumple up on top of the safe). The ice cold stone bathroom floor doesn't help, nor did the tub, which didn't drain.  Asking a handicapped person to move from a wheelchair to the tub and back in those conditions is just plain cruel and unconscionable.  There's no refrigerator either and I could hear everything going on in the room next door. The cost of the room was extremely high for what it offered too: try the Hampton Inn on  Watts or the Arlo on Hudson or the James if you need to stay in the area.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It isn't any worse than normal NYC street noise, just something to note when booking the hotel.\n\nMy husband and I were both traveling for work and got a room on the 21st floor that was already renovated. It was cute and had enough room for both of us, other than the bathroom. This is a teeny tiny bathroom and the shower is small as well. A large person would have trouble maneuvering. Toiletries were nice, but smelled a little manly.\n\nIt was much noisier than I expected (not counting the construction), but that may have been because the window had an issue and didn't close all the way. We got a lot of street noise (surprising from that high up) and it was rough during rush hour since room 2101 overlooks the entrance to the Hudson Tunnel. The noise in the hotel was more than what I would have expected also, considering there were only 6 rooms on the floor. A lot of doors banging throughout the evening.\n\nThe bed was not very comfortable. Every time my husband would shift in his sleep, the whole bed would move. It was also not very firm, so if you like a soft and jiggly bed you may enjoy it. \n\nWe also were supposed to have bottled water in our room but housekeeping must have missed that, so I had to ask for it at the front desk (along with an extra towel). Everyone at the front desk was super friendly every time we interacted, and the gentleman bringing us towels and water almost beat us to the room.\n\nThe lobby is pretty tiny but we didn't spend much time there. The elevators were actually pretty quick for us on the 21st floor; I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nOverall, I would stay here again if the price is right. Convenient to the 1,3 and the ACE lines, short walk through a cute neighborhood to get to Broadway, plenty of restaurants nearby (and a Starbucks!) but away from the smell and traffic of Canal.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1157456,"title":"Cramped, bare-bones Sheraton property","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-01-27","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"We stayed at this property for two nights in January, mid-week. The site at this time is undergoing renovations (currently 2nd-4th floors), and some of the inconvenience of our stay was due to the workers tying up one of the two elevators during the day for freight. The construction also makes the hotel quite messy, with plaster chips on the carpets. I can work around the inconveniences and mess caused by renovation, but other issues mean that until it's done, I would not recommend this hotel to others.\n\nThings I appreciated. \n1. The front desk staff. Unfailingly friendly and helpful. Helped us resolve a room issue with speed and two breakfast vouchers in apology. \n2. The housekeeping staff. Friendly and funny. When you're all sharing a single elevator you get a little esprit du corp. \n3. The bed was comfortable--nice range of pillow types.\n4. The makeup mirror was mounted at a height that made it usable. \n5. Shelf in the shower that is perfect for a coffee cup.\n6. Good blackout curtain. \n\nRed flags:\n1. My biggest gripe with our room was that the big industrial power strip (that we plugged all our tech into) is controlled by one of the wall switches by the door. No sign tells you this. When we turned out the lights for the night, we inadvertently turned off the power strip as well--and in the morning woke up to completely dead phones. \n2. The bed is a good size--but the room is not. Probably okay for one, very cramped for two. \n3. The shower is narrow, further constrained by a metal grab bar on the wall, and a metal door handle on the door. I estimate about 2 feet of clearance between these two bars, which makes drying off tricky. \n4. Our shower did not drain promptly-could have been just our room.\n5. No valet or doorman on staff. They use a local service to valet the cars, but when you arrive you have to go in and ask at the front desk to have your car valeted, then leave the keys. \n6. The exercise facility in the basement  is one of the smallest I've seen. 4 machines (1 each of treadmill, elliptical, regular bike, reclining bike), and a set of hand weights. \n7. No Club level, though that just may be the Four Points brand. \n8. Ice and vending (for 22 floors) in a single location (the basement). \n9. The blackout curtain in our room was hard to pull up--the metal chain had no gripes so you have to wrap it around your hand to get a good hoist. \n10. The water in the shower is baffling. Turning the knob counter clockwise turns the water on, then off, then on, then off. The markings of Hot and Cold don't correspond to anything on the knob. It takes a while to find the right position for a good temp, and you just have to go on intuition and have patience.\n11. The hot water is scalding hot. Be careful. \n\nSome reviewers have pointed out the convenience of location, and we did find that to be true for points in Lower Manhattan. But there are a lot of other hotels in the area, and we'll be looking there next time.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's NYC. You squeeze around the bed to get to a small bathroom. I never spend any more time in a hotel than I have to when I travel. I'm either out exploring, or in the bathroom getting ready to go out, or in the bed. I don't need a lot of room, just a comfortable bed. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean and serviced daily, the a\/c worked (it was July), the coffee pot didn't work and it took a few tries to get one that did, but there is a Starbucks a block away. What I disliked was that the woman at the front desk kept telling me my coffee pot worked and kept trying to explain to me how to turn it in (seriously?) and I had to insist that she send maintenance up AGAIN (she didn't want to do it) and when maintenance arrived, it took him all of 30 seconds to determine that the coffee pot did not work and promised to get me one that did. It took that third try to get one that worked. \n\nI might stay there again, but for my next trip to NYC (planned for May 2018), I've booked a different hotel, not because my coffee pot didn't work, but because the woman at the front desk treated me like an idiot who didn't know how to turn on a coffee pot.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

The staff is really nice and helpfull. The location was very central, close to different subway stations and lots of bars and restaurants just around the corner. The bed and shower were really good, which I think is very important when you only come to the hotel to sleep and shower. \nFor a New York hotel, the rooms are pretty spacious so you could actually lie down the suitcases somewhere.\nOn Wednesdays there is a free beer and snacks in the bar for the hotel guests. \n\nBathrobes, soap, showercaps, bodylotion and whatsoever were available, but you needed to ask for it. It would have been nice if it was already in the room. They were not very generous in the coffee, tea and water supplies in the rooms. We only got one bottle of water every day while we were two. \nWe were at the 4th floor and had to keep the blinds shut all day because everyone from the office across the street could see straight into our room. I guess that might be better on a higher floor or on the other side of the building. \nThe aircon\/heater made a hell of a noise so it was quiet warm in the room during the night. \nThe room was good isolated from the other rooms, so you couldn't hear your neigbors, but the windows and the door were not. So you could hear everything that happened in the corridor and outside, and New York is noisy! \nThe smoke alarm was covered with a plastic bag, I think because of the steam coming out of the bathroom that was right next to it, but nevertheless, not very safe in the case of fire.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The front desk staff was awesome and recommended us a place to eat for breakfast and which streets to go for good shopping. They were super helpful and printed us out directions if we needed it over the next few days and always helped us figure out what subway line to take. The room was pretty quiet, and left free water bottles in the room which was great. Would definitely recommend to a couple on a budget and wanting a super cool and convenient neighborhood to stay in. Lots of great non touristy restaurants and bars in the area as well as shopping! \n\nThank you for the fantastic memorable trip!","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I needed to get to Hoboken easily for a sports event and love Soho, Tribeca and the Village. This was the perfect area to stay. You can walk everywhere and the train is one block to get to most other parts of the city. It's a great base for bike-riding as well since the west side bike path is 2 blocks west. I was able to take advantage of it in Feb when the temps were 65! I parked for free on the street across from the hotel on the weekend, and could walk to the village, and Soho for meals and entertainment at most hours. The hotel was basic. Theres only like 10 rooms on each floor so its intimate. I needed to ask for a remote control which I've never had to do before, I think it was lost, but the staff brought i up quickly, The bath was renovated, but small, The toiletries were fine. The linens were clean ans crisp. I was out late (3am) and had a great night sleep. The coffee maker in the room was ok, but theres not enough creamers and sugar for more than one cup and the hotel did not offer replacements. There's free coffee in lobby in the morning til 10 though, and there a small restaurant and bar on site which I did not try but smelled good. \n\nI thought this hotel came with breakfast, as it did if you booked through hotels.com or their own site, but apparently the cheap rate on Hotels Tonight did not include it. The desk staff was not particularly helpful explaining it, and did not mention alternatives, or even where the restaurant was if I wanted to go anyway on my own dime. So even though the hotel was fine, the staff were not particularly enthusiastic. For the money and location this place was fine though.  There are trendier places around, but prepare to pay much more for those. They had a gym, but I did not use.\n\nThe hotel is under construction but I did not hear a peep, probably because it was the weekend (Fri night - sat)","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

We actually used the app Hotel Tonight and on that app, their users rated it at 87%, so we figured, it'll suffice. We only booked a 1 night stay but in just 1 night, we came to the realization we should've spent a bit more money and could've avoided possibly one of our worst stays in hotels ever! Now, don't get me wrong, we didn't book this hotel expecting a boutique experience, but there are just some things we have complaints about that shouldn't be present in ANY traveler's experience regardless of the $$ bracket of hotel. List is as follows:\n1. NOISY hallways\/rooms...If you cherish quiet and sound, consistent sleep, DO NOT STAY HERE!\n2. Uncomfortable beds...if you have even the slightest back problems, pregnant or are used to a nice, comfy bed, DO NOT STAY HERE! (The seats in my car are more comfortable than the queen bed in our room was, no joke!)\n3. Scratchy sheets...if you love slipping into a bed with sheets thread count >200 DO NOT STAY HERE! I swear the thread count on these sheets were 30..we could've used cardboard box panels and that would've felt smoother. \n4. Lobby bar does NOT sell water bottles....they offer 1 complimentary bottle of water with your stay & that would be fine if traveling solo, however, it was my wife & I staying there, so when we ran out of that, we went to the lobby bar to buy another bottle but they told my PREGNANT wife that they don't sell bottled water.. WTH! Love someone to explain that one to me. DO NOT STAY HERE!\n5. Cleaning staff too loud in the morning for turning rooms around...check out time is at noon and while that's pretty standard for any hotel, if you've read all the above grievances, you're expecting to sleep until pretty much 11am at latest. NOPE, not in this hotel! The cleaning staff must have been trained by paramilitary assault troops because at 9am it felt like the SS Troops were hollering and banging through rooms and the hallways waking you up (if you even were asleep still at 9am in the first place) DO NOT STAY HERE!\n6. Pillows are like flapjacks FLAT...Ever had to sleep on the floor without a pillow? Ever fall asleep on your desk pulling all nighters for college and your neck hurts because you didn't have a pillow? This is pretty much what you can expect of the pillow selection at this hotel. When you walk in the room, the bed has like 8 pillows on a queen size bed, but its a moot point if all of them are as flat as bar codes. DO NOT STAY HERE!\n7. Air Con unit leaks water...the entire time we had the A\/C unit on or the Heat on the system leaked water onto the carpet below. Since the room is already a small fit for that queen size bed, one MUST walk directly by that leaking A\/C unit so unless you keep your shoes on inside the room, you're pretty much playing in puddles by the window not to mention what mildew must grow in that room daily! DO NOT STAY HERE!","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It has easy access in and out of the city being right by the Holland Tunnel. Cabs are readily available on the Main Street 40 feet away. Or at most times right in front of the hotel. Service, from the second I walked in the door to the moment I left, was absolutely superb on every level. I was greeted immediately and checked into the hotel and overly accommodated with anything that I could possibly have needed. I went up to the room and everything was very well-appointed. It looked fantastic but a little tight and small. Rather immediately left the room and went on to some appointments I had in the city. Upon returning later that night I started noticing some of the details and it was definitely not up to the level of service that I experienced earlier. There were two windows behind the bed that were completely filthy and stained with cement. And were literally directly against the next building, not uncommon in NYC. It looks as if the hotel is under renovation on the upper floors. Which I guess is ok and a hotel needs to update so that's fine. But the noise from it definitely woke me up quite early around 7 a.m. The room itself when I reentered that night was freezing with the thermostat set on 70. I raised it up to 72 and the room became extremely hot....there was no balance. I think there were just some issues with the way the heater was operating. But it was one extreme or the other. Everything seems very very clean so housekeeping definitely doing their job. There is a portable closet in the room which for some reason absolutely stunk and I could not figure it out. That is where the safe was so I needed to go in and out of it but it really was bad as to some strange odor. Once again the room itself just lacked on some of those kind of details and the service is absolutely perfect. Most likely, I would return to the hotel and I am hoping that all the Kinks work themselves through once the rest of the renovations are done. There is also a Lobby restaurant downstairs that serves Italian and it has a bar. It isn't ok restaurant as well....Service sensational, food very good....needs a little attention to atmodphere of the restaurant.

The hotel is 21 floors, 8 rooms to a floor, with very narrow halls. There are two elevators and the wait for an elevator can be fairly long. \n\nI was on the top floor in a room that brings new meaning to the word \"cozy.\" Other words that come to mind? Tiny, cramped, cell-like . . . you get the drift. On a cost-per-square-foot basis, this may have been the most expensive hotel I've ever visited in Manhattan -- and that's saying something. \n\nI was less than thrilled when, in my \"cozy\" shower, there was very little water pressure at 6 am. And that was after a poor night's sleep due to a LOT of outside noise. It didn't seem to me that the architect designed in the noise reduction attributes I would have expected in a 24-hour city.\n\nThe property seems to have taken a fair amount of guest abuse -- there are lots of scratches, dings and scuffs.\n\nThe lobby works -- if you're the only guest. With two people waiting and their luggage, there was little room to spare. The \"fitness room\" is in the basement (subbasement?) with very limited space and equipment.\n\nCompared to the physical appearance and lack of charm of the property, the staff simply was awesome. Everyone I came in contact with had a wonderfully positive attitude and a genuine willingness to help. When a guest told the woman tending bar of a problem in the men's room (which is in the subbasement), she responded quickly and enthusiastically to get the engineer on it. When I mentioned a wi-fi connectivity issue to the front desk person, he had the Wi-Fi rebooted in minutes.","travelDate":"2016-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I also like the free coffee in reception in the mornings, it's nice to be able to grab a cup on my way out.  Location is also good, in a quieter area of Manhattan, but a five minute walk from Bleeker Street, and a ten minute walk from Greenwich Village, with all their bars and music venues.  Two minutes walk from a subway too, which leads directly up to Times Square and beyond.\n\nOn the negative side - don't stay here if you like to relax with a quiet drink in the hotel bar at the end of the day.  The bar is embarrassingly small - literally a bar with six bar stools in a corridor-like set up, and no other tables or chairs.  The walls are thin, and I could literally hear people coughing next door, and the ping of the lift being called during the night.  The air conditioning is really old-fashioned and terribly noisy.  There was a \"knack\" to flushing the toilet to stop it constantly flushing afterward. Even my TV was irritating - there's no \"menu\" function and it takes a couple of seconds to change channel, which is really annoying if you're just trying to flick through to see what's on!

I chose this location mainly for its proximity to work and things I wanted to do.  It's next to Greenwich village and is just a few minutes to walk to multiple subway stations.  There's also a Citi Bike rental nearby, a shared public bike rental service that makes for an excellent way to get around and see the neighborhoods quickly.\n\nWhen I stayed here in early November, I found the hotel staff and even the guests to be very approachable and friendly.  It was nice to enjoy a night cap at the bar and have some good rest.  Be aware, however, that this hotel does get a fair share of noise.  As other reviewers have indicated, there's construction during the day and you'll hear it on 3 of the 4 sides of this hotel.  The 4th side faces a busy road (Varick St).  If you're a light sleeper then you may need to choose between the constant noise of the busy road and the daytime construction.  The construction site is active at 7am and closes generally by 4pm Mon-Fri.  I was out of the hotel most of this time so the noise from the work site didn't affect me, and I was very happy to not be on the farthest end and facing the busy road.  A nice touch I found is that the hotel leaves ear plugs on the night stand by your bed even though New York is inherently noisy.\n\nAs to the quality of the room, I think the size is par for the course.  In fact, when compared to similar rooms by price elsewhere in NYC, Zurich, and Lima, the rooms in this hotel are a bit larger.  My stay was on the 10th floor and my room didn't feel updated but neither did it feel run down.  My only complaint is the loud air conditioner\/heater and the awkward shape of the shower.  I was unable to use the shower without bumping both sides, and it was made even smaller with the large mounted soap dispenser.. the bathroom by comparison is very large and the shower could have easily been a foot wider, but for some reason it wasn't designed that way.\n\nAll in all, I would stay here again.  The location to the restaurants and shops on MacDougal St and the subway stops made my visit much more enjoyable, and the staff at this hotel are both personable and friendly.","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location is close to the heart of Soho with plenty of great shops and restaurants.   The staff was generally energetic and helpful although the front desk staff doesn't seem to communicate well with each other.   More on that in a minute.   The problems with this Four Points are many, starting with the room size.  Think crackerbox.   If you want a view, you won't get one here.  Our room on the third floor offered intimate viewing angles of the construction project going on right outside our window.   As an added bonus, we experienced loud construction noise starting before the rise of dawn.  Our request to move to a higher floor was eventually given a pledge that we would be upgraded the following morning.   Somehow, I wasn't surprised when front desk personnel the next morning was unaware of this commitment and had no other rooms available.   \n\nThe term \"upgrade\", in this case, did not mean we could get a larger room.   I was assured by staff that all rooms at this Four Points are equally small.   An upgrade does mean that you will be on a top floor, with at least a modest, peek-a-boo view.  At an extra charge, of course.   \n\nOur friends in the adjoining room experienced flooding into the rest of the unit whenever they used the shower because the threshold was very low----an ADA room apparently---but without going to the expense of providing extra drainage, something clearly necessary in such cases.\n\nAnother budgetary practice at this Four Points was to use refillable containers for shampoo, conditioner and gel in the shower.   Our conditioner reservoir was empty.  The reservoir should contain enough conditioner to last a week, so this means they aren't refilled routinely and perhaps only when guests complain.  At a rate of over $300 per night, this hotel is a poor value.  With so many hotels in NYC, there is no doubt that there are many better choices for about the same price.","travelDate":"2015-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Kostenloses WLAN und Wasser fand ich gut.\nBar und Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck finde ich teuer bzw. nicht lecker, direkt am Eck ist ein \"Pret a Manger\", kann ich mehr empfehlen.\nDas Hotel ist LAUT, zus\u00e4tzlich ist noch eine Baustelle nebenan, in 2015 wird die bestimmt nicht fertig!\nUmweltschutz kennt man nicht, alle nur angefassten Handt\u00fccher werden sofort getauscht.\n\nMeine Kakerlakenprobleme:\n\u00dcber Nacht wachte ich zu 5 Kakerlaken im Badezimmer auf. Widerlich, aber nicht untypisch f\u00fcr New York, wie man mir sagte. Nur dass die meisten vielleicht mal nur 1 Kakerlake haben, nicht 5.\nBin also sofort runter zur Rezeption (aufgrund der fr\u00fchen Stunde war da noch der Nachtmanager) und habe das gemeldet.\nIch habe ihn dar\u00fcber informiert, habe ihm gesagt dass ich nicht in dem Zimmer bleiben will UND dass ich unbedingt duschen muss, da ich es sehr eilig hatte.\nLong story short - er hatte nicht wirklich Interesse an meinem Problem und sagte mir, dass ich nur in meinem derzeitigen Zimmer duschen kann (oh danke!?). Ein neues Zimmer bek\u00e4me ich fr\u00fchestens um 15:00. Au\u00dferdem k\u00f6nnten mir seine Kollegen sp\u00e4ter besser helfen.\n\nAlso, etwas beleidigt und w\u00fctend, bin ich zur\u00fcck in mein Zimmer und fand immer noch 3 Kakerlaken im Badezimmer.

Habe versucht, die Kakerlaken mit dem Sp\u00fclbecher zu fangen, die sind dann aber irgendwo in der Wand verschwunden. Immerhin ;)\nHabe anschlie\u00dfend in Rekordtempo geduscht und bin zur\u00fcck zur Rezeption. Da war mittlerweile das Tages-Personal anwesend.

Gut, habe alles nochmal erkl\u00e4rt - das Personal war aber auch kaum interessiert und \u00fcberrascht (Gru\u00df an alle nach mir Kommenden!) von den Kakerlaken schienen sie auch nicht.\n\nKurzum, wirklich entgegengekommen ist man mir nicht, man war auch nicht besonders hilfreich. Habe dann nur f\u00fcr die letzte Nacht ein neues Zimmer bekommen, was interessant stark nach Insektiziden roch ;)\n\nF\u00fcr mich ist das Hotel glatt durchgefallen.\nQualit\u00e4t zeigt sich erst, wenn etwas schiefgeht, und das war hier mehr ein Fiasko.\n\nMeine Firma hatte mir den Aufenthalt gezahlt, deswegen bat ich auch um eine Kompensation, ein Entgegenkommen, irgendwas. Es gab ja nicht mal eine Entschuldigung.\nMir wurden irgendwelche Punkte versprochen - aber ganz ehrlich, zum einen habe ich die nicht erhalten und zum anderen wei\u00df ich nicht, ob ich in dieser Kette jemals wieder buche.\n\nHabe dem Personal gesagt, dass wirklich nervlich am Ende bin und das alles auf Tripadvisor & Co landet.

I think they fixed it only temporarily as it tended not to work again at last day. \n- There was no cold water, only warm to boiling hot. Trying to get cold water, only \"air\" would come out of the tap and the toilet would start to make funny noises.\n- The battery for the door lock went empty at Friday midnight, and we were locked out for 2 hours (got compensated with a voucher for \"complementary breakfast\" at the hotel's restaurant. The breakfast was mediocre)\n- Finally, there's a construction site right next to the hotel (until December 2015, I read somewhere), so on workdays it was very noisy, but I don't blame the hotel for that. They provide earplugs as a countermeasure.\n\nThe good things were: \n- Location! Very close to subway stations, restaurants, Hudson river, etc.\n- Again, friendly staff!\n- Might be insignificant, but I liked the free complementary water bottles in the room.

It is located a bit away from the high traffic areas (although subway access is farily close), so once the construction next door is completed, there should be some solitude to be had.  In the mean time, you should expect some construction noise throughout the day and consistent noise each time a car passes over the metal plates on the street out front.  The project does not appear to be near completion within the next few months.  To help along those lines, they did provide ear plugs at check in.  The rooms were good size, fairly clean and had been recently updated.  The mattresses and linens were fairly new and the pillows were above average.  The bathroom was smaller in size and lacked adequate counter space.  That said, it was updated with new tile and fixtures.  The on site restaurant has an outdoor eating area and attentive staff.  However, the quality of the food did not meet our expectations for the price point.  They do offer discounted parking but the garage they use is a few blocks away, so the valet may be the better option for some.  The bottom line is a decent hotel with an associated reasonable price point.","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel is within walking distance of most things you would want to see in Tribeca, Chelsea and Soho. The High Line, Meatpacking district, Chelsea Market, Freedom Tower etc etc etc are all a 20 to 30 minute walk away. The hotel is also very close to many restaurants and bars. \n\nThe facilities-Like most NYC hotels, the rooms here are small. They are however well appointed. Beds are comfortable, bathrooms are renovated and the cleaning staff does a wonderful job of keeping everything looking great. The only downside is the air conditioner is super loud. I suggest ear plugs. \n\nThe Staff-This is the friendliest hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff were great. Yang and Brian at the front desk were super helpful, always greeting people and providing answers to any questions. I cannot stress enough how kind, warm and welcoming they were. They seemed to be able to handle the pressure of people showing up early for reservations and people checking out all at the same time.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's a bit pricey and it's worth it just don't get take advantage of. We live close by in NJ across the river so we usually just go home when we are done with the city. This time for Spring Break my young daughter wanted to stay. I found this hotel online with decent reviews and it was ok price wise for the area. We travel a lot and when we go away we sometimes order room service. She asked for room service and we agreed since it was a special stay. Well 2 pancakes, an orange juice and a tea went from about $20 to over $45. $25 of the bill were for service charges. I had to call and question the breakdown after my husband had paid for it The best part is that my daughter gave the service boy a $5 tip when he had already received $6 on the tab so he made $11 on $20 pancakes. Next time I think I will stick with Marriott which is where we usually stay. At least they don't extort you. By the way, most of the staff was very nice and helpful.

The location is great, close to the beating heart of Soho but down a quiet side street: we pulled up quite late but check in was easy enough (albeit they had forgotten to put up the travel cot, despite our having reminded them the night before, and could not send one up for fifteen minutes) and we were sent up to our suite on the top floor.\nConsidering it was reasonably priced for a suite we had not been expecting much but were pleasantly surprised, especially when drawing the blinds in the morning: the suite had massive windows with great views over Manhattan. The bedroom and living room were both of decent sizes for New York and we were able to put our baby down to sleep in the living room every night and have some quiet time in the evening to ourselves. Wifi was also free and good (multiple devices supported without any problems). One slight niggle was the air conditioning\/heating which was a bit patchy: it worked but, by design, allowed the rooms to get relatively chilly before kicking (noisily) back into action at random points in the night to heat the room up before switching off again to start the process once more. Also as a note the door separating the two rooms was not great.\nAll in all however a good budget conscious option for someone needing a bit of extra space in Manhattan, providing a quiet base from which to explore the bustle of Soho with the unexpected wow factor of some spectacular views.","travelDate":"2015-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room just barely fit 2 queen beds with hardly any space to walk around. But yeah, I understand that is the norm in NY.\n\nOther that that, the heater was ridiculously noisy. We had to have it on because it was cold outside, but it sounded like a train was in our room whenever it turned on. Luckily, I'm a pretty heavy sleeper but it really disturbed my mom to the point where she turned it off in the middle of the night, but then we both froze.\n\nThe toilet was also hard at flushing. We would have to hold the handle down for multiple seconds and even then, it barely flushed all the way.\n\nThere was also construction going on during our stay -- so if you are a light sleeper, I'd recommend trying to find out if the construction is complete.\n\nThe hotel was in a great location for this particular business trip, so that outweighed most of the negatives.

Check in was swift and friendly and the front desk person offered some dinner suggestions in the neighborhood. My room was on the 15th floor and had a northwest facing view. It was a king room and surprisingly maneuverable despite the limited floor space.  The bathroom was also full sized ( for a Manhattan hotel) and had a deep shower stall with a strong shower head. The bed was very comfortable and I slept well each night.  \n\nThe hotel itself is a narrow building and the hallways are small and tight. expect to hear every footfall and door slam if you are lounging in the morning hours when the maids are on the move.  The area it is located in is just below W. Houston and Varick.  I found it very convenient for taking the #1 train uptown for meetings and for walking to and from the Soho and Bowery area attractions.\n\nI would certainly stay at this hotel again.

The rooms are furnished and decorated with modern style, everything is spotless and clean, and all staff members (from front desk to housekeeping) are above and beyond friendly, more so than anywhere else that I've stayed in NY. There's also free wifi, reasonable incidentals deposit fees, a great fitness room, and a bed and pillows so comfortable, you'll find it hard to want to get out of it every morning. Close to subways and walking to restaurants, spas, salons, and shopping. I did encounter a number of issues, however, during my stay - more than what is acceptable for the price I paid. The 1st room I was assigned to had a cold draft (window hole?) coming from outside, so I was quickly and kindly assigned to another room, and upgraded. When I went to the fitness room, which looked untouched, the temperature was at 60 (freezing! felt colder than outside!) and the TV remote controls didn't work; a maintenance man quickly came to fix the problems with a smile. As I was getting ready to go out, the sink handle wouldn't turn. Again, someone came to fix it right away, though that took longer and, as a result, made me late for where I was going. At least the maintenance man was extra friendly and apologized for the problem! Finally, the business center printers weren't working, and while I was glad to be able to email the front desk agent to print my boarding pass, it would have been a stressful affair had he been busy. One last one: my clock radio wouldn't turn on and off with ease, after (again) a maintenance man came to check it out. So I just left it on the whole time, turning the volume on and off, instead of the power. Good for me; not so much for the hotel's energy costs. Hope they get those clocks fixed. What a wonderful place, a wonderful property, and above average staff. I can't say enough about the friendly, jovial staff. I hope that the management works on fixing some of the issues throughout the hotel so that the staff can shine at doing an even better job on customer service, instead of troubleshooting hotel upkeep issues that they probably have nothing to do with. Overall, a great experience for the price and location. I'll be happy to stay here again.","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

It also is close to Greenwich Village, where there are amazing small restaurants (see review of Vin et Fleurs), shops, clubs, and a plethora of everything great about he city.  Staff are very pleasant, attending, will do everything you need or explain nicely policies or why the elevator was broken, give directions about cab locations, extra towels, package delivery, and the repairman was up within 5 minutes to replace a toilet part to stop it from running). We did eat breakfast in the hotel restaurant, expensive but very good.  We had drinks at the bar:  the young man who served us (bartender) was excellent (the woman bartender the next day was NOT very friendly at all; we felt we were inconveniencing her).  The bar essentially is only 8 seats or so, tucked on the side of the lobby inside a glass wall\/door.  Cute, but very small, although they could make specialty drinks.  \n\nWhat's to be Considered:  the whole place is small, like  miniature for a New York Hotel:  it was very expensive, but I believe any hotel in NYC increases rates in December.  Lobby has 3 chairs, two elevators, a small check in desk; it can get crowded if three parties are checking out at the same time. There are 2 elevators (one was broken, and I heard another couple indicate that one was broken the last time they were staying there), so it is very slow to wait to go up to your room.  The room:  small; one-person bathroom, can't go by a person sitting in the chair at the desk to get around the bed.  Very clean, however, and linens were very luxurious and comfortable, each bed gets 4 pillows.  Rooms have room-darkening shades and it was quiet sleeping (no traffic noises).  Heat is loud and goes on and off to maintain the heat you set on thermostat, so to sleep with no noise you'll need to turn it off.  Shower had 3 units for use:  conditioner, shampoo, and bath gel, so you didn't have to use those little bottles.  Very small paper cups are available, as well as a hair dryer stored in a basket under very very small sink.  Room we had included 2 beds, a desk, and a standalone closet that holds maybe 8 clothes items.  There is a safe in the room, on bottom of closet but we did not use it.  I did go down to the small gym, and quality of the few pieces of equipment were very high quality, TV on wall, weights.  Wish I had that treadmill at home!  \n\nI would stay here again if price was more realistic for the space of the room size, due to location and efficiency of staff.","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Having stayed at similar hotels in other areas of Manhattan, this one is,without doubt, the best value for money.  It's a sheraton four points so don't expect high end luxury.  What you will get is a nice, clean, well-serviced hotel with the perfect location.  The rooms are nice - pretty compact, but sufficient space for two people. The closet is a decent size, as is the bathroom.  The elevators are a little overworked and can sometimes take a while to arrive, but apart from that I have never had any problems or reasons to complain about this hotel.  Front desk\/concierge service is always friendly and willing to offer advice about the city.\n\nLocation is the real beauty of this hotel.  Nestled amongst a combination of commercial, industrial and residential areas, the hotel is tucked away on a somewhat quiet street (as quiet as a street can be in Manhattan). It is a short walk (5 minutes) to the nearest subway line which will take you to Times Square, Central Park, Upper East\/West side, Brooklyn, Grand Central Station and Penn Station among other places. It is easy walking to Soho, the Village and Tribeca.  A short walk or run to the river front and the walking\/cycling paths which run along the river.  Going to a Broadway show?  No problem - 15 minute subway ride to the theatre district. Dozens of great restaurants and bars are at your doorstep - easily walkable.  Tons of fantastic shopping of all sorts - luxury boutiques, antiques, quirkier shops, and of course Canal Street. \n\nThe best part for me is that coming back to the hotel provides an escape from the Times Square chaos and the crowds of people you have to fight in many areas of Manhattan.  It's often a welcome relief after a day spent amongst all that energy. It provides a respite and the chance to recharge before heading back out that evening or the next day.","travelDate":"2014-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Next to Soho and the Village.  I love staying here for the location.\n\nPrice - for the money, this place usually offers good value as long as you understand what you are getting. \n\nRooms - small, but generally clean.  They are starting to get a bit tired\/worn, however, especially the bathrooms.\n\nCons:\n\nLocation - 7th avenue next to the Holland Tunnel is not the most attractive neighborhood.  Although the neighborhood has improved, it is pretty industrial.  That said, Soho is a few blocks away.  Because the neighborhood is \"improving\" expect construction.  \n\nAppearance - When this place opened, it had a very modern and clean vibe.  Yes, it was a Four Points, but it was hip (in a way).  The lobby now is so cluttered with brochures, stickers on the windows, various marketing materials, and a misguided attempt to \"decorate\" with various crapola - it definitely makes the place look budget, which is too bad.\n\nElevators - I can't tell you how many times I've stayed here and one of the elevators is out.  This turns something that works into something that doesn't.  On our last stay, the elevators worked for 3 days. On the 4th day (when we were leaving) they only had one elevator and we waited for about 15 minutes and almost missed our train.

Or, just catch the number 1 train to 42nd St. (about 8 stops). \n\nOne night we walked all over Soho trying to find a restaurant that did not have a long waiting line just to wind up back at the hotel to eat dinner and to our surprise the food was excellent. So have dinner at the hotel one night you will enjoy it, especially the lobster ravioli.\n\nAs we walked through Greenwhich Village one morning we stopped at a little place called Waverly's (I think that's the right name) for breakfast. The food was good and reasonable for NYC. Try the spinach and feta omelette, or the silver dollar pancakes.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

It was clean, we got a corner unit which admittedly is slightly larger than some of the smaller units that some have previously complained about on Tripadvisor, but most importantly: Everything from the lobby to our room was very clean beyond my expectations, the beds were made crisply, the carpet in our room had little or no stains, and everything in the room was in perfect working order.  The room safe was an unexpected welcome surprise that we used to stored our iPad in while we were out having fun in Soho & Greenwhich Village.  Kudos to Nicolas and his colleague stationed in the lobby, as they made check-in at 3:40PM an easy pleasure, and they even followed-up with a call to our room to see if everything met our expectations after we were settled in for a little while.  Got back to the room at 3AM, and from the 11th floor, overnight street and traffic noises that should be fully expected by any rational human being while staying in the largest metropolitan area in the United States were frequent, but as I stated earlier were fully expected, and were absolutely acceptable within the context of our stay.  So all you nay sayers from the UK or the \"fly-over states\" in the US that have unrealistic expectations of what an urban hotel stay should be like, need to get real about staying in a large city.  Staying in a large urban center will not necessarily include a rooster calling out in the distance during the early morning while the dew is still glistening on the grass!  (This coming from someone who lives in a rural area located in Southeastern PA)  \nAs some have complained about, the AC wall unit was admittedly loud, but hey... Forgetaboutit!!!  Tripadvisor's overall rating system would not allow me the granular resolution to pick a 4 1\/2, so my four dots in my overall rating is really a 4 1\/2.  If your expectations are what one would experience by staying at that Waldorf, then this hotel is not for you.  But if you are realistic, and enjoy clean accommodations, then I recommend that you stay here if this part of town is where you want to be.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

When I first arrived at my room at around 9pm, it had an overwhelming smell of body odor. I thought I'd give it a while to see if it would disappear or if I'd get used to it (even tried airing it out with the windows on 90 degree weather) but it persisted for the few hours I ended up staying. The walls are PAPER THIN. I could hear the details of every conversation the men in the room next door were having (one liked to whistle). I had an early flight in the morning and really wanted to sleep so I called downstairs to see if I could switch rooms. The person who answered the phone said no but offered that I could come downstairs to get a pair of earplugs (as an experienced traveler I always bring my own, also I had already changed clothing). He offered to call the room to tell them that the walls are extremely thin but he never did (I could hear every word that was said). I turned on the AC, which as other posts have noted is disruptively loud (no joke) and finally fell asleep only to be awoken at 3am by a loud buzzing sound that made my entire room shake. At first I thought it was some type of fire alarm (sounded like an air raid). But after going into the hall, I discovered it was coming from directly behind my bathroom wall. I called downstairs to inquire about the noise and they simply thanked me for letting them know. I ended up checking out at 330 am because waiting at la Guardia was more comfortable.

My room also looked straight out at a brick wall. \n\nI really don't find any compelling reason to stay here except for the location - close to Broadway and my office but I am going to try elsewhere for next time - Marriot Courtyard nearby and some newer hotels around the corner on Hudson. I paid about $350 per night which is expensive and I really felt I didn't get a whole lot. Bathrom is tired but otherwise clean. \n\nStaff were nice but I could really have done without their unprofessional conversation about how shocked they all were that someone had just gotten fired.

Our first 4 nights were in a 6th floor king bed room facing Charlton, and the last night was in a 21st floor (top floor) city view two double bed room.  I would say that the upgrade is worth it.  In both cases, the bed was very comfortable, and this is something my husband is very fussy about so that's saying something!  Also, we didn't have any complaints about noise on either floor (just garbage pickup or something our 2nd morning, but that's a necessary evil).  The windows in the 6th floor room were very drafty though; the windows actually didn't close well, so it was always a bit drafty (although at night when you close your blind it blocks the draft).  Also, we were much happier with the bathroom in the 21st floor room.  It had a bathtub, for one thing; I know that the reason there was no bathtub in the 6th floor room is that it was designed to be \"accessible\" (although for the life of me I can't see how someone with mobility issues would be able to manoeuver in that very narrow shower stall), but did it ever leak!  There wasn't much of a lip, so you wound up with a pool of water on the floor every time you had a shower (and we're quick shower takers).  Also, as others have mentioned, the heater\/AC is noisy, but it seemed to be much noisier in the 6th floor room; I sleep with earplugs and it was still quite noticeable.  Due to having the two double beds, the 21st floor room was also more spacious.  Overall though, I can't complain, it was worth the money we spent.\n\nThe big bonus was the location; easy access to both the 1 line and ACE line (1 is closer) and all the galleries, shops, restaurants and bars that SOHO and Greenwich Village have to offer.  Also, the staff was very friendly; front desk, restaurant, cleaners, etc. were all very professional.

DUCT TAPE!!! That's just unacceptable to me. Needless to say, it did not hold the water back, and instead the bathroom floor had a giant pond. At least the shower pressure was good, temperature was consistent, and the towels were pretty fluffy.\n\nWhoever designed the bathroom either did not have a ruler, or had no experience using a bathroom. Why is the sink so tiny? Why is the faucet a kitchen faucet, so you can't really wash your face without having water flow everywhere? Why is the shower so narrow, but long? I'm a small person, yet still felt claustrophobic. To make matters worse, the shower was lined with black tile. And all the racks in the bathroom for towels and amenities were slanted, i.e. not installed properly. The sink also had dirty looking mold\/mildew where it is attached to the counter top.\n\nOutside the bathroom, I enjoyed the decent size of the bedroom. The bed was also pretty comfortable. But the rest of the furniture was aging poorly. There were a lot of chips and misalignment. And the top of the leather desk chair was basically completely peeled off. \n\nNoise was definitely an issue from my 7th floor corner room. Not so much other hotel guests, but street noise. Being able to hear a street conversation from the 7th floor is ridiculous. And the subway does rumble loud and clear. Thankfully I am a sound sleeper, so it only bothered me before I fell asleep. The a\/c+heating unit was also pretty loud, but at least it maintained the temperature.\n\nThe overall impression is that management does not really want to invest to keep the hotel up to date, which is a shame, because the location is good, and the rooms are of decent size, and real fixes for small issues (better windows, proper shower door installation, new faucets) could easily bring this hotel up to snuff. \n\nBut duct tape...really?","travelDate":"2014-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

So I've had a fairly wide spectrum of experiences in New York, and all of them have been very good.\n\nHaving stayed exclusively in midwotn, my wife and I were excited to call a new neighbourhood home for our 4 night stay. Prices were competitive all over (in fact, the Four Points Times Square was even cheaper), but we decided to stay here for $165\/night. Given my platinum status, I chose the breakfast option as my amentity. I tried to use my \"suite night\" awards prior to check in, but, alas, the two suites (I think they have only 2) were occupied. \n\nWe took Strusser's Limo Service in a nice SUV from LGA to the hotel. Our check-in was prompt, polite and efficient. They were kind enough to locate us on the 19th floor (1 from the top -- suites are on the top), with a view north. I quite enjoyed the view -- could see both the Chysler and Empire State buildings, and also the Hudson to the north-west.\n\nThe room was quite small, but welcome to New York. It had everything one could need, including electrical outlets next to the bed. The bathroom was a very pleasant surprise. Small, but a very nice full-size shower as opposed to an oppressive a nasty shower\/tub combo I hate so much (Westin and Sheraton Toronto, I'm looking at you...). The room did have a bit of a smell -- I wouldn't say it was offensive or nasty, it just had a smell. Hard to explain. \n\nI must confess that I'm not the biggest fan of Four Points beds. I find them to be very hot -- and I hate being hot when I'm sleeping. However, I found the bed at this hotel to be extremeley comfortable. I did not over-heat, the pillows were fine (a litle over-stuffed), and the mattress quite comfortable. This was the best Four Points bed I have ever slept in. Walking miles every day also might have helped. \n\nBreakfast was served downstairs in the restaurant. The first morning, service was very slow -- despite there only being two other tables occupied in the restaurant. The lady serving I don't think had good organization skills. Now the remaining mornings we were served in a wonderfully efficient and friendly manner, and the experience was terrific. ;The platinum voucher, which is typically only for continental, was a dollar value that covered the main breakfast combo (3 eggs, meat, toast, hasbrowns, coffee, juice). I appreciated that very much. They didn't even bring a bill for me to sign, and when I asked for one to leave a gratuity against my room, the staff said it was included.\n\nI REALLY liked the location of this hotel. I didn't hear club noise, or contruction noise. That said, the building is by no means sound proof, and one night was garbage pick-up noise, and it sounded like the truck was actually in my room (perhaps in the closet? -- oh wait, there wasn' one!) The view was great, and it was 1 block from the #1 subway line. We could go from our room to the middle of Times Square in about 15 minutes -- amazing! It was also a short walk to Prince and Spring streets, where all of the action, restuarants, shops are, etc. \n\nBecause we were staying in a neighbourhood rather than a tourist mecca, it felt like we were living in New York. We really enjoyed our experience at the Four Points. If I was heading to New York and wanted to spend as little as I could on a hotel, but stay in an area I liked, and a place that I know will be clean and comfortable, I will looke to come back here. \n\nBy the way -- New York in December is magical.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is no central air so you turn on the individual unit in the room as required. The unit is very loud, so loud that I only ran the unit as absolutely necessary. The temperature regulation is horrible so you have to turn the unit on and off from that perspective anyway.\n\nRoom:\nAs per NYC standards, the room was small.

The front desk agent was very pleasant to greet me and was able to issue a room even when it was only about 1:00PM.\n\nHowever, I simply don't understand the following:\n\n*  The bathroom wash basin is regular small basin fitted with a kitchen use faucet hardware.  Every time I turn the water on, just even washing my hands - it's like I've been through a rain shower.  For a face wash, it's back to kindergarten kids, playground with water fountain splatting everywhere.  By the way, the kitchen faucet is able to turn the spout away from the basin, anyone could flood the entire bathroom and the room anytime.\n\n*  All the track lighting in the room and bathroom feels like as if I'm an artwork in a gallery.  Is it necessary for a track of 5x spotlights?  Besides, there's no chance of reading in bed because I don't think I can even read a word on a page with lights in my face.  In the bathroom, I must be very happy with my body that I'd love to be Mr. Muscle to flex my biceps under all the lights, I don't really think so.\n\n* Apparently, there's must be some sort of hidden alarm system that the guest can switch on for the room with a motion detector smack in the middle of the room.  Or, it's a device that detects motion of guests in the room for the security\/management to see if the guests are burglars?\n\nOne of the days at the hotel, I've returned to the room with the door ajar early evening at about 5:00PM.  The housekeeping staff for that day serviced the room but didn't close it shut.  Thank God that I didn't leave anything valuable in the room.\n\nThe thing is does it matter how many stars that any given hotel was rated as?  Or is it the room rate?  It's suppose to be a place away from home that makes the guest feel at ease, secured, safe, comfortable - for the least in basics of hotel standards, in my point of view.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

As others have mentioned, the location if not central, is at least convenient with with the 1 & 2 subway line (Houston) a block away and ACE lines (Spring St) two blocks away.\n\nFor a business traveler, room size is decent. In looking at the floor plan, there are only 8 rooms per floor and the rooms in the corners are slightly larger.  It would be a little tight for a couple on vacation, but it is New York.  Good size desk with a bunch of outlets conveniently located.  I was in room 608 which was facing the front directly over the hotel entrance.  Charlton is a relatively quiet side street and you're just far away enough from Varick that I didn't hear that much street noise...an occasional siren or horn and sanitation truck early one morning.  Very quiet compared to Times Square hotels I've previously stayed at.\n\nAs others have stated, free bottled water is a nice touch.  Decent TV channel selection.  No complaints about housekeeping.  The furnishing generally were good and I slept well (although I did notice the desk chair was **very** worn...almost looked like it was aged on purpose but I don't think so ;-)  Front desk staff were various degrees of friendly, but always appropriate.  I managed to leave my Sonicare in the room but housekeeping tracked it and I was able to pick it up the next day.  Good service there.\n\nThe restaurant is not bad.  I arrived very late, hadn't had dinner and the weather was bad, so decided to eat in the restaurant based on some pretty good yelp reviews.  Service was great, food was overpriced but decent and they had an OK selection of beers on tap.  I assume the same kitchen provides room service so room service would be a good option if you didn't want to leave your room.  We went here for drinks the next night and same great service.\n\nI agree with others however about the bathroom.  Plenty of space, but in my room there was no way to keep water from the walk-in shower from forming a lake in the middle of the bathroom floor.  Shower drained very slowly and no matter how much attention I paid to keeping the door closed or the shower head pointed towards the wall...it didn't matter.  I don't think it helped that both the shower stall and bathroom floor were level (rather than sloping slightly towards the drain) so whatever water ended up on the floor didn't drain.  Also, beware that the walk-in shower is way too small for people of size (which meant I regularly knocked the shower door open).  A colleague mentioned they did not have a walk-in shower, but it might be something that is different from room to room.\n\nAnd I also like to echo a previous posters comment about the amount of counter space in the bathroom (pretty much zero).  I didn't even have a place to put a normal sized toiletry kit.  This is unfortunate given the fact that the bathroom itself is decent sized.\n\nOverall a great, dozy business class hotel with the only downside being the bathroom.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

My room was pretty dirty, full of marks on the wall and dust and the bathroom is a problem on its own, with water going everywhere the minute the shower is turned on and not enough space around the sink for your own toiletries. I was expecting more and think for the same price there are better options close enough (such as the Marriott just around the corner).","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Bath room was a wet room which flooded after a shower my only real issue.\nGood Value for money as room is clean, warm , good size, excellent location, friendly staff and not too expensive.

I believe I was assigned to an upgraded room type as it felt more spacious than I was expecting. I actually found the general quality and amenities at the property quite good. Free wi-fi, bottled water and coffee\/tea plus a generous supply of bath and shower soaps in eco-friendly containers (mounted to the shower wall). Frankly, you couldn't expect much more from a Manhattan property than this and they do deliver on the Four Points brand attributes.\n\nI did find the room to be quite loud. I was on the back of the property and was awakened the first night by what sounded like jackhammers. The second night there was a bad cover band playing in or around the building behind (hint: they apparently fought the law and, spoiler alert, the law won) which was quite loud and interrupted my evening.\n\nThe other issue that crept up was with the toilet flushing functionality. It was flowing poorly on my arrival and actually stopped up during my second day in the afternoon. I reported it to the front desk prior to going out for dinner and when I returned, although engineering had been in the room, it was only partially resolved.\n\nNevertheless, NY has its share of noise and plumbing issues. It's NY. You roll the dice and roll with whatever comes. I found this to be a generally reliable property and would return here again. The location is outstanding. It might not be my first choice but it's at least good enough to go on the list of potential candidates for a short stay in the city.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The first night had continual outside  noise.  Our room overlooked a vent from an adjacent building which we thought might be the issue. The hotel is on a quieter street although close to the main street (Varick).  Despite there being no traffic outside on either street, the noise continued (it was like the hum of traffic).\n\nIn the morning the hotel was very accommodating to move us to the 12th floor facing the opposite side but the noise continued including construction noise from the lot next door.  We bought ear plugs and that made the difference - we were able to sleep for the remainder of our stay. The manager did suggest that they didn\u2019t have double paned or insulated windows to block out exterior noise.  We had just left a Times Square hotel with no noise problems, it was frustrating that a quieter neighbourhood like Soho ended up being louder.\n\nDespite this we loved the location. It was easy each morning to stroll Spring or Prince Street for a nice cafe for breakfast. It was also a great location to walk as far as the Financial district and Chelsea with ease and enjoyment.

From the manager all the way down to the cleaning staff. But when you stay in a hotel you want the rooms to be comfortable,clean and having the ability to be slept in. This is not the case at this hotel. We stayed on the 10th floor first. The room showed real signs of aging, the chairs were tattered and the paint could have been better as could the worn out desk. The toilet was broken and sprayed water on the wall. However, the sound coming from the construction site next door on Charlton Street made for an even worse night. We were then moved to a room on the 17th floor that was so small you could not open a piece of luggage on a luggage rack. This room directly overlooked the entrance on Hudson street to the Holland tunnel. Once again we pleaded to be moved. The third room was actually bigger. However the airconditioner huffed and wheezed all night. In addition the Special Halloween club that opened up that weekend for a month delivered noise all night. There were bullhorns in the street and street music and entertainment. The club itself extended through the building on Hudson Street and you could actually feel the heavy bass beat in our room. The club is around for a full month every night. I must say we fled the hotel. We were granted the ability to check out one day early and get a refund but I would have liked to have checked out even sooner. Yes you can't control street noise but you can insulate windows and walls. I should know as I live around the corner on the feed to the Holland Tunnel and have thick windows and walls. I barely hear street sounds. There is no excuse for this amount of noise leakage. This stay was one of the worst in my life. I was forced to stay away from my apartment as I was doing renovation and there was dust all over. I was forced to flee home and clean for two days instead of having a leisurely several days at this hotel.","travelDate":"2013-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Despite the built in desk and the wardrobe there's enough room to walk around both sides of the king size bed. The bathroom is also small but not tiny. One thing to be aware of is that the bathroom door is frosted rather than opaque, so if the light's on in the bathroom the room gets flooded with light.\n\nThe only real noise on the 21st floor was the slamming of other room doors which is unavoidable.  The air conditioning was very effective as well.\n\nThe toiletries are very basic with dispensers mounted on the shower wall rather than in little bottles. This got to be a problem towards the end of the trip since twice daily showers in the sticky August NYC weather drained our entire supply of shower gel.\n\nNo breakfast is included which is standard for American hotel chains. There is a perfectly acceptable breakfast\/lunch\/convenience store on the corner at which you can pick up a typical New York breakfast of an H&H bagel and a cup of coffee to go.\n\nThe hotel's area is convenient to SoHo as well as Spring Street shopping, including the home of the infamous Cronut. \n\nBest of all it is also extremely convenient to stops for the 1 and C subway lines.

Everything I checked was over $200 a night except for the Four Points SoHo so was concerned that maybe it wasn't in the best area, but it was GREAT!!  Looks pretty new, rooms are surprisingly a decent size compared to some closet size rooms you get in Manhattan.  Upon entry, the room and the decor are so well placed that I would have sworn the beds were queens instead of doubles (doubles being the norm in Manhattan).  The high quality beds and bedding also give the illusion that the doubles are bigger than they actually are.  I would never have thought they were doubles but management corrected me.\n\nThe hotel is very clean and well decorated.  Front desk staff was friendly, very helpful with directions and suggestions and ordered me an airport car that arrived on time.\n\nHowever, the location must be odd because the two taxis that I used had trouble finding it.  The first taxi, a black car from JFK, had to use a GPS.  The second taxi, a yellow cab, couldn't figure it out by the cross streets I gave him.  I finally told him by the Houston St subway stop and he got me to the hotel from there.\n\nI'm originally from NY and worked in the city so am familiar with subways and getting around to tourist sights so to me the location was good.  For someone new to NYC, this may be a little out of the way of the more popular areas....but for the price savings, it's certainly worth learning how the subways and taxis work and staying at the Four Points SoHo.  \n\nYou are next to Chinatown so some of the best Chinese food is in the area.  (Also close to Little Italy.)  We ate at Jazzy's restaurant located right on the corner next door to the hotel.  It's a really unique restaurant....half is chinese buffet (very delicious!) and the other half is split between a deli that serves fresh sandwiches and a grille where you can get several things like omelettes to BLT's.  The boys ate chinese and I had breakfast.  Where else can you get a combination like that except NYC?!  :)\n\nSo glad I discovered this hotel for future visits.","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location was absolutely great for us - just a couple of minutes walk from Houston Street Subway (1) which got us to Times Square in less than 20 minutes.  Walking distance to Greenwich Village.  \n\nThe staff were efficient and courteous and our room on the fourth floor was absolutely fine for our needs. I had been concerned about the issue of noise, particularly having read the comments made earlier about the building work going on right next door, but while we were there, the site was deserted.  We had asked to be moved higher but during our stay one of the lifts was out of action.  Being on the fourth floor meant we could take the stairs which was fine for us.  The managment recognised how irritating having a lift out of action was for guests and laid on free lunch for everyone on the Friday, by way of an apology.  Nice touch.\n\nThe heating worked well and the beds were very comfortable.  There wasn't enough drawer space for the two of us - travelling in early Spring meant we both had quite a few jumpers, but it was just a minor thing.  \n\nRoom came with a tea\/coffee maker and an ironing board and iron.  Free coffee also available in reception in the morning.  We didn't eat in the hotel but had breakfast out - there's a diner right on the corner of Charlton and Varick, a few steps from the front door and also an IHOP on Varick!  \n\nThe bathroom was clean and well lit and the bath although small, was a welcome bonus as I was expecting just a shower. The shower itself had good water pressure but the best thing about the bathroom for me was the fantastic little hair dryer!  I need to style my hair rather than just dry it and it was great... Minor point to many, but a big bonus to a few!\n\nI 'paid' for our room with Starwood Points but my girlfriend paid for her daughter's room.  She felt that it represented very good value for money.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this hotel - we have already agreed that when the time comes for our next trip, we will be staying here.","travelDate":"2013-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The best thing about this hotel (besides being right next to our office in NY) is the staff.  Very, very friendly and helpful.  The rooms clean and functional but average.  Closets are too small, and everything that is screwed into the bathroom walls (towel racks, shelf under the vanity, etc) is either wobbly or hanging at an angle.  I've stayed at this hotel often, and every bathroom is like this - the contractor seems to have screwed the fixtures into the drywall directly.  Otherwise, the value for money is good, but this may be due to corporate rate we have.  If you are impatient, do not take a room that is high up.  The (two) elevators are quite slow, so take the stairs.  Also, there is a major construction site next to the hotel right now.

Since both of these are a short 5 minute walk, the location is incredibly attractive.\n\nThe hotel is still relatively new (circa 2008) so everything still works and looks good, with a few minor scratches here and there; it has HD TVs (with HD service) and free Wi-Fi throughout. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, and the rooms and are clean. Beds are really comfortable, a brand standard. Rooms are New York tiny, and those at the lower floors (probably assigned to those who seek \"deals\") do get traffic noise. The hotel has both an onsite restaurant and room service, but given that the restaurant is unrated and the huge proximity of amazing eateries within a short walking distance we've never tried it; same with the bar, which is tiny. It has no lobby space to speak of.\n\nThe one HUGE mistake the designers made is to skip on central HVAC: not only this is an environmental disaster, but the cheap window-mounted units are LOUD. And I mean REAL LOUD. The room also lacks blackout curtains so instrumental for jet-lag recovery: just a flimsy plastic shade with ample light leakage from the sides.\n\nFinally, the Wi-Fi quality was absolutely abysmal (graded F- on speedtest.net), to the point where I cannot return here if I have serious business (Skype calls with the team, etc.) to do.  Given that from what I read it costs an hotel 8 cents per room per night to provide internet, they seem to be incredibly shortsighted.  I would expect them to address this and hope that managements adds a response here about it.","travelDate":"2012-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I had planned this trip for a mini Family Reunion centered around the Thanksgiving Holiday\/Parade. We reserved rooms well in advance (6months) of our trip and wanted to stay in Soho to get a different aspect of the city since we have been many times before and stayed mostly in midtown. What a NIce surprise this hotel is. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by staff and though our rooms weren't ready yet we  were offered storage for luggage until they were. The staff also asked if we knew where to park our car and I said I had researched a place about 8 blocks away. They asked at what price and offered a garage around the corner (3 blocks) that matched the price I had. When we returned later that day and were given room keys we made our way to the storage room. We collected our own luggage (which I thought odd) and carried it to our room (again I thought odd - we were never offered a bellman to take the bags for us), this was my only minor complaint because later in our trip I saw bellman assisting others with luggage - maybe none were available when we needed them? When we got to our room it was CLEAN and Fresh with a Modern look to the room - not the typical outdated, painted over and over again look many Uptown hotels have. There was a small couch in the corner (which ended up being a luggage rack for us) and a desk area to work from in the opposite corner. Only 1 small dresser with 3 small drawers and an armoire that had a safe and an iron and board if needed inside. The room was small but we expect this when coming to NYC. Each time we left or entered the hotel we were greeted by staff and they always seemed in good spirits. The Subway is only 1 block in one direction and 4 blocks in the other direction - so very close to the hotel. There are a few nice places to eat nearby or to stop for a glass of wine and appitizers. Overall I enjoyed our stay here and would stay again - maybe next year.","travelDate":"2012-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

What did I get for $500 \/ night, weeknight? A room slightly larger than the bed, a coffee pot that sprayed coffee everywhere but in the cup, and a tv remote that wouldn't function.  That said, it was clean, the bathroom black marble and shieck (though shower only, sigh), and a great location with a really friendly staff.  But, call me old fashioned, I couldn't help but think I could stay in a suite at the Phonecian for almost the same rate.  It's just over priced.  Maybe the solution is to cough up a bit more and stay higher end? I don't know.  I feel like it was the worlds most expensive La Quinta.  Hard feeling to shake. And, I'm not thrifty.  If I was, I probably would have ad a hissy fit.\n\nThe restaurant for breakfast is a typical NYC nook.  I found it charming, if the choking poster on the wall from 1920 did turn me a bit off.  For lunch, I sat outside, and my raviolli was really good.  \n\nThe staff is on happy pills which is always great to see, and took a bit off the feeling of being bent over.  But just a little.  Starwood needs to take a look at the pricing structure for these basic inner city hotels.  What makes them attractive is the value.  The value here was lacking.

Spent 5 nights on the front end of a business trip to celebrate our anniversary. Used points for our stay. (5th night free promotion) Easy access by car service from Newark Airport. Reached out to the hotel manager via LinkedIn prior to arrival but did not hear back until I pointed it out to reception after check in. \n\nArrived at the hotel at 2:50 p.m..Was told that our room was not ready but it would be only 15 or 20 minutes. Waited in the lobby in the small lounge and watched three parties behind us get their keys and head upstairs. After 45 minutes had passed, I saw the front desk clerk in street clothes and leaving for the day. I approached the new clerk and was told our room was ready. Wonder how long we would have waited had I not inquired again.....Requested king bed in quieter spot regardless of view.\n\nRoom assigned was 1106. No doubt these are a bit smaller than your typical Manhattan rooms but it did have the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay. Spent 30 minutes trying to log into Wifi until I finally called down for help. They sent up some technical help who said the signal on that side of the building was weak and sometimes you had to stand by the door??? So I am standing in the doorway of our room with my laptop in hand and still could not get a strong enough signal to connect. I used my Ipad via 3G the rest of my stay.This room was also handicapped accessible but the differences were subtle enough for us to let it go. That is, until we used the shower just after checking in. Glass enclosure was barely wide enough for me to stand in and the design allowed for water to leak constantly onto the bathroom floor. After two showers, the bath mat and another towel were completely soaked and the floor still had standing water. The tile floor was like walking in ice.  I told my wife not to use a hair dryer while standing in there and I went downstairs to request another room. When I voiced my frustration to reception about my check in snafu and safety hazard in that bathroom, I was peppered with excuses. He (Nick I think?) ultimately assigned us a new room and sent us help to move to room 1002. Bellman was friendly, helpful and apologetic. This room, while comparable in size, was layed out differently and it offered more usable space. There are few rooms on each floor so slamming doors and housekeeping in the hallway will likely be disturbances regardless of your location. Noise seems to travel inside the halls.\n\nCame back that night to a bottle of wine and fruit plate for our anniversary. Nick also sent us some drink tickets for the lounge. The gestures were appreciated but we prefer a seamless stay over freebies any day of the week. Our only other issue was dry cleaning not being returned as promised. When I inquired the next day, I was told our DND sign was on. Hmmmm - we have been gone for the last 8 hours and our room was cleaned. Would have preferred they just take responsibility over the excuses.\n\nRooms were clean, climate control worked very well, beds were comfortable and standard tub\/curtains showers were spacious with plenty of hot water and pressure.  Hotel location was fantastic. Subway close and a short walk to dozens of bars and restaurants. Don't understand prior reviews who claim nothing is nearby. \n\nHad a few drinks at the lounge on site but cannot speak to the food. Throughout our stay, Nick had been helpful in recommending Dylan Prime for dinner, offering an umbrella during a storm and directions as needed. The 1st 24-36 hours were the most rocky but things settled from there and we ultimately enjoyed our stay and agree that we much prefer this part of town over midtown going forward. We would recommend this hotel and suggest the appropriate expectations upon arrival to make for a more pleasant stay.","travelDate":"2012-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From the moment we checked in, every staff member on every shift couldn't have been more helpful, enthused, and committed.  Congratulations to what must be a terrific management team for creating a truly welcoming environment in this behemoth city.  The restaurant is cozy and reasonably priced, as is the bar with its outdoor area.  The gym downstairs is unambitious but has the basics.  If there's a negative, it's that the otherwise comfortable rooms are on the small side, and even two people are going to find themselves having to negotiate walkways between bed, desk, and closet.  The truth is, though, that visiting New York isn't about hanging out in your room, so if you can put up with this minor inconvenience, the place is otherwise a complete pleasure.  Word to the wise on room location:  Charlton St. is under a lot of construction as of Summer 2012, and you'll want to request a room to the rear and east side of the hotel.  That said, you will very much enjoy this very well priced and welcoming little piece of Manhattan.","travelDate":"2012-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From memory, when I was searching in the Internet, there weren't a lot of hotels in Soho, or the ones I wanted weren't available. The location isn't great and the streets closer to the hotel aren't as well lit. It's a 10-15min walk to Soho. Rooms were average for NYC I think. Our room was behind the elevator and was a little bit noisy.

Last year when staying there, I was reminded that the hotel opened in the mid 1960s . A few months ago, I tried to get into the hotel and found that rates were nearly 500 per night, thanks to the Hilton Club concept which seems to have cut the available rooms to ordinary folk to about half of the total, resulting in twice the price.\nI took a chance and decided to stay in Soho, where a pal of mine owns a great jewelry store, and found the above sheraton. When I checked in, the desk staff acted as if I was a long time lost person who had come home for good. In a flash I was in my room, all new and nice, with internet that worked like a charm ( I seem to remember a german phrase - mit raazender geschwindekuit- or something like that- with great speed) and a very very nice room for a very very good price. Best of all, elevators that got you to your room on floor 14 with even more speed than ever in a hotel in new york. No waiting.\nOnce I checked in, I found the staff eager to help me get around the city, and where to walk to. All kinds of flower shops, my pals store, and every imaginable kind of cool stores are available. plus, something you will never see in mid town, nice little bakeries, pizza places, and restaurants of every type. \nThe rooms. like many at any four points sheraton, are modern design, and not the traditional heavy woods,and massive chairs, but very very comfortable and well appointed. There was even a power strip for those of us who think we are to be in touch with 2 phones, two laptops, and of course an ipod. So for the first time in years, my own power strip was deployed to remain in the suitcase. \nIn walking around, I was able to visit my pals store in soho, visit art galleries, and frankly enjoy myself despite having heavy duty finance meetings ever day over 4 days. My worst fear- not being able to get a cab, or being forced to use the subway a lot- were never realised. Despite it being a small hotel at least by gotham city standards, there was always a cab waiting out front. Also the cab fare to LaGuardia was about 10 bucks less than the trip to midtown. \nNow it turns out that soho is considered a new emerging area for tech companies, lofts, and young people. If you want to enjoy the City of New York, consider staying here. Its my new  home.","travelDate":"2012-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Sheraton markets the Four Points brand as a business class hotel, an but this property fell short on several points. On the good side, the staff was friendly and helpful, it was a walkable distance to the conference, subway line 1 access one block away, and a very fun neighborhood with bars and restaurants just a few blocks away (MacDougal and Sullivan Streets). On the other hand, the room finishings were just average for this grade of hotel, there was no realistic work space (although the wifi worked well), and the complimentary breakfast for conference attendees was just pastries, juice, and coffee. I feel this kind of breakfast really falls short for what people want when they are about to sit in a conference for 4 hours until lunchtime. At other conferences I've been to, the hotel offered a full, complimentary breakfast. Too, the bathroom has the world's splashiest skin, so if you are environmentally-conscious and wish to reuse towels, forget it because everything was saturated. I needed all new towels every day.

The front desk staff were really chatty and welcoming. The housekeeping did an excellent job. Their response time to requests was quick... On the first evening in the room, my little one fell, bumped his nose, leading to a nose-bleed. I called the front-desk and they sent up ice within 2 minutes. Later, they also gave me a list of clinics nearby, in case medical help was needed. Luckily it wasn't. \nOn arrival, we discovered that Travelocity had booked us into a King Room instead of the 2 Doubles mentioned on my booking voucher. The staff at the front desk immediately assigned us a room with 2 doubles. This correction happened in such a smooth, tension-free manner that I could barely remember that an error with regard to booking had occurred. \nThere was one service glitch regarding the rental car we requested through them to go to the airport.

At a glance, it seemed a little out of the way, and I wasn't sure I'd be happy with the location.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  It's on a quiet street, right on the edge of everything SoHo has to offer.  It also seemed a bit \"upgraded\" in decor vs. the other Four Points Sheraton properties in Manhattan (Chelsea, Times Square).\n\nPROS:\n - Very attentive desk staff.  They were efficient, friendly and actually quite funny when I checked in.\n - On a quieter side street where you don't hear constant honking horns and sirens, but still just a half block from Varick St. (name changes from 7th Ave a couple of blocks up at Houston St)\n - Rooms are nicely appointed - comfortable bed and pillows.  Work area in the corner maximizes desk space.  Bathrooms are mostly black granite with a stand up shower only.  I felt this was a nicer bathroom than other FPS properties.\n - Nice view of mid-town from rooms that face that way, although a little blocked by a nearby hotel tower.\n - Very short walk to the Red \"1\" subway line - about a half block away at Houston St.  This will quickly take you to to the West Village, Chelsea and Times Square to the North, and the World Trade Center to the South.\n - Very short walk to the heart of SoHo (shorter than I had thought), which is packed with awesome restaurants and shopping.  It's all pricey, but it's classic New York.  Even if you just walk around and look.\n\nCONS:\n - Not the easiest\/quickest to get to from the airport. I paid about $45 to ride from La Guardia.  \n - By no means a big, fancy hotel.  The lobby is tiny and the small restaurant\/bar wouldn't be my pick with so many other choices nearby.  But it's quick and easy to get in and out of, which I prefer.\n - Not centrally located within the city.  If you're hitting all of the classic New York sights, you'll need to allow time for walking or switching of subway lines.   \n\nI'll gladly book this hotel again for future stays.  Among Starwood hotels, you can get some of the better rates for this property.  I usually book AAA rates on spg.com.","travelDate":"2012-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

I was given a welcome bag of goodies including a bottle of water, a pack of cookies and a Time Out guide, a nice touch.\nThe room was small - I had read other reviews where this had been mentioned but from the property images I was not expecting it to be quite so small - however as I was staying on my own this was not an issue and I settled in quite quickly. \nMy room backed onto the elevator shaft (I think 2 rooms per floor back onto the elevators) and there was quite a lot of noise from the elevators that seemed to travel through the bathroom ventlation shaft. There was also quite a bit of noise from other rooms which also seemed to travel this same way. The noise did not affect my sleep fortunately but was a bit intrusive when trying to relax in the room at other times.\nThe room was clean and well appointed with a desk area, work chair, armchair, wardrobe and flat panel HD TV. The bed was very comfortable with clean crisp linens. The bathroom similarly was well decorated and stylish with everything you could need provided. I loved that the towels were a good size, soft and fluffy and smelt really nice and fresh.\nDidn't get a chance to try the Italian restaurant - this was off the small lobby area and to be honest looked more like a bar than a restaurant although I can imagine that in the summer when the terrace is open there would be more space and activity.\nOverall I was happy with my choice of hotel - you dont get much for your money in New York, but this property offered a quality room in a great location for a reasonable price (considering New York options!!!)

The room has a large TV, small dresser and small wardrobe with in-room safe. The safe was suitable to store our valuables and laptop. They also provide an umbrella in the room. The bathroom was quite small. It was only fit for 1 adult in there at a time. Not much room to store your own amenities. The amenities provided seem more like what you would find in a motel than a hotel. However, the bathroom did look new, modern and very clean. The heating unit was quite noisy, as it would make loud noises as it switched on and off, as well as when it was heating up the room. Our room had a nice view of the wall next door. The free wifi throughout the hotel made it convenient for us, as we had free wifi in the room.\n  \nThe hotel had a small breakfast room, tiny bar, small lobby and reception area, which got really crowded in the mornings. There is also an internet station with 2 PCs for those that don't have their own with them. The staff were very helpful and professional, always on the ball with everything and greeted with a smile.

Ms. Luna took the time to chat with us and ask how our stay was and what she could do to make it better. \n\nOur room was always clean when we returned in the afternoon and never had to wait for housekeeping.

The hotel was about 1 \u00bd blocks from the subway stop. \n\nThe check in process was great-the hotel staff was so super friendly and accommodating. I had a room on the 7th floor (I had read online that the rooms with the best view were the 10th and above but it didn\u2019t really matter to me.) The room was very nice and had an extremely comfortable bed. The rooms are small, but so are all hotel rooms in New York City. The bathroom was very nice and there were complimentary toiletries and a blow dryer underneath the sink. The shower is all glass and completely see-through which I didn\u2019t have a problem with but could see might be embarrassing for some. A few minutes after settling into my room, an employee came and delivered a welcome basket complete with water and a granola bar. I thought that was a nice touch. \n\nThere is a gym and ice machine on the bottom floor. The gym was small but would have been sufficient for a quick workout. There was also a VERY small bar on the first floor (literally had 6 seats in it) but it looked like everyone in there was enjoying themselves. There was a coffee maker and tea bags in the room, as well as a complimentary bottle of water. \n\nOn the day of check out, my meeting ran a little longer than expected so I called the front desk and asked them if I could push my check out back to 2 pm which they accommodated no problem. Again, excellent customer service and they didn\u2019t charge a fee. \n\nI would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who is considering it.

As Starwood member, we try to stay in Starwood hotels.\n\nWe checked-in at 5pm. We booked a traditional room and requested in our original booking top floor with views.  We got room 2003! The view from this room was fantastic, windows everywhere, overlooking the Hudson River and the city (photo). We had a very welcoming room and very quiet, right on the corner in Level 20. They offer free bottle of water and coffee\/tea facilities for your convenience. At night, they deliver to you room some snacks (popcorn) if you wish to relax in your room watching a movie. The bed is super comfortable. The only drawback is the internet (free of charge) which is really slow.\n\nAs we wanted to explore the Soho suburb and restaurants and cafes, we didn\u2019t dine in at the Hotel. They have \u201chappy hours from 4m to 7pm and lunch specials.\n\nThe nearest subway station is only two blocks from the hotel. The WTC is only two stations away and 10 min ride to Times Square.

However, it does mid-grade better than a lot of other \"mid-grade\" options.  First of all, we stayed here using points so for us it was a win-win.  I imagine they charge a lot for this property considering it's in Manhattan and I might not be as thrilled with my experience if I was actually paying, but that said, I was very pleased.  The staff was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  Staff makes all the difference in a hotel, and I give this staff top marks.  We stored our bags twice with the hotel and they even seemed surprised but pleased when we offered them a few dollars for doing so - unlike most other hotels which consider it almost a fee.  The room was clean, adequately sized, and the bed was very comfortable.  I even liked the pillows (which is unusual)!  The bathroom was nicely updated and again, a decent size.  Both the bedroom and bathroom are not huge, don't get me wrong -- this is Manhattan after all -- but decently sized.  We had one issue with the bathroom - the shelf above the sink was broken at some point and thus leaned downwards.  Our stuff was perched a little precariously but didn't fall - no biggie.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this hotel would be the noise.  The hallway noise (people coming in and out of their rooms, or waiting for the elevator) sounded as if it was happening RIGHT next to you.  Also, the room wasn't well insulated from street noise.  And finally, when the AC kicked on, it did so loudly.  However, this wasn't a huge deal -- pop in some ear plugs (a necessity when traveling) and it's fine (although you may be awoken throughout the night by some noise or another).  We were also on the front of the hotel, which could have led to the load street noise.\n\nThe location was ideal - so close to SoHo and the Village.  I was very excited about the location. Yes, it's pretty far west, but a quick 5-7 minute walk puts you into the thick of things.\n\nI really appreciate the free bottle of water.  More hotels should do this.  For what probably costs them $0.25, it's worth the goodwill (and the well-hydrated clients are happy clients).","travelDate":"2011-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we left each time, we were offered directions to where we were going. I called to ask where the ice was, they said, \"we will just send some up\". One night they just called up to our room to see if we needed anything. The last night we were there, we asked for suggestions for a restaurant, Nicholas actually called and made the reservation for us. Then, champage was brought to our table, \"courtesy of our hotel\"!

Everyone is VERY friendly and helpful at the hotel, even the room attendants, everyone always says hello and has a smile, you can see they love their job. The hotel was suprisingly close to everything...I saw reviews saying bad location, but I have to completely disagree. New York is a walking city and its about a 5-10 min walk to the heart of SOHO or the Village. There are numerous great restaurants within that walk---(great bakery Francois Payard, you gotta try Molly's Cupcakes (Cupcake Wars winner from Food network) on Bleeker it's new and the best cupcakes we had anywhere in the city (strawberry shortcake cupcake) and believe me we tried a lot!!!, Joe's Pizza at 6 and Bleeker is great for a true NY slice it's the locals choice for Pizza, for a nice dinner try Palma on Cornelia everything is wonderful!). It was nice to be close to several subway lines so that it made getting to any part of the city very easy (ask for the map of the city when you check in, it's all you'll need).  The room was nicely appointed, much larger than expected considering you are in Manhattan (much bigger than what I've stayed at in the W in NY). The bathroom is small, similar to that of the W.

We could walk to SoHo, the West Village, Greenwich Village and TriBeCa with ease, and there were several subway stations very close by if we wanted to venture further than comfortable walking distance. \n\nOn top of all this, we were able to get a great rate which bumped this hotel up from \"very good\" to \"excellent\" in our opinion. We were so pleasantly surprised and comfortable with the room that we got that we found ourselves wanting to stay longer than the two nights that we booked. \n\nOne caveat to this glowing recommendation: if this is your first time in Manhattan, it might not be the best place to stay. I think that if my fiance and I had never visited before and wanted to partake in all of the tourist activities, the location would have been too isolated from Times Square\/other tourist destinations, and because the hotel is smaller, I might have expected a lobby and amenities on a grander scale.\n\nThat said, as a veteran NY-er, this was the perfect hotel for our visit.

Emely Estrella manages a team of enthusiastic, kind, engaging and professional front of house staff who simply could not have been more helpful.  We had ordered about 11 different items from Amazon.com that arrived at their different times (most before we even got there) and they were expertly received, cared for and handed to us with the broadest of smiles.  The room was wonderful.  Large and comfortable bed, spotlessly clean room with all the facilities you would want as a tourist. free internet was reliable and reasonably fast.  The location on Charlton street is perfect.  Short walk to the Village, literally 1 block from 2 different Metro stations if you want to go to the city or on other trips. Extremely good value - but mostly a genuinely friendly and happy place - we'll definitely be back.","travelDate":"2011-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Le camere non sono molto grandi in compenso ci sono due letti molto confortevoli. Bagno decisamente molto piccolo e senza il bidet come sempre negli USA. \nNon si sono in tv canali satelliteri italiani. Colazione alla carte senza buffet. Il bar, durante il mio soggiorno, non era in funzione, davvero scomodo! per colazione o un birra ci sono per\u00f2 vicinissimi uno Starbuks ed un simpatico bar. In camera offrono comunque due bottigliette di acqua e caff\u00e8 free. Connessione internet wireles gratis. Molto difficile trovare dalle 17 alle 19 taxi dal centro di Manhattan a Soho.","travelDate":"2011-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Location is good.  Dining and bar options nearby and close to two subway lines.  Professional staff who actually seem to give a damn about guests.  That was refreshing.  Hard to call any hotel in NY a value but I'd stay there again.","travelDate":"2011-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Ok we got a deal on expedia but I've stayed in better hotels in NYC that were also \"deals.\" \n\nThe staff was terrific - however, I don't recommend getting them to arrange a ride to the airport - we were charged nearly double what we paid from the airport - never, ever again!","travelDate":"2011-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}
