I travel a lot for work and leisure, and finding a hotel with service, comfort, location, etc. is hard to find. This hotel covered it all and more. From the moment we pulled up to valet, we were welcomed with a warm smile and felt taken care of immediately. Breakfast was delicious, with fast and friendly service each morning. The rooms were comfortable, with beautiful views of the park and city, and I loved sitting on the little nook overlooking the busy streets. I loved the foam roller and steamer in the room- something you don't normally see in hotels, and are useful items to have!

It was fantastic! From the moment you walk in, you feel like you're in a cozy oasis right in the middle of the city jungle. The blend of modern luxury and eco-friendly design creates an inviting space where you can't help but feel at home.\nThe rooms are like little havens of comfort and style, with everything you need to relax and unwind after a day of exploring the city. The proximity to Central Park is perfect, and the attention to detail in every aspect of the room, from the organic linens to the sustainable amenities, is truly impressive.\nBut what really sets the 1 Hotel Central Park apart is the people. The staff here are incredibly friendly and approachable, always ready with a smile and eager to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Particularly, at the front desk. Austin, Josue, Joshua and Janae were absolutely stellar. Whether you need recommendations for the best local spots or just want to chat about your daily experiences, they're there for you with genuine warmth and hospitality. They were like having friends in the city, and it makes all the difference in the world.\nAnother stand-out that makes the hotel incredible is their restaurant, Jams. The food was absolutely fantastic. Only to be outdone by the service. Ediliana, our server, had such detailed knowledge of the food and made great recommendations.\nThere are several choices when it comes to picking a hotel in this neighborhood and I can tell you, I have stayed at some great places, but this has been the best one yet.

We posted the negative review and were subsequently contacted by management and told they'd refund our whole stay if we took the review down. When I asked the manager why the full refund wasn't offered during the original conversation, she told me she didn't believe we'd post it. Very interesting technique, 1 Hotel.\n\nWe stayed at this property over Christmas and are still actively telling everyone we know visiting the area to avoid this place (and yesterday was Valentine's day).\nWe were victims of the bait and switch you can see in other reviews where we book and paid for a higher tier king bed room, but instead got a view that isn't as advertised, a queen bed, and no heat. When conversing with the front desk about the issue, we were told at first we were wrong, there was no way it was a queen bed, only for the manager to later confirm it was (management-probably need to coach your front line, this seems to be a recurring issue for your guests).\n\nWe were offered another room on floor three next to the loud appliances that no one ever wants... that's exactly how it was pitched to us, \"sorry we gave you a lesser room, but the only other one we can give you is even worse and no one ever wants it.\" Classy.\n\nAfter we finally got settled into a third room that magically became available later, the manager tried to deploy service recovery techniques with us and connected us with the concierge that was supposed to help us rebook a show we missed due to the check in disaster, but the concierge never called us back. He'd called us to confirm the price point we had, so he knew how to reach us...\n\nAs I spoke with the manager about our dissatisfaction and points of contention (all of which are not listed in this review), she verbalized to me that they are not what you would consider traditional high end\/luxury. I had shared my very positive experiences with her that we had at The Pierre, Mandarin Oriental, The Trump, The Conrad, Lotte, and Loews, and she basically admitted they aren't up to those standards. But yet, they are happy to charge a nightly price that would lead one to believe they rival the other properties.\n\nIf you want a place that will give you the room you pay for, have a team that will honor their commitments, not have to listen to the room service crew complain about management, know what you're going to get when you order room service, have a helpful hand at the entrance when your hands are full of luggage, get help hailing a taxi if needed, have heat or air conditioning, and not have to audit your folio for incorrect charges (yeah.. the 'one night credit' they offered was originally applied backwards and they instead were charging us even more for the horrendous experience)..... even the management agrees that 1 Hotel is not the place for you.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We upgraded the room and it was nice but the bathroom was odd in the sense that it wasn't very private.  They have designed a glass shower that is part of the main room but also part of the bathroom so in order to get privacy while doing what we all do, you need to pull a curtain which barely covers, nothing romantic about that :( .

As a friend said, one needs to really lower ones expectations on service when one visits new york. After several mishaps during stay, including with room service, will probably not be back here. They didnt even accept their mistakes, making me feel like a complete idiot. e.g. they refused to believe that what they sent with room service was different than what was in the menu - and that too completely burnt. At a nicer hotel they would have simply apologized and sent a replacement. But instead what i. got was a long argument which i didnt need and spoit my mood. And they would enter your room even when privacy light is on, without even a phone call. Also the location is basically tourist central, so not exactly relaxing.

That is too early for a hotel kitchen to close in Manhattan.  They don\u2019t have soap in the rooms \u2026 just pump canisters with shower product \u2026 seems cheap, to me.   The hotel charges a $45 \u201cResort Fee\u201d that is not discussed when you make a reservation.  The hotel has no resort \u2026 it\u2019s a hidden charge for the Wi-Fi, in-room coffee, fitness center, etc.  These are amenities they advertise as \u201cfree\u201d.  It is a total rip off and just a way to charge more for the room while appearing to be price competitive.  I am sure a lawyer said it was legal and some executive got a bonus for dreaming up the scheme \u2026 it is false advertising and annoyed me.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Chic modern furniture, reclaimed and salvaged wood, live edge wood desk with industrial accents were all in keeping with the eco-mantra of the hotel.\n\nThe 1 does have an all day restaurant, the Jams.

I have shared some of this with the hotel but no reply yet, two days after checkout. We had two connecting rooms. The room was chilly (February!) and after one night I had to request the heavier coverlet that is shown in the photos. My teens' room had none. There was no mention of room service so I had no idea that was an option. The breakfast credit doesn't come close to covering breakfast at JAMS unless you are a single person, perhaps a couple, or if everyone just has something tiny. Our room occupancy was technically six and even though there were three of us, we went well over the breakfast credit until the final morning when we each ordered a small item and just one glass of orange juice (the kids drank water). Other five-star hotels have breakfast included booked with AmEx or Virtuoso, etc, so something similar would be nice. The house car was a nice touch and we used it twice.

Beyond the awesome sustainability philosophy of the 1 Hotel brand, the staff (or 1 Team as they are known) at this property consistently go above & beyond to make your stay incredible. Management truly cares about not only the physical environment at the hotel itself (we were first here in 2017 and the hotel has never looked better) but ensures the 1 Team is focused on customer satisfaction, and then some! We stayed here the week before Christmas and unfortunately had to cut our trip short by a day as a big winter storm was forecast for our last day. The 1 Team took such great care of us - starting with Chester at check-in, explaining all the aspects of the hotel (and greeting us in the mornings as if we were part of the family) and then Flo, wanting to be sure our room met all our expectations.  Brayam and Luis, the Concierge team, gave us great recommendations on what to do, and what to see, and handled our restaurant bookings. When we told the team we were excited to see a Knicks game later in the week (our first time at Madison Square Garden), Andrew & Flo sent up a sweet plate of cookies and chocolate and wished us a great time at the game. Such a thoughtful gesture! We were going to grab an Uber to MSG when at the last minute, Chester flagged down the Hotel's Electric Audi courtesy car for us. Talk about being driven in style to the game! One morning while waiting for my family at Jams for breakfast, Nicole the hostess saw I was alone and struck up a conversation with me, and made sure to sit me next to a power outlet to charge my phone while I waited. She also held our table until my family arrived. Again, it's these small gestures that really do make a difference! As we had to depart a day early, Josh at the Front Desk made sure our bill was adjusted, and ensured our last dinner reservation for that night was cancelled. Luis recommended an excellent restaurant (Sarabeth's) very near the hotel for our 'last breakfast'. It was excellent. All in all, we can't wait to come back to NYC & the 1 Hotel Central Park. The hotel is fantastic but it's the 1 Team that makes this the best hotel in NYC! Congrats 1 Team on exceeding our expectations once again!","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel was very central to all we had to do and see in NYC and overall is an excellent value. I have been to the chic location in Hollywood, CA (we are from Los Angeles) and had loved it as well. This was a great little spot and was perfect for our mini-vacation in the city. The lobby was super cozy with plenty of seating to chill with a glass of wine and was decorated so beautifully for the holidays. The rooms were extremely clean and well-appointed. Not overly luxurious, but the bathrooms were spacious and had great lighting. Everyone on staff was very helpful, nice and super accomodating. The menu at Jams was a bit limited and we had hoped to see a bit more offered especially for dinner, but everything tasted great and was delivered very quick. Housekeeping was also fantastic and the rooms were always very neat  and tidy. They were very accommodating especially because my daughter had a head cold and they let us stay in the room late and still managed to have someone service the room which was so helpful. I know that bed comfort is a hard thing to rate as it is such an individual preference, so I say this with that caveat in mind but I found the beds to be a bit too hard for me and made it difficult to sleep. But I am super light and not the average size where most would prefer a more stiff bed so I am sure this would be comfortable for most. The location couldn't be more perfect. It was one block from Central Park, Subway stations, 5th Avenue shopping (Bergdorf's,, Tiffany's etc.). There is a Starbuck's across the street along with a wonderful Merci Market filled with everything you could ever need. I loved our location, the hotel and the staff!

The property itself is spectacular. They really decorated it nice for the holidays. Upon arrival we were greeted by Kyle who really made our night by giving us an upgrade from a Queen bed to a King! We did not specify that my fianc\u00e9 (now wife) and I were in NY to elope so it really made our elopement experience special. The staff is super friendly and attentive! Heidi followed up after we checked in to make sure that we got all of our packages that we sent to the hotel and even followed up after our stay as one of our packages did not make it in time. She helped me sort out sending the package back which goes above and beyond in my opinion. The staff provided umbrellas when it was raining one day which was super convenient! Two other cool features about the property is that they have a complimentary Audi to take you anywhere in a 15 block radius. My wife and I took it to our ceremony in Central Park. 1 Hotel also has an app which is pretty cool.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":6883205,"title":"Unauthorized charges & NOT a luxury experience","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-12-02","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"1) For starters, we had to pay for our entire booking up front because we were staying for Thanksgiving\u2014& they seriously price gouge for holidays. They sent us an invoice reflecting a gotcha $32\/day \u201cdestination fee,\u201d which appeared to have been included in the invoice we\u2019d just paid. However, we learned *after* our visit that the invoice was inaccurate & we weren\u2019t charged the total $156 destination fee until *after* our stay, which was very confusing because we were under the impression it had already been paid. We also had to request the invoice, as they hadn\u2019t sent one for 2 days after taking almost $7k of our money. \n2) My mother was handed 2 bakery items by concierge on Thanksgiving morning\u2026she asked if they were complimentary, to which the employee replied, \u201cyes, of course they are.\u201d However, we ended up being charged $22 for these 2 bakery items\u2014only discovered at checkout. \n3) We expected to only owe about $150 for the extremely overpriced & very small portion-sized green drinks & fish tacos we\u2019d gotten, but instead we were looking at a $322 bill: the drinks, tacos, not-so-complimentary bakery items, & the destination fee we thought we\u2019d already paid. Even worse: the front desk associate didn\u2019t even bother to verify the charges with us or to even notify us that she was attempting to charge the card on file before doing so. She said she was \u201cjust checking everything over\u201d & then suddenly declared that the card on file had been declined. This is the point at which we learned about the bakery items & the destination fee. \n4) My husband received a printout today showing that they attempted to charge us an additional $600 for god only knows what\u2014hours before we\u2019d even checked in! They then charged .01 shortly afterward, no doubt trying to test his bank & weasel any money out of us that they could. Then they attempted to charge his card 2x 6 hours before our scheduled checkout (2 hours before our actual checkout)\u2014& when that didn\u2019t work they tried to charge $100\u2026again trying to weasel any money out of us that they could. We ended up corresponding via email regarding the final charges & I was told at 7:30am that we still owed the $322, however, 6 hours later, they attempted to charge my husband\u2019s card $1,735.54!!! When my husband called to ask about it they told him it was the remaining balance for our room. He informed them that we\u2019d been required to pay for our room in full prior to our stay due to the holiday & the man then said that \u201csometimes the system will just charge random amounts if the first attempt is declined.\u201d \u2026A random amount of over $1,700?!?! They then attempted to charge $302 2x while we were conversing via email; this was apparently after they so generously removed the $22 charge for the *complimentary* bakery items. \n5) Our tv wouldn\u2019t work properly on our final night & they had to send in a tech to get it working. The problem seemed to be resolved but 5 minutes later we were having the exact same problem again. At that point we were too frustrated to bother calling the tech back in. \n6) The Thanksgiving breakfast basket had bland yogurt, stale bakery items (which is why my mom took the complimentary ones from the lobby), and 3 cups worth of coffee in a thermos\u2014& they charged $80 for it! We used our room credit towards the basket but its still a ridiculously high price for a cold breakfast for 2. They also took our basket that still had several items left in it while we were out\u2014so we didn\u2019t even get to finish what we\u2019d already paid for!\n7) The entire hotel smells of patchouli or some equally offensive\u2014very pungent\u2014aroma that just smacks you in the face right when you walk in & the rooms are TINY. There is no bath tub & the open glass bathroom might *look* cool, but its extremely inconvenient when you\u2019re rooming with family members. The bathrobes are horribly uncomfortable & the towels feel like floor mats. \nIn conclusion: I absolutely do not recommend this hotel for anyone. It looks very cool & has a nice kitschy vibe\u2014but that\u2019s as far as the positives go. The whole place is cramped, smells bad, is overpriced, & they\u2019ve had us stressed out since the moment we tried to check out, for 3 days now. They did end up finally overlooking our remaining $302 balance\u2014but only after my husband confronted them about all the extremely erroneous charges that were attempted on his card. I hate to think how difficult it would\u2019ve been to get our money back had his card been charged successfully\u2026& I honestly wonder how many others have also received charges like these without noticing until it was too late.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Not only is the location prime, the rooms gorgeous and the service impeccable but if you\u2019re lucky enough to snag a room overlooking 6th Ave (aka Ave of the Americas) you can enjoy prime viewing of the parade from the comfort of the most cozy window seat large enough for two or three! To top it off, JAMS restaurant in the hotel offers a Thanksgiving Day Parade Basket to be delivered to your room, filled with the most scrumptious pastries, coffee, OJ, yogurt, granola and fruit. It is beyond sublime! To top it off the staff at the hotel are amazing! Everyone we came into contact with \u2014 from Christopher in Guest Services, to Kyle at Check In, the lovely doorman known simply as Gee, to Anderson who escorted us (and our luggage) to the parking garage a few doors down after the parade ended so that we could avoid the crowds and the added time it would have taken for us to get our car (and thus expedited our departure) \u2014 was beyond reproach. The staff is simply the best of the best. I wish I could recall everyone\u2019s name because they all deserve a shout out. But a special acknowledgment to Christopher who truly made our stay with the hotel extraordinary. This was our second, return visit. The first was 6-7 years ago when my child and I visited the hotel with my parents, also during Thanksgiving and had two rooms directly overlooking 6th Ave. With my father having passed away since then and my procrastinating having made reservations till the last minute, I worried that our return visit would pale in comparison to the first. But Christopher did everything in his power to ensure our stay was truly splendid, including getting us into a room near the corner of the hotel (at 6th Ave & 58th Street) on the 4th Floor that had a prime view of the parade, allowing us to watch it from our room rather than have to rise early to snag a spot of street. I also would be remiss not to mention JAMS\u2019 staff who helped us navigate constantly changing, last-minute reservations at the restaurant. Mariela Estrada, Murat Erbil and MenSa Smith we\u2019re all incredibly gracious and accommodating. This holiday at 1 Central Park was truly one to remember! I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough! Cheers!","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I prefer smaller, boutique hotels and this fit the bill.  Lorenzo, the concierge,  was my first interaction with the hotel.  I wanted flowers delivered for the birthday girl in our group.  He quickly responded and had a magnificent arrangement delivered while we were at dinner.  The hotel also delivered a bottle of Prosecco and a lovely note for the birthday girl.  Check-in was delightful.  Christopher and Brian took extra good care of us and offered us an upgrade to the Penthouse Suite from 2 rooms for a small fee.  Of course we said YES Please.  We were able to move to the Penthouse on the 2nd of our 3 night stay and GK moved all our luggage, flowers, prosecco and our shopping bags while we were away for the day.  We dined at Jams and Daniel took extra time to go over the menu and help us make the best choices - the JW Chicken & Fries and Kale Salad were both delicious.  He went the extra mile and brought dessert for our birthday girl.  Now about the Penthouse Suite 1710.  It is a 2 bedroom\/2.5 bath corner suite with views of Central Park.  There are two living rooms and a small kitchenette and an 8 person dining area. It was extremely clean.  The only complaint was the lighting in the bathrooms.  It was very fitting for the aesthetic but not great for women getting ready.  The master had a beautiful copper soaking tub, river rock floors, dual rain & wall showers.  The beds were a tad firm but the bedding and pillows were very comfortable.  If small hotels with attention to detail are your vibe this is the place for you.  Thanks for a wonderful stay 1 Hotel.

Our room was lovely and had the best view of Central Park, very comfortable bed, nice linens, luxurious bath products and the best robes I have ever had in a hotel. We were on the 17th floor and literally did not hear a sound all night including the famous NYC car horn. We had everything we needed in our room and when we called down for one thing that we did not have they were knocking at the door in less than ten minutes with our request. Another thing we loved so much was that all the water in the hotel is filtered which I have only seen in one other hotel outside of the United States. We had dinner in Jams one night and were blown away by the service and our dinners I had the Wild Striped Bass which was DELICIOUS and will get it again as soon as I can get back there and my daughter had the Gnocchi which was also very tasty. Our servers were so attentive and friendly and dining room was warm and inviting. It was surprisingly quiet for a busy place. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and can not wait to return and also try other 1 Hotels. ","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

We had 3 rooms in the hotel.  The hotel itself was amazing.  The rooms were clean, well-appointed, super comfortable.  The location was perfect - close to Central Park & within walking distance of Broadway, subway stations, restaurants, pretty much everything you would want.  However, what set this hotel apart from every other hotel we have ever staying in was the concierge, Lorenzo Gutierrez.  Lorenzo worked with me for weeks before our trip with advice on places to go and things to do.  He secured reservations for us and transportation to and from the airport.  He contact me immediately when he found our that our flight had been cancelled to see if we needed additional help getting to NYC.  While we were in NYC, he responded to every question we had (and there were many) quickly and thoroughly.  Could we have navigated a family trip to NYC without him - yes.  Would I ever want to do so again - no.  He patient, prompt and thorough assistance made out trip so much less stressful and more enjoyable.  I would stay in this hotel again just work have access to him and everyone else working the front desk.  1 Hotel NYC's greatest resource is the people working at the hotel.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

We tried pretty much all of the drinks, plus some they whipped up for our curious taste buds. \n\nWe had the pleasure of meeting Joe Torres, from 1 Hotel SF, who was on assignment. He made our time even more special.  WE can\u2019t wait to visit the property in SF when it opens. \n\nOur only delta for the trip was with the menu. We asked for a grilled cheese for our little guy\u2014an off menu item and they declined our request. So if you have younger kids with limited tastes, you may find it difficult to eat at the restaurant.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

While you can find luxury hotels all over the city, there are always (in my experience) status\/class judgements made by the staff and you are treated accordingly. \n\nAt the 1 Hotel, this couldn't be farther from the case. From check in to check out, the staff was SO kind, flexible, understanding, and hospitable. In many cases, they went out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed. Not just on check in and check out days. \n\nSafety is always my top priority when I'm traveling for business solo. I felt safe everywhere in the building and the location is optimal for walking\/arriving at night if you have late events. \n\nNot only did I feel safe and taken care of by the staff, but they went out of their way to ensure that I had a room when my flight was canceled last minute (7pm that night).  When I asked about availability for that night, they could have laughed or let me figure it out myself. Even with pretty much full commitments, they were able to help me arrange accommodations for that night. AND they kept my previous rate. Truly best in class. \n\nWhile I wasn't able to catch the names of every staff member who made my experience so wonderful, I have a few saved that I'd like to thank: \n- Christopher, Nirio, Joshua, and G.

When we got back, we were not informed at the reception when collecting our keys that our luggage was not yet in the room- we had to go back down and request for it.

Miserable excuse of a filmsy wooden sliding door for the bathroom that hardly did the job of providing aesthetics nor full functionality. \n\nCherry on the cake- we got a miserable plate of 3 stale cookies put out cold on the table, with a scribbled note, as a wedding celebration 'gift'. Certainly screams 'luxury from a 5-star hotel' doesn't it? It felt insulting, akin to a real slap in the face. Even Holiday Inn could deliver a more sincere touch than this cheap gesture that sought to deliver at its lowest. \n\nThere are plenty of hotels in this neighborhood that can provide a better level of service and attention to details.

Superb Staff & Prime Location","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-02-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This is the best hotel in all of Manhattan! For years we have come to the city and have stayed at other 5 star properties but only 1 Hotel Central Park has ever exceeded our expectations and they do it every time we stay there! \n\nThis hotel has everything and the location is prime!  There is a plethora of cafes, restaurants and shopping just steps outside the hotel,  even if you don't want to spend your entire time in midtown the subway is around the corner with a short ride to downtown. \n\nI love this hotel because they are consistent in their service standards; the rooms are clean and on trend never looking outdated, the linens are top quality and the room amenities are plentiful!  \n\nBut it is the staff that sets them apart from the other 5 star properties and they are what really make this property special. It's becoming rare now of days to find kind, happy people who enjoy their jobs, who actually stop for a moment to engage with their customers\/guests. The staff at this hotel genuinely make you feel like they are welcoming you into their own personal home!\n\nEveryone we came into contact with made us feel special and took a personal interest in how our stay was without being invasive or coming across robotic like they had to ask. I wish I could remember the names of everyone who we encountered, especially the doorman and bellman because they should know even their small gestures of anticipatory service impacted our experience in a big positive way.  \n\nFrom our lovely housekeeper who offered to bring us up water after learning we ran out and then doubled up on the next night just to ensure we would not go without again, to the brilliant Richard at concierge who has now assisted us on two trips, he has a pulse on everything that is trending in the city and has without fail recommended the best places no matter what kind of experience or vibe we are looking for. His communication is efficient starting with pre arrival and follows through on requests and confirmations. I never worried I wasn't booked for a request I asked for. He is even willing to step outside his immediate role to assist us by going above and beyond when we were running late getting back to the airport and could not find a cab, Richard not only had the front drive staff on the corner trying to hail a cab but he went out himself almost down the entire block trying to help hail one! I feel like any other hotel would have just pointed to the front door and said good luck. I also can not forget to mention the wonderful Chester, the overnight front desk agent who without hesitation at 2 a.m. accommodated a later check out due to canceled flights we just learned about. His cheerfulness and willing spirit to help us that late and not pass along the request to the morning staff was the kind of reaction we needed under a stressful situation to make us feel at ease and that everything was going to be okay. \n\nI can not say enough about this property, sure you can spend the same amount per night at surrounding hotels but what is priceless at this hotel is the staff, I will never stay at another property  because we know our friends at 1 Hotel Central Park will always take care of their guests!","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Even friends and relatives.  I will definitely stay there again.  The hotel sent a car to pick me up at the airport, and I can tell you that it was well worth it. The food in the restaurant was better than good, with a little bit of a limited menu, but they are adding items, with specials of the day according to Covid and\/or customer demand.  Minibar in the room (they emptied it out for me because I needed it) and a coffee\/tea maker in the room.  Beautiful functional room decor.

EVERY single person we interacted with went out of their way to be helpful, gracious and kind.

He is the shining star of the 1 hotel!  This hotel is very clean and prides itself on its eco-friendly amenities which I appreciate, but the biggest complaint I have is the room we stayed in. We chose a Central Park king room on a high floor. Great view of Central Park, but the room lacked in necessities for a room of its size and honestly for what we paid. We have stayed all over the city, from the Carlyle to The Dream hotel. I expect a full length closet and drawers. This room had what I called a \u201cmurphy closet\u201d which could hold about 4 men\u2019s dress shirts and 2 drawers which was hardly enough to unpack 2 suitcases of stuff. I had no place to hang my dresses, no place to put my shoes snd boots, one hook next to the toilet in the bathroom. I would expect a room like this in Europe but not in NYC. We may not be the demographic to attract for the 1. We like luxury in the city, turn down service, I don\u2019t want a yoga matt or feel like I\u2019m in a dorm room trying to find space for my stuff. I\u2019m sure we could have paid for a larger room but would never think to ask if the room had a closet or double sinks?

Location is amazing across from Central Park, 24 Apple Store great for the teens, 5th Avenue shopping and restaurants.  The decor is truly impressive with plants seeming to ooze out of the hotel.  The decor is maintained in the guest rooms with little surprises of plants in the bathrooms etc. We all loved the lounging area by the window. This place is an oasis in the middle of NYC and truly can appreciated by those that love nature. It is a boutique hotel so the lobby is small but decor is beautiful and inviting.  I give this a 4 out of 5 stars because the service is not on par with a 5 star hotel it is just average at best. Checkin was a bit rough, nothing really explained, no mention of what is included in the destination fee, no explanation of the restaurant, breakfast etc. Major delay in getting our bags to our room.  With all this being said it\u2019s easy to overlook because your staying in the best city in the world and the uniqueness of the hotel makes up for in lack of service.

Based on the positive reviews we read here on Trip Advisor, we decided to take a chance and book the 1 Hotel Central Park for the first time.  We regret our decision and cannot recommend this property.  Before I begin, I need to call out the staff- who were, without exception, professional and polite.  However, they are fighting a losing battle and seem to be overwhelmed (if the hotel isn't staffed properly- which is common during this difficult times- they should book fewer rooms).  After a very smooth check-in process, we proceeded up to our room- which smelled like a gym locker room.  The front desk couldn't have been more apologetic and quickly switched us to another room (and re-routed our baggage).  All good so far.  However, problems persisted.  Due to our personal health concerns, we asked the front desk to instruct Housekeeping to just drop off towels each day- and not clean the room.  Instead, they did a full cleaning of the room and touched everything.  Next, our themostat  didn't work.  The only way to adjust the temperature was to call the front desk and have maintenance do so remotely.  This required multiple calls each day since we like the temperature cooler at night than during the day.  The temperature was never quite right- and the whole thing was ridiculous.  We tried to call room service, but no one picked up.  We called again 10 minutes later; again, no one picked up.  We tried to call DoorDash\/UberEats for delivery, but the internet was so weak in the room that we couldn't get a signal for any website throughout our stay.  So I put on my shoes and went down to the hotel's restaurant to ask if I could order food I could take back to the room.  The greeter couldn't have been nicer and said I didn't have to come down, but I could just call down my order.  When I mentioned that no one was answering the phone (the restaurant was only 1\/3 full), he was clearly embarrassed, quickly took our order and actually came upstairs to help deliver the food and apologize again for the inconvenience.  When we finished eating at 8pm, I called the front desk to ask for the tray (which we left outside the door) be picked up.  While the front desk promised to take care of it, the tray was still outside when we left for breakfast at 8am the next morning.  I was able to speak with Manager Ani- who listened intently to my concerns and said she would follow-up.  We didn't ask for anything to be taken off our bill- and she didn't offer.  While we had booked for 3 nights, we checked out after only 2.  It just wasn't worth the hassle- and we won't be returning.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Our flight had us in early at 9am, the hotel was more than happy to hold bags until our room was available which allowed us to get right to hitting the streets for the day!\n\n We were given the option to upgrade our room for an additional cost, the additional cost included a Central Park view, and let me tell you what. It was worth every penny. I honestly did not want to leave this room. The window seat was the best! The amount of thought that went into each detail of this property and room is more than I ever expected. The d\u00e9cor, the staff, the view, the location. It was beyond perfection.

This year, we no longer live in the city, so thought it'd be nice to take a visit to the city on the new year's day and do the things we used to do like jogging in Central Park, shopping at Columbus Circle, or simply people watch on the street. \n\nI chose 1 Hotel Central Park mainly for its cozy interior and the location. Upon arriving at the hotel, I immediately fell in love with the interior. It was exactly what I thought the hotel would be... the smell, the light, and the warmth! Everything was perfect until the morning... as I woke up to get ready for my jog in the Central Park, I came to realize there was no running water on the premises. \n\nAfter getting in touch with the front desk receptionists, I learned that there was some work being done in the city and unfortunately went wrong, so we wouldn't get water until further notice. Shocking and annoyed, I know it wasn't the staff's fault, so all I asked was to keep us informed and let us know if there's any alternative solutions found. As the last receptionist I spoke to promised to keep me posted, I sat and waited next to the hotel telephone but the phone never rang. Our morning schedule was ruined... no jogging, no showering, and worst of all... no water to even flush the toilet. \n\nAs it got close to our checkout time, I was packed and ready to leave the hotel. I decided to give the front desk one last call because I couldn't believe there was still no update after close to 4 hours since my initial call. I made the call and soon learned that the hotel staff was instructed to give guests water bottles since the city was still trying to figure out where the pipe issue was. I was furious because we were never told from the previous staff we spoke to ... nor did we receive any voluntary updates until this last call was made. If you're still reading this review, maybe you think I'm an annoying guest. But let me be clear ... I made no complaints to any hotel staff since the morning because I know it wasn't the staff's fault that there was no running water. My simple ask was \"let me know when the water will be back. Thanks\". The staff in the hotel, they were simply the messengers which means they failed at doing their job at this point. \n\nFrustrated and disappointed, I expressed my anger to Chris, the hotel staff I spoke to last. He apologized for his colleagues and immediately sent water bottles to our room. He later promised to take care of the hotel charges & fees for us. If it wasn't for Chris, I think this review would have been 1 star. In fact, after Chris took care of us, it made us want to give 1 Hotel Central Park another shot. \n\nAfter we checked out from the hotel, ironically, I saw two text messages from the hotel automated system. One says we're free to use the water bottles provided in the mini bar at 8:47am. The other one says the water is back on at. 11:18am (like literally after we checked out). The problem then became apparent to me. The hotel used \"technology\" for its communication but it didn't work in time. No staff told me to watch out for text messages and all my focus was waiting for the hotel phone to ring since that last the means of my communication with the staff throughout this time.\n\nHaving stayed at many different hotels in the world. I truly had the fixed feelings about this experience. The hotel was lovely and the staff was helpful on individual basis but the dots were not connected across the system; hence, the overall experience was poor. Very poor indeed. \n\nI'm writing this review in the hope that the hotel management team would acknowledge outstanding customer service from Chris but also want to point out what's broken in the system so that it can be fixed for future reference because I truly hope to experience 1 Hotel Central Park the way it's been designed to experience! Good luck.","travelDate":"2021-01","tripType":"NONE"}

I was looking for a unique, kitschy, boutique experience and was I ever surprised by what I found in 1 Hotel Central Park. The website doesn't give too much away about their appearance and I won't ruin the surprise but it is WILDLY gorgeous, smells heavenly, and is so safe and clean. Walking into the lobby you feel like you're taking a timeout; a really high class, relaxing timeout. Not to mention their staff is incomparable in kindness, helpfulness, and generosity of spirit. We dealt closely with their manager Miriam, desk clerk, Josue, & doormen Andrew and Shane. These people were professional while still being personal. As it was our wedding, they went beyond all expectations I had to make it a special weekend for us. When we left they felt like family, if for no other reason than I will remember them as such a crucial part in pulling off my wedding day.\n\nI'd also like to add: their COVID protocols were clear and concise without tainting the experience. It's hard to do anything right now without COVID being all up in your face, no pun intended. At 1 Hotel Central Park, everything is SO CLEAN in general but the social distancing measures they've taken are obvious but tasteful.","travelDate":"2020-12","tripType":"NONE"}

It was great to simply order a soy cappuccino to my room with the app. I got an answer that it could take up to 30 minutes but after 10 minutes it was already delivered and this service is available 24 hours a day. I also loved the hoodie bathrobe in jogging suit fabric.\n\nThe food in JAMS is super delicious and again everything is organic - perfect for me, because I enjoy the same quality on vacation as at home.\n\nOne evening JAMS was closed due to an event, but for hotel guests there was a delicious buffet and drinks in the lobby, a very nice idea!\n\nThe apple bar every morning in the lobby with regional organic fruit was great.\n\nI have rarely been to a hotel with organic amenity products that smell so good as shampoo, conditioner, body lotion did.  I have long hair, so it was especially nice for me to see that the hotel also put a hair tie in the shower.  Someone was just thinking!\n\nOn my check-out day the street was closed because ice sheets came down. A staff member was escorting me and my luggage to the the Plaza Hotel where my driver was waiting.  That's what I call excellent service.\n\nIn conclusion, I have never been in a hotel where the overall package was so close to perfection.

The hotel location a block from Central Park and walking distance of Columbus Circle and Rockefeller Center is great. There are many other pluses but my stay was severely undermined by unfulfilled promises due to poor communication between staff, managers who were not readily accommodating, and poor follow through when errors were noted and later compounded. For a pricey hotel their apology was stingy.. upon reservation I had been promised a $100 food voucher. Problems: the room was not ready at 6 pm at night. The only apology was the offer of a bottle of water. They had no record of the voucher and expected me to show them the paperwork. They eventually found the paperwork but when we check out they double billed us rather than crediting us. Prior arrangements were made because of dietary restrictions. On two occasions these had not been passed on to the kitchen and at dinner on Thanksgiving it took 40 minutes just to get a roll. But that is only the beginning of the problem. The dinner ended up being free, which was warranted and I am grateful. That is how the hotel should have handled other issues. In the end of our stay, I experienced at least 4 major incidents and the overcharge for the room. I didn't receive a written apology or a deduction of the cost of my room. Clearly, the different departments need to coordinate better and the managers need to be better trained on communication and in apologies for errors that are of their own making. For these reasons, I give the hotel a poor overall rating. Which is too bad because the hotel has many positives.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The best aspect of this hotel is its location, right near Central Park, luxury shopping at Bergdorf's, the new Nordstrom Flagship, etc., short walk to MoMA, Rockefeller Center, Columbus Circle, etc. I will also preface this review by saying everyone who works at the hotel is courteous, hard-working, and doing their best in a tough physical space. What do I mean? Well, first of all, the lobby area is tiny, crowded, and cramped. You have people trying to check-in and check-out; basically what amounts to a little larger than a podium stand as the concierge desk, and three small seating areas to \"relax\"--all within a very tiny footprint. I arrived on a Friday evening--well past the official check-in time of 3pm--and was told my room wasn't ready yet and was being \"inspected.\" The front desk gentleman offered to comp me a drink in the lobby while I waited. I was tired from a long flight and just wanted to get into my room. There was literally no place for me to sit, even if I did want a drink. I also find it unacceptable to not have the room ready. Management should operate the hotel with the assumption that every single guest is checking-in at 3:01pm. Again, at almost $1,000 per night, I was pretty floored.\n\nThere were also some usability issues and details with the room that made my stay less than enjoyable. For example, the bathroom had almost zero counter space. And my in-room Nespresso machine was broken (I even watched a YouTube video to make sure I was pushing the right buttons). The hotel is not soundproof enough. One morning around 8am I heard the couple next door having sex loudly (he was a screamer). And later on, a baby was wailing for an hour. Meanwhile, the three elevators are quiet but excruciatingly slow and small. \n\nSince the hotel is eco-friendly, they encourage you to download their mobile app as the main way to order food, learn about hotel amenities, etc. So I downloaded it and ordered room service for dinner one evening. When I was finished, I went on the app to request tray pickup. I received confirmation that my request was received. Well, the next morning, my tray was still outside my door and never picked up. I also ordered coffee one morning as part of room service breakfast (my Nespresso machine was broken, remember). It was the most tasteless, weak coffee I've ever tasted. I resorted to walking across the street to Starbucks every morning.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We would then sleep over at a hotel at or near the Parade route, and get up early on Thanksgiving morning to see the Macy's Parade (and even occasionally enjoy a room with a Parade view). \n\nOver the years, as the Parade route would occasionally change, my family and I stayed at the Dream Hotel on Broadway, the Manhattan at Times Square Hotel on Seventh Avenue, the JW Marriott Essex Hotel on Central Park South, and the Park Lane Hotel, also located on Central Park South. And as wonderful as our stays were over the years at those hotels, none of them compared to our recent Thanksgiving stay at the 1 Hotel Central Park Hotel.\n\nEverything is just perfect about this hotel, from its location (just steps away from Central Park South and Central Park itself), the eclectic yet beautifully adorned rooms (which are kept absolutely spotless), and most importantly the entire staff, who always went the extra mile to accommodate all of our needs, and did so with a smile and a lot of holiday spirit.

I hesitantly booked a Central Park Suite as it only clocked in at 450 square feet for $1400 a night, which would have put us any of the nicest hotels in the city.   Reading several reviews on Trip Advisor about the simply superb service, I came into the weekend with high expectations for service and reasonable expectations on the accommodations.   \n\nWe arrived at the hotel at 1:45, knowing check in was not until 3pm, hoping the room would be ready, but it was not and that was fine.   We were told that we'd be given a call when the room was ready and went out to grab some lunch.   We had a 6:30 dinner reservation to celebrate, so we snacked here and there and returned to the front desk at 3:45 never having received a phone call.   At 3:45 the Front Desk told us that the room was clean and just needed to be inspected and it would be 10 more minutes.   OK, I understand,  As I was walking away I thought I heard confirmation that housekeeping had just gotten into the room, but I gave the woman at the front the desk the benefit of doubt.   At 4:05 my wife started asking me to complain (she is 8.25 months pregnant and really wanted to rest before dinner) but I gave them another 10 minutes and at 4:15, the room was indeed finally ready.   I understand sh*t happens - maybe the last guest stayed way past the Noon check out etc...  What I did not appreciate was being lied to that the room simply just needed to be inspected.\n\nWhen we unloaded the car at 1:45, they took our bags but never gave us a claim ticket, so they asked me to describe our 4 bags and told us they'd be right up.   At 4:25 we called to check where the bags were and they said they were on their way.   At 4:35 we called again, and they were still on their way.  At 4:45 I was getting angry and finally someone knocked on the door with a cart of \"not our\" bags.   He was very apologetic and said he would be right back with them and I insisted to come with him, so this debacle of check in process could finally be over.   Upon being taken down to the 3rd floor, I went into a room with an unmade bed and towels all over the floor - a dirty room that they were using for bag storage and identified our luggage and bellman took them up, and finally just before 5pm we had our room and our luggage.   The bellman asked if we had been to the hotel before, and I said it was out first time to which we replied \"Oh man, I am sorry\" .  \n\nAt 6:15 we came down to leave for dinner and asked if the house car could take us to 53rd and Lexington to which they said yes, and it would be 5 minutes.   10 minutes later we asked the doorman to please check in and see if they were close, and for some reason he was hesitant to make the call, finally making it at 6:28 and the car was still 5 minutes away.   So we hopped in a cab at 6:30 for our 6:30 anniversary dinner.    Superb Service huh ?\n\nThe rest of our stay was uneventful.   The room was very nice, the bed very comfortable, but that doesn't make a hotel stand out.   My wife, who wanted to come for the green initiatives was disappointed that despite hanging our towels on the hook to be re-used, we got new towels at cleaning and turn down and that bathroom products were far from environmentally friendly.  She loved the Fall decor, but agreed it was not worth the price.\n\nAll in all, it was an average stay but again not worth the price tag compared to other luxury hotels that address you by name and do not miss one detail of  the superb service and hospitality once can expect in Manhattan.  Its a great location but we left disappointed.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Not too mention, the intoxicating smell of the lobby, so fresh and so clean.  I love the 1 Hotel, it's my home away from home.  And the staff is absolutely amazing.. I usually check in closer to midnight and when I arrive one of my most favorite people greets me in the lobby, with a familiar welcome.. He remembers my name, gives me a huge smile and asks me if I need anything before I head up to my room.  As soon as I get the room, I'm instantly in my element, comfortable bedding, relaxing lights, and the fresh clean scent of the 1 Hotel.  I can go on and on about this hotel, but it's best for travelers to truly experience not only the exceptional service but a great space to hang out.

Every evening after either a long day in the freezing cold office or a day in the sweltering heat, coming back to my room was absolute bliss. The natural interior (stone, wood, plants) was so calming and relaxing, I truly enjoyed spending my evenings here. \nMy room (as well as the bathroom) were quite spacious, very clean and quiet. In terms of amenities, the bed was super comfy, the shower had great water pressure and there was plenty shampoo, shower gel and moisturiser (unlike the mini portions you get in some other hotels).\nI ordered room service a couple of nights which was very good and the staff were extremely friendly. In addition, I was able to connect my Netflix to the TV as well which made me even happier.\n\nThere was an incident on one of the nights when the hotel seemed to be struggling with their fire alarm as it went off every 30-ish minutes which was the only negative I can report and pretty annoying at 3am in the morning.\n\nAside from that I would always stay here again.

Seriously, it's not a fee that the customer can opt out of so just up the nightly room rate. There are active law suites against Hilton & Marriott corporation in certain states against this practice because it's clearly a deception when compare rates.

O carpete sujo do andar fica imundo no caminho da suite e na porta da escada, ao lado da suite, eh algo nojento e contrangedor. Tentei mudar de suite, alegando que ficaria 5 noites e nao iria ficar em um lugar assim, sem vista inclusive, apenas com uma vista interna.

The upkeep of the room is substandard with stiff shower door that could not be closed properly.  The room was not too clean when i did a wipe down which I always do at all hotels.  The air conditioning system was not working well, but it was acceptable.  There was a false fire alarm at 3am in the morning and we were all woken up by an announcement in the sound system in the room which scared us.  The person who made the announcement = was not clear and I had to get out of bed to find the phone to call the reception to find out what was going on.  The hotel made an apology to the incident with an email, a note and some cookies which as quite nice of them.  The staff were all very friendly with good service and common sense which is important when answering our questions.  The kitchen was under renovations, so only cold food was served in the morning.  Both the bagel and the croissant were horrible and the hotel can absolutely do better with those.  Coffee was not good either, so we opted to go to the Starbucks across the street every morning instead.  I would not stay at this hotel again as the rooms are too small.

We booked for eight nights and left after one day. \n\nThe person that checked us in was totally disinterested, could not smile and never looked at me directly.  I certainly did not feel welcome.\n\nI think the hotel is badly designed.  We booked a City View Suite.  It was pretty expensive and we had reasonably high expectations which were soon shattered.  The suite consists of two rooms.  The bedroom is small. The \"living room\" is reasonable.  But the real problem is the bathroom.  The door\/wall is glass.  The bathroom faces the outside window.  By City View, they mean looking across 58th street at another building.   People in that building had a view right into the bathroom including the toilet. We had to close the drapes when we used the facilities.  There was no way to turn on the bathroom lights when I got up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet without waking up my wife.  \n\nWe asked at the front desk about upgrading to a Park View room which had a bathroom that did not face an apartment. across the street. We were told the cost of upgrading would be $250 and that was after a discount.

No need - this hotel really ticks all the boxes for me, most importantly an excellent location to base from. It`s close to Central Park, subway stations and really easy walking distance to Broadway, West Village, Upper East Side, Times Square and plenty of other places. Several good restaurants nearby and The Plaza food hall is down the street, which is a great place to grab a morning coffee and snack before wandering through the park. The hotel itself is quite unique - I think they have done something pretty impressive in setting up an eco-focused hotel that is still high-end. The small details are all there and the service was excellent. I particularly liked the little differences from other hotels, such as the push lighting and do not disturb buttons, the steamer instead of iron, and the reading nook that looked out over 6th Avenue.

The interior of the hotel and the rooms are nicely done and the \"window seat\" in the room is great.  Our room on the 17th floor had a view of Central Park!  The rain shower was awesome.

Hotel itself is OK (although dark and the bathrooms lack any privacy), and the restaurant Jams is actually lovely, but the service we received was atrocious. During our stay we were left with a batch of \"clean\" laundry which was covered in blood - and I mean covered - for which we received no reassurance that the towels were just heavily stained and not someone else's bloodied towel from another room. Neither did we receive an apology. On check out a manager did show some concern and agreed to provide us with a refund off our bill as a gesture of goodwill. The refund was processed but entirely unknown to me (until my credit card bill arrived), the hotel had credited the refund back to themselves again a few days later. Our travel agent sorted this for us and we were refunded for a second time. However ten days later, the same thing happened - they took their money back again. Using my credit card details TWICE without my consent is simply unacceptable but, it would appear, not worthy of an apology as we have heard nothing from the hotel since by way of explanation or apology. Overall, a bad experience we won't be repeating.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Upon arriving, we asked if it would be possible to do an early check-in. Michael, who helped us, said that it was, but that the only room available was an ADA compliant \"city king room\". We sounded a little bit unsure, but he stressed several times that the only difference between this and the non-ADA compliant room was that some shelving were lower and that there were some handles in the room to assist with mobility. Sounds like minor differences right? Wrong.\n\nThe floorplan was completely different. The nice shower you see in published photos for the \"city king room\"? Replaced with a much less interesting one. The nice window nook that they advertise on the site was completely gone and replaced with a simple sill with some plants. Moreover, there was a gigantic and extremely intrusive steel pillar in the middle of the room. Maybe these things don't seem like too big a deal, but the nice shower and the window nook were my drivers in choosing this hotel over others. Yes, there were handles for mobility and the desk was a little lower, but I can't help but feel like the other differences were deliberately and conveniently withheld from me - I just don't buy that he didn't know about the other differences.\n\nAdd that to the $50 early arrival fee they charged me, I cant help but feel a little bit jerked around.\n\nPlease avoid the ADA room, despite whatever assurances they might give you.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The halls have moss strips at he doorways that somehow makes you feel good as you walk by. The service was excellent and the location 1\/2 block from the start of central park cannot be beat for a show weekend. The restaurant is hip and inviting and the service was excellent. The breakfast was top notch and they had options for vegans and carnivores alike. The bar at night is lively and the beer and drinks were all excellent. The rooms are typical for a NYC hotel.

I wouldn't discourage anyone from staying here if wanting a mid-town hotel but I would not return again on the next trip.  More things irritated us than impressed us.  \n\nThe main drawcard is of course the great location and as a lover of all things Scandi I felt the decor in the foyer had that sort of vibe and a fresh 'woodlands' smell - so we really just loved that aspect in particular.  The other thing I really enjoyed was the smell of the great products in the bathroom.\n\nThe less impressive however.....\n\nAfter departing they charged us $15 for mini bar consumption yet we hadn't consumed anything.  We raised it with them and it was refunded so that was fine, but irritating because it meant overseas transaction fees on our credit card for no fault of ours!  On that note, what is weird with the mini bar is there are no glasses (wine, tumbler or otherwise) to use even IF you wanted to consume something from the fridge.  Weird!!!\n \nOur 'suite' had zero view whatsoever.  Not every room is going to be lucky enough to have a good view I know, but paying much more than a standard room and having a view out over an aircon system isn't great!  Incidentally the sound from that system was tolerable for us - we note others say it is really loud but we didn't notice it.  Also, yes this is Manhattan, but for a suite there was next to no room to move.\n\nThe resort fee:  a permanent grumble of ours with all hotels.  Don't tell us that all these things you 'get' are included or complimentary when you pay a daily fee for them!! \n\nOur family members received turn-down each evening in their room.  We had a higher priced room, if that meant anything, and never once had turn-down.  Also, be aware if you like your privacy that the glass bathroom doors, even with the screen pulled, leave a little to be desired!  \n\nFinally, during our stay we needed an ice bucket on three occasions.  Two out of the three times we had to follow-up either by phone or in person downstairs as it didn't turn up despite being told it would be sent 'immediately' every time.  Once we simply couldn't wait any longer and had to leave for our dinner and put a note on the door to ask them to enter and leave the ice inside.   For a five star hotel that's pretty hopeless.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had a great stay then, and the hotel was new.  We've also stayed with 1 Hotel a few times since then.  But during this last trip, we had a few problems that we hope will be addressed, so here's a new review. \n\nThe prices have now gone up by quite a bit since two plus years ago, and the hotel is showing a little wear. \nFor this recent visit we had two rooms and stayed for 5 nights, and at this cost, it wasn't cheap.\n\nPositives\nLocation, location, location; friendly staff; comfy beds; good Wi-Fi.  The staff always asks if they can help (even when they can't help or don't), and they are friendly and try to assist.  They make you feel welcomed. The window seat is lovely and relaxing. \n\nNegatives\n\n1.  When we arrived a little after 6 pm (really, 6 pm!) our rooms were not ready, so we had to wait in the crowded bar area.  They did give us a free glass of sparkling water, but we were tired from a day of traveling, and had to sit and wait for an hour before our room was ready.\n\n2.  The air conditioning noise was loud in one of the rooms we were in. One of us waited in the room to show the repair person they finally sent up, but when the worker came to the room, he said the a\/c unit was known to make the noises, that he could not easily repair it. There were no other rooms available that evening, so we used ear plugs.  But after one night, we were able to change rooms.  Guess what?  The new room's a\/c was starting to have the same problems - it was noisy but not as loud as the previous (original) room so we just stayed in this second room.  Plus, all the packing and unpacking took up valuable time.  The noise was bearable.  So that room will also have noise problems later if the a\/c problem is not looked after. \n\n3.  One evening we ordered dinner in the room.  The dinner didn't arrive.  After 2 hours, we called downstairs, and the lady that answered said she saw the waiter bringing up our food right then.  We waited an additional 45 minutes - valuable time, and we were hungry and wanted to do other things.  (We somehow thought room service would be relaxing and quicker.) So we called downstairs again.  They reordered the food and it arrived at least 3 hours late from our original order time.  We didn't have to pay for the food, they tried to make it right, but this should not have happened, especially after calling about the food more than once.  And we can't get the time back.  This from a 5 star hotel that charges a high rate.\n\n4.  As a selling point in its ads, the hotel offered a free taxi to close locations in a hotel electric car, but every time we asked (3 times), the staff said, aw, they were sorry but the car wasn't available. We even tried to book the car in advance and asked when the car would be available (we could wait or be back later), but we couldn't do that either.  The staff could never tell us when the car would be back and available. Why offer a car if you're not going to truly let the customers\/ visitors use it?\n \nThese were the biggest problems.  (We had to get the wooden key redone because it had stopped working for one of the rooms, for example, but this is minor compared to the above 4 problems.) \nAlso, the construction problems outside aren't the hotel's fault (except that the room prices are so high that you'd expect better - or more reasonable rates).  And hopefully the construction will disappear soon.  But a 5 star shouldn't have these problems.  \n\nWe had such nice stays previously that we were really disappointed and hope the a\/c gets fixed, the rooms are ready at 6 pm, and the staff are more efficient.  We want to like 1 Hotel again, but there were so many disappointments this one visit.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I would say it is anything but. I booked a junior suite which is a very expensive room and found myself on a low floor with a view of nothing more than the very large and loud HVAC equipment powering this and the other buildings around that. The room itself was small, the shower door did not close fully and whenever I showered the bathroom flooded because of this. The one redeeming quality I can mention is that the bed is comfortable.\n\nThe exercise room they dub the \u201cField House\u201d is small, cramped and full of equipment that is either broken or poorly positioned and difficult to use. Prime example would be their treadmills which have an awkward light bar in close proximity and directly above the running deck. If you are 6 feet or taller there is a good chance you might knock yourself unconscious if you had a little hop in your step. \n\nOverall I\u2019m very disappointed in this hotel, which is the last thing I would expect at these rates.

It ticks the boxes for a 5 star experience in NYC, enhanced by the signature theme of the 1 Hotel group. To be honest we were apprehensive about this when we booked, but the emphasis on being environmentally friendly did not take away from the luxury aspect of the hotel experience. \n\nService was great throughout our 6 nights. We'd arrived at 2am on our first night and the night manager went out of her way to provide us a better room away from the lifts. Amenities were simple but good quality and very well thought out. The Tesla hotel car was really handy for short trips around town. \n\nLocation was great next to central park, with Moma and most of the midtown attractions within walkable distance. Subway is also very close by. \n\nThe only problem we came across was the quality of the sound proofing, when our neighbours slammed their door the walls would literally shake. And being in NYC the overnight ambulances etc would often be noisy even when we are as high as the 12th floor. \n\nOverall this is probably one of the best hotels we've stayed at in NYC.

For New York City that is a big deal.\n\nOver the years, my family have always stayed at the Plaza or the Ritz Carlton on Central Park. These days we felt like staying somewhere a little more modern and interesting and in an attempt to settle on a new regular hotel we stayed at the Edition back in July and the 1 Hotel this week. Our intention was to choose the one we liked the most for future visits. It is going to be tricky to do that. The staff at both hotels are terrific however the concierge service at The 1 Hotel is exceptional. I thought the service from the concierge at the Edition was very poor by comparison. In fact The 1 hotel concierge service is so good it is up there with the Concierge desks at the Plaza and the Ritz Carlton...superb.\n\nI like the atmosphere and the vibe at the 1 hotel. However the Edition hotel is far more fashionable and has a very cool bar scene while the 1 Hotel is more \u2018touristy\u2019\n\nWhat really swings it towards the 1 Hotel is the location which is excellent. Our corner rooms enjoyed Central Park views. The bedrooms are also best at the 1 hotel. The showers are absolutely excellent although I wasn\u2019t very impressed with their dressing gowns ...while The Edition have the best dressing gowns ever.\n\nI\u2019m often asked by people to recommend a hotel in Manhattan. I think the Plaza is worth staying at once just because it is iconic but the Plaza rooms really are boring. After decades of visiting New York I really did feel it was time for something new and the 1 hotel fits the bill. I noticed a 1 Hotel in Miami on my last visit although I\u2019ve not stayed there. I do however appreciate sustainable, design hotels and The 1 Hotel ticks many boxes. \n\nRecommended for great service, location, welcome and comfort. ","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":6883205,"title":"Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-09-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"My wife and I recently spent one night at the 1 Central Park when we were in New York City for dinner and a show. We stayed at the 1 South Beach a couple years ago and really fell in love with the brand concept during that stay, so we were looking forward to having a chance to try this property. Everything about the service, the room, and the location were just perfect for our needs. We really loved the hotel, and so did our dog.\n\nArrival Experience:\n\nWe arrived on a Saturday in the early afternoon, and the hotel impressed us as soon as we drove up. The exterior begins the unique eco-chic theme, with greenery and reclaimed wood right on the side of the building. When we drove up, a staff member was ready to assist with our luggage and take our car for valet parking. Valet parking is pricey (as expected in New York City), at $65 per night with no in\/out privileges. However, it\u2019s convenient, so we used it. \n\nWhen we entered the lobby, we were immediately impressed by the cool vibe. The variety of materials, d\u00e9cor items, and seating areas is a feast for the senses, with lots of live plants and a great scent. It has a cozy and inviting atmosphere that communicates the environmental focus quite well. The lobby isn\u2019t huge, but it\u2019s a good enough size to have space to relax, and there were usually always staff members around to say hi. The lobby also features a \u201cfarmstand\u201d of fruit that is always available. We really loved this feature at the 1 South Beach, because it was basically a buffet of interesting fruits. We were a little disappointed that it basically just featured generic apples and pears at the Central Park location. It\u2019s nice they offer this, but it wasn\u2019t anything interesting.\n\nAt check-in, the front desk staff member was extremely nice and personable, and he informed us that our room was ready early. Especially since we had our dog with us, it was great to be able to settle in immediately. Another friendly staff member helped us up to our room on the 15th floor (1514), and he said he would make sure that the hotel\u2019s dog amenities were brought right up, which were delivered less than five minutes later.\n\nRoom:\n\nAlthough it was a pricey upgrade, I booked a Central Park View room, since I wanted to make sure we were able to have the best experience possible. I also elected to add an extra $19 upgrade to ensure that we\u2019d have room on one of the highest floors. Even though the room ended up being quite expensive (close to $700 per night with all the upgrades), it really did not disappoint. We were lucky enough to have a corner room, so we had windows on two sides, which really contributed to making the room feel like it was a good size with lots of natural light. \n\nThe view of Central Park was the highlight of the room, especially with the large built-in window seat positioned perfectly to take it all in. The hotel is one block back from Central Park, and it\u2019s not the tallest building, so none of the rooms have a panoramic view over the park like you might be able to the get when staying somewhere right on the edge of the park, like the Ritz-Carlton. However, the view still is quite great. The Central Park view looks down 6th Avenue to the park and is an interesting and impressive view, looking at both the trees in the park and the buildings surrounding it.\n\nThe room itself was not a bad size at all for being in a city, and the d\u00e9cor was great. The use of reclaimed wood and plant materials is carried out so well from the lobby, through the hallways, and right into the rooms. The room had a fun mix of materials, ranging from wood floors, to different reclaimed wood on the ceiling, live plants, and even an iron support beam coming right through the room by the entrance. The fabrics are varied and interesting, and the comfortable and large window seat was an awesome spot to sit. The whole d\u00e9cor of the room was sort of eclectic, but in the most perfectly curated way that is carefully thought out, upscale, and comfortable. It\u2019s not your traditional upscale hotel, but it\u2019s refreshing that it\u2019s different. \n\nThe bathroom is the one portion of the room that could probably be designed better, but I think they were intentionally going for form over function in the design process. As others have mentioned, the bathroom is very open to the rest of the room, and it\u2019s kind of unnecessary for it to be like that. There is a sliding door on the sink\/toilet side of the room, but the shower itself is completely glass. There is really only any potential privacy by pulling a sheer curtain across the shower, but that doesn\u2019t really do much. We were fine with the bathroom setup, especially just for one night, but I can see the open concept bathroom wearing thin during a longer stay or if staying with people you\u2019re not that close with.\n\nThe bathroom itself was quite nicely appointed and made good use of the small space, with plenty of counter space and a large shower. The marble shower with a rainforest showerhead was really nice and included the 1\u2019s nice smelling natural bath products in full-size bottles. \n\nWe were totally ready for all of the eco-friendly touches from staying at the 1 South Beach in the past. The eco-friendly touches are present without being annoying, and aren\u2019t really even noticeable if you\u2019re not looking for them. The comfortable bed is appointed with an organic mattress and sheets. The rooms don\u2019t offer water bottles, and instead have water glasses with a note reminding you that New York City tap water is filtered and fine to drink. The shower includes a five-minute timer you can use to help conserve water. It\u2019s all little stuff, but creates a unique theme.\n\nEverything about our room was really nice and very comfortable. We were just sad we were only there for one night and couldn't enjoy it for longer.\n\nPets:\n\nWe don't travel with our dog all that frequently, but we were excited to bring her here since the hotel advertises itself as being dog friendly and doesn\u2019t charge a fee for pets. The staff in the lobby always went out of their way to say hi and give our dog attention, and the dog amenities in the room were great. We were surprised when a staff member came to the room with a full BarkBox of treats and toys for her, along with a huge dog bed and water and food bowls. Everything we could need was provided, and we particularly loved getting to take home multiple nice toys and treats that came in the BarkBox. We didn't see any other pets while we were there, but we absolutely recommend bringing pets to this hotel. The location was also so convenient for taking our dog to Central Park for walks and going to the bathroom, since finding green space for a dog can be challenging in some areas of the city.\n\nOther Amenities:\n\nSince we weren\u2019t at the hotel for long, we didn\u2019t get visit many of the hotel facilities, such as the gym. There are also additional common areas on the 2nd floor, which we heard were nice but never saw. We also didn\u2019t have a chance to try the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Jams, which is off of the lobby. It looked very pleasant and nice, in keeping with the hotel\u2019s theme.\n\nLocation:\n\nThe location of the 1 Central Park is another of its great strengths. You\u2019re only a block from Central Park South, and easily accessible to many popular spots in Midtown. We were easily able to walk to a show in the Theatre District at night, and we were so thankful to leave the craziness of Times Square when returning to the hotel. You\u2019re also just a block away from the Plaza Hotel and the beginning of the posh shopping of Fifth Avenue. Anywhere else in the city is also easily accessible by subway, so it\u2019s an ideal jumping off point. \n\t\nOverall:\n\nDespite only being there for one night, we had an excellent time at the 1 Central Park and would be happy to return in the future. We had no complaints whatsoever. The eco-chic theme and d\u00e9cor are well done, and the place just has a friendly vibe that is refreshing for a five-star hotel. The staff seems happy to be there and happy to interact with guests. We had a good experience at the 1 South Beach, an even better experience at the 1 Central Park on this trip. We cannot wait to try other 1 Hotels in the future, including the 1 Brooklyn Bridge and the others that are in development.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}
