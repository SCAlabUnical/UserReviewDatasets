Good luck to anyone who considers staying here and I\u2019ve stayed in shared BnBs with one bathroom. \nI checked into the Ramada by Wyndham around 8pm EST. As soon as I entered my room, the second guest I was with walked in to use the restroom and closed the door behind her then preceded to be locked in there for 45min due to a faulty mechanism. \nI immediately called Rut the manager on duty at the front desk who came up within minutes to assist but clearly was out of his depth as he assumed the lock was jammed but in actuality the entire door handle had been broken prior to our arrival. As a guest I had to Google how to dismantle a door handle because the panel where you can get under the lock was located INSIDE the restroom. Instead of calling the fire department, Rut called his elders who in turn blamed the issue on us; the guests! Thankfully for the night manager as he was apologetic and changed our room immediately. The next morning when I went to speak to the manager on duty I was met with disdain and told I have to call back after 1 to speak with the supervisor, Sam Kuppuswamy. I was unable to call because I was in a conference so sent an email to inquire about a discount or rebate regarding the issue. When able I returned to the hotel and spoke with Sam who was offended by the email I wrote asking for a discount and thought it rude that I said I would review his establishment based on my experience with the company\u2019s resolution. After feeling berated and realizing I was being talked down to, probably because I\u2019m a woman of color; the guest I was with stepped in and finally Sam relented and gave a 20% discount and only then offered an apology.

My main complaint then was that the rooms had a strong stuffy odor. I learned before booking with this hotel again that Ramada had eradicated the odor issue by pulling up the old carpets and replacing them with vinyl tile. Though the odor problem was gone during my recent stay, there were a few things that will keep me from coming back a third time.\n\nMy room looked old but clean, and I was happy to have a fridge and a safe to keep a few things. I loved being within walking distance of Times Square. On the negative side, the toilet in the room didn't flush well and the AC unit was so loud that I had to turn it off so I wouldn't hear it. The free breakfast every morning was one of the worst offerings I've had from any hotel. The selection was very limited and no warming element was used to keep hot foods from getting cold and sitting at an unsafe temperature. Comfort Inn offered a better breakfast here years ago.\n\nAnother negative that has less to do with the hotel and more to do with the city: During the day, there were people who appeared to be vagrants hanging around near the property. It's not uncommon to see that in NYC, but what was new to me was the yelling, fighting and partying I heard every night after midnight on 44th street in front of the hotel. I don't know if the people involved were the same ones I saw hanging out during the day, but the yelling had gotten so bad one night that the police came out with sirens on. It was never a quiet night having a room with windows facing 44th.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

First and foremost, the people at the hotel are absolutely unfriendly and loathsome. My phone got stolen on the way to the hotel. Luckily I knew the address, but when I got to the hotel they wouldn't give me the room because the reservation was under my uncle's name (perfectly understandable) but they also simply would not allow me to use their computer\/phone for 5 minutes to try to call or communicate with my uncle. While paying more than $100 to stay at that place, they made me go outside to times square like a beggar to ask someone to let me use their phone to try to communicate with my family members, who were waiting for me and would probably be worried that I wasn't there. Not only is that terrible hotel service but, honestly, just being unfriendly people. They were so rude and entitled. As if that weren't all, THERE ARE COCKROACHES IN THE ROOMS. Ok, I get it, it's Times Square and it's dirty, but hire a fumigation company, it's not that hard and it's very effective. I had to go to the front desk at 12 pm bc I saw maybe 3 roaches in my room. The guy came with this stupid little spray can and sprayed that corner a bit. I asked if I could keep the can in my room and he said no.

After lugging our cases a couple of blocks we arrived very early and knew our room wouldn\u2019t be ready but asked if we could leave our bags which was no problem.

The free breakfast the next morning in the reception area was really good with plenty of choice, perfect start to the day. This was our last day in New York and we left our luggage and did some last minute shopping etc. We returned about 3.00pm as we were being collected just after 4.00. We had bought a sandwich and had it with a cup of coffee when a member of staff asked for our tickets to get our Cases which were in a room just off the reception, he left them beside us and near a desk with a lap top and printer on it.

DO NOT LEAVE VALUABLES IN ROOM AND DO NOT CHECK LUGGAGE WITH THEM!!!!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-11-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"I am a long time Choice Hotels customer and thought we could expect the same safety and care for our belongings as I always could else where.   Boy were we wrong!!!\n\nThe price was cheap, so I was OK with the small but comfortable rooms.  And the breakfast is great each morning and front desk and breakfast server where friendly.  But it was appalling after we checked in to have to walk over dirty sheets and towels just thrown on the hallway floors (not in a cart) to get to our room.  Then at night, the maid cart was left right outside our room with a dirty sheet over it instead of being put out of site or in the hotel supply room in the basement.  This was the entire time we were there, not just a one time excuse.  We felt like we were staying in a supply closet.  \n\nI wouldn't even mention that if it hadn't been for what happened on our last day.\n\nAt breakfast, my sister had her wallet with her.   We went up together to our room and she had it in her hand.  She set it on the bed to finish package.  Our flight wasn't until later that night, so we were checking out to leave our luggage with them while we finished doing some sightseeing.  We know she either accidentally left it in the room or packed it in her luggage because after checking out and giving them our luggage to secure, we went directly into the waiting Lyft car.   Shortly after that we noticed she left her wallet behind.   But when we got back to the hotel, it wasn't in her luggage, and the hotel cleaning folks claimed it wasn't in the room either.   Upon waiting to get our luggage out of the \"secure' location, I witnessed first hand how not secure it was.   Right before I gave our claim tickets, I watched them bring another hotel guest back to the room where everyone's luggage was and watched as they let him go through luggage that wasn't his.   I confirmed with Choice Hotel Corporate they they should not be letting other guests back into the secure luggage area.  \n\nSo that pretty much confirmed for me that if a hotel worker didn't steal her wallet from the room or luggage, the hotel staff made it way too accessible for someone else to take it.    The only 2 places it could have been was in the room or in her luggage.  Both which should only have been accessible by hotel staff at this point.\n\nWe asked to speak to the hotel manager and review camera security tapes.  However, were told there was no manager on duty at 3pm in the afternoon.   So, I left my contact information as asked that the manager call me to discuss.  That was 5 days ago, and the manager of that hotel has yet to contact me.\n\nThe good news is that some wonderful women happened to be in Harlem and found her wallet the next day.   We were never in Harlem!!!   So, I would be curious to find out if any of the hotel staff is from Harlem.  \n\nThe other security issue is that that the printer with the so-called Business center is broken.   We were told by TSA to print off statements and info that would help verify my sister to get back on our flight home.   Apparently, the printer has been broken for some time, so the hotel staff told my sister she could log in and print from the front desk computer.  Originally, they wanted her to give them all her log in info so they could locate and print it for her.  Talk about violating Cybersecurity laws!   Fortunately, they let her log in herself and print.   Although my sister is trustworthy, it makes you wonder who else they let log in and if they keep an eye on them to make sure they're not accessing all the guest's information.   Again, according to Choice Hotel's Corp Headquarters, they should have had that business printer fixed, or at least set up to print to the front desk computer.   Not allow customers behind the front desk.\n\nChoice Hotel's headquarters is currently investigating, and I appreciate at that.  I would definitely stay at other Choice Hotels still.   But learning that this is an independently owned\/run location, who has yet to reach out to me, I do not recommend anyone stay here.   Too much risk for theft and exposure to identity theft at this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

It has waffles, eggs (scrambled and boiled), bacon, a selection of bread and pastries, donuts, yogurts, cereals, coffee, milk, juice. Cofee and te are available all day. The area is small (about 10 tables) so it can become crowded around 8 am. But I've never had to wait for a table. Space can also be used to dine in so you can bring food (there are some food stores close to the hotel). You can use the microwave, cutlery, water so this is a great dining option. You also have a fridge in the room so you can bring your cold beverages. They cared about my luggage before check-in, and after check out. I saw some bad comments from the previous guests, but then I realized most of them were from people that were accommodated in the basement. So they should have paid very little for that.

We are top tier Bonvoy so my expectations are high. I had to adjust them.  Early check-in was guaranteed, but I arrived before my husband. They were not going to allow me to check-in (with that ingratiating gee so sorry attitude), but just as I reached my husband via mobile the staff member asked if I had any ID with the same address as my husband. A room was then made available immediately. I was in 2206 which is a king room and has plenty of space for 2. However, there is one lonely USB port and it didn\u2019t work. Nor did any of the outlets in the strip. Bring your wall chargers. I did report the problem and exactly nothing was done.  \n\nThe bathroom has a nice size shower with a hand held spray. This hotel does not have the large dispensers of product in the shower and 1 bar of soap, 1 little bottle of shampoo and 1 of conditioner were in the room. No body lotion, no shower cap, no shower gel were in the room. I did not ask housekeeping for more, I just went to Walgreens and bought my own.  Wi-fi was free, always worked and the speed was acceptable. \n\nThe bed was comfortable and the pillows were full size.  We did not utilize housekeeping services. There was a refrigerator and the noise it emitted made me think we were in the middle of a windstorm. Turning it to the lowest setting kept water cold and eliminated the noise. Do you have a maintenance department at this hotel?\n\nThe foyer of this hotel is welcoming and there is a microwave. Is it cleaned after every use? I didn\u2019t use it, I don\u2019t know. This Courtyard has a large lounge\/eating area and breakfast, light dinners and drinks are available. It is not open all day. The best Starbucks coffee is made at Courtyard Hotels. This hotel is steps from Whole Foods, Starbucks, Walgreens and numerous restaurants. You won\u2019t go hungry. \n\nThe elevators are key card controlled. Swipe your room card where indicated. I appreciate this security feature. \n\nThe fitness center is in the basement which creeps me out as it is lightly traveled. All of the equipment is turned away from the door so you can\u2019t see who might be coming in. There are towels, disinfectant wipes and water. All of the equipment is ancient, but seemed to be in working order. There are free weights and a couple of floor mats. How about a TV channel guide? And maybe turning the AC on?\n\nI chose this Courtyard for location. I had citi pass tickets to the Friday AM concert on Rockefeller Plaza and even with tickets you need to be there before 5 AM. I walked the distance in just a few minutes. It is close to the theater district and an easy walk to Penn Station, Hudson Yards and the High Line as well as Flat Iron, Chelsea and Central Park. I much prefer to walk NYC when possible and it\u2019s often faster than taking a cab or Uber.  I am not a fan of the subway. \n\nI think I am done with Courtyard in NYC except for the 37th and 7th location. The staff is usually friendly. The accommodations are looking weary. \n\n","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

I cuscini sarebbero tutti da rinnovare, li ho trovati scomodissimi e non all'altezza di un hotel. La stanza \u00e8 piccola, problema ricorrente a NY, noi avevamo i trolley e tutto sommato ci siamo arrangiati, con le valigie grandi sarebbe stato un problema anche perch\u00e8 non ci sono piani d'appoggio ma solo un piccolo armadio poco capiente.

It is located just a few minutes walk from all the theaters, but far enough from Times Sq to be a little quieter.  The rooms are very small, but fairly clean with pleasant decor.  The room rate includes a breakfast bar which is quite high quality.  You can make waffles, there are scrambled eggs and sausages or bacon, and then the usual bread, yogurt, cereal, hard boiled eggs, and fresh fruit are also on offer.  There are surprisingly good croissants and danishes which appear to be from a bakery.  Although the guest rooms only have a fridge, there is a microwave in the breakfast area that you can use at any time ( plus paper plates and plastic cutlery).\n\nCheap (for NYC) parking directly across from the hotel.  Remember to have the hotel validate your ticket.\n\nOf course the hotel is not perfect and the following are some of the downsides.  The public areas - especially the elevators - are pretty dirty.  The front desk staff are a bit dithery- I requested a courtyard room and got a street room.  I was too tired to ask for a different room, but note that there is NO soundproofing and the street noise can be loud.  Also, the desk clerk will pretty much ignore you if you try to check in early, but there is a nice fellow who will store your bags.\n\nThe rooms are extremely hot and the heating system cycles on and off (loudly) constantly - earplugs are useful.  We turned the heat down to 60F (the lowest it would go), but the room was still quite warm.  The bed was comfortable with clean linen and an ample supply of pillows.  The bathroom fixtures were also clean.  However walls and doors were dirty and the edges of the carpet needed a good vacuum (it looks like they just use upright vacuums).  You might want to wipe down your room when you arrive.\n\nDespite these minor problems, I highly recommend this hotel, especially if you can get a room for under $100 per night.  Excellent value!

I wasn't bothered by the small size or dinged up furniture.  I was bothered by the pilled sheets, dirty smelling pillows and hair all over the bathroom.  The toilet seat was so gross I grabbed a washcloth and scrubbed it down before using.  Visibly dirty, with hair and some kind of sticky paste on it.  The in room heater must be broken, because it decided to always be on regardless of how low the temp was set.  I finally got up at 3am and turned it off completely.

The bathroom is also dreadful, I can hardly fit inside of it and the toilet paper is that thin I can see through it. I had extreme discomfort sleeping in this tetorous building!! The fridge is in a dreadful place and gets in the way of accessing parts of this awful room. The view is also dreadful I tried cutting it out but like I said earlier the curtains do not shut. In addition to this the heating doesn\u2019t work and many drafts were coming into this small but cold room. Around this \u201chotel\u201d there was a strong smell of cannabis, this is appalling.

The room is very small (expectable for the price) with old and cheap furniture and old and cheap carpets. Bed is queen size, pillows standard. It is not so very clean. The walls are very thin, so you can hear everything from the surrounding rooms. It has a very large TV set and a very small wardrobe with an iron and iron table. It has a large mirror. I was given a room for disabled persons (I had not asked for it) , so the bathroom was quite particular and made you feel at a nursing home. However, However, I do not believe a person in a wheel-chair can really move in a room with so few space. The basin is minimal, you do not have any space where to place your stuff, at the shower (plastic and quite weak) you do not have anywhere to place your soap or shampoo. It does not have an augmentation mirror and the amenities are few and cheap. Breakfast room is small for the amount of people and can be full when you arrive. Breakfast ends earlier than in most of the hotels (9.30), it is the typical breakfast of small American hotels, not bad but nothing fancy. The lift is old and noisy. The staff is polite, but they do not do the smallest effort to solve any problem. A couple of warnings: if you want a shuttle you have to ask for it 24 hs in advance (something they do not consider important to warn you when you ask at your arrival, so.....be ready to pay 85 USD for a taxi). They will tell you that you need 1 hour by taxi to JFK, do not believe them, you need 2 hours. And finally, if you plan to send any purchases to the hotel.....they reject all of them even if you had sent a warning mail telling some parcels will arrive....and do not consider necessary to tell you by mail that they do not receive them. They simply do not answer your mails. In summary, if you are a fan of Times Square and plan to have breakfast early, be out all the day and only get some sleep at the hotel, you could be there.

That is the reason we picked this Comfort Inn.  Upside is its price.  We stayed for 5 days and the average room rate for Sunday through Thursday was about half what the Intercontinental (at 8th and 44th) charged.  Downside is the size of the room which, I calculate was about two-thirds the size of a room at the Hilton around the corner.  If we had been taking kids to New York we would not have stayed here.  The room is obviously sized for a business traveler on a budget.  Upside:  the room was clean, the king-size bed was comfortable and the pillows were just what we needed after a day of walking the city.  The bathroom was also about two-thirds the size of the Hilton's rooms (we checked but at over $400 a night we decided to save our money for other things) but it was clean and the shower was very good.  As with many, if not most, Comfort Inns, there is a free breakfast included which was good ... not great mind you ... but if you like waffles, this is a quite tasty extra.  The coffee is freshly made and even the eggs were OK.  Many of the people who stayed there told me the room and bathroom is what you would expect to find in a moderate priced hotel in Europe.  My wife and I will stay there again.  It is conveniently located and does what we wanted:  a safe, environment that provided comfort for weary souls who came to New York to see the city and then get a good night's sleep before doing it all over the next day.  As for dry cleaning ... the hotel doesn't offer it but there is a dry cleaners next door.  TIP:  walk to 8th avenue to get your Uber or Lyft.

The only complaint I would have is despite the fact that there was a big flat screen TV on the wall, the channels were not HD and there were not many to choose from.

Although there were other hotels that were just a little more in cost, they also charged a $21-$33 daily \"resort fee\" (none at Comfort Inn) and if you wanted a refrigerator, another $35 for your stay (refrigerator in our Comfort Inn room at no extra cost). Free wi-fi. Free USA Today newspaper in the lobby. Another very big plus for Comfort Inn: free breakfast! And it was an excellent breakfast of waffles, eggs, alternating bacon or sausage, croissants, danish, toast, bananas, oranges, apples, three types of juice, yogurt, cereal boxes (not generic bulk cereal) and more. The breakfast attendant was amazing in keeping the breakfast stocked and the breakfast room tidy. Breakfast was always busy, but we found a table every morning.\n\n    The location was terrific. We were there to see plays and could walk to all the theatres. Just a few blocks to Times Square and the TKTS booth. Lots of good restaurants in the area (didn't get to try them all in six days). Subway entrance a half block from the hotel and the port authority two blocks away. The hotel is in the middle of a \"side\" street, so it was a lot less busy.\n\n    You expect NYC hotels to be small. Our room had a king bed and was roomy enough (our last vacation was a cruise, so we can handle cozy). During my research, I saw photos of very small, tight rooms, and this was so much better, especially for six days. The room configurations are not all alike (from floor plan and peaking in while housekeeping was at work). Our bathroom was too small to easily open and close the door and to stand in front of the sink (toilet too close), but other bathrooms are configured differently. Housekeeping did a great job every day.\n\n    There is only one elevator for 7 floors and probably 10 rooms on floors 2-7. Build in some wait time during the busy morning.\n\n    Front desk: some were more friendly than others. We had a few favorites. They answered questions, were helpful and provided quick resolution (light out in hallway by our door).\n\n    To be improved: The lobby area could use an interior decorator and maybe some remodeling. Since the rooms are small and there was only the desk chair to sit, it would have been nice to have a comfortable lobby area. There is an old sofa and a couple chairs, but not inviting. There is a computer and printer available. And the breakfast area tables and chairs.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Add to that the fact that reasonable pricing is not often synonymous with quality accommodations in NYC.  Thankfully, I was open-minded when reserving a room here.\nThe location was very good. West 44th is one of the quieter cross streets in Manhattan.  The hotel exterior is kind of average, but the interior was bright, clean and attractive - kind of reminding us of a hotel where we stayed in Oslo, Norway.\nThe desk staff was friendly, helpful and efficient.  The rest of the interior was clean, though it had an oddly haphazard layout.  When we got to our room we discovered the probably reason for the hall layout.  This appears to have been a hotel with larger rooms that have now become more utilitarian in size (e.g. Minimal space to squeeze between the bed and the wall-mounted TV).  It was exactly what we needed, with little wasted space.  The room was clean and secure, with almost everything in good repair (Their were a couple of tiles loose in the shower, but it didn't impact our stay).\nThe Lobby breakfast area was pleasant and clean.  My only comment\/criticism there would be that the bar stools were a bad choice.  They were cheap and, as a result, upholstery was giving out and the stools scraped noisily on the floor.\nThe breakfast was good and a step above minimal.  I looked, and it would be hard to beat this place for location and price.  There may be better\/nicer hotels in the area but, for a 1-2 night stay in the city, you would probably be paying for stuff you don't need anyway.\nGenerally, the worst thing I saw was the elevator, which was slow and bounced like a thrill ride.

We arrived and were given a key to our room with a king bed.  It was in the basement, and small, and I'm claustrophobic.  They told me there were no rooms available on upper floors with a king bed, and I would have to pay more for a room with two doubles.  I showed the reservation, where it did not say that the room was in the basement (!), and the man said to call the website.  Their website.  How do I call a website?  So the (more reasonable) woman that was also present agreed to call the manager and handle the problem.  We waited a half an hour.  A precious half an hour between shows when we could have been sleeping or showing for us to say that it is listed on the website. I was so upset that after a half an hour they just wanted to prove me wrong, that I didn't look.  But since then I have looked (please look!) and I can not find that rooms with king beds are in a basement!!  I have clicked through a full reservation and can not find it.  I paid the extra for the room.  It was not 5 p.m., and they had the rooms, and had us wait for a half an hour. I can't believe they wouldn't have said, \"We'll offer you a one time upgrade because of the misunderstanding.\"  Especially as it was not listed on my reservation on my phone!!!!  \n\nI looked at the room before taking the two double beds, and it was lovely and the house keeper who showed it to me was also lovely.\n\nAnd lastly, and hand to god this is true, we found a live Tick on a towel this morning.  I don't know how this is possible in a city, but we did.  We would have brought it down and showed the desk staff, but I am certain they would have taken a lot of time and not done anything to help us.  \n\nOkay, now really lastly, I can not believe the man they had helping us is customer facing.

We're extensively traveled.  We enjoy the fancy hotels, but we're realistic and know what a simple good value is.  Luxury isnt always about bling, sometimes its about convenience and what works well.\n\nIf we had been just visiting NYC with no particular purpose we probably wouldn't have looked twice at this Comfort Inn, especially with the mixed reviews.  But this time we were in the city to move our daughter into an appointment in the neighborhood nearby.  So this was convenient base camp for a week to get that done.\n\nThe surprise was how perfectly nice the hotel and service was for our whole stay.  \n\nWe got the \"dreaded\" first floor room,  #108.  It turned out to be perfect for us as I was walking back and forth between my daughter's appartment.  What a hassle it would have been to wait for the elevator each time. Yes we could hear commotion in the lobby at times, but no big deal.  BTW, first floor always has the best water pressure.  It was also very convenient to getting breakfast and bringing it back to the room.  I joked with my wife to dare me to walk out into the breakfast area in my pajamas and slippers to get coffee like it was our kitchen at home!  That would have got some wierd looks!\n\nThe room was on the smaller side, but definitely not unworkable.   Everything was clean.  The linens smelled fresh.  The room had a surprisingly big TV although the number of channels and picture quality was a little let down.\n\nI see people remarking that breakfast was awful or something.   Id say it was actually rather above par for this level hotel.  Good selection of both hot and cold items.  The coffee was way better than I would expect and available 24 hours.\n\nComing into the city I was fretting over where I was going to park my van to unload all my daughter's stuff for her appartment.   My daughter is a model and fashion student so she doesn't travel light.  To my surprise there is a huge loading zone that extends down the street and in front of the hotel.  It was empty and perfect.   Then there is a freshly remodeled Edison parking lot right across the street.   Im crazy about my cars, like obsessive compulsive, so I freak out about NYC parking.  Edison is always great and never a mark.\n\nSo will we stay at Comfort Inn Times Square West again.  You bet. I will specifically ask for room 108 right off the lobby.  And we'll stay for a week at less than half the cost of any other reputable hotel in mid-town.  I'll spend what I save on all the great restaurants in the Hell's Kithchen neighborhood and buy lots of trendy cloths for my wife and kids!\n\nI completely reject most of the negative reviews I read.  I dont know who those people are, where they come from, or what they were expecting.  But if you can deal well with anything between the Intercontinental and a Fairfield Inn then you will be pleased with your stay at this Comfort Inn. ","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

In the other direction is an avenue with more dining options than you can sample in a week.\nBottom line is that our week-long stay was a pleasure.

The elevator can be a tad slow too.\nBut the room was clean, the bed so comfortable, the sheets felt amazing and each side of our king-sized bed had not just one, but two reading lights, one focused for when you want to read later than your partner and the other just normal. We had a room on the sixth floor which is a bit more expensive but probably well worth it, even though we did not check out any other rooms. \nThe breakfast too was impressive: even a waffle maker and scrambled eggs, bacon one day and sausages the next, fresh fruit, orange juice and everything else one would expect. This hotel was several hundred dollars cheaper than a more high priced hotel we usually stay at. In addition, they offer points if you become part of the hotel chain program. The staff, especially Anil, as well as Sunita and Karina, were beyond helpful calm and welcoming. They also gave us good advice on landmarks and airport transportation and were quick to attend to any unusual needs, such as wanting our room made up right away. Not only was this done, but they gave us a change of sheets too--all so quickly and professionallyl. Best, I guess, I liked the value for the price.

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":1485603,"title":"Good price, perfect location, decent hotel.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2016-08-20","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Stayed here for the first time recently and it was a good hotel for the price in a great location.  First my normal disclaimer for those who aren\u2019t used to staying in Manhattan.  Hotel rooms everywhere in NYC are small. If you've not stayed in a big city before, this is something you're going to have to accept. Space is at a premium everywhere and that includes hotel rooms, so don't expect tons of space to sprawl out, a huge bathroom, or much closet space \u2013 unless you\u2019re willing to break the bank, they don\u2019t exist!\n\nLocation was great for doing a lot in Midtown\/theatre district.  It\u2019s on 44th between 8th and 9th \u2013 really close to a lot of things (and a subway stop at the end of the block) while being on a block that\u2019s normally slightly less crowded than others.  I say normally because when we were there, we found out that Biden was staying down the block from us and the street was full of various cop cars, ambulance, and official vehicles.  It was interesting to see all this, but I digress, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s generally a really good location. \nThe room was fine \u2013 we had a room with two double beds.  We had a small fridge, coffee maker, and a desk.  There was a tiny armoire to put a few clothes in, it also had a safe and iron.  The bathroom was nice, looked recently updated.  We had a couple problems with the bathroom \u2013 the showerhead really didn\u2019t work well and the hairdryer was dead.  Thankfully, when we reported these, each were replaced very quickly and without question. Our room faced 44th which was normally fine, except one night when I was awoken with horns and sirens (assuming it was something to do with the VP\u2019s visit \u2013 see above). We were a few floors up from street level, but I will point out that there are some rooms right off the lobby next to the elevator as well as some that seemed like they were garden-level.  I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t stay in one of those rooms, as I imagine they could get noisy.  The elevator was a bit slow and wobbly, we ended up just taking the stairs most of the time. \n\nThe lobby was compact, but tidy.  My main issue with it was the smell.  It was a very strong smell of what seemed like some kind of industrial cleaner.  I\u2019m glad they kept it clean, but the smell was a bit too much for me.  When we were there it was very hot outside, so I wonder when it\u2019s nicer if the door can be opened and let the smell out.  Breakfast was included daily and served in the lobby.  It was mediocre, but it was \u2018free\u2019 so I\u2019m not complaining much.  Two types of make your own waffles, some breakfast meat that changed daily (microwave bacon, sausages, etc.), eggs, breads, sweets, yogurt, and more\u2026 In the afternoon, the lobby also had fruit-infused water and cookies which were a nice touch.  \n\nEveryone we interacted with that worked there was very nice.  They were friendly and willing to help.  One remembered that mentioned we were going to a show and when we returned she asked us how it was.  If you drove in, you can self-park across the street.  The hotel will give you a sticker so you only pay $30 per day.  Note that there are no in and out privileges and if you\u2019re a few hours over you may be charged an extra day\u2019s rate (both of which are common at most garages in town). Overall, it was a good hotel in a perfect location if you\u2019re seeing shows or doing other touristy things midtown\/Times Square.  Given the location, it\u2019s a good hotel for the price point and I\u2019d consider staying here again.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We asked them nicely if they could just leave everything as it was so we could collapse in our room but they refused to leave. One of them was also using our phone charger, which was fine but a little odd. We had to call the front desk so they could ask the cleaners to leave. \n\nHowever that was one small blip in an otherwise perfect stay. The breakfast was good - very American, waffles, eggs, doughnuts etc. The staff were very helpful and they let you leave your bags there if you have time between arriving and checking in. \n\nThere is a car park across the road too.

The price was indeed very good for the great location, and there were some other good points as well.  We found the room clean and tidy, and all the equipment (including Wi Fi) worked well.  Plenty of towels.  But there were significant drawbacks too.  Prime among them was the truncated, stingy lineup of channels on the cable.  No HGTV (no House Hunters), no MSNBC (no Morning Joe), no Food Network (no Chopped), no Comedy Central (no Daily Show).  Very frustrating.  Also, there was no dresser in the room because the dimension of the room did not provide enough space between the foot of the bed and the wall.  Consequently, there were no drawers to put dirty clothes in, forcing us to put the dirty clothes back in the suitcase.  There was a small desk but it was not usable because the mini-fridge was located under the desk where your legs should go.  Breakfast selection was quite good but the scrambled eggs were overly salted and many of the pastries were seriously stale.  Still, hotels with this good a location generally cost $100 more, so whether you'll be happy depends on whether the defects are worth saving $100\/night.  For me, because of the cable offering, it will never be more that a reluctant Plan B.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There was noticeable mildew in the cracks and the floor of the shower looked dirty and dingy, so much so that my daughter refused to take a shower when we were there. \n\nYou can hear very clearly what is happening in the hallway from your room, so that was annoying as we were situated near the elevator and I was woken up several times each evening and morning by people talking in the hall as they were waiting for the elevator.  Obviously the hotel can't control people's behavior in the hall, but just be aware that it can be noisy.\n\nAlso be aware that while the hotel is nice enough to hold your bags for you after you check out so you can continue to explore the city, they will only do this until 6 PM.

The 44th street Edison parking lot has deals for longer periods of time -check parkfast.com.\n\nThe hotel is right on 44th street, seven stories tall with about 9 rooms per story, except for the ground floor which only has about 5 rooms.  So it is a small hotel, run by some very courteous and helpful Asian Indians.  \n\nThe wife and I staggered in at 730pm with our luggage, having awaken at 4am to catch the shuttle to SFO.  The hostess smiled behind the counter and  offered us freshly baked complimentary chocolate chip cookies for us starving guests -we flew American Airlines which doesn't offer a real in flight meal, just snacks and sandwiches on the 6 hour flight.\n\nDidn't remember her name, but the hostess was extremely helpful in all aspects of our stay, even directing us to the nearest decent restaurant -right across the street -the entire area for blocks around is full of restaurants, with Times Square\/Broadway theater district only a 7 minute walk.\n\nWe got room 605, and got on the single rickety, slow elevator with torn up tiles on the elevator floor, for the ride to the 6th floor.  This was the only item which was subpar -everything was clean, modern and tidy looking.\n\nWhen we opened up our room, we got a king size bed with a large sliding window with a view directly in front of the hotel on 44th street -the window opens about 5\".  \n\nClean and relatively new carpet, and comfortable to walk on.  \n\nYou want to get a room as high as you can, if you are facing the front of the hotel, due to traffic noise -NYC drivers lean on the horn a lot, noise from night clubs nearby, and the neon lights in front of the hotel.     \n\nThe bedroom area was approximately 8' x 14', with a 2' area around the sides and end of the bed to walk around.  Small external wooden closet, desk, desk chair but no dresser, except for a single drawer at the bottom of the closet.   Dorm size Refrigerator, Electronic safe and 40\" flat screen cable TV on the wall in front of the bed.  Free Wifi, good enough to read e-mail, but too slow for videos.  Comfortable bed\/pillows, with black out curtains.  No noise from the neighbors.\n\nRoom is cozy, with no sitting chair, and little room to put one's luggage.  But by New York City standards, the room was adequate in size, especially for a budget hotel.  Quiet but powerful AC\/heater next to the window, although outside temperatures never reached 65 while we were there. \n\n Across the street is a series of single story businesses, with skyscrapers on the other side of the block, so there is some degree of privacy with the curtains open on the single sliding window.   \n\nBathroom is approximately 6' x 8', and includes a bathtub -didn't expect this!  Bathroom is so small that the open door barely misses the toilet.  Long bathroom granite sink, very clean, with vanity mirror the length of the bathroom.  Forget something -downstairs will give you a free toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, comb, etc.   \n\nRooms in the back of the hotel, including the first floor open up on a courtyard, and would be quieter, but without the view of the front facing rooms.   Avoid getting a room on the first floor due to noise from the lobby and breakfast area. \n\nFull complimentary buffet breakfast with scrambled eggs and sausage or bacon, along with oatmeal, waffles, pastries, yogurt, apples and oranges, along with fruit juices.  Very unusual for a New York hotel.  Microwave available at the breakfast area next to the lobby.\n\nAsian Indians stock the breakfast buffet, man the front desk, and do daily housekeeping -all in the family.\n\nSubway is a block away on 9th street, a very busy 4 lane, two way avenue, where we caught a taxi on our third day to stay at West 57th Street by Hilton Grand Vacations for 5 nights, double the cost of the comfort inn hotel  -the real reason we came to New York City.\n\n7am Saturday and 8am Sunday awakened by jack hammers working on water line across the street.

(The show was great!) We chose the Comfort Inn Times Square for is proximity to all things near Times Square, a room with 2 beds, the free breakfast, and most of all - the price!  The hotel was an excellent choice for all of those reasons. \n\nThe rooms are on the small side with 2 beds, but had everything you could ask for in this location for the price.  The hot and cold breakfast was great every morning, the bacon was even crisp! (which is hard to do in a warmer), they had many choices of cereals, danishes, coffee, teas, yogurt, toast, bagels, waffles, and more.  Yes, the eating area is small, but as with any hotel that serves a hot breakfast - you need to go early. However, I did see the staff working very hard up to 30 minutes past stop time to accommodate people that arrived late.  Other hotels I've stayed at would stop stocking the food 30 minutes early so they could close it down on time.  The staff was very attentive to the breakfast area and its customers. Food in this area is very expensive so this free breakfast easily saves you $15 per person each day! \n\nThey had coffee and tea in the lobby 24\/7.  The beds and pillows in our room were very comfortable, we slept great every night. Our room was on the 5th floor and faced 44th street and we were not disturbed by any noise.  I mean, it is downtown NYC, if you expect no street noise,  you are looking in the wrong city :).\n\nMost visitors to NYC aren't staying their rooms all day, so for a place to sleep and eat breakfast, the Comfort Inn is perfect.

Hotel staff were all very polite and helpful, breakfast was plentiful, and the location was good.  We had a double\/double room, which was pretty cramped and it was impossible to unpack b\/c there is just a small armoire w\/one small drawer.  Might have been easier to move around if not for the rolling chair that really wasn't needed since you couldn't sit at the desk thanks to the mini-fridge under the desk (mini fridge was great thing to have though, so no complaints there).  4 adults in a room would be really claustrophobic (we had 3), but for just needing a place to sleep, it was fine. Room was quite clean, beds were quite comfortable (to us) & linens very soft. Only complaint was the other guests who utterly lacked common courtesy, coming in super late & yelling\/slamming doors at all hours.  Walls are thin and doors don't block hallway noise (not uncommon in any hotel). Bring a white noise machine or use an app on your phone to help mask it somewhat.  Also, appreciated that the sidewalk was kept shoveled during the storm, but would have liked it if at least a small path could have been cleared from sidewalk to street so getting into cabs wasn't such an ordeal. Wifi was hit or miss and the TV had very limited channels that didn't match up to what was on the card in the room, but we found a news station so that was good enough for us.

The breakfast was decent. We were able to walk to Times Square from here and obviously the nearest subway station, so it was quite close to everything. The only negative was when we were trying to sleep one night and the heater was making this horrific noise. It sounded like a generator or a lawn mower was running. It must have been midnight or later. I could not stop laughing because this contraption was situated above my brother who was trying to sleep on the mattress on the floor. I imagine that it was like trying to sleep with this loud motor looming over your head. Eventually, my brother complained and they put us in a different room. If anything, it was a laugh. It is the Comfort Inn after all. In the end, my dad compensated himself for this flaw by stealing a couple muffins from the breakfast bar on our last morning.

The hotel is on 44th, just a five minute walk from Times Square and within the Theatre District, surrounded by many of the large Broadway shows. It is also in a great location for travel as it is less than two minutes from Port Authority making it very easy to get to from the Subway itself, and easy to get to from Newark Airport as Port Authority is the first stop from there ($17 one way). The hotel isn't 5*, but it is above average and will give a great base with a comfortable bed and helpful staff. The other thing which sets it apart from other hotels that I researched before booking was that breakfast was included - many New York hotels don't include this - and a first class breakfast it was too with bacon, egg, sausage, freshly cooked bread, cakes, cereals and my first ever helping of biscuits and sausage gravy! There was lots more on offer too. We had a great view of the Empire State Building from our window which was an added bonus. I would definitely recommend this for a short stopover in the city if like me, you are just using a hotel as a base and will be out exploring the city the rest of the time.","travelDate":"2015-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Young front desk staff working the afternoon shift when I checked in were very friendly.  \n\nThe negatives:  Attempted to print airline boarding pass on hotel lobby computer late in the evening but one computer was malfunctioning and the other wasn't hooked up\/wouldn't turn on.  I asked the two men who were then on duty at the front desk for help with the computers but they weren't able to get the one computer turned on.  Most hotels would have offered to print the boarding pass on their front desk computer when they saw that the lobby computers weren't working, but I had to ask them if they could do it.  They initially said they weren't able to do it, but a few minutes later they said I could use their computer and print it off myself.\n\nAfter successfully printing my boarding pass, I asked if I could leave a wake-up call for 7 a.m. and they said they would do that.  However, I was awakened by heavy machinery on the street outside our window at 7:45 that morning (despite requesting a quiet room) since they had failed to give us a wake-up call.  We had to hurry and get ready to leave for our flight (no time for a shower, etc.).  I asked the man at the front desk about the wake-up call and he checked his list and apologized since he said the two men who had been working when I made the request hadn't written down our wake-up call on their list.\n\nI had difficulties with the front desk staff at this hotel on a previous stay as well when I was watching a video interview on the lobby computer late one evening.  There was sound coming out of the computer speaker but it was so soft that I had to lean in towards the speaker to hear it.  Nevertheless, a front desk staffer came over and told me I needed to turn off the computer because \"the noise from the computer is going to wake up people who are staying in the rooms near the lobby.\"","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Our room looked like the hotel's pictures and came with the advertised amenities.  It was also quite comfortable.  We would come back for an hour or so from one area of the city and go to our room to get refreshed and relax, before continuing our explorations.\nThey don't have a fitness facility, but you can walk everyday, so there's your cardio.  Also, they do not have onsite parking, so if you're traveling by car be sure to find the lowest priced garage with in\/out privilege's.\nIt's very nice to be able to start your day with FREE breakfast before setting out for daily activities.\nStaff are friendly and obviously quite busy (in a positive sense).  You don't have to be concerned with not being taken care of.\nNow, a word about location.  The hotel is only a couple of blocks from Times Square, which can be and many times is, the mass of humanity you might think.  And, those couple of blocks are important because while centrally located to major sites, the hotel is down W44 St from 8th Ave away from the hustle and bustle of 7th & Broadway.  So, we enjoyed quiet nights for sleep to wake up refreshed in the morning.\nWe had easy walks to sites like Rockefeller Center, The Museum of Modern Art, Port Authority Bus Terminal and Metro, Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, and more. Although, we used our Metro Card to conveniently get to Central Park, The Natural History Museum, Battery Park, Brooklyn, etc. in minutes.\nThere's a reason so many travelers would recommend the Comfort Inn Times Square West, it's because of the value, service, accommodations and location.  Maybe that's all I needed to say, in the first place.\n","travelDate":"2015-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It ran over my toes if I didnt remember to back up. NYC rooms are small, but not this small.

Yes, the rooms\/bathrooms are very small (we were in room 201 with one King bed), but the space is used so efficiently that they pack a lot of amenities into the small space. \nThe lights by the bed are great...larger light for the room, and a very tiny reading lamp for not bothering the other person in the room late at night or early morning.  Each side of the bed has a table with a charging station right next to the bed.  Convenient for checking those e-mails comfortably.  There is a coffee maker, refrigerator, and safe.  The air conditioner looked relatively new and was very quiet. The bed was very, very comfortable and I slept like a baby both nights.  Plenty of pillows with varying firmness. There was no street noise, and our room faced 44th street. The bathroom is small, but has a decent size sink counter. There were cookies available at the front desk every day.\nThe location of Comfort Inn was terrific.  We walked all over the place from Grand Central Terminal to our theater to Madison Square Garden to Times Square.  \nThe breakfast was great, including waffles and either sausage or bacon and eggs. The breakfast seating is limited, but our group of 4 never waited more than a couple minutes for a table.  \nThe staff was all amazing.  I wish I knew the front desk clerk's name, but she checked us both in and out. She was very friendly.  We arrived at 1:30 and checked in immediately even though check in was at 3:00. \nThe wifi sign on was easy and remained strong for our entire visit.  It did not need to have  a log-on each time. \nWe found the elevator to be a little slow, but our room 201 was just a few steps above breakfast so we just took the stairs.  I appreciated the ability to not have to use the elevator.\nThere was an odd odor in our hallway.  It did not go into the room at all, and I am not sure what kind of smell it was.  The carpet looked to be fairly new, and I did not see any stains.\nOverall, I would return to this hotel in a heartbeat.

The hotel validates parking for this lot at the front desk, it's very convenient.\n\nAs for the hotel itself, the staff were excellent, especially Niti at the front desk.  We arrived late at night after driving 6 hours from Rochester and we were exhausted.  We asked if we could get an extra room for the kids.  She quickly gave us another room, on the same floor, no problem at all.  The next day, we needed directions to NYU and wondered if we should take a taxi or the subway.  Niti printed out very clear subway instructions, told us how to get to NYU, also gave us taxi instructions on timing and sent us on our way with a smile.  She did the same each day for each school we wanted to visit.  We had googled this information, but Niti made it clear, concise and easy to understand.  Every afternoon when we came back, she took the time to ask how we were and if we needed anything.  She always had a smile and a pleasant greeting.  Comfort Inn should be very proud that she is the face of their business.\n\nThe other staff were just as nice.  It's a very pleasant place to stay.\n\nPhysically, the hotel is an older building that has been recently renovated.  The rooms are tiny, there are about 20 inches of clearance from the foot of the bed to the wall.  The beds are doubles, not queens.  That being said, the decor is modern, very HGTV.  There are flat screen TVs and refrigerators in the rooms.  The bathrooms are tight, but have nice fixtures: marble, nice shower heads.  The water pressure is better on the lower floors, but still adequate elsewhere.  The air conditioner is loud, but it works well to cool the room.\n\nThe hotel offers a good free breakfast in the lobby: waffles, bread, pastries, bagels, eggs, sausage, coffee, juice, fruit, yogurt. There are tables, but it's a tight space, so they offer trays to take breakfast back to your room.\n\nThere's free wifi, a computer for guest use in the lobby and in the afternoons, the front desk has cookies!\n\nThe cons are few and not serious:  The elevator is slow and it bounces up and down as you ride it.  The rooms on the first floor and in the basement don't have any privacy.  Avoid them. The hotel rooms are very small, but for a room under $250 a night in Times Square, I'm not complaining.\n\nAll in all, this hotel is an excellent value for the price and location.  If you are visiting New York, especially on a budget, this is a great place to stay!","travelDate":"2015-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Had many options for all. From waffles, toast, bagels, bacon, scrambled eggs, yogurt, pastries, cereal, & coffee\/juice. \nParking was very convenient. We parked in a garage across the hotel. 24 hr rate is $30 for cars & $50 for SUVs\/minivans. \n\nThe only cons I felt were:\nI didn't put up my sleep card the previous night as I expected to get up early and head out by 10 am.

Wifi was slow but did work. Parking is not included but they have a reduced rate with the garage directly across from the hotel. We used their services and found them to be very accommodating and helpful.  You have to understand that you are downtown New York City. With that in mind, you should appreciate that the rooms are very small. That is certainly the case here, but it was also adequate.  The only gripe that we had was the fact the curtains will not close completely over the windows. There was a buffer layer, but you could not completely darken the room with heavier curtain layer.  As a result, the sunlight came in the room early in the morning.  Again, that is a very minor gripe.  Breakfast was the standard fair that you would expect this type of hotel to have - it certainly was adequate.The staff at the front desk was very helpful and willing to guide us around the area.  You are steps away from the subway, as well as Times Square.  Oh yea - our kids loved the free hot chocolate all day in the lobby, too.   :).

The beds were comfortable and the bedding was nice. And the location was really nice.  There were theaters down the street as well as a subway stop at the end of the block.  Really couldn't ask for a better location.  And the breakfast was nice.  Not great but given most hotels in the area offer nothing, this is awesome.  Now what I didn't like.  The room was small. Miniscule, Microscopic.  Our room had two double beds, one end table, a small desk, a small wardrobe and a small fridge.  There was so little floor space  I was constantly tripping over bags and shoes.  Because of the lamp, coffee maker and other stuff on the desk, there really wasn't room to use it as a desk.  And my biggest complaint is that the room was musty.  As soon as I walked in the room, my sinuses started filling up.  My allergies bothered me so much that I had to take medication before bed every night so I wouldn't wake up with a headache.  That said, my son didn't notice any smell and had no issues.  Also, there were stains on the carpeting both in our room and in the halls.  I think the place would be greatly improved if they just replaced all of the carpeting.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

As others have mentioned, the rooms are a little small (about the size of an average suburban bedroom), but the property is clean and well-maintained. The free breakfast has a good selection of food and beverages, and the round-the-clock availability of coffee, tea and hot chocolate is a nice touch.\n\nOne potential downside: If you have to get work done, the small size of the rooms make this a little harder. The desk in my room was cluttered with the lamp, coffee maker and charging station, with barely enough room for a laptop. And the small refrigerator sat under the desk, taking the room where your legs should go. I found it easier to use the bed as a desk. \n\nIf location is an important consideration, you should know the hotel is closer to 9th Ave than to 7th and Time Square. The \"Times Square West\" in its name perhaps suggests a closer proximity to Times Square than you get. It's still less than a 10-minute walk -- not too bad, but something you should know about going in. \n\nDespite that, however, it's a clean, comfortable room, and a pretty good value in the overpriced world of midtown Manhattan lodging. I might not want to spend a honeymoon there, but for a night or two, it's a good deal for a pretty good property.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room was small be adequate although it was a challenge working out where to put our suitcases.  We muddled through though.  The staff were very friendly, everything imaginable was provided in the room, including a safe, ironing board and iron in the tiny wardrobe, coffee making facilities on the desk, and plenty of disposable cups.  There was even a small fridge under the desk.  The bathroom was a good size and everything was provided in there.  it was a bit noisy though - the constant sirens don't help you sleep well (our room looked out on 44th Street) and when the guests in the next room open or close their door, it sounds as though they are in your room.\nOn the downside, we never got used to the lift - it did a lot of bouncing and adjusted itself every time one or two more people got in - not good for your appetite.  There are 10 rooms on each of the seven floors in this hotel, but only one slow lift, so sometimes you have to wait quite a long time for it to arrive. I would recommend asking for a room on a lower floor so you don't have to use the lift. and if you want a bit of quiet, ask if rooms away from 44th Ave are quieter.\nThe breakfast room was always crowded - again, it is probably too small for all the guests it is supposed to accommodate.  Every day we had to wait for a table to become free before we could help ourselves to breakfast.  The food selection was good though - eggs, bacon or sausages, toast, cereal, pastries, yoghurt, fruit juice, fruit,waffles - the owners have crammed as much as they possibly can into the selection.  if you have room to eat breakfast in your bedroom, it would be worth taking the tray from underneath the coffee machine, and put your breakfast on that to take up to your room.\nThere are plenty of places to eat and drink within a stone's throw of the hotel, and there is a laundry right next door - they will wash and fold your clothes for 90 cents per pound - drop it off in the morning and collect it after 5pm.\nThis hotel is so conveniently placed, and good value as well.  We will definitely stay here again, and will recommend it to others.","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The cleaners I seen were men, who did not speak much English, and I don't think they understood to come back in 20 mins. \n\nThe free breakfast they supplied were waffles, (both original and chocolate) boiled (hot or cold) eggs, sometimes scrambled or egg patties, microwaved bacon or sausages (alternate days) and bagels, pastries and mini muffins, cereal and yogurt. Coffee\/tea\/hot chocolate was a 24\/7 deal. \n\nThe real problem came when the night before we checked out, we asked for a taxi to be ordered for us for 9 am the next day. We were told by several front desk staff that the taxi is $60 for one trip to LGA and that included tolls, and tip. We were fine with that since it was $45 to come from the airport and its $15 per person to get the shuttle. However, once we arrived at the airport, the driver that the hotel ordered for us, tried to scam us out of an extra $8 (not much i know) for 'tolls' he decided to take to make the trip to the airport smoother.. Funny since it took us an extra 30 min to get to the airport than coming from. My husband got very irate over this driver trying to scam us for more money and the driver backed down and gave us back $10.  \n\nJust be aware of this, and maybe arrange your own transportation.  Would I stay here again? Probably not.","travelDate":"2015-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

You can check your lugagge there if you are early or staying in NYC after checkout.  There are restaurants in the area, including a diner around the corner, pub across the street, french place that looked good a half a block doen the street.\n\nWe had a room with two double beds and it was tiny.  I couldn't stay in this room for more than one or two nights, because even with minimal luggage there's just no place to put anything, let alone dress.  Bathroom is similarly small, with really not enough room to put the tioletries of two women, even though neither of us has tons of bottles.  Everytime you move you are in danger of knocking something in the tiolet!  \n\nIt does have a coffee maker, but I'm not sure how usuable it is, because you have to either walk across the bed or move luggage to get to it.\n\nFor people who like openable windows, they do open, which is a huge thing with me.  If you like to open the window you might want to get a room higher than 2, because our 2nd floor was right above the lobby roof.  Ventilation seems to work well and is not loud.\n\nOver all, a GREAT place for a short visit with no more than two adults.

The location is fantastic, especially if you want to access Broadway shows and Times Square within easy walking distance.  There is lots to do in this area.  \n       Our room had a queen-sized bed, and there was very little walking room around the bed, and we had to take turns accessing certain parts of the room as there wasn't room for two people to function easily in the same area at the same time.  The shower door wouldn't open and close properly, but the hotel sent up maintenance men immediately when I mentioned it.

Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and chocolate chip cookies are available for free all day and night. The staff were friendly and obliging.  A couple might want to get a room with two beds just for extra space.  Or, see if they have rooms with king-sized beds, and find out how much free floor space there is.  There is a wardrobe to hang up clothes, although the hanger rack is low that full-length clothes drag on the floor of the cupboard.  There is a small safe in the wardrobe as well.  There are bedside tables that can hold items, but no dresser.

The breakfast was better than average, with hot foods like eggs and bacon as well as toast, bagels, fruit, cereals, etc. Even though the hotel is small (welcome to the city!) there was plenty of room to sit and eat breakfast. The wifi worked like a charm!\nThe staff was very attentive to our needs and helpful. They allowed us to check out late and even held our luggage until it was time for us to catch our flight (even offered us cookies and coffee while we were waiting for them to retrieve the luggage). \nOne last point, the hotel was about 1\/2 the price of the hotel that was hosting the conference. It is a great value and I will be back. ","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Yes,  pretty quite dumb from my part,  truth be told I'm happy of my mistake. Though there are mostly good reviews on this hotel there's also bad comments and that quite scared me, my family is used to travel in good hotels but this time we were in an adjusted budget for our winter vacations in NYC. \nSo,  getting to the hotel.  Lobby is small,  you can't expect the Plaza size lobby for a Comfort Inn,  but it's practical. The people handling the main desk are friendly and make your stay a pleasant one. Next to the lobby is the tables for the breakfast buffet they offer each morning already included in your daily rate. This is a major plus for the value because you get a hot breakfast each day you save at least 7 dollars daily. From waffles to bagels,  with a different time of eggs,  yogurt, coffee,  juice,  tea and milk. It's a good breakfast you can have to begin your day. \nSon on that first floor there are a couple of rooms,  which I think is really practical,  no need of elevators or so. There's only one elevator and it could take a little longer in the mornings, but that's not really a big hassle. We stayed in the 4th floor and in a Double bed room,  yes,  the rooms are small but that's nyc type. Any hotel in the city will be a smaller version of it than any other hotel of the same brand in any city. So,  the room had a desk,  chair,  mini refrigerator. The bathroom is complete with essential toiletries you might need in the trip,  also a hair dryer and iron are included in the room. \nThe bed,  it's so comfortable! They provide you of hard and soft pillows, which I must say is nice to consider your option to use.  \nLocation of the hotel is the best value of all,  GREAT!  Just one block and a half from Times Square and one block from theatres that have Mamma M\u00eda, Rock of ages,  The Phantom of the Opera and Matilda. In the same block walking towards 8th Avenue is the metro stop which connects to almost all the metro lines in the city. \nGotta say the location for the price it's totally worth it.","travelDate":"2015-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Caught the bug, which is good because the manager initially denied vehemently that there could be an issue.  He insisted that he'd gone and inspected the room and there was zero evidence of infestation.  The rooms had been remodeled so there was no way we could be correct.  Even after we showed him the bug crawling around in our plastic cup, he actually suggested that we could have \"brought it ourselves\" in our bags or clothing.  I understand there is a bed bug issue across the country.  I wasn't expecting to never encounter one (though this is my first ever).

You also likely noticed that they require similar points to stay for free. I have stayed at both and there is NO comparison. The COMFORT INN TIMES SQUARE WEST IS A MUCH BETTER VALUE! Instead of reeling off justifications for why you are \"ok at the Econo lodge\" you could be HAPPY at the comfort inn west. The rooms at the Econo Lodge are a joke. You will be sharing embarrassing photos at the water cooler back home about how you could stretch and touch both walls (really) at the Econo Lodge. \n\nThe Comfort Inn is not a palace but it is very functional. The bathroom is clean. My room with 2 double beds (I chose that because you couldn't fit 2 double beds into my room at the Econo Lodge) didn't require you to 'inhale and walk sideways to get by the bed'. The desk and chair were fine for getting work done too. The walls were clean. The heat\/ac worked. It was about 1\/3 smaller than a normal room but still big enough to be in without getting claustrophobic.  \n\nThe location is good for theater goers. Many shows will be less than a 10 minute walk and some only 3 minutes. \n\nThere is some noise with other doors closing and from the street even if you are on a high floor but not that kept me from getting a good nights sleep. I found the bed very comfortable (unlike the V shaped bed at Econo Lodge). \n\nIf you are a single, book a double room anyway and you'll have lots of extra space. There isn't a chair for sitting and watching TV so plan on viewing from your bed. The TV is about 32\" and is wall mounted. \n\nThere is a single slow elevator which can get frustrating as it it also the one that the cleaning crew has to use. There is a garage across the street where you can park (with hotel validation) for $30 per day. \n\nI have stayed in many places (Crown Plaza, Double Tree Times Square) that were a bit roomier and ON Times Square that are worth your points (but a LOT of them...50,000 per day and up). The Comfort Inn West offers great value for your points!","travelDate":"2014-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

It is a couple of blocks from the Port Authority Bus Station where the NYC Airporter takes you to and from the airport. This hotel is very clean and the staff is friendly. The continental breakfast is convenient and good for a hotel breakfast. The breakfast area was very clean as well. The price is reasonable and a bit less than other big name hotels in the area.

We were gone all day and just needed a nice, clean place to sleep. This place did just that.  There is a complimentary breakfast in the basement that provided a nice breakfast...eggs, sausage, toast, cereal, donuts, muffins, coffee, and juices.  Plus, we had two complimentary bottles of water in our room each day.  Those definitely were needed.  One works up quite the thirst walking around town.

We ate early (about 6.30am) and it was just a couple of other families so no rush or crowd.\n\nThe location was great, only a couple of blocks to walk to Times Square and the tube. \n\nIf you want a boutique hotel or spacious accommodation this is not the hotel for you, if you want a good value clean hotel to use as a base then I think it is.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were traveling with a few valuables and we wanted to leave it in the safe while we were away. We checked in around midnight and reported the broken safe. They did immediately send maintenance. However, he was there for almost 20 minutes not knowing what to do, and a little insensitive to the fact that we did have to rest up. He finally tells us that they will send a different safe in the morning but we would've been out of the hotel by the time they sent the new one, defeating the purpose of wanting to lock up our valuables in case someone were to go into our room.

This was literally the only hotel I could find in Manhattan with prices in the $200's (used my AAA and got a discount).  The front desk staff were friendly and the rooms were absolutely fine and clean with comfortable beds and pillows.  Breakfast, as others have written, was marginal - not enough room for people to sit (everyone up between 830 and 9 of course) and pretty limited with watery coffee, white bread, nasty pastry, etc.  I made due with bananas and peanut butter - no problem - but this was no different than what you might find on the road at this type of hotel for the \"free breakfast\" - would recommend walking and getting a bagel or pastry somewhere else.  There is only one elevator which can be a problem if you are in a hurry.  You can get your parking ticket stamped and pay $30 a day across the street.  My only complaint is the very very strong smell of the cleaners\/disinfectant that was in the lobby as well as the rooms - we had to air out the room with the air conditioner and it still smelled strongly.

We were on the top floor, facing north, away from the street we were on, and had a decent view.  And the window opened!  So nice to get fresh air at night.   Except for Saturday, or if a fire-truck went by on 45th (the next street over) it was pretty quiet at night.\n     The breakfast was also better than expected.  The usual motel stuff, plus fresh fruit, eggs (scrambled one day, hard-boiled the next), sausage and bacon alternating, and it was constantly restocked by very attentive staff member.  \n     The entire staff was friendly and helpful, from the desk clerks, to the breakfast room attendants, to the house-keeping staff.   Because of them, and the other things listed above, I would definitely stay there again anytime I went back to New York. \n     I do have 3 very minor knocks on it:  1) Maybe it was because we were 7 floors above the router, but the WiFi was very slow.  I would strongly recommend bringing an ethernet cable (yes, they have outlets for them.  Just make sure they are connected.)  2)  There is one elevator for 65 or so rooms on 7 floors.  Going down the stairs was often a better choice than waiting (can\u2019t use them going up: only the first floor is unlocked from the stairwell side.)  3)  The toilet paper: it is about on par 1970\u2019s Eastern Europe or Turkey.  I doubt they can do much about the WiFi or the elevator, but if they don\u2019t upgrade the toilet paper I will go to a store and buy my own next time we are there.  And I will still stay there again.","travelDate":"2014-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I set my expectations too high based on the TA reviews and the following were my issues\n1. Paper thin walls. I was beside a family with young children. There's nothing the hotel can do about noise from other guests but I could hear everything that happened in the room next door and what TV program they were choosing to watch. The issue is the walls are too thin.\n2. Towels. These need to be refreshed. I stayed 5 nights and of the 5 sets of towels I used, 3 of them had significant wear\/stains.\n3. I have stayed in New York about 10 times, and I know how small hotel rooms in the city can be.... but this was the second smallest room I have ever stayed in. I was travelling alone (which was lucky) and stayed in a Queen Room. These really should be marketed (like other New York hotels) as Petite Doubles as there is almost no clear floor space whatsoever\n4. Noisy air con. The air con units are very noisy. It was February in New York and it was snowing & cold. The Air Con was needed but it can not be left on at night as it is so noisy.\n5. WiFi - very slow WiFi that drops out and prompts you to re-login at random times when you can be in the middle of using it!\n6. Noisy, very slow elevator - and there's only one. I was on floor 6 - hotel has 7 floors. Lift was horrendously slow especially in the mornings and at other peak times. It is also extremely noisy so if you get a room in the half of the hotel closest to the lift you will enjoy the noise of the motor running all day and all night\n7. Others have commented on the friendliness of the staff. I can't say the staff were unfriendly but I certainly didn't find them especially helpful, courteous, or friendly  - rather they were efficient.\n8. Housekeeping is extremely noisy, often congregating in groups in the middle of the corridor having loud conversations...or, worse, using a walkie-talkie intercom system to hold long conversations\n9. Breakfast was ok.  The dining facility was too small though, frequently running out of seating, and shutting service at 9.30 neither helps with the crowd nor provide guests with a restful lie-in in the morning when they are on vacation!\n8. Hotel name slightly misleading as it's not on Times Square itself but once you look up your maps in advance you will realise this. I didm;t measure it but it's at least 2-3 avenues of Times Square.\n\nCan;'t think of much to recommend this hotel, given the huge number of hotels in New York but it does have a decent location and the price is sometimes attractive","travelDate":"2014-02","tripType":"SOLO"}
{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":1485603,"title":"Unbeatable deal","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2014-02-06","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Two blocks from Times Square.  This hotel does as much as it can with this property, and it does quite well.  What it lacks, mostly, is extra space for things like a fitness room, restaurant and so forth.  There are many properties in NYC that cost more and don't really offer more, or even as much as this one.  \n\nThe rooms:  while small, they are bigger than many in NYC.  At least they have en suite bathrooms and there is some counter space in the bathroom.  The double bed rooms are actually a fairly decent size.  The king bed rooms would be big enough for a queen bed, but the king bed does leave a quite squeeze with the desk.  Overall, the rooms are fully-equipped and better than I expected.  While not luxurious, they are pretty much 3-star standard.  There was some noise in our room from the elevator next door, but overall it was quite quiet for being in downtown New York.  There are not many rooms on each floor, reducing the chance of noise from other guests.      \n\nBreakfast:  The breakfast room is pretty tiny and crowded, but there were tables more often than not.  Staff did a good job keeping things stocked.  It was pretty much the typical complementary breakfast for these sorts of hotels, with some hot selections and waffles and above average pastries.  \n\nJust one elevator does mean their are some waits.  The exterior of the hotel is quite plan, though the lights make it a bit more attractive at night.  \n\nService:  Fine.  Not especially friendly, and a bit busy most of the time, but pretty efficient.  \n\nLocation:  The location is awesome and is the reason to stay here  Just two blocks from Times Square.  \n\nThere are public parking lots around--the cost is high, so this is best for people not driving to NYC.  If you do drive, the lots are cheaper than garages.","travelDate":"2014-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I commented several times to my travel mate how clean everything looked, how fresh the linens smelled, and how shiny the floors were. The shower head was powerful and the water pressure was great (this may sound silly, but it's important for a woman!) The full breakfast in the morning was a bonus. They served hot options (bacon, sausage, waffles, oatmeal, biscuits and gravy, etc.) along with cereals, pastries, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, etc. There was a variety of selections for everyone.

The room (606) was at the back of the hotel so it was pretty quiet for NYC. The room was clean except for the shower tile grout was showing a bit of mildew.  Towels are thin and skimpy but they allowed us four each day so that balanced out.  Breakfast was typical with microwaved scrambled eggs, bacon and waffles for hot food and a good selection of yogurts, fruit and breads as well.  The breakfast area was well replenished and that isn't easy at 9:00 AM when the capacity 35 room reaches overflow.  \nThe TV in our room would not show cable TV properly because of a loose coaxial that we had to have fixed twice, with poor results.  Also, the hallway had piles of laundry (clean or not?) in clear bags at all hours, something I have not seen happen before.\nWe were lucky to get a king room, that was a decent size for NYC, for $170 plus taxes for our three nights.  The location is 1 1\/2 blocks off of Times Square with several restaurants and bars (with $8 beers) around it and the wonderful Shake Shack on the corner.  \nAll in all a good experience.","travelDate":"2013-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We chose Comfort Inn Times Square West due to the great price and location, and we wasn't disappointed! \n\nWe checked in at 1pm, and was shown straight to our room (although I thought check in was 3pm so was extremely happy!). We stayed in room 509 and it was perfect for what we needed. A large bed (and one of the most comfy I have ever stayed in!), a fridge, table and chair and a shower. The room was spotless and came its a flat screen tv with a free movie directory! Amazing! The rooms are small, but in NYC, it's very unlikely you would get a large room! It was a comfy size for the 2 of us plus luggage and many many shopping bags! \n\nThe location was amazing! 2 blocks West of Times Square, and in the heart of it within 5 minutes. There is a subway at the end of the block that runs A,C and E lines (many of which take you down to the 9\/11 site without having to change!). The area was safe and busy but was not disturbed by any noise at night time. There are numerous bars and restaurants in the block, and slightly cheaper than eating in the heart of Times Square. \n\nThe breakfast was an added bonus! Paid a lot more to stay elsewhere on my previous trip without breakfast! So this was amazing! Never had. Problem getting a table, and we was down in the breakfast between 8am and 9am each day. Breakfast had a lot of variety - American waffles, bacon, sausages, cereal etc etc. Breakfast staff were extreme polite and would bring over your waffles when they were ready. \n\nOverall, an extreme happy stay at the Comfort Inn and would recommend to all if your looking for a cheap and cheerful hotel in a perfect location! \n\nNew York will always be my favourite city in the world, so I will be returning!

OK, it\u2019s not the Waldorf Astoria, but for the money we paid it was great PLUS you also got breakfast.\nFrom the outside the hotel does not look much, but it\u2019s a 5 minute walk to Times Square and there are theatres and bars \/ cafes all on the doorstep. It is located on West 44th Street, Just off 9th Avenue (towards 8th Avenue).\nChecking in was quick and easy. The staff on reception, to the cleaners, all were very polite and helpful.\nThe hotel has 7 floors and we were on the 5th. There is one small lift and it\u2019s a bit slow but you can always take the stairs. The room had 2 double beds, flat screen TV, filter coffee machine, air conditioning\/heating unit, fridge, iron, ironing board, en-suite bathroom, with small bath and shower. \nThe room was a little small, and my only gripe really was that there was not enough drawer space. Perhaps the hotel should consider taking out a couple of the chairs and adding in a chest of drawers, or maybe instead of having 2 double beds, have one queen\/king sized bed as this would just give a bit more space. The room was fine for a couple, but for more than 2 people I think that it would be a bit of a squeeze.\nWe had room 507, which was at the back of the hotel and quite quiet. The only noise was occasionally from the fridge. There was also a bit of a draught coming from behind the AC unit. The beds were very comfy and we got a good night\u2019s sleep (or maybe that was due to all the walking that we did!).\nBreakfast was coffee, tea, bread, bagels, muffins, pastries, cereal, waffles, fruit \u2013 plenty to set you up for the morning.\nWhen we arrived at JFK airport, the cost of the yellow cab, was $58 to the hotel (set fare to central Manhattan hotels). We arrived on Sunday lunchtime, and the transfer to the hotel took about 45minutes. On our return, we asked the hotel to book a cab for us, and they use a private taxi firm, with a flat fare of $65. Note: if you want to use the tunnel you will have to add on the tolls of $7.50 to this. The private taxi was nice, a big 4x4 with blacked out windows \u2013 cool! This arrived on time and took about 60 minutes to get through the Thursday evening rush hour traffic to the airport.\nAll on all, we had a nice break and the Comfort Inn Times Square West was more than adequate for our city break and I\u2019d recommend this for couples or 2 people who are looking for a central, good value for money hotel. \n\nP.S. The Beer Authority bar a couple of doors up from the hotel was great. It\u2019s like a sports bar, but they have happy hours and do some nice cocktails and also a good selection of beers and ales.","travelDate":"2013-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The bed was comfortable and I slept well despite being alone.\nThe breakfast is included in the room charges and it was a basic one but very filling, with eggs, toast, fruits, yogurt, and waffles to end with.

I have read some of the reviews and I can't understand the complaints about the elevator -- there is also a stairwell that can be used.  This hotel is extremely clean -- the area where breakfast is served is immaculate -- the food is very good and lots of it, fruit, yogurt, all kinds of baked goods, bread, bagels, cereal, eggs (2 kinds) and bacon and sausages.  The coffee is great too and very thoughtful to have it throughout the day for guests.  (One small suggestion is to leave a little milk in the fridge for tea drinkers).\n\nThe bedrooms are compact, but have everything you need.  The beds are comfy and the bathroom is very clean (and I am very particular).  Anything you needed was just a phone call away.\n\nWe were also very touched to find roses and chocolates for my daughter's birthday -- what a lovely touch.\n\nVery close to EVERYTHING -- and yet pretty quiet.  We were on the second floor looking onto the street and we were not interrupted by noises while sleeping.\n\nThere is only one thing I want to mention -- and it was not the hotel's fault -- we were looking for transportation to Woodburry Commons for shopping and while the hotel staff were extremely helpful in arranging transportation, the Busline -- American Tours -- was terrible!!

A 10 minute walk to the Hudson River.  A majority of the staff were friendly and helpful with any of our queries.

Also close and an easy walk were the Empire State Building, Macey's and an extensive array of shops.\n\nWhere the hotel punches above its weight are the softer touches - A Continental type breakfast which really set us up for the day (hot - eggs, bacon or sausages, toast, freshly cooked to order Waffles, Fruit, very fresh pastries, Yogurt etc & don't be put off by the plastic plates\/knives\/forks as they are just functional) and all day complimentary filtered coffee for guests in the Breakfast area on the ground floor by Reception.

{"helpfulVotes":6,"locationId":1485603,"title":"Great Location in the Theater District","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2013-09-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"This was our second stay here. The following review is my original review with updates.\n\nIf you\u2019re the type of traveler for whom a hotel is merely an adjunct to a trip -- a clean place to stay with a convenient location -- a place where the hot water is hot, the toilet flushes, the shower works, the bed is comfortable, and the price is reasonable [by NYC standards], then this hotel is for you.\n\nMy wife and I stayed here for six nights. It was our tenth trip to NYC for a week of theater, delicatessens, and bargain shopping [while I stayed outside and people-watched, or in two instances walked across the Brooklyn Bridge].\n\nLOCATION: Located on 44th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues the hotel is in the west end of the theater district, convenient to Times Square and the subway. It\u2019s a safe, busy area, at least between 7AM and 11PM. I was in my room at other times. \n\nTHE ROOM: \nThe room with two double beds is somewhat small, even by NYC standards, but a couple coordinating their movements can avoid bumping into each other. \n\nThe room contained an iron\/ironing board, hair dryer, clock, fridge, coffee, coffeemaker, and safe. \n\nDrawers and closet space were minimal. Fortunately my wife prefers to live out of her suitcase, so I had the two small drawers and the small closet to myself. I found that I was storing items in places that I\u2019ve never used -- the drawer of the night table and the empty space below the drawer of the night table. The room contains two chairs but it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll use them for storage.\n\nThere was a full length mirror. \n\nWall Street Journal and USA Today are included in the room price and are available in the lobby. \n\nWe did not bring our laptops so I can\u2019t comment on the wi-fi. \n\nThe TV was a flat screen. \n\nThe room-lighting is on the darker side of adequate. There is a nightlight in the bathroom as part of the hairdryer.\n\nThe shower spray is steady and the hot water remains constant. The shower is a shower\/bath combination. \n\nThe bathroom has minimal counter space for two guests but was shiny, spotless, and well-lighted. The towels are plentiful and although not plush, certainly do the job. A minor annoyance: there is no soapdish in the shower.\n\nHousekeeping was dependable.\n\nThe bed, pillow, and linens were comfortable [This is subjective, of course. One guest\u2019s \u201ccomfortable\u201d can be another guest\u2019s sleepless night.]. \n\nWe were on the 6th floor so I can\u2019t comment on the lobby noise that other guests have discussed. We didn\u2019t hear the guests in the room next door; however, if the sound of the automatic lock engaging when a room door closes bothers you, then I suggest ear plugs. \n\nThe air conditioner was effective and quiet. \n\nTWO UNIQUE FEATURES OF THE ROOM:\nAs a matter of course we all know that to take a shower we have to redirect the water flow from the tub to the shower. We find the lever, push it, pull it, or flip it and voila! -- a shower. Not here. HIDDEN at the end of the faucet is a ring. You have to run the water and pull the ring down. Kudos to my wife for figuring it out. Apparently I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s had problems. I subsequently noticed that they have to explain it in the hotel information book in the room.\n\nMost hotel rooms have two sets of curtains -- the thin white see-thru curtains and the lined room-darkening curtains. Here, however, the room-darkening curtains are stationary; they don\u2019t extend across the window. So you figure that you have to live without room-darkeners. But there is a THIRD SET of curtains hidden behind the white see-thru curtains. These are the room-darkeners. I found these on our third day.\n\nELEVATORS: There is only one elevator. In addition, it seems to function as the service elevator. The staff does its best not to interfere with the guests. We had no unusually long waits. But the problem is obvious. Elevators can break and certainly require routine maintenance. What do guests do when the elevator is invariably out of service? For some guests the stairs are not an option.\n\nSTAFF: The staff is a major selling point for the hotel. In a word: excellent. They are pleasant, helpful, and accommodating.\n\nWhen we checked in, we realized the prior occupants had locked the safe. We called the front desk. Within five minutes a staff member came to our room and solved the problem. He made sure that we tried it and it worked before he left. \n\nA lamp malfunctioned in our room. As we left for the day, we reported the problem. When we returned that afternoon, we had a replacement lamp. \n\nMy wife asked the desk clerk about the location of a street fair. After getting an answer we went up to our room. Upon entering we received a call. It was the desk clerk apologizing for misinforming us and gave us the correct information.\n\nINTERNET ACCESS: If you don\u2019t have your computer with you, the hotel provides a computer in the lobby. The cost is included in the price of the room. The staff asked non-guests who were using the computer to leave.\n\nSECURITY: There are surveillance cameras on every floor.\n\nFOOD: Guests have access to a buffet breakfast, which is built into the price of the room. Cereal, sausage\/bacon, eggs, waffles, yogurt, breads, bagels, pastries, fruit, juice, coffee, and tea are standard. Like the rest of the hotel staff, the woman working the breakfast was excellent. She kept all items restocked, made sure the food areas and tables were clean, and even made your waffles. She ensured that you got a good start to your day. A Comfort Inn buffet breakfast is not intended to be a sit-down breakfast at a coffee shop with your eggs made to order and is therefore easy to criticize for not being what it never intended to be. It\u2019s an efficient way to refuel and get on your way.\n\nThe breakfast area provides tea, coffee, hot water, and a microwave 24 hours a day.\nThe front desk has chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon.\n\nSUMMARY: A reasonably priced hotel must get its reasonableness from somewhere. In this case it\u2019s the size of the rooms, a small not fancy lobby, rooms which could be somewhat brighter, and the one elevator, but if these money-savers don\u2019t bother you, then the great location, the included breakfast, and the superb staff make this hotel a good choice.","travelDate":"2013-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

During our visit, we did a hop on-hop off bus tour to see the city (the pick up site is in Times Square). It would also be very close for any shows. (Being small-town people, the best thing was leaving our car parked and walking...don't think that you'll get anywhere driving yourself around NYC!)","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I did a lot of research to figure out where the best location to stay was based on what we were planning on doing. Then I looked at the cost of the hotels and decided on the Comfort Inn. Upon check in, we were greeted by a friendly desk clerk. Our room was on the 4th floor which was easily reached by the elevator. Once getting off the elevator, the rooms (about 10 per floor) are situated around the outside edges kind of like a square. We had a room with a king size bed. The room was a good size for the 2 of us. It did have a refrigerator which blocked the path to the other side of the bed. Without it, I would say it was a perfect size for 2 people. The bathroom was very cleaned. Shiny faucets and floors. The bed also had both soft and hard pillows to choose from and I would say our bed was very comfortable. Our room was street side, so we did hear the sounds of traffic, but to me that is expected given being in a city. \n\nLater in the day, they served chocolate chip cookies, had coffee and water available all day. There was also a continental breakfast which included chocolate or white waffles which were made by a hotel employee, eggs (hard boiled or scrambled), sausage, gravy, toast, pastries, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, juices, etc. The breakfast area is a nice size, but too small for so many people. \n\nAs far as getting to the heart of NYC, this location is a straight shot (2 blocks) to the Broadway shows, a couple blocks to the Port Authority Bus\/Subway station, 3 blocks from Times Square, Hard Rock, etc. If we ever travel back we certainly will stay here. It was in a quiet area, but close to all the \"fun\", or at least easy enough to get transportation - subway, bus, taxi to anywhere. The staff were friendly and very helpful in giving directions and making us feel welcome.","travelDate":"2013-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

First would be the cost of NYC hotels, we covered this by using our Choice Privileges points.  The next big concern was the security of my motorcycle during our three night stay.  I called the hotel on two separate occasions and they assured me they had a deal with the parkade across the street and that my bike would be as safe there as anywhere as they had staff on site 24\/7.\n\nWe arrived at the hotel and check in was handled quickly by very friendly staff, a good start to our stay.  Unpacked the bike and headed across the street to park it and the stress level rose immediately when the staff tried to wave me out of the parkade and said they don't allow motorcycles in the parkade.  I tried to explain I was from the hotel and they said they had a deal but that got me nowhere and I'm fairly certain the only reason I got to talk to someone in charge was the fact I was blocking their entry and was not leaving.  Eventually the Asst Mgr. found a spot to park my bike and after making it very clear they would not be responsible for any damage to the bike agreed to let me park it.  Not exactly the warm fuzzy feeling I was hoping for leaving my bike for 3 nights.\n\nWhen I returned to the hotel I was pretty stressed about this and mentioned to the staff at the desk in the future they should know the parkade won't take motorcycles as we would not have booked had we known this fact.  The manager came out and apologized and stated that because the parkades are always full they change their rules whenever they see fit and if the hotel tries to complain they essentially tell them to pound sand and void the contract.  I understand this is not directly a hotel issue but it was a major factor in my choice of hotels so I've included it in the review.\n\nOur room was nicely appointed and spotless and it was also quite small but I had expected that based on other NYC hotel reviews.  Wifi worked great, maid service was excellent and about the only room related issue was the last day I felt our towels were beyond their service life but it was such a small issue it wouldn't affect me coming back based on how happy we were with the room itself.  If you are a light sleeper I'd recommend ear plugs as there is a lot of street noise early in the day.\n\nThe included breakfast was awesome, well stocked and kept full at all times by staff.  The only other issue we had was the Comfort Inn website states this hotel has guest laundry and traveling by motorcycle we planned to use it.  When we arrived we found out there is no guest laundry and the nearest laundromat was many blocks away.  Not a huge deal but had the website been accurate we would have done laundry the day before arrival at our previous hotel as they had a guest laundry.","travelDate":"2013-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It was an easy walk to Times Square and to the Intreped museum.  Eat at Bubba Gump in times square but that is another review.   Great hotel.  Of all my experiences in New York Hotels this was the best.","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From the first day to the last the staff were exceptionally accommodating with all our requests for information, directions and a late check out being catered for with great professionalism. We both recommend this Comfort Inn for the following reasons.\n\n1) Very economical for its location \n-it is within walking distance of the majority of broadway shows, \n-the Hudson River with its great parks and walk ways. \n-It is 100 metres from an entrance to the subway for 42nd street\n- There is a wash and fold laundry right next door at 90c per lb or on 9th Ave between 44th and 47 th (100-150metres) away there is a coin op laundry\n-There are a great many eating places of all description and costs. There is a nice little Thai restaurant two doors up that has a $16.45 three course meal which is great and then there is the Gallo Nero for Italian (On 44th & 9th Ave)\n- In other words it is very convenient\n\n2) The rooms and bathrooms are small but only using the room to shower and sleep, the room was adequate. We had a king bed which had a choice of hard or soft pillows and was very comfortable. The rooms and the general environment of the Inn was clean and pleasant.\n\n3) The breakfast room is small so get there between 06.30 and 08.30 because after that it gets very crowded though there was a constant turn over of seats. The Breakfast food itself is ok with a selection of cereals,yogurts, coffee, tea, breads, muffins, bagels (These at times were somewhat stale).The only poor part of breakfast was the cooked breakfast which was not the most nutritional being sausages, bacon and eggs cooked in a bag.\n\nIf you don't want to spend too much money, have a convenient place to stay which is comfortable, clean and a reasonably good breakfast you can't go past  this Comfort Inn.","travelDate":"2013-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It takes FOREVER, so plan either a long wait or a walk down the stairs. As others have said, the shower is just plain confusing - they actually have a laminated card with instructions behind the front desk! I don't know why they don't just print that up and stick it in all of the bathrooms. Also, the free breakfast was tasty but the dining area is overcrowded. You can hardly maneuver between the tables with a plate full of food, and I was constantly tripping on chairs and purses. \n\nOverall, it was a relatively pleasant stay in a wonderful location.

There is one sofa that faces the checkin desk and the area frequently smells like cleaning supplies.\n5) It is not obvious how to turn on the shower and when you try long enough and eventually get the front desk, it is obvious that they've had the question asked of them numerous times.\n6) 9:30 is too early to shut down breakfast abruptly.  People travel from all different time zones and for all different reasons and I have been in other similar-style hotels that keep it going a little longer particularly when their occupancy is high, as it was.  \n7) The sink needs to be turned off exactly the right way so that it does not drip.

Price-wise, NY is expensive at this time of year. no matter how hard we tried we couldn't find anything decent at a sane price, and the Comfort did deliver good quality for this price. Location is great for first time visitors- 5 minutes walk (with stroller) from Times Sq. 2 minutes walk to the nearest Metro station and about 15-20 minutes walk to central park\/ 5'th avenue. also close to the 34'th shopping street.

The hotel is small but friendly, with free wifi. the room we got (a queen size bed ) was great for a couple but absolutely cramped with a baby's crib. after one night we had to move to the (little more spacious) double room. Lucky for us there was one available  and the Duty manager, Sunita, offered it to us at no extra cost for the entire stay. this is what I call service!\nThe room was kept clean and was in good condition. Cable TV, coffee maker and fridge were all nice to have.    \nBreakfast was nice, with bagels, waffles and, fresh fruits and cereals. the only downside is that the dining area was tiny and usually packed by the time we got there. still, this represents excellent value as a similar meal eaten outside would cost around 10-15$ per person.\nOverall I would recommend this hotel more to couples or business travelers, but we still had  a great time there.","travelDate":"2013-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms were clean and twin beds were comfortable for three adults. However rooms are on a smaller size compared to other places we have visited in USA. Great location for travelling in Manhattan. Metro was down the road. Time Square 2 minutes walk and good variety of restaurants at the other end of the road. \nBreakfast was good and plenty. All staff were very helpful though some did not speak much English, however this did not stop them from doing the jobs there were assigned to do. Restaurant area was too small. They could arrange it differently to make use of the area and also have chairs that would fit under the table to make space. I did not feel comfortable carrying my hot tea to my table !!! \nThe receptionist\/ duty manager Ajay was friendly and very helpful. \nIf I go back to NY again I would definitely stay here.","travelDate":"2013-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I requested that they come clean the next morning and we didn't have any trouble after that.","travelDate":"2013-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We booked for 3 adults, there were two beds, 7 LARGE suitcases (no storage, no room) .. one of us had to sleep with suitcases as our bed partner!  But the Hotel was in a GREAT LOCATION, the Customer Service was superior, they even make homemade chocolate cookies EVERYDAY!!!  My suitcase did not arrive at the airport and was not seen at the hotel until very late the second day, but the staff gave me the essentials, which was something that I did not have to worry about purchasing.  It was an overall good experience .. you really had to laugh about the small room, which we did!  In fact, my friend had brought numerous pairs of shoes for her numerous outfits and those were lined up on the windowsill due to no storage or space for 3 people, if you know what I mean .. but other than that .. it was PERFECT!","travelDate":"2013-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Shower is tricky, a gadget in the tub faucet.  Impressed from the start.  We arrived for early check in to hear\/watch exchange of a guest berating the check out staff because thought the price signed for night before was too high for 11 hours.  Doesn't matter 11 or 24 hours, same amount of clean up and care for staff, that guest paid $10 less than our room.  Guest was nasty, repeatedly spitting of the word despicable!  Staff was polite, balanced and fair in responses, showed no agitation in reaction to this attack on them.  The staff had agreed to hold our bags prior to room readiness, but room was ready upon our arrival! Center of everything we wanted, we walked to Empire State Bldg, walked to Broadway show, walked to Jekyll & Hyde theme restaurant, cab to National Museum of History and Central Park. The continental breakfast next day surpassed by far the common definition of it.  Available was fresh made pancakes, sausage, muffins, yogurt, fresh fruit, juices, bagels, and much more. Buffet is a better description.  Staff agreed to hold our bags after check out.  Mind you we were carrying 2 bags the size of some large purses, we did not burden them with large or numerous bags.  \n\nIf the staff stays the same I would come back to this place again and again.  Only hope I find one as good when I decide to go back to Manhattan South.","travelDate":"2013-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The service by the staff at the hotel was excellent - all the staff we encountered were polite and very nice! We had a room at the front of the hotel for our first 2 nights which was quite noisy - just street noise - and asked to move to a quieter room.

The hotel is on 44th street, which is straight down the road from the Majestic Theater where the Phantom of the Opera plays.  Unbelievably convenient.  There's also a subway stop just down the block about 30 yards.  There's also a multi-level parking garage directly across the street.  Yes, a few bums on the street (you can escape 1 or 2), but they never entered the hotel and the hotel attendant watches the door all night long.  Rooms are small, but larger than a European hotel.  The room was clean, the bathroom was clean, the towels clean, and the linen clean.  No bad smells, no bad stains.  The one bad thing was that the safe in the room didn't work.  No biggie.  The breakfast is also very good for a continental breakfast. They always have waffles, but they alternate scrambled eggs and bacon one day and hard boiled eggs and sausage the next (I've never had a \"nuked\" hard boiled egg, and not sure I will again, I really wish they'd boil them).  Anyway, a woman makes the waffles and ensure the entire area is tidy (I've seen places destroyed when hotel staff aren't around).  The woman is generally quiet and my kids were nervous, but they said good morning and she had a smile that was worth a million bucks.  She's just shy.  Anyway, there's toast, cereal, bagels, yogurt, you get the photo.  AND!  At night, on 8th and 43nd (I think) there's a Crumb's Bakery where you can get killer cupcakes (BabaBooey Flavor, no joke) and you can eat them back at the hotel where they have coffee and tea all night long.  We're not night birds, so it was nice to cap off the evening with green tea and cupcakes.  Anyway, the only snafu was a young, short, heavy-set girl behind the counter in the mornings who is rather curt.  It seems like the place is a family owned hotel, so I have no doubt that her parents will help her with courtesies in the near future.  Anyway, we felt safe, secure, clean, fed, and rested.  You can't ask for anything more from a Comfort Inn that's this perfectly located in the Big Apple.","travelDate":"2013-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}
