She has a smile that lights up a room! Do you know how great this Girl is?  If not let me tell you.  She started our conversion with a funny joke to lighten up how confused I was if I was at the right hotel.  She made me feel very comfortable and I noticed how at ease I was talking to this girl.  She found my reservation mediately and just did her bet to accommodate me in finding a room.  I honestly don't think you guys know how rare it is to find someone like Nakita on board the front desk.  \n\nNormally I find a front desk person literally hating their job and wishes you can be out of their face asap.  Not Nakita, her & Heidi were attentive to everyone who they came in contact with and with a beautiful smile. They are top notch of their game! Nakita did not skip a beat! Heidi was just as alert and as soon as there were people behind me to check in they came full force to make sure, \"yes you are our number one priority!\"  \n\nI am so tired of how I would get treated with the long faces and mandatory \"I have to be nice to the customer\". but these two girls are pure magic.  You can obviously tell They love their job and really want to make sure everyone that was coming and going has a great time at the hotel.  You honestly can't find genuine people l ike these two but Nakita is the star of the show and I hope you guys treat her right because if you don't i definitely know how to snag a great person and give them a way better opportunity.  \n\nIt was very refreshing to talk to the both of them.\n\nPlease don't lose her!

Ganz Lower Manhattan, insbesondere die Wall Street, WTC und Battery Park mit der F\u00e4hre nach Brooklyn, Staten Island und Liberty Island ist sehr gut zu Fuss erreichbar, die restliche Stadt ist per Subway (drei Stationen in direkter N\u00e4he) ebenfalls sehr gut und schnell erreichbar. Im Quartier sind diverse L\u00e4den und Restaurants zu finden und es hat uns hier an nichts gefehlt. Nachts haben wir von Midtown aus Sicherheitsgr\u00fcnden jeweils ein Uber f\u00fcr die R\u00fcckfahrt zum Hotel genutzt. Wir haben in der Subway zwar keine schlechte Erfahrung gemacht und alles war friedlich und schien sicher, aber wir wollten das auch nicht \u00e4ndern. Die N\u00e4chte waren f\u00fcr NYC sehr ruhig. Nat\u00fcrlich hat man auch hier einen gewissen Citysound, aber er war absolut ertr\u00e4glich und wir schliefen wunderbar.\n\nDer Empfang im Hotel durch Nakita und Victor war herzlich und wir f\u00fchlten uns sofort wohl. Das Hotel macht einen sauberen und gepflegten Eindruck und unser Zimmer war sehr sauber. Das Boxspringbett hatte einen perfekten H\u00e4rtegrad und bescherte uns sieben sehr geruhsame N\u00e4chte. Auch das Reinigungspersonal war sehr freundlich, als wir zwei Mal Kontakt zu ihnen hatten, weil wir noch im Zimmer waren, als die Zimmerreinigung nach dem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck erfolgte. A propos Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck: Dieses kann zwischen 7 - 10 Uhr im Hotelrestaurant eingenommen werden und ist sehr reichhaltig. Man hat die Auswahl zwischen dem Buffet und einer reichhaltigen Karte. Beides war sehr gut und kann uneingeschr\u00e4nkt empfohlen werden. Auch der Service war jeweils freundlich und zuvorkommend.\n\nBeim absolut problemlosen Check-Out bot uns der Empfangsmitarbeiter Martin proaktiv an, einen g\u00fcnstigen Wagen eines Partnerunternehmens f\u00fcr den Flughafentransfer zu organisieren, was dann auch reibungslos funktionierte. Zwischen Check-Out (m\u00f6glich bis Mittag) und Abreise konnten wir unsere Koffer kostenlos bei der Rezeption deponieren.\n\nAlles in allem waren wir mit unserer Hotelwahl sehr zufrieden und w\u00fcrden das Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center in Manhattan Downtown NYC uneingeschr\u00e4nkt weiterempfehlen.

We have stayed here since 2018 and continue to come back. We have been very happy with the hotel itself and the staff have been great. This time they went over and above to exceed our expectations and I wanted to make it a point to write about our experience. \n\nThis trip started out differently. We arrived late on the 23rd after our flight was delayed. When we arrived at the hotel we met Nakita at the front desk. We were told that the room we had booked (1 king bed) was unavailable at that they had only rooms with double beds available. We were very upset. We had planned this stay and booked months in advanced. We were very disappointed that the room we booked was not available. When we went up to the first room it was unfortunately not ready for guests and we had to go back and change rooms. Nakita was professional and tried her best to make things right. She said someone would call us between 9 and 10 am the next day to follow up.\n\nThe next day, exactly as promised we were called to let us know that the room we had booked was available. We were thrilled. We felt heard. We felt that the staff had made a promise to get back to us and help make things right - and they did exactly that. We ended up just staying in the room we were in and let the staff know we were happy with how they handled things. On top of that the front desk staff helped get us a late check out so luckily we could go directly to the airport. On our way out the manager met us to ensure our stay went well and we thanked him. \n\nEvery time we passed by the front desk or came in and out from exploring the city or shopping we were always greeted with a smile.\n\nWe really appreciated how we were treated.

It certainly does not merit the glowing descriptions so many first time reviewers have given.\n\nPROS\n1) Ladies at the front desk are nice. We requested housekeeping daily, and they only skipped us once.\n2) Location was close to good subway stops that took us quickly to Brooklyn or uptown Manhattan. A surprisingly nice change of pace from Midtown.\n\nCONS:\n1) Room was not just \u201cManhattan small\u201d but laid out weird. The closet was more of a cabinet where the ironing board\/iron was also kept. But the ironing stuff ate up so much of the space that we couldn\u2019t hang our clothes without twisting them to one side. Even after tossing the ironing board in a corner of the room, the iron holder jutted out and made retrieving our clothes difficult.\n2) Condition of property was pretty dated and, in some ways, unclean. Carpets, for example, need to be replaced, especially in the halls.\n3) Helipad across Water Street leads to constant drone of helicopters.\n4) Not many great dining options nearby, although we understand that is a reflection of being in the financial district. \n5) We could hear everything\u2014 and I mean EVERYTHING \u2014 in the room next door, which leads me to\u2026\n6) Quality problem with some of the guests. The guy next door had an assortment of sketchy looking \u201cfriends\u201d coming and going at all hours. I should have asked to move, but hoped it was a one night thing. No such luck. The door slamming, music, partying and female noises (yep!) led to two nights with no sleep.\n7) Big stack of the \u201cEpoch Times\u201d newspapers in the lobby for the guests\u2019 reading pleasure. Tells me everything I need to know about the owners.\n8) No common space to hang other than the lobby.

I have complained relentlessly about this feature being made available but somehow never works.\n\nSo, I asked the woman at the front desk why my digital key did not work.  She blamed it on a possible problem with my credit card not authorizing.  That's BS as I know my credit card information was entered correctly and that it's valid.\n\nTurns out, according to another review, the digital key access has been down (or will be down) for 6 months.  I suppose this is something that Hilton doesn't want to tell its customers.\n\nDespite being lied to at the front desk we do appreciate being personally called when a room became available.  The staff at the front counter was very good at holding our bags both at arrival and departure day.  Thank you for that.\n\nOriginal review from 3 months ago below...\n\nI always try to stay with Hilton Inns as I find them to be an exceptional value for the money.  Was a bit disappointed that their Hampton Inn, next door, was booked for our Great Saunter weekend as it would have included free breakfast at such an expensive price point.  The Hilton Garden Inn does not offer free breakfast though a restaurant is located on its second floor.\n\nThis is an excellent hotel at an excellent location with a good variety of restaurants nearby.  The front desk personnel were extremely polite and welcoming.  We got some great tips on where to go for dinner.\n\nThe downsides?  The Keurig machine is broken in room 1402. Forgot to report it, but I am sure after the staff reads this review, they will replace it.  There's still water inside it as it never dispensed it for our coffee.\n\nAlso, very disappointed in the Digital Key concept.  It's supposed to allow you to skip the front desk and go right to your room at check-in.  However, I have yet to stay at a Hilton hotel that offers this service and not had the app mandate me to check in at the front desk.  Why advertise the convenience of this service and it doesn't work as promised?\n\nStill, despite those issues, I still give this hotel my highest recommendation as the rooms were extremely clean and we enjoyed a good night's rest.\n\nBe aware the hotel will mandate a $100 deposit at the time of check-in that will be refunded when you check out.\n","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

(We did end up getting to keep our room) and our experience was Wanda was delightful. The whole staff at the front desk was super helpful to any and all our requests. \n\nThe one thing that I would say is the housekeeping lacked communication with the front desk, where one night we did wait over a couple hours to receive the new items we requested until we went down to the front desk to request them in person.

You could see the System Island Ferry terminal from the hotel, the Statue of Liberty cruises were a few minutes\u2019 walk away and there were numerous subway lines in easy walking distance (1, 5, R & W).  The price was one of the cheaper options in Manhattan yet the rooms were spacious, clean and in good condition.  All staff seemed very friendly and our room was cleaned daily to a good standard.\n\nI have only rated the hotel as a 3\/5 for the following reasons:\n-  Only one member of staff on at busy times which led to queues checking in etc.\n-  Paper \/ plastic cups only in the room and coffee only to drink (I knew this and had bought a travel kettle and my own tea bags)\n-  Room key card didn\u2019t work on the first attempt and we were on 23rd floor so this was a long journey back down! This happened to a number of people so not a one off\n-  The cleaners sometimes forgot to replace all towels, leave fresh cups and more coffee or soap which would then lead to another trip back down to reception to stand in line, which got boring quickly! I still have no idea why our soap was replaced daily (this seemed wasteful)\n-  Only one small wardrobe (with just 4 hangers) and no proper drawers to store clothes\n\nUnexpected plus points:\n-  Iron and ironing board in room\n-  Good sized room\n-  Very effective air conditioning and a window that opened enough for fresh air\n-  Lots of USB charging points in the room\n-  Free and fast Wi-Fi\n-  Mini fridge and microwave in the room","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Was a bit disappointed that their Hampton Inn, next door, was booked for our Great Saunter weekend as it would have included free breakfast at such an expensive price point.  The Hilton Garden Inn does not offer free breakfast though a restaurant is located on its second floor.\n\nThis is an excellent hotel at an excellent location with a good variety of restaurants nearby.  The front desk personnel were extremely polite and welcoming.  We got some great tips on where to go for dinner.\n\nThe downsides?  The Keurig machine is broken in room 1402. Forgot to report it, but I am sure after the staff reads this review, they will replace it.  There's still water inside it as it never dispensed it for our coffee.\n\nAlso, very disappointed in the Digital Key concept.  It's supposed to allow you to skip the front desk and go right to your room at check-in.  However, I have yet to stay at a Hilton hotel that offers this service and not had the app mandate me to check in at the front desk.  Why advertise the convenience of this service and it doesn't work as promised?\n\nStill, despite those issues, I still give this hotel my highest recommendation as the rooms were extremely clean and we enjoyed a good night's rest.\n\nBe aware the hotel will mandate a $100 deposit at the time of check-in that will be refunded when you check out.\n","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We originally booked for 4 nights but Virgin changed our flights so we had to book an extra night. \nSo where should I start.. arrival to New York was later than expected due to snow in Manchester so the flight was delayed, it took  5 hours to get to Manchester airport (should have been 1.5hrs) but hey ho we got there in the end so can\u2019t complain, thankfully the flight was delayed otherwise we\u2019d have missed our hols! Hotel was fab, good size rooms with a large bathroom and great lighting in the bathroom too. Spotlessly clean with a wardrobe, TV, mini fridge and a microwave too! I\u2019d requested a river view as we\u2019d gone for our daughter\u2019s 30th birthday and wanted to surprise her and I\u2019m so glad to say the hotel accommodated my request and we all had a view of the Hudson River and the Staten Island Ferry terminal. Beds were super comfy, had the best nights sleep for a long time. Staff on reception were great but my only complaint is they were all unsure of the change in policy for hotels in the US around the food and beverage credit for Hilton Garden Inn properties. On booking I was informed we were entitled to a $10 food credit per day per person to use in the snack shop, this was instead of a free breakfast, however the staff thought this was per stay but after questioning this a couple of times they did honour it and took the charges off our room. As we\u2019d arrived later than expected we didn\u2019t do anything on the first night except get a drink in the restaurant, good service and prices not too bad. A few people had complained about the wait time for the lift but I can honestly say we waited less than a minute or two when we called the lift throughout our whole stay. \nGreat location for the free Staten Island ferry and for the subway to Times Square. But I wish we\u2019d turned left after leaving the hotel as a fab walk near the river which we only found out about on leaving. Within walking distance to 9\/11 too. Highly recommend George\u2019s for breakfast, around a 10 minute walk from hotel. Fabulous food and service and reasonable prices too, a definite win win. \nWe booked our transfer back to JFK through Martin on reception, it cost a set fee of $95 and was definitely worth it, took all the stress away from getting a yellow cab or trying to negotiate the air train and we had a very comfortable journey back in a luxurious car with a fabulous chauffeur too. \nWe will definitely stay here again, one of the best hotels for space and cleanliness and great staff too, a special mention to Martin, An and Jaquana for making our stay memorable x","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There is construction in the area and all the construction workers park their cars in front of the hotel which made it super inconvenient to check in , drop bags and then go to park the car ( they have no valet).\nAlso , there was one guy at the front desk that was on the phone every time for the 3 days I was there - this was annoying because he never acknowledges you when you are waiting at front - even for a simple 3 second question.\nAlso they told me i could call them when i was ready for a cab , of course I called the front desk to no answer ( the guy was probably on the other line again!). But that was fine cause it was new york and there were multiple cabs a block away at the staten island ferry terminal. \nThe room was good , i got a water view room and even tho its partial view due to buildings , was still nice ( i was on 27th floor).\nCoffee in the room was horrendous as you would expect , and the bathroom has a small leak and very little hooks for towels.

Two of us were coming from Cleveland and the other three from San Diego.  We arrived on June 22nd.  We were all first timers to New York City and were really looking forward to this trip.  We had three criteria that we expected from our hotel: cleanliness, location, and excellent customer service.  The Hilton Garden Inn did not let us down.  The housekeeping staff did an outstanding job of keeping our rooms clean and responded to any needs we had quickly.  The location was fantastic.  A short walk to the waterfront, several excellent restaurants, and the subway.  But, by far and away it was the customer service that went above and beyond.  Always a warm greeting, including a smile and eye contact, and most importantly remembering we were new to this beautiful city. The front desk staff never failed to ask us what we saw, how our day had gone, and what were our plans for the next day.  You may be wondering why, of the three criteria by which we rated our stay, customer service would rise to the top. That is because three of the five of us have over a cumulative 50 years working for Nordstrom, the major U.S. retailer well known for its exceptional customer service.  As a result, customer service holds a special place in our hearts and our expectations.  We especially want to thank the following people: Jaquanna, Ameena, Martin, and Rafael for the level of customer service they delivered and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone considering a trip to NYC.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}
{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":12297961,"title":"Just below the standard 4.5 rating. Roomy for a NYC hotel IMO, but perhaps some post-pandemic things to work on.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-07-07","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"So from my review of another NYC hotel, I wanted to try out another place to see how things compared. Didn't know that next time would be several years and a pandemic later.\n\nThis Hilton Garden Inn was located in a fairly convenient location relative to getting around the city. You are near several different Subway Lines through the South Ferry\/Whitehall St Stations (1, R, W), Bowling Green (4, 5), and if you're willing to take a slightly longer walk, through the Broad St (J) and the Wall\/William St Station (2, 3).\n\nIt's also near a masseuse that I highly recommended in a review I posted just a little while back - which is a plus to unwind all those tight muscles from walking around all day.\n\nBack to the hotel, I had taken a red-eye flight and arrived at the hotel an early Friday morning. The very friendly lady at the front desk confirmed my request for an early check-in, which allowed me to shower off the tiredness of traveling.\n\nYou are given a choice of a City or Water View for a room as an option. I thought that a Water View would not only be a nice view to have in the nighttime, but also some privacy from the high-rises that pepper the city landscape. I even chose a very high floor to increase those chances.\n\nBut when I orientated the room to Google Maps before arriving, it seemed less likely that would be the case. And in fact when I got to my room, there was indeed a view of the water, but also of an office building right across from me. So while it was not wrong that I got a water view, I would say that I was disappointed in the water view I did get - so I personally wouldn't waste the time spending more for a choice of view unless you don't mind it somewhat being obstructed by a building.\n\nBut the room itself was spacious. Much more spacious than the room I got from the other hotel. It had a normal hallway opening to a room much like any other room I would get in a HGI elsewhere. Ample space to get around, the same comfortable bed, a sliding door into the bathroom (which seems to be the thing nowadays), and a proper hot shower available to you. And there were many outlets (though the bedside ones were a bit loose when plugging things in - don't know if that was a feature or something that needs to be fixed.\n\nThe only real gripe I had was with the carpet. Wearing my personal travel hotel slippers, I noticed that (a) there appeared to be an area that was a bit sticky and also noticed a stain or two, and (b) a bobby pin that was against the wall to the bathroom. These weren't enough to warrant pointing it out immediately to the staff who might have someone clean the room, and I particularly didn't really care enough to consider asking for a different room.\n\nI also figured if housekeeping staff is a bit shorthanded and\/or like other hotels don't clean unless asked to or after the customers leave, that that extra day or two of not being able to do maintenance probably makes it harder to get rid of those things. I'd probably say that to counter that to have the carpet steam-cleaned regularly. Perhaps they might already do that and I just caught the tail end of the period. Again, I wouldn't consider it overly dirty or anything, but at the same time something that should be noted for all rooms going forward.\n\nI did not get their breakfast, but I also believe they were having some work being done and the restaurant being closed, but since I wasn't getting breakfast anyways (I wanted to have Dunkin since it's not in my area) I didn't actually catch all of what was said to me.\n\nOverall, it was still a good stay, again would probably recommend deep cleaning the carpet regularly (if they don't already). Would definitely give the hotel another stay. Again, not enough issues to give it a 4 (which as mentioned is more punishing on this scale), but would put it on the lower side of the 4's though if the carpet thing is resolved it would be the normal 4.5 every other hotels have received.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Ich kann hier nur warnen, da wir erst  im Taxi vom Airport zum Hotel davon erfuhren, dass das Hotel unser Zimmer storniert hatte. Ehrlich gesagt, ist mir so ein Gesch\u00e4ftsgebaren noch nie passiert, zumal es sich hier um eine Hilton Tochter handelt. \nIch hatte die USA Reise sehr fr\u00fchzeitig gebucht und meine Kreditkarte, die zu dieser Zeit g\u00fcltig war, hinterlegt. Die Buchungsbedingungen waren als \u201eohne Vor- und -Anzahlung\u201c beschrieben. Zwischenzeitlich hatte ich eine neue Kreditkarte erhalten und das Hotel wollte wohl am Anreisetag meine Kreditkarte, die ich hinterlegt hatte, pr\u00fcfen. Da jedoch die alte Kreditkarte noch im System war und das Hotel somit keinen Zugriff auf die neue Karte hatte, versuchten sie mich zweimal zu erreichen um meine Kreditkartendaten zu aktualisieren, dann, da ich nicht antworten konnte, stornierte das Hotel unser Zimmer eigenm\u00e4chtig.\nWohlgemerkt, wir wurden am Anreisetag kontaktiert, an dem wir fast 9 Stunden im Flieger sa\u00dfen und mindestens 4 Stunden in Flugh\u00e4fen ohne Internet. Wie soll ich da reagieren auf Fragen meine Kreditkarte betreffend, zumal ich Bedingungen ohne An-und Vorauszahlung gew\u00e4hlt hatte. Also w\u00e4re eine Bezahlung eh erst im Hotel n\u00f6tig gewesen. \nSo etwas ist mir noch nie passiert, ich reise in die USA und mein Zimmer wurde eigenm\u00e4chtig storniert, nach etwa 20 Stunden Reisezeit (Transfer, Flugzeit, Wartezeiten an Immigration\u2026)\nMerkw\u00fcrdigerweise war unser Zimmer zwischenzeitlich angeblich  bereits vergeben worden und man konnte uns nur ein kleineres und schlechteres Zimmer zum dreifachen Preis anbieten. Somit haben wir m\u00fcde und ersch\u00f6pft ein anderes Hotel online gesucht und konnten wieder mit dem Taxi zu dem neuen Hotel fahren, das wir gl\u00fccklicherweise so kurzfristig buchen konnten.\nDer f\u00fcr die Stornierung Verantwortliche wurde zudem sehr unh\u00f6flich und frech und meinte, wir sollten doch bei booking.com anrufen und den Vorgang melden. Zu bemerken ist, dass es zu dieser Zeit bereits nach Mitternacht in Europa war. \nUnser Urlaub fing also sehr schlecht an, zumal ich auch noch Telefonkosten von nahezu 100\u20ac hatte, da ich vor Aufregung wegen der Stornierung versucht hatte bei der Hotline des Hotels anzurufen und ewig lange in einer Warteschleife hing.\nIch kann nur  vor diesem Hotel und dessen Gesch\u00e4ftgebaren warnen, schade f\u00fcr unseren Urlaub.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The room also has curtains that don't meet in the middle - they give you a blind, but put in curtains just at the side, which is odd. The bathroom basin tap is completely\u00a0loose, like just sitting on the surface, 100% loose (dangerous from a flood POV \/ I'll report it, but it's\u00a0odd no one else did before me) ! The fan makes an unpleasant noise too.\u00a0I knew that the restaurant\u00a0probably wasn't going to be operational - It's a shame though, as it draws one, to feel more at home and looked after, when you meet for a meal with everyone there.\u00a0There is a good \u00a0'whole foods' style store, a 5-10 min walk away - go east up Water Street. Bizarre that the desk didn't all know this, now I've taught\u00a0them where to advise, for the future.\nI stayed in an outstanding\u00a0Hilton Garden inn, in Tangiers, Morocco\u00a0(several times) - this was not as good as that. No double rain shower, or amazing menu room service, generally not as smart. In a tall building\u00a0where it can be cold and very windy in winter, this place needs the windows sorting out.\nThe guy at the desk said that the room would be cleaned in the afternoons, it was not. He also said he'd ring to check if the room was ok, but he did not.\nFor such a short street at the back, that my room overlooked, I've NEVER heard so much noise from 1 small street - ENDLESS beeping from deliveries, garbage trucks, construction\u00a0trucks - its like ALL of New York's trucks with their reversing beeping on, crashing and banging. Ludicrous - starting early in the morning. Unless you're\u00a0planning to be up very early, then you won't be allowed to sleep on.\nI asked\u00a0for my room to be cleaned on the second last day. He said 'no problem, I'll get someone to do it this afternoon\". I came back in the evening and it hadn't been touched. Went to ask for more toilet paper, as its the one thing I needed -although the overflowing bins needed emptying too really, and another towel, as the shower surround leaks, so I have to mop up after a shower and they don't dry in time, by the time one returns\u00a0for another shower.\nHe let me check out at 2pm, which\u00a0was nice, as my departure from NY by train wasn't until 3.40.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"NONE"}

The NYC Subway system can get you anywhere you want to go in the city! Just tap your credit card to enter--so easy! 2 subway stations (South Ferry and Whitehall) are literally across the street; other subway lines are within short walks. Staten Island Ferry is across the street, and NYC Ferry lines (South Street Seaport) are a short walk away. One subway ride to and from Penn Station if you are using Amtrak or other long-distance train service.\n\nI requested a room on a high floor with a nice view, and they accommodated my request.  Of course, being in the Financial District, most views are of high-rise office buildings.  But I could see some decent views of Brooklyn, Governors Island, and the SI Ferry.\n\nThe room was very clean and modern. Large windows to look out over the city. They made efficient use of the small space. Comfortable king bed. Multiple electrical outlets to charge devices.  I made use of the mini-fridge (Buy your drinks at the Walgreens nearby). I was very happy to have a walk-in shower, as I am not a fan of tub\/shower combos.  I believe it is because it's a newer hotel; most older hotels only have the tub\/shower combos.\n\nI was disappointed that the restaurant is not open, but there are many other food options nearby, for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Both fast food, fast-casual and sit-down restaurants.  All kinds, including mexican, salad, indian, italian, bagels, burgers, etc.\n\nElevators were fast and efficient, and never a problem during my stay, and I was almost on the top floor.\n\nThey made it clear when I checked-in that there was no housekeeping service; fresh towels and other supplies can be requested from the front desk. If I wanted my room cleaned, I had to give them 24 hours notice. Not my preference, but this seems to be the way all hotels are going, even after the pandemic period.\n\nAll hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  I know that they are short-staffed, and probably over-worked.  I made a point to greet them and say hello every time I entered or left the hotel.\n\nI will consider this hotel again on future stays in New York City, depending on the price.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":12297961,"title":"Family Vacation","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-07-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"This is a review of our stay in NYC for out hotel & for Booking.com. \nMy name is Sonja & I traveled to NYC with my two son\u2019s ages 17 & 20. This was our family vacation. I booked our hotel with Booking.com on March 18, 2021. I read the reviews & viewed the rooms & did a google search of the surrounding areas & decided we would stay here. \n\nHere is my overall review & opinion of our stay. \n\nHotel Lobby: the lobby is just beautiful. The d\u00e9cor & the seating area are all very plush & comfortable. If you need to get out of your room for some fresh air, to relax or read a book you can do so in the lobby. The lighting is perfect, it is clean & the hotel smells so good. The staff is . . . . . . WONDERFUL\u2026I will get to them shortly. \nSurrounding areas: you can catch the M55, M15, M20, the subway, site tour buses, eat at the many street vendors & purchase souvenirs. The hotel is located across the street from the Staten Island Ferry; you have access to several subway connections & buses. There are many restaurants around each corner, a Chipotle a few blocks down, (a good deli sandwich place) around the corner called Potbelly & a host of other eateries. If you are feeling sick & need some medicine there is Walgreens (they are called Duane Reade) in NYC but there is one around the corner. There is a park across the street & a waterfront. You cannot go wrong staying here. PERFECT location. \n\nRooms: Our room was located on the 25th floor & the view\u2026\u2026.AMAZEBALLS\u2026\u2026AMAZING\u2026\u2026so beautiful. The rooms were very clean & equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker & a safe. They have blackout curtains if you want the room dark. There is an iron, ironing board, blow dryer hangers & a desk with a desk lamp. They have free Wi-Fi & cable & I almost forgot to mention, the fridge is cold & our drinks were ice cold. The linens are so beautiful & high quality. The pillows\u2026..I felt like I was in heaven (LOL) they were so plush & comfortable. I told my son\u2019s I need to find out where they got these pillows & sheets & blankets so I can purchase some myself. They had these green blankets in case you needed extra cover & my 17 year old slept wrapped up in that blanket the whole seven days. He kept saying, mom please ask if we can buy get one of these because I need one of these. Therefore, since he kept saying how wonderful it was I asked for another one & my 20 year old said the same thing. They were in sleep heaven\u2026..I even took a nap & wrapped myself in one. Love those covers. Overall, they have top notch, high quality bedding & it will not make you itch & it is definitely not cheap. You can tell Hilton prides itself on making sure the guest sleep well.  My favorite thing was the bed. I slept like a baby. \n\nBathroom: There is a light around the entire bathroom mirror that I just love. I need one of those in my bathroom & it allows you to see your makeup very well. In addition, the bathtub is was my other favorite, I love taking a bath & I took a bath almost every night. There is no stopper so I just used a towel to keep the water in. The tub is long enough so that my feet did not even touch the other end & it is wide enough so that you are comfortable. I loved the tub. The water stays hot & we all showered twice a day & the hot water never ran out. NYC is very humid & you are going to want to shower when you return. The bathroom is very spacious. I love the lighting\u2026\u2026\nStaff Review:\nImran: So a few days before we were to travel, I messaged the hotel using the booking.com app & Imran replied to me. I was somewhat surprised, as I was not expecting to get receive the kind of customer service. I asked for directions to the hotel from LaGuardia airport & what bus or shuttle to take. He explained by messages how to get there, what bus & subway to take & was so nice & kind & I could tell through the messages that I chose the best hotel. Imran was also the person that checked us in. He was so pleasant, assisted us with a smile & told us how to use the key card, about their snacks that you can purchase & add to your room & how to enter after 11Pm. He was just a delight & so nice. Imran exemplified excellent customer service in person & by message. \n\nNikko: Always said hello, have a good day, he chatted with my son who vlogs, always assisting & doing so with a smile. I am big on customer service and I definitely received it here. Nikko, helped us & gave us the best directions back to LaGuardia, as we did not want to use the subway. It was hot that day & we wanted to use the bus only. He took his time looking up the directions & we got there without any delays thanks to Nikko. We had an adventure every day & each day we left, he greeted us with a smile & told us to have a good day. He is just an overall nice, kind person. \n\nAndres: He is one the houseman & whenever we needed towels or extra toilet tissue he provided would bring them to out room. He always did so with a smile. There was three of us & he brought a set of two towels once, & I told him we need one more & he brought it right up. Such a nice sweet young man. Good service & always provided with smile & always asked was there anything else we needed. Great service. \n\nRafael: This hotel was so clean like a said in the beginning. I decided to sit in the lobby one night & eat my dinner & I saw Rafael, cleaning & sanitizing everything. All the local places guest touch. He kept the place clean & I waved hello to him & he waived back with a smile. Everyone here is just so pleasant & I attribute that to Hilton. Again, a very nice young man & while he was cleaning I asked if I could sit & he nodded yes. I sat in the lobby for an hour or so, it was quiet & so clean. Like I stated earlier the hotel smells so good & is so clean. \n\nMartin: Finally, if you need help bringing up bags or any other kind of assistance you can ask Martin. Always there to assist in any way. \n\nFinal thoughts: If you are planning to travel to NYC stay at the Hilton Garden Inn NYC Financial Center\/Manhattan Downtown located at 6 Waters Street, New York, NY 10004. I promise you will not be disappointed. The next time we are in NYC, we will stay here & anytime I take a vacation I plan to stay at a Hilton Hotel. This is by far the best hotel that I have ever stayed, but it will not be my last. Lastly, I booked our hotel using Booking.com & I always use them when I travel. As they do not charge your card ahead of time which I prefer. This was such a fun vacation & we had a blast. Thank you to all the staff. \n\n*Please excuse any typos\u2026I have on nails\u2026thank you.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

I spent five weeks of those eight weeks at the Hilton Garden Inn financial center location. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there. \n\nI stayed in a king room for the first few weeks and then I moved to a double room when a member of my family came to visit. Both rooms were great, standard hotel rooms. My only suggestion of how to make the rooms better, is the closet. The bar in the closet faces front to back, instead of side to side. It was not at all easily accessible. But since I was staying there for so long, I ended up buying a little clothing rack off of Amazon and putting it in my room so that worked out fine. \n\nThe front desk personnel were very kind and helpful. I had a lot of packages coming to me from family and friends and they always were quick to let me know when something had arrived. They also had many nurses to deal with during this time and I think they did a great job of finding ways to help during this extremely stressful time. \n\nThe location of this hotel was great. You can see the Staten Island Ferry Directly across the street. There are several subway lines within 1 to 2 blocks. There is a city bike dock location less than half a block away. It\u2019s a two block walk to the bike trail that goes all the way up the east side. It\u2019s about 1 1\/2 blocks to battery Park. I really love this area. It\u2019s also easily accessible to the FDR and the W. Side Highway, depending on which way you are driving. But definitely no need to drive here, there is so much available through public transportation.\n\nI would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New York. I know this area is not normally thought of as where you would stay if you were coming for a tourist visit, but because of the easy access to trains that run of the east side of the island and the west side, it\u2019s actually a very accessible location. I will be staying there again.","travelDate":"2020-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

But most importantly (and this is why it wins out over the other Hiltons I stayed at) the staff. We didn't feel like we were an imposition to them.

The closet was super tiny, too small for two people even if it was only for a weekend. BUT, we did not have many things and honestly the view and the service outshined that space. The room was extremely clean. The bathroom was as well. And I am PICKY with the cleanliness of sheets and bathrooms to the point that I ALWAYS bring my own towel, pillowcase, and shower shoes. I felt comfortable, clean, and as though I could step everywhere with my bare feet. \n\nI gave it a 4 because it was pricy to book and the space was small, there was no mini-bar in the room, and the menu prices were a bit over the top, BUT, I would return to this hotel again and probably will.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

That felt so good! She made me feel right at home. I had dinner there most nights so I got to see Anna and fellow bartender Matthew in action.

The hotel is quite modern yet homey.  My guest room, although modest in terms of square feet, was spacious by NYC standards.  The bathroom was bright and very functional with good water pressure and temperature.  The living area included a lounge chair, a desk with an ergonomic chair, and a very comfy bed.  The closet was rather small requiring me to relocate the ironing board to fit all my dress clothes.  The dresser space is also limited.  However, the room had a mini fridge, microwave, and safe.\n\nThe lobby is surprisingly inviting.  In the morning, there is a station with coffee and teas.  During the day, you will find two drink dispensers containing fruit-infused water such as kiwi and mango.\n\nHilton Honors members get vouchers for complimentary breakfasts.  Make sure you stop by reception even if you check in yourself and use the Digital Key program.  I really enjoyed the made-to-order items like the avocado toast topped with fried eggs and the frittata with truffle shaving.  On various days, I noticed blueberry pancakes, a garden vegetable omelet, and even oeufs cocotte on the menu.  The weekend cafe staff is very laid back.  During the week, the cafe adopts the more business-like aura of the clientele by including visits to your table by the manager.\n\nA few shout outs to staff members:  Thank you Ms. Lee at the front desk for getting me a room with a nice view, helping me navigate the pantry (convenience store), and going above-and-beyond on at least one occasion.  Also, Rafael was a joy.  Keep smiling!  Also, housekeeping nailed it.\n\nThe hotel is located at the lower tip of Manhattan.  Tip: Tell your taxi driver to take FDR Drive South to the Staten Island Ferry exit.  For those opting for public transportation, the last stop of the 1 train (which stops at Penn Station, Times Square, and popular areas of the Upper West Side) is a block from the hotel entrance.  South Ferry subway station is unmanned.  If you are not familiar with the area, you will feel safer at night with a ride share.\n\nIn spite of the warnings about construction outside the hotel, there were no noise issues.  There was just a slight diversion as you approach the entrance.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend the hotel for location, value, and comfort.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Rooms were also very clean and when we called for someone to reset the safe they assisted promptly.\nUnfortunately our experience with the breakfast facilities and service on the last day was extremely disappointing.  It was busy when we arrived but as it was during the middle of the time the restaurant was open this was expected.\nHowever, there were no plates on the breakfast bar so I had to ask for some, I then had to ask for cutlery as there was not any laid out on the table but gave up waiting so had to go and find our own. We ended up getting our own coffee and had to go and get milk from the cereal area.  We don't have a problem with getting our own things, but this is not how this restaurant is set up.\nOn a Sunday they apparently don't offer sausages and the other two ready cooked items of potatoes and scrambled eggs had basically ran out, so we ordered an omelette each.  My husband waited that long for his he had to go and ask the chef where his omelette was only to be told it had already been sent out - don't know who got his order but the waiter\/waitress had obviously given it to the wrong person even though we'd got the numbers on our table.  He had to re-order and wait again!  \nOn the fruit bar, apart from a couple of chunks that had been dropped around the edges the pineapple box was empty.  The melon was still available but I would have expected the pineapple to be replenished as the breakfast sitting was only part way through - only a tiny niggle, but I like pineapple.\nSome of the tables were left \"dirty\" for quite a while before they were cleared for the next guests.\nI did try to \"complain\" about this via the reception lady but she was very dismissive of me.\nHowever, because of everything else that was good I would use this hotel again. Also at night time it is rather quiet, it is at the end of town (obviously if you're planning on staying here you can see that) and the main road is positioned around the edge of town so you can't hear the traffic on it.\n","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

I definitely enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The price per night was very cheap for NY standards, but that was mainly due to staying there off-season. \n\nParticularly the location of the hotel is very good, very close to the South Ferry terminal. Multiple stops of the underground are within walking distance (1, R, ...), so you can get everywhere in Manhattan within 30 minutes. Multiple restaurants and shops\/supermarkets can be found very close to the hotel. Only disadvantage is that a few of these are closed in the weekend, or only open later in the morning. Another thing to mention, is that the staff is very friendly and helpful, particularly Martin. \n\nRegarding the hotel room (which is of course the most important): the room was not very big, as could be expected in New York. But it was ok for a few days, the size did not bother me. Beds were very comfortable, and bathroom was also top. The curtains blocked the outside light very well, which is often not the case in other hotels. The bathroom has all the amenities one needs, and there were enough towels available (+ good quality). The water pressure could be maybe a little bit stronger, but again this did not bother me at all. Only negative point, hence the overall rating of 4 stars instead of 5, was that the room was quite noisy due to the airconditioning just outside the hotel. So one might want to avoid staying in room 605, definitely if you are a light sleeper.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Far from the action in midtown, without the hasstle of crowds,  was a great decision. Just in front of Staten Island Ferry, Subway lines 1, W, R and a five minutes walk to 4 and 5 lines, it was a great spot. Also backwards was Wall Street, to the left South Seaport District and to the front the sidewalk to the river with an incredible view to Brooklyn Bridge. Near the area, there's a lot of Taverns with great ambiance and food. We use all time the Subway to go Midtown and Uptown visiting places and friends. We've been several times in New York. Always stay in a different place and area.\nThis is one of the best hotels we've stayed in NYC. Why? The staff was wonderful, always with a smile; a good morning, good afternoon and good evening. The smile was part of their uniform. I don't know who was the manager, all looked like working as they were. They were very comprehensive, because the vacation became a so so, not fault of the Hotel; in Puerto Rico happened an earthquake in those days, with all our family there. We start to worry and thought to go back as soon as possible.\nBut, by phone, reach our family and all was alright. We decide to stay but we had mixed feelings. The staff made all possible things for having a pleasant stay. They have coin washer machines and washed all of our clothes. We rest and slept until late but the maid in charge of 11 floor (a nice blond woman that can't took her name), always was checking we were fine.

I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone that plans on visiting NYC for any reason especially if you plan on going with your family because the location is away from the crowded streets and is probably the safest part of Manhattan... But the subway station is directly across the street which is where the #1 & #2 train run which will take you anywhere in Manhattan that you need to go because it runs from the tip of the financial district all the way to the north end of the island. So if you want to go to the World Trade Center it\u2019s about a 5 minute ride in the train, Times Square is about 15 minutes, and Central Park is about 20 minutes. Which the #2 or #1 train will take you right too it. Also all the ferries that take you too Eli\u2019s island or Statue of Liberty or both are directly across the street as well... and there is helicopter ride to it as well across the street and pier 17 which is walking distance from the room too has ice skating on a roof top with an amazing view above like 4 floors of restaurants and bars.. You can also see the Brooklyn bridge right from your room and if you walk across it you will have the best pizza or Philly cheese steaks in NYC. If you plan on going to NYC anytime soon this is a must stay location. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the best affordable hotel in Manhattan!! I stayed at the Michelangelo right in Times Square for $1,000 a night and didn\u2019t even get a quilt to sleep with..! I barely paid that for 4 nights at the Hilton and it was very peaceful there!! I liked it because it was in a very nice part of town without thousands of people everywhere but if you wanted to go to Times Square to party it was only a 15 minute ride on the train which was directly across the street..! Then when you were ready to get some rest this hotel was nice and quiet so you wouldn\u2019t have any issues getting rest!! Next time I go I will stay here my entire stay and save a ton of money in comfort!!!!

The hotel staff was wonderful and accommodating our needs, which included connecting rooms and storing our luggage on the day of departure while we visited the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.

Our room at the Hilton Garden Inn at the Financial Center in January was smaller than we had experienced elsewhere, but the positives far surpassed the few negatives. To begin with, the door entry uses an easy touch card instead of a slot.  I loved the ingenuity of the bathroom barn door, leaving lots of space in the bathroom and the hall.  The large shower and the very quiet toilet flush were a bonus, along with the nearly soundless HVAC which was quickly responsive when changing the temperature.  We arrived having walked in the cold for a while, and I was ready for a nice hot tea.  Unfortunately, the coffeemaker did not respond.  I went to the restaurant and An fixed a lovely tray with pot, cup and saucer to take to our room.  As always, the staff was friendly and eager to assist, especially Kelvis and Abdel.  The only hitch was the wardrobe:  just big enough for our two winter coats, but the handles were very difficult to grasp to open the doors (see photo).  All in all, we enjoyed our weekend, and grew to love the neighborhood restaurants and shops.  Surprises were the Bowne & Co.

A negotiated rate with our corporate HQ around the corner makes this a smart choice. Rooms are typically sized for New York, with furnishings in good condition. The basement gym is also consistent with the HGI brand, while breakfast was served with a smile by Efe and her colleagues. It seems rooms on the front have noisier PTAC heating and air conditioning units, while ones one the back have quieter VTAC ones. I chose rear-facing rooms ending in 01 and 09, since a restful sleep is worth more to me than a semi-obstructed water view.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Could have been easily fix by air freshener. When I got in the small fridge was left open, all the drawers were left open, as if the cleaning crew forgot to closed them when they were cleaning, strange. No big deal since the room was clean, but the stale smell took way from the room cleanliness. The TV didn't turn on when I wanted to see the news about hurricane Dorian hitting FL. Not a big deal, but for a $277.75 per night room, you expect a working tv and clean smelling room. The other problem when the 1st room they gave my with the king bed I reserved smelled like cigarettes , so they moved me to another room with twin beds with the stale odor I mentioned above.

The property is far superior to the other hotels nearby - trust me, I have stayed in them all! The hotel is newer or recently refreshed which is great! Rooms are spacious and clean, and the the front desk staff are super nice and accommodating. Best part of staying here for me though are Matt and Willie in the restaurant. I am frequently at my client 10+ hour days, and so I usually arrive right before they close. Some places give you attitude for coming in late, but my server Matt is always smiling and always takes great care of me. The chef Willie also never grumbles about staying late and makes some seriously delicious food. When I am working in this part of NYC, I will not stay anywhere else!

There are a handful of really awesome options that you don't normally find at your standard hotel breakfast. My personal favorite is the Huevos Rancheros. It is consistently delicious every day of the week and you can even specify how spicy you want it. If you get the chance, talk to Elbert - the head of dining at the hotel - to describe to you what he puts into the sauces. It is evident that food is his passion and it really shows in the quality of the food. Even the presentation of the food is exceptional, making for an awesome experience.

Our flight into Newark was delayed several hours and then the subsequent train rides from there to the South Street area took a while. The woman who checked us in at 3 a.m. was very friendly. It turned out our room had the ice machine located right outside. As we were trying to finally get to sleep, others were starting their days early and getting ice. When we got up a few hours later, my husband went to the front desk while I was getting ready and asked about moving rooms because we didn't want to listen to the ice machine for the next five nights and our TV wasn't working. Imram, the manager he spoke with, was apologetic and said they would get us moved if we didn't mind storing our luggage while another room was cleaned. We were thrilled they would be able to move us, so packing up was not an issue.\n\nWhen we got back that day, we had a new room on a floor without an ice machine and still the amazing view of the East River and the Staten Island Ferry terminal. Within minutes of settling in, Gabrielle stopped by to make sure we were happy with our new room and offered us complimentary hot breakfast for the inconvenience. It was so nice to have staff who genuinely cared about our satisfaction!\n\nThe rest of our stay went very well and we didn't have any other issues. We only did breakfast the one morning it was complimentary. It was $17 for continental and $23 for hot breakfast, otherwise. The offerings were good--pastries, fresh fruit, made-to-order omelets and so much more. \n\nThe location is very convenient for tourists and business travelers. There are two subway lines right there and the Staten Island Ferry. It's a short walk to Battery Park to get on the Statue of Liberty\/Ellis Island ferry, and the Wall Street Bull is a couple of blocks away. There are lots of historical places in the area as well. There were also a fair number of places to dine in the area.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were assigned to Rm 2703 and given 2 rooms keys .  My husband had a question for the front desk staff so I gave him one key and went up to the room with our luggage.  The room key I was given did not work and since there were 2 house keeping staff, Navidad and another lady cleaning Room 2704, I asked if they can use their master key to help open my door.  They tried my key and confirmed that it was not working and said they had to call their manager.

Enjoyed a post work steak and wine dinner and did not want to travel home late hence had booked this overnight stay.\nThe hotel is not quite 2 years old and maintains a \u201cfresh\u201d appearance. I was greeted at the front desk by a most professional and classy hotel manager who made the check-in process effortless. Had booked a \u201croom with a view\u201d which placed me on the 23rd floor. Hallways are clean, nicely lit with plush carpet. A king size bed sat on the back wall of the room with a large window looking outside by the furthest side of the room. When lying on the bed you face a narrow corner \u201carmoire\u201d on your right side and moving left a desk and chair which attached to a modular dresser holding 2 small top to bottom  drawers and a cabinet holding an in-room safe and mini fridge.\nI could not use the safe as one compartment for the 4 AAA batteries was broke however this was a minor inconvenience. At the end of this combination modular desk and dresser sat a Keurig coffee machine and 2 bottles of water each holding a tag listing $3.00 cost.The tiled bathroom was well constructed and contained a sizable shower with thick (lucite ?) sliding doors, a wall sized vanity with a large mirror hung above and Neutrogena toiletries on the counter-top. I will say bathroom lighting was not bright enough for my needs however the shower provided ample water flow and water as hot as you like.\nThe mattress, sheets, pillows, etc were quite comfortable and the in-room thermostat worked well to provide occupants temperatures to their liking.\nAll in all a pleasant stay however I deducted a star for the undersized armoire, lack of free bottled water, inoperable safe and poor bathroom lighting.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

The front desk staff were super friendly and always greeted me with a \"hello\" and a smile when I walked by. The bartender was also very friendly and I enjoyed my conversation with him. I liked that he was attentive to other guests as they walked in without being rude to  me or them. I did think that the breakfast was too expensive at $23.99 so I went out and got some eggs and fruit somewhere else to eat in my room. I realized that I didn't have any salt\/pepper so I stopped in the restaurant to see if they had little packages and the manager was very accommodating (I was waiting for him to tell me to get lost since I had another restaurant's food in my hand).\nThe BIG deal came though after I had returned home I discovered I left something very important for work at the hotel. I called and spoke with Imran who personally walked two blocks to FedEx and had it shipped to me. HE SAVED MY BUTT! Not only did he save me but he was super nice the whole time we were trying to figure out what to do. Not once did he make me feel like I was inconveniencing him (which I was). \nThe room was clean and comfortable but honestly, I'd sleep in a cardboard box under a bridge if it had service like this!

I was very dissatisfied with the guest services and I strongly discourage anyone needing a hotel in NYC (especially FiDi\/ lower Manhattan) from staying here.\n\n \n\nTo preface this review and to save others from a headache, I am a Hilton Honors member and have stayed at the DoubleTree by Hilton in FiDi (5 minutes away) and the Hilton Garden Inn in Long Island City. Both of these are excellent alternatives\/ substitutes to Hilton Garden Inn Financial District.\n\n \n\nMy main issue with this Hilton was that guest services just plainly did not carry out any of our requests, all of which were reasonable requests that every and any hotel, no matter the caliber or price point, should provide in exchange for our payment. On three separate occasions, we had to wait over 30 minutes for them to bring up random toiletries that we requested (e.g., toothpaste, shampoo, shaving kit). Every time, without fail, the employee would bring the wrong item which meant we had to wait an additional 15 minutes for him to go back and bring us the correct item.\n\n \n\nAnother major inconvenience was when we requested to have our room cleaned in the 2-hour morning period of 9:30 am to 11:30 am when we knew we would be out of the room. We called housekeeping and they said they would send someone right away. When we left our room, there was a maid cart right outside of our door and the employee staff even made eye contact with us as we departed. Of course, when we returned 2.5 hours later, nobody had cleaned our room. When we called down to the front desk, they offered no explanation for this slip up and noted that they had indeed received a request from us (they even showed it to us on the call log) but they could not offer any explanation for why the ball was completely dropped. No apology or even acknowledgement of the inconveniences caused from the front desk manager either. Instead, they offered to send up toiletries and towels which again took 30 minutes and the toiletries sent up were not the ones we requested either.\n\n \n\nOn our last night, we had a pile up of garbage in our room because housekeeping neglected to clean our room. We had a huge carton of trash including food to throw out. I knew better by the final night not to bother calling guest services, so I walked around the entire floor looking for a trash chute. Since I could not find one, I then called downstairs asking for assistance in picking up the garbage. ","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Good selection of Neutrogena products aswell. \nWe only had breakfast the 1st morning, was a bit pricey but the choice is very good, the chef even cooked me a fresh egg benedicts which was out of this world, would reccomend at least once. My wife can be fussy and had nothing but praise.\nThere is fresh takaway coffee, papers etc in the lobby every morning.

This hotel is also right across the street from the South Ferry (think free views of the statue of liberty) and near good breakfast and Financial District restaurant options.  My guidance to anyone wanting to visit NYC is to forget paying $250+ to stay in mid-to-upper Manhattan and stay at this hotel in the Financial District and take the subway (We purchased the 5 day unlimited pass.).

Check in with Lee was very welcoming.\nThe hotel is modern with speedy elevators to all 29 floors.  There is a restaurant on the second floor, but the food is kind of expensive.

This is good, because the hotel is less expensive than Times Square hotels. There was a group of us in several rooms, but sorting out final bills was a bit of a hassle. \nRooms are modern, but very compact,  There is just enough room for what you need in a hotel room, although there was not a closet in my room, just a tiny wardrobe with room for one person's clothes.  Good luck finding a place to put your suitcase.  Had some trouble getting the room temperature to be comfortable.

Hotel itself is just fine, not over the top but not leaving us wanting for anything either. It even has a bar but we didn't avail ourselves to it. The main reason I selected this hotel (other than getting Hilton points) was its proximity to Battery Park. We booked the first ferry out to the Statue of Liberty\/Ellis Island and the fact that the hotel was a 5 minute walk allowed a leisurely Saturday morning. Also, access to NYC subways is dramatically simplified by the fact that most lines (4\/5 and 1\/2\/3) begin & end or pass thru the Battery. I took advantage of the valet parking service offered at the hotel ($100 for 48hrs) and we had really nice breakfast in the hotel restaurant. If your looking for a nice NYC pub, try the Whitehorse Tavern just a block or so away.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We traveled from Newark Airport with the NJ Train and then metro, I would say it took in total about 1 hour. We arrived at South Ferry Station, which is a 2 min walk to the Hotel. We were allowed to check in at 1pm as our room was ready. Staff were always friendly, greeting you on the way in and out of the hotel. On our last day, they kept our luggage for us after check out as we had an evening flight.\n\nThe room was quite large in comparison to what I expected. King size bed with city view, mini fridge, microwave, safe, cupboard with iron and ironing board, good size tv, coffee machine with coffee\/tea supplies, massive pillows, neutrogena toiletries and clean white towels, plenty of space for our luggage and we forgot to bring an adaptor plug, but didnt need it as the room had usb points for our chargers. The room exceeded basic needs. \n\nThe location was great, we walked to the Statue of Liberty ticket desks and were across the road from the Staten Island Ferry, we did not eat at the Hotel, as it was cheaper to eat outside. It was very easy to reach many attractions via metro, we brought the 7 day metro card and caught the train from South Ferry Station every time. \n\nOverall the location, size of the room and facilities available are brilliant for the price you pay, you get more than what you pay for.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"NONE"}
