Incredible poor service and no interest to help us with new room or any compensation. Was promised 100 USD for the food we had to throw away, but even after 1 month we have not received it. What kind of service\/support is this?. We have sent complain by mail\/telephone and we wrote down all things that was wrong when we was there. We had mould inside our refrigerator then you sent up somebody to clean it when we told you. Coffee machine was out of order, it was replaced, missing the remote control and you came up with a new one. But 5 days without kitchen and no compensation. Unbelievable after traveling properly 20 times in the US this was the worst customer support we have experienced. The worst was that we vere honest and respectful with you and not even trying to understand us or help us.

From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out, we were treated with a friendly, professional manner. Flavia checked us in quickly. Our room was not huge, but plenty of room for 2 people who planned to eat most meals out anyway. Fully stocked kitchen complete with full size toaster, microwave, and dishwasher. \n\nWithin an hour we discovered that our air conditioning wasn't working well. An engineer responded quickly and everything was fixed to our satisfaction. \n\nAnd free ice cream in the lobby on Sunday! What a surprise! It was a great and unexpected treat. Jamie was right, it's never too cold for ice cream! \n\nA friendly bellman helped us with subway info and we were able to navigate almost like locals. Tip: you access the 57th Street station on 55th. LOL\n\nThey advertise free American breakfast buffet, and trust me, it is huge! 4 or 5 hot options, salads, lunch meat, granola bars, cereals, yogurts, \npastries, breads, fruit, juices. \n\nCheckout was also a breeze. I rang for a bellman and for my car from the valet service at 10:40. A very pleasant bellman showed up 7 minutes later. We had a TON of bags as we were visiting for a race weekend. Athletes don't pack light, ha ha.  We were in the car and pulling away before 11:00. \n\nWe will definitely stay here again, assuming the NY Road Runners pulls my daughter's name for the marathon lottery!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

One minor thing was I didn\u2019t have toiletries in the room when I arrived (no hand soap) so I had to call down to get some, and they were very prompt in bringing them up. However, the room itself has seen better days. There was a chunk of carpet missing right next to the tile of the kitchenette and the solution there was a piece of duct tape with strings from the frayed carpet hanging out. There\u2019s a liner\/bedskirt around the box spring of the mattress that is flaking off and missing chunks of the blue color in some places. The mattress is obviously old and had massive indentations and squeaked when getting into bed. The pillows and bedding smelled old and like thousands of people had slept on them without being washed\/replaced, upon arrival there was hair in the shower, on top of the duvet and also on the arm chair by the window, there were stains all over the carpet - one particularly gross one that was right next to the bed and sticky - and there was an old French fry underneath the night stand next to the bed. Additionally, the shower head was spewing water every direction and the shower liner and curtain were obviously dirty - one stain looked like it was dried blood.

Just a personal preference, I respond better to bright and airy environments.\n\nThe hotel room - a studio with a city view, has a cute boutique feel. The kitchen has a fridge and microwave which is great for microwaving leftover NYC pizza. The location is ideal if you are in town to watch a Broadway show. Walk in one direction for Times Square and the other direction for Central Park. \n\nWe chose this hotel because it was the best priced and located hotel from the Marriott Bonvoy chain in the Manhattan area.

As essentially novice NYC tourists,  I debated a lot about where in Manhattan to stay. We are Bonvoy members, so I narrowed it down to Marriott family properties. The positive reviews and amenities won me over for the Residence Inn. It was also appealing that it wasn't completely in Times Square.  It's conveniently located on 54th right off Broadway,about 5 blocks south of Columbus Circle and Central Park, and about 5 blocks north of Times Square. I'm not sure why they use Central Park in the name, it's really more Midtown. Upon our arrival, the valet took care of our vehicle quickly. I felt $60 a day for valet parking was pretty reasonable.  I had requested a high up floor when I made the reservation,  and we were placed on the 62nd floor. What a view! It's the tallest hotel in North America with 65 floors. Our room had a full size bed and a twin. The full size seemed even smaller than a typical full. Other than that, the room was really nice and had everything we needed. It was clean and aesthetically pleasing too. We had cleaning services daily with all toiletries restocked. The little kitchenette was very nice to have, but we ended up not using it as much as I thought we would.  We were not in the room much, breakfast was included and we ate dinner out each night. The breakfast buffet was a highlight.  Very well stocked with food, plates, utensils,  everything you could need. There's a huge area to eat in with many tables and chairs.  It wasn't at all what I imagined. They had a bar that also served starbucks drinks in the morning.  They also served really good quick bites in the evening- we ate there one night when our other dinner plans fell through.  Lots of friendly employees around.  The lobby was also very nice and well staffed - and on parade day they had baskets of complimentary hand warmers and a kind gentleman serving up hot cocoa! Delightful! It was a pricey stay but very much in line with prevailing rates at comparable properties in the vicinity.  I would definitely stay here again!","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I don\u2019t normally stay in midtown, but this was one of the only options left on a night of multiple flight cancellations during the US Open and Fashion Week.\n\nCheckin was wonderful.  Fast, courteous.  More than courteous.  They even provided me with a bottle of wine because of what I had been through.  It really made a bad night a little better and made me feel appreciated as an ambassador.\n\nBecause of the lack of availability, I had a \u201cfamily\u201d studio with a double and twin bed.  Bed is comfortable.  Decent linens.  And usually when I stay at a Residence Inn or a three star Marriott property, I would never consider using the tub.  The tub here is spotless!  I was really impressed!  I plan on soaking in it tomorrow.\n\nPlenty of drawers, closet space, storage.  The kitchen isn\u2019t a full suite like many Residence Inn properties, but it\u2019s very functional, efficient, and sleek.  There is a small dual fridge\/freezer, a dishwasher, a microwave, and a cabinet of dishes.\n\nAirflow\/temperature regulation is good.  Plenty of lighting to meet whatever wishes you have\u2014lamps galore in all parts of the room.\n\nMy room had a nice city view.  Windows insulated well and keeps the noise out.

Near Times Square and Broadway and a lot of tourist attractions.\n\nI\u2019m not a midtown girl, but this is a nice, clean, comfortable spot, especially for families and groups who want to do the tourist thing.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

We were nervous after reading negative reviews but really can't understand what reviewers were complaining about as that was not our experience at all.  As 3 females travelling we always felt safe here - Central Park was 10 minutes one way and Times Square was 10 minutes the other way, it's a perfect location.  We loved the view from our room at night time when New York was all lit up.  Our room was spacious with a big bathroom, always well stocked with plenty of towels and toiletries.  The little kitchenette was very handy when we bought drinks and groceries, or took boxes up from breakfast.  Talking of breakfast this was fantastic - a huge room with plenty of seating and a massive array of fresh food always being restocked by the plenty of staff milling around answering any queries and cleaning up.  There was a gentleman who was always clearing away tables and emptying the bins and was friendly and helpful.  He obviously loved little kids and would pay special attention  to families who were juggling their kids while also trying to have breakfast.  A couple of times we saw him produce a packaged cookie from his back pocket to give to a little one and their little faces lit up and the parents were always so pleased that someone was paying attention to their kids - we thought this was lovely and such a personal touch.  We've read other reviews that the breakfast room was too small with a limited range but that is not the case at all - it was brilliant - best of all they provide boxes so that you can take foodstuffs away with you which we did all the time and could then store in our in room fridge.  We never saw the cleaners but they did an amazing job and twice they did our washing up!  We never had that before and it was a pleasant surprise as we were intending to do it when we got back in the evening.  The front desk staff were friendly and helpful and one young lady receptionist always gave us a wave and a smile as we passed by as she recognised us after a couple of days, though she always struggled to understand our English accents!  The concierge guys were brilliant and so helpful.  I can't remember their names except for the one with a film star name - Orlando.  They answered all our annoying tourist questions and one of the guys, when we asked about a cab, took us up to the corner and used his whistle to stop a cab, opened the door and sent us on our way - such a nice personal touch which made us feel cared for.  The air conditioning in our room was very effective and was not noisy at all so maybe the people who mentioned it were just unlucky.  Yes the elevators did make a noise but not that you couldn't sleep.  We loved New York and would like to return and will definitely stay here again - I would 100% recommend staying here.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"NONE"}

As always, let's go Pros and Cons.\n\nPROS\n1. I'll start this review by praising Errol! He's the lead breakfast manager. His spirit and energy is everything you would want in someone who works in the service industry. He welcomed everyone who entered the breakfast area and would check on you to make sure you and your family had everything you needed. Over several days, I watched his interaction with guests who stayed multiple nights. He remembered names and checked on folks as if they were his family. My son is a very picky eater and Errol prepared pancakes for him even though pancakes weren't available that morning. Marriott's management should have Errol train all of its employees because he's that good. From little kids to grandparents to all ages in between, everyone showed their appreciation. Interacting with Errol served as a great start to each morning. You can tell that he loves his job. I hope he's there if and when we visit this property again. Outstanding! \n2. Speaking of breakfast, plenty of different food options were available. I was pleasantly surprised as it's free for guests.\n3. Location: The hotel is close to nearly everything you'd want to see in Midtown - Times Square, Central Park, Broadway, Rockefeller Center. You'll also find many restaurants within a short walking distance, including chain restaurants (Chick-Fil-A, Sweetgreen, Chipotle) and many others. \n4. Customer Service: In addition to Errol, the entire team provided outstanding service from start to finish. Thank you to Lani at the front desk as she made us feel at home from the moment we arrived.\n5. The workout room has ample space and more equipment than most hotels. Again, I was pleasantly surprised.\n6. We stayed on the 48th floor and enjoyed a great view of Central Park and the Hudson River.\n7. The shower water pressure was strong (but not too strong) and also included a thermometer that allowed you to read the water temperature. Also, major kudos to the tall shower head which is great for anyone who stands taller than 6-3. \n8. The air conditioning unit worked great and wasn't loud, which can be an issue for some rooms.\n\nCONS\n1. This is nitpicky, but the temperature in the workout room was extremely cold, which is uncomfortable when you're working out and sweating.\n2. Breakfast can be busy with the combination of the Residence Inn and Courtyard guests.

The GPS address sent me to another Marriot Residence in NY entirely and their website is confusing, it should be clear that the hotel is both a Residence and a Courtyard. It was incredibly hard to find, the GPS address was incorrect, and eventually, we had to use the mailing address, our eyes, and map reading, thankfully my partner was there to help me navigate so I could focus on the road.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The receptionist (super friendly and very accommodating) told us there was a room on the 38th floor - beautiful room ~ I passed on that room and told her we would wait until 4pm for a higher floor.

For your reference, if you ever book the family suite, it always comes with a Tub and all the rooms are in the same location with the same type of view. \n\n(Note: covid, shut the hotel down for a long time and is now just getting back to 'normal') \nI noticed there was a replacement fridge (small dorm fridge) that was located where the fridge drawers used to be. I didn't think anything of it, until I tried putting food inside. It took a while for the fridge to cool down. All items were there for us to make small meals and a quick breakfast; plates, glasses, bowls, bottle opener, mugs, toaster, kettle, etc. \n\nI went to use the bathroom and noticed the toilet seat was very loose. I attemted to tighten the bolts behind the seat; no such luck. The bolts were rusted and we needed new nuts and bolts to repair the toilet. The shower was a challenge as well to get the water to turn on - it's been off for a while. Once we were able to turn on the water, it worked just fine. Excellent water pressure.\n \nWe decided to call Maintenance about the minor issues. Hubby and daughter explored the hotel while I waited for the repairman to come.

The staff is always friendly and approachable, despite this being a very busy hotel. I always feel valued when I stay. \n\nThe Courtyard hotel is on the lower floors (5-34); the Residence occupies the upper part of the hotel up to the 65th floor. Both hotels share a beautiful and spacious breakfast area on the 4th floor. The breakfast experience is upscale for a Residence Inn - couches and upholstered chairs, plus high bar seating that overlooks the city. Food options are plentiful and include extra touches, such as meat and cheeses, greens, oatmeal with several toppings, eggs, breakfast potatoes, sausage, etc. There are TVs and a bar, so this is also a gathering space (which is appreciated considering the tight and busy lobby). \n\nThe rooms are always well maintained. The elevators almost always run efficiently--crucial for a skyscraper hotel. The decor is lovely. Even though the rooms are a bit small, the finishes and the storage areas make up for it. Plus, the kitchenettes provide convenience for longer stays. \n\nThe best part of the hotel is the amazing views (of Central Park, midtown, and Times Square). I have stayed at 10+ different Marriott properties in NYC, and RI-Central Park has the best views. \n\nThe hotel is centrally located, just north of the Times Square chaos. It is within a few blocks of several subway stations so access to the entire island is convenient. It is within walking distance of the theatre district, Lincoln Square, Carnegie Hall, Rockefeller Center, and 5th Avenue shops.\n\nOn this recent visit, Kimberly and Pamela ensured that we had a wonderful stay. I called to inquire about the possibility of upgrading to a two-bed room (most rooms are kings), and Kimberly assured me she would do all she could over a sell-out weekend. At check-in Pamela assisted in orchestrating a surprise: a two-bed room on the 65th floor. The views were spectacular!

Victor at the front desk checked me in.  I had 3 different reservations pieced together for the 5 nights I would be there and he set it up for me so that I would not have to be bothered checking in and out and was able to give me the same room for the entire stay.  I even asked if he was able to get me a corner room (they have an amazing view) and he found one for me and I was even able to check in earlier than the 4 pm check in time.  Victor was great to deal with.  A little later I went down to the desk to request a blanket for the room and Victor took care of that too and I had it in no time.  While I'm discussing helpful staff I have to mention Wioleta.  Due to an impending snow storm I tried to get out of NY a day early.  I went to the desk and explained this to her and she checked me out assuring me I wouldn't be penalized for an early check out.  Three hours later I found out that due to the storm the flight I rebooked was already cancelled and I could not get out til the next day.  I went back to the hotel and asked Wioleta if I could get my room back and she took care of that for me causing me to be very relieved.  She was so helpful and pleasant and truly seemed concerned for my situation.  \n  The hotel itself is in a great location.  Close to subway stations, Central Park and the theater district, without being so close to the craziness of Times Square.  As I previously stated the views from the rooms are just amazing.  The rooms are not huge but they are big enough and who really spends lots of time in their room in NY and to me the views make up for any lack of space.  \n  There is a breakfast buffet that is included on the fourth floor of the hotel.  They have hot items such as eggs, breakfast meats and potatoes as well as pastries, bagels, oatmeal, fruit and a number of other things.  The seating area is spacious and comfortable.  \n  I highly recommend the Residence Inn NY Central Park.  \n  \n  \n","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":6023925,"title":"Great Deal in Midtown","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-11-17","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"The Residence Inn was one of the more reasonable rates for a mid-week stay between Times Square and Central Park (many hotels were charging double or more).  The hotel shares a building with a Courtyard franchise, but the Residence Inn gets the higher floors.  My room had a great view of the Times Square ball (note to those looking for a New Year's Eve room without being in the center of it all).  \n\nFor those used to the typical full kitchen Residence Inn studio, this is not for you.  The room was very small, with just a plush armchair and a desk in the combined bed\/living area.  There is no stove in the kitchenette (though hot plates might be available) but there was a two-drawer refrigerator\/freezer and a drawer (!) dishwasher, as well as a microwave and a few small appliances in a drawer.  The bathroom had a thermostat for the shower (so you know your water temperature).  The only issue I had was an HVAC system that only seemed to blow cold air (I don't think there was an AC\/heat selection and it still tripped with cool air when I raised the temperature).  There was enough radiant heat from the appliances and building that it wasn't a major issue.\n\nBreakfast is in a fourth floor bistro area shared with the Courtyard.  While Courtyard guests pay $20 for the buffet, it is still free for Residence Inn guests.  The variety was much better than most RI breakfasts, including scrambled eggs, cold cuts, potatoes, and andouille sausage (though they still had the prepackaged sandwiches many RI locations have switched to).  The quality wasn't the great and there didn't seem to be anyone actively replenishing, but I can't complain much for not paying for it.  I'd be much more upset if I had paid $20.\n\nThe one head scratcher is the wifi systems for each hotels are not interconnected, even though they use the same network name.  I had no issue logging in and using the system in my room but I was asked to log in again both in the lobby and the 4th floor bistro, and my room number was not recognized, probably because it was the Courtyard's system.  I would think having one Bonvoy network with both sets of rooms integrated would be an easy fix.\n\nOverall, we had a very pleasant stay and I now have a go-to place in the event I cannot find any other reasonable rates in the area.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The Residence Inn occupies higher floors, so most rooms have a nice view. Staff was friendly, but housekeeping and service was pretty poor. Parts of the room definitely felt a bit aged and worn. Breakfast was nice and convenient.\n\nPrice: considering the view and location, I would say the price was quite fair.\n\nLocation: I like staying in Midtown, so I liked this hotel's location. Subway stations were close by too. Area felt safe and not too touristy even though it was close to Times Square.\n\nCheck-in\/out: average. Fast but never received a phone call from the staff when our room was ready for check-in.\n\nRoom: the best part of the room was the nice view and the large windows, which was a priority for us. The room was definitely a bit aged. The TV was not working upon check-in (no signal). The wardrobe\/closet doors were not opening smoothly. The built-in fridge\/freezer combo did not appear to be working at all. The food we stored in there was not chilled. We ended up tossing all of our leftovers. \n\nAmenities: the gym on the 35th floor was well equipped. Two Peloton bikes (although I think only one was working). Several treadmills with I think 3 slat belt treadmills.\n\nService: this was probably the only subpar part of my stay. We had some dirty sheets that we noticed upon check-in (very minor). Housekeeping changed the sheets but the person appeared quite grumpy and looked like they did not want to be there. On a Sunday night, we requested some laundry bags be sent up to the room at 10pm. Called the front desk twice, waited over an hour, and ultimately had to go downstairs to the lobby myself to get them at 11pm. I sent a few chat messages using the Marriott app and compared to my stay at a Marriott property in September, responses at this property were far, far slower. Hours went by before I received a response.\n\nStaff: though service was subpar, I would say most staff we interacted with were friendly. Everyone was very courteous and polite.\n\nOverall, we would likely return to this property in the future given the location and views. Hopefully we have a better service experience next time. However unlike previous stays, we might shop around several Marriott properties for future stays in NYC.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":6023925,"title":"Great Location","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-09-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I chose this hotel over others for its kitchenette - it's not a 'full' kitchen as it has no oven - but it does have enough bits and pieces to be sufficient (Toaster, Kettle, Coffee Maker, Microwave, Fridge, Dish Washer and a good selection of crockery.  Considering there is no oven the dish washer is a bit unnecessary).  I couldn't get the fridge to switch on, but someone appeared within 20 mins of me telling reception - it wasn't broken but needed to be switched on in a certain way (A small set of instructions wouldn't go amiss)\n\nThe location of this hotel is great, it's a short walk from Central Park and Times Square, and one of the subway lines from the airport stops very close by.  A good amount of the other lines aren't far away either.\n\nCheck in was quick and easy, which was lovely after a 7 hour flight, 2 hours stood in passport control, an hour in a cab battling NYC traffic and the time difference from the UK.  The guy who checked me in was friendly and efficient.\n\nThe room was fine, it was clean and well appointed.  There are a few knocks on the furniture, but it didn't make enough of a difference to matter.  I asked for a Times Square view and I could just about see it from the 52nd floor.    There are a few odd design flaws - the wardrobe does not fit in long women's dresses (I had to hang them on the shower door) and its door hits the main doors closing mechanism.  The showerhead is very high up - I am 5'8\" and could just about reach it to get it out of its holder and use it that way - by the time the water reached my head it wasn't with enough force to remove the conditioner.  It also has a slightly slippery floor when wet - OK for me but if you are elderly or slightly dodgery it might make for an interesting time.   Other than these few little foibles the room did its job well for the 6 nights I was there.  It was quiet - I didn't hear a thing from other rooms although I know they were occupied, and the bed was extremely comfortable.  If I was to add anything it would be a small table and chair, or maybe lose the dishwasher and replace it with a gap and a bar stool.\n\nThere is a buffet breakfast with a surprisingly good selection.  Tea, coffee, juice, cereal, three hot items (usually scrambled egg, potato and either bacon or sausage), fruit, packaged bagels and pastries, bread for toasting, hams, sort of cheeses (being from the UK I can't call US cheese, cheese.  Sorry guys! It's no good anywhere, not just here! You must have a shock if you come to the UK and eat it!), salad items and yogurts.  There's enough to keep you going for a good bit of the day.  I arrived early (usually for opening time) as I was still half on UK time, it did start to get busy around 7:30\/8am.\n\nThe four lifts were quick and never took long to arrive, despite the hotel being very busy (I heard one of the guys on reception informing a walk up that they had no rooms left).\n\nCheck out was also quick, and the guys held my case for a few hours until I was ready to leave for JFK.  When I was ready, they sent a message to the yellow cab group, and one was ready for me within 10 mins.  That saved me wandering about with my case trying to flag one down or taking the subway in the heat. I also had an hour's chat with a very friendly NY cabbie who lived in The Bronx and gave me an interesting running commentary the whole way to the airport.  \n\nThe staff without exception were friendly and helpful, although that does seem to by the NYC way across the board.  I felt safe at the hotel, being a lone female, I am very aware of potential issues - you can only access the lifts with your room card, the room has a peep hole and a mechanism that allows the door to be safely partly opened.\n\nAll in all, very pleased with my choice of hotel - nowhere in NYC is cheap but in comparison to some of the other places I investigated, The Residence Inn NY Manhattan\/Central Park was a good deal","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Located in midtown it's very close to a few subway stations, Central Park, Broadway theaters ,museums and Times Square yet it's just removed enough from all the craziness in Times Square.  The rooms are on the small side (which is not unusually for NYC) but they make the most of the space and the views from your room are amazing.  The staff at this hotel is top notch.  I have never encountered an employee here who is any less than pleasant.  On my recent stay Merlinda checked me in, she was so welcoming and friendly and quickly got me into my room.  Checking out I had the pleasure of dealing with Kimberly.  I recognized her from previous stays and she always stands out as offering you any help you may need.  A basic breakfast is available on the 4th floor which comes with the room rate at the Residence Inn.  It's nice to be able to go downstairs and grab breakfast before starting your day and relax in the nice room where it is served.  I will continue to book here on future trips to the city.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Al check in abbiamo chiesto cortesemente camere ai pinai alti e le abbiamo avute (55 e 61 piano). questo e la vista emozionante e piena di atmosfera, farebbe dimenticare qualsiasi difetto. Sembra tutto abbastanza pulito, il letto \u00e8 comodo, bella TV , clima gradevole, molto silenzio. Cucinina scarsamente utilizzabile (mancano i fornelli e c'\u00e9 una elettropentola sola) . Bagno paragonabile a quello di un due\/tre stelle italiano (come arredo...ad esempio , doccia a pavimento con tendalino ), ma ampio, funzionale e ben dotato di prodotti e morbida biancheria). La colazione non soddisfa il gusto continentale o italiano : pochi dolci, neanche uno straccio di croissant o di biscotto, esigua la scelta di marmellate ( a volte c'era solo mirtilli)  . Anche il lato salato era scarso. Solo una mattina c'era del bacon , negli altri giorni una specie di mini hamburger ( o forse salsiccia a fette) poco sapido, uova strapazzate e patate con peperoni. Impossibile farsi un caffellatte decente se non a pagamento (caro prezzo) al banco  della sala dove servono Starbuks (ovverosia grossi BIDONI di caffellatte , molto buoni, in cui possono bere 3\/4 persone ). Comunque considerando che la colazione \u00e8 offerta da pochi hotel, non ci si pu\u00f2 lamentare.  Nell'area della colazione self QUASI NESSUNO , salvo pochi italiani, porta la mascherina. Quale \u00e8 il principale lato negativo ? L'assistenza al desk. La prenotazione \u00e8 stata operata via Booking. In particolare, a fronte di una spesa preventivata in $ 6140, avevo temuto che, non  avendo alcuna delle nostre carte con tale capienza, potessero esservi problemi di plafond. Pertanto ho avvertito la direzione del problema via mail (risposte piuttosto tardive e sempre e solo in inglese) chiedendo se era possibile il pagamento con carte di debito , bancomat ed offrendomi, dichiarando che volevo essere al riparo  da conseguenze negative,  di pagare in anticipo una delle due camere. Tale facolta', prima ammessa con tanto di indicazioni di moduli da compilare, mi \u00e8 stata successivamente negata via  mail , ma con ampie rassicurazioni sulla capacita' dei metodi di pagamento dichiarati (sempre via mail) . Al Check in si verifica che : la camera appoggiata alla prima carta (con plafond di 5000 Dollari ) per $.  2.800  va bene, ma la carta non pu\u00f2 essere usata per pagare una parte della seconda (il cui costo era circa 3350 Dollari). Ricorriamo allora alla carta di debito (con caricati quasi 4000 dollari) , la quale per\u00f2 ha un limite giornaliero di \u20ac. 10000 . CI risolvono dicendo che avremmo dovuto portare la carta ogni tot in modo da consentire il carico della giusta quota. Cos\u00ec abbiamo fatto e ci \u00e8 sembrato di capire che , nei primi quattro giorni, abbiamo fatto pi\u00f9 prelievi fino alla somma dovuta per la camera meno 1000 Euro dollari All'uscita dall'albergo  (Domenica di Pasqua ) il dramma: le somme che credevamo attinte dalla carta di debito , ci si riferiva che erano solo bloccate ma non incassate. Tuttavia, ci spiega l'addetto al desk, avevano consumato il nostro plafond (per cui non potevamo pagare quanto mancante). Insomma, sti soldi non erano pi\u00f9 ne nostri ne loro fin o al marted\u00ec successivo (due giorni lavorativi). Mostriamo le email con le quali anticipavamo il problema ed offrivamo una soluzione, nonch\u00e9 la rassicurazione finale della loro impiegata e chiediamo una soluzione e ci si dice di provare con gli ATM esterni (avendo 3\/4 bancomat) . Dopo avere raggranellato circa la meta' della somma mancante  in contanti, l'impiegata contattata via mail prima dell'arrivo, ci fa sapere che \u00e8 tutto risolto, e che manca solo il saldo dei mille euro (1100 dollari mancanti)  . Glieli diamo in contanti e la cosa finisce li . In sostanza portatevi carte di credito ben tarate perch\u00e8 questi non sono affatto chiari . Commento finale: grande paura , tensione, stress.  Scarsissimo senso di accoglienza e di relax, indifferenza di alcuni impiegati al banco (anche in relazione alle difficolta' linguistiche rispetto alle quali non c'\u00e9 soluzione . Non ho sentito una parola di francese, tedesco od altro, figuriamoci l'italiano ). Scuse finali della povera Pamela  (che ci aveva risposto alle mail iniziali) e ci ha confermato che eravamo a posto. L'ospitalita' \u00e8 UN'ALTRA COSA . Breve post scriptum : un giorno \u00e8 mancato il servizio ascensore per alcune ore (alle 9 di mattina): scendere dal 61^ piano a piedi \u00e8 possibile, ma le gambe e i piedi vi ricorderanno l'impresa per i successivi 10 giorni!","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Unfortunately, some were very loose and could not hold the plug. There is a bit of noise from the HVAC and appliances. I heard no noise from the street, and was on the 41st floor. An access card is needed to operate the lights and once removed, the lights go out after a few minutes. It must be an energy saving feature, but I did not like it.

The bed was very comfy. Housekeeping did a good job as we were there for a week.\n\nBeing Primo Marriott Bonvoy Members, I expected a little bigger room. We will probably return to the 6th Ave property next visit which includes a full kitchen and sofa area.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}
{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":6023925,"title":"Amazing view but charge for packages","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2021-10-04","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"The hotel is in a great location, walking distance to both Times Square and Central park and is one of the reasons we chose this hotel. We booked the grand times square view room and I will never book other rooms. The view from the room is amazing and you can see both the Hudson river and Times Square. While the room is very small, the storage layout helps make the room size ok. Another reason we booked the hotel is because it has kitchenette in the room and laundry facilities in the hotel. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star is because before booking I tried to see if they charge for packages sent to the hotel for the guests but nowhere can I see any information. I looked all over their website but can\u2019t find any information. I saw a post here in TA that they receive packages for free so I booked the hotel instead of Hilton for this sole reason. But then I get there and they charged me $10 per packages even for small packages. When I asked where is this fee stated in their website, they showed me  something on their phone that does not even look like their current website. The guys was nice and we tried to meet in the middle so I did not press any further as I don\u2019t want more stress. But I am sure it wasn\u2019t in the website and they can\u2019t show me where exactly in the website. Moreover most hotels charge for packages only when receive before the stay but packages received during the stay are free but in this hotel, even very small packages sent during the stay is charge $10. Had I known this I would not have booked this hotel because there are hilton hotels with similar facilities that do not charge for packages and those that do only charge for $2 per package.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Up until my arrival, my trip was not going well. My plane got diverted overnight to Pittsburgh due to bad weather, so I could not attend the Broadway show and High Line walking tour that I had prepurchased.  But, Mathura at the front desk immediately made me feel welcome and assigned me a room with a breathtaking view.  Thanks also to Mirlinda at reception who was also very helpful.  I'm still amazed at the convenience of this location. You can walk to many Broadway theaters and MOMA, there are three subway stations nearby providing access to several lines,  and there are tons of restaurants from fast food to fine dining.  I plan to stay here whenever I visit NYC.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The location is great and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The water never got hot in the shower. Just semi warm.

I've tried calling the main number and can't get to a representative.  I left a message for the billing dept at the hotel today hoping someone will get back to me.  I originally had booked a room at Residence in Times Square using my annual certificate for one night and my points for a second night.

I can confirm they can match your rate and will match the room type as close as possible.\"\n\nThis was fine with me, so I emailed her back and she booked us a room at Central Park.  On June 1 (the day were to check in), I received an email from Marriott stating that I had insufficient points to stay in the Central Park Hotel.  When I we got to the hotel I asked at the front desk and they said that I was not going to be charged for the room, and my original reservation at Times Square was being honored.  I did use the valet parking and I knew that I would be charged for that.  I requested a late check out on June 3, which I was granted as a Silver Member, and when I checked out at the front desk at 1pm, I was presented with the bill for the $140 and I paid it.  Yesterday, June 18, I check my Bonvoy credit card and noticed that I was charged $770 dollars for the room!  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE somebody from Marriott contact me to straighten this out or tell me who to contact! \n\nOn top of this our first room was so noisy with a banging sound which was most likely coming from the plumbing, and our shower stopped a couple times too, that I asked to be moved to another room the second day.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

The room itself was tiny, particularly for a Residence Inn, even by New York standards.  The kitchen was nice, with fridge, freezer and dishwasher drawers.  The air conditioning didn't work properly, requiring visits from maintenance.  Then the lights and plugs on one side of the room didn't work. This meant the alarm clock didn't work.  We just didn't want to deal with more people in the room, so we lived with it.  The overall condition of the room was a bit tired.  While I get COVID restrictions, the breakfast was a joke.  It was inconsistent day to day, no spoons one day, no knives the next, no drinks one day, only plain stale bagels one day--nothing else!

I do recommend staying here. My only complaint is the fact that since this is a Residence Inn, an extended stay, the room is lacking storage to be considered an extended stay. No draws to put clothing, the wardrobe has the safe in the center so you can't really store much on the lower portion. For this to be an extended stay its poorly designed. The kitchenette has one outlet to put the provided hotplate, but theres isnt real space for the cooktop to sit. If you're an overpacker, good luck finding a place to put your things. Even my suitcase doesn't have a real place to go. Would I stay here again? Yes I would.  Also, keep in mind that the higher up you are, the longer the elevator wait will be in the morning, but it's not a deal breaker. I did wait 5 minutes for the elevator at one point and in the moment it was frustrating, but I would still ask for a room on the higher floors even with the wait time, views are too nice to not accept the elevator wait times. - Petty complaint - breakfast should go until 10am.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This really is the perfect location.\n\nMake sure to enjoy the fresh American breakfast.  They serve a huge spread with literally something for everyone.\n \nThe amenities and location are great; cant be beat, but all of the employees are what makes this our favorite place to stay while in Manhattan.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Subway station within 2 blocks. \n\nLobby:  Shared lobby for Courtyard Marriott (lower floors) and Residence Inn.  Check in was quick and elevators were fast.\n\nRoom:  we had a standard room, which had a nice little kitchenette space at the entrance,  king bed fills up most of the bedroom space, there\u2019s a desk and small chair, and small closet.  There not much floor space in the bedroom, but entry way has nice open space in front of try kitchenette. \n\nBathroom: decent size and has bathtub.  Decent bath products that smells nice. \n\nEverything is fairly updated and has modern feel.  Clean and simple.  Bedding was not the most Lux but comfortable.  \n\nBreakfast:  free buffet breakfast is included.  \n\nFor the price, this is a great value and I would stay here again.  Not as posh as The Edition or W, but I like this hotel better than the Sheraton 3 blocks away. Will definitely be back. ","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The room itself was spacious for New York standards, and the kitchenette was perfect.   The breakfast was good and plentiful, and the seating for breakfast was very nice.  The only \u201clow\u201d on our visit was that we booked a Gray Line Hop-On-Hop-Off tour (at a cost of $94.40 US for two) with the woman (Shanel) in the Marriott lobby tour booth.  She told us that the buses ran every 15 to 20 minutes, but unfortunately this was not true.  After waiting for over 40 minutes at three of the stops in the freezing cold and wind, we gave up.  This is an expensive price to pay to go from the hotel to the Met to the Roosevelt Centre.

The BEST part about this hotel is the location. It is SO close to everything. Short walk to Central Park in on direction, short walk to Times Square in the other. There are several subways stops nearby so it was never hard finding a route - but we really only needed to use it when we went downtown (9\/11 museum, Battery Park for Statue of  Liberty tour). It was also only a 20 minute lovely walk through Central Park to\/from the Met. \n\nThe room itself was nice. For NY standards, it was probably considered large...but it was still much smaller than a normal hotel room in any other city. So adjust your expectations accordingly :)\n\nIt was really great to have the free breakfast available every morning. The food was so-so. Eggs, turkey sausage, breakfast potatoes, toast, bagels, cereal, deli meats\/cheeses, pastries, fruit, coffee, water, juice. The only thing that seemed to change each day was the pastry selection, other than that it was pretty much consistent. Again, not a culinary experience, but it was helpful not to have to go find a breakfast place each morning. The dining room was also very pretty.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this hotel!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

My stay in New York City was very nice just like the hotel. The only thing to criticize is the cleanliness of the tables at breakfast. \n\nOn the day of departure we cleaned up our hotel room and went to the reception with all our things and asked the employees to put our suitcases and bags on the side, because we still had about 5 hours until our flight back home flew off. We explored the wonderful city of New York in the last 3 hours we had left. When we came back our taxi was ready to take us to the airport. We packed our luggage in the trunk and got in. After about ten minutes I noticed that my headphones were no longer in the bag I put them in four hours before.\nArriving at the airport I immediately called the hotel and reported my problem that my headphones were no longer there. They immediately asked for my e-mail and I gave them a description of my headphones.\nWhen I arrived home I received an email from the hotel with a message that my headphones had been found. I was happy and asked them to send it to me. They sent me a link to the website Ileftmystuff.com. I filled out the forms on the website. When I finished, the price for getting my headphones back was $160. This price is much too high and I wrote it to the hotel. I asked the hotel to send me the headphones via UPS, which is between $20 and $30. The hotel agreed and asked for my exact address and phone number. I sent them my exact address and phone number and looked forward to having my headphones back. But I didn't get any feedback about my headphones for about three weeks.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Unfortunately, from beginning to end the staff was a complete failure and did not make my stay enjoyable.\n\nKnowing how busy hotels in NYC are, I purposely waited until 4pm to check-in to the hotel (keeping myself busy wandering around the city).  Upon arrival, the large lobby was busy and there was a line but to the staff's credit, within minutes more staff appeared and I was directed to a young man for assistance.  \n\nThat's where the problems all began-----he first couldn't find my reservation as he looked at the Courtyard side first.  When he finally found it, he began telling me something about giving me 1k points and moving me----I finally figured out that he was saying that the Res. Inn was busy with U.N. visitors (despite my trying to come in 4 days before the U.N. start, I guess they were saying it was busy already) and that he wanted to transfer me to the Courtyard and give me 1k points for the inconvenience.  \nFine, except that he spent 10 minutes going back to the office to finally figure out that my reservation didn't allow that.  Then he said that there were no rooms ready yet (check-in is at 4 isn't it????) and asked for my contact number so he could call me when it was ready.  Despite my repeating my number 3 times, he kept writing down the wrong number!  \n\nI headed out and after 90 minutes contacted the hotel via the Marriott app's chat feature  upon which they told me that my room was finally ready.  I was about 30 minutes away but when I arrived, I stood in line and was told by a young woman that she was going to find me a room (she apologized for the delay and promised me 1.5k more points which of course, I never received!).  I was really confused since they had told me the room was ready, yet when I arrived it suddenly wasn't again!!????  And then she proceeded to tell me that she was going to \"upgrade\" me to a LOWER floor.   How does that work if the hotel is known for it's views from the higher floors???\n\nAs for the room, it is small and most comfortable for 1 person.  It's not a full Residence Inn as it does not have any equipment for cooking other than a microwave but maybe that's a NYC regulation.  For a relatively newer property, the furniture and floors were already showing damage and need of repair.  As for my \"upgrade\" I received a southern view of Manhattan with a peek-a-boo view of the Hudson.  The elevators are small and there can be a wait but I didn't find the wait excessive as at some other properties (e.g. Element NYC).\n\nBreakfast in the lounge was chaotic (too many people cutting in lines) and for me, not edible.  I've been to many Residence Inn's and I know that I'm not receiving a gourmet breakfast but this one was just not edible (I think they do actually use powdered eggs here).\n\nUpon check-out, there was an issue with my bill which while quickly addressed came with a side of attitude (the woman told me that \"she moved it somewhere else as I was supposed to tell them beforehand:).  I'm a loyal Marriott member and was looking forward to my stay here but based on this and my experience at the Hilton Garden Inn next door, I would most definitely stay at the Hilton Garden Inn instead!","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":6023925,"title":"My Favorite NYC Marriott Property","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-07-31","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"RI Central Park may be my favorite Marriott property in NYC. Of the 30+ Marriott (and former Starwood) Manhattan-area hotels, I have stayed in 10+ different properties (including the Marriott, Renaissance, Fairfield Inn, Courtyard, Residence Inn, SpringHill Suites, and Pulse brands). \n\nWhy I love it:\n1) Staff is fantastic. Despite servicing both Residence Inn and Courtyard guests (both hotels are in the same tower), front-desk employees and are always friendly, efficient, and proactive. \n2) Views are incredible - city views and park views from 35+ floors up\n3) Kitchen convenience - microwave, mini fridge, sink, dishwasher. Now you can eat your pasta leftovers! \n4) Subway convenience - perfectly situated between multiple stations so you can easily get anywhere, uptown or downtown\n5) Walkability - close to theatre district, Carnegie Hall, Columbus Circle, Rockefeller Center (yes, and Times Square)\n6) Well-designed rooms - rooms are average in size by NYC standards, but there is plenty of storage: bedside tables, tall closet, console drawers, even bathroom drawers\n7) Sleep quality - situated on the edge of the busiest tourist area but very little street noise\n8) Free breakfast - oatmeal, waffles, eggs, potatoes, sausage, deli meats and cheese, fruit, yogurt, bagels and pastries (usually, ample seating, as well)\n\nA few negatives (to be objective): \n1) The main negative is the wait for the elevators. When you're up so high, taking the stairs is not practical. Plan accordingly at breakfast and check-out times. \n2) Most rooms have 1 king bed with occupancy for 2 guests (only a few doubles), so tricky if you're traveling with children. \n3) Based on the popularity of this hotel, availability can be low and rates can be high. Book in advance and consider using your Bonvoy points! \n\nDuring our recent stay with our teenaged children, Mathura ensured that we could get two rooms on the same floor--not an easy feat in the sold-out summer. But she made notes in the computer prior to our stay and even provided an update upon check-in (as she happened to be working at the time). We were in NYC during the July power outage, and staff handled the situation very proactively. They offered bottled water to people congregating in the lobby (initially, elevators weren't operating and obviously AC was not working), provided plenty of overhead announcements, and gave away snacks in the restaurant. Nicole did a fabulous job of calming and informing guests about the situation. Michael volunteered to check on one of our children who was stranded in our room (i.e., the generator hadn't kicked in yet, so no elevator access). We felt safe and reassured during these few hours of uncertainty. These are the moments you hope your hotel staff will shine! Bravo, RI Central Park staff!","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Can organise coins down at reception but there is also an awesome electronic machine where you can pay using your card and activating a washer or dryer from the machine.\n\nBreakfast was great and complimentary to all guests with many hot options and cold. Waffle stations, pastries, fruit, eggs, bacon, sausages etc. \n\nLocation is perfect for those visiting to see a Broadway Show or visiting NYC for the first time. Only a few blocks away from Central Park and Times Square you get the best of both worlds.\n\nPlenty of restaurants within walking distance, great food truck on the corner of 54th and Broadway.

Lots of choice and no limit.  I\u2019m really fussy about my coffee but the coffee was really nice.  In England I always put coffee mate and caramel syrup in my coffee and they had little tubs of coffee mate liquid which I had never seen before.  We filled up on breakfast, as we did lots of walking. \n\nI just want to say how great the staff were as our daughter was sick mid week.  They brought us extra bedding, extra towels, extra toilet paper, changed the beds several times and washed the bathroom floor.  Everything we asked for they provided us with even late at night.  Thank you so much.  It\u2019s really hard when your child is ill in a hotel room but you helped us so much and made it easier to get through it.  She soon recovered and we continued our holiday.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room was rather small but well equipped with lots of storage and amenities.  Sad that they nickel and dimed with the $7 bottles of water in the room - really??  A complimentary bottle of water or no bottle of water at all would have been much better.  The room and bathroom were clean.  The bed was so comfortable with crisp linens and cozy pillows.  With only a few rooms on each floor and so high up, it was completely quiet during our stay.  Breakfast was plentiful with many healthful items (contrary to reports in other reviews!) It was crowded during breakfast, but not impossible to navigate, choose what we wanted and find a seat.  All staff members were polite and friendly.

We arrived in the city early so I was just expecting to leave our suitcases and be on our way but was pleasantly surprised when we were told we could get in our room at 10:45am! The girl who checked us in was very friendly and informative. We went to our room which was a corner room on the 42nd floor. It was beautiful, clean and modern looking. We knew we wanted to get some cold drinks and snacks to bring back to the room so I looked for the fridge. I found it but unfortunately it was not working. We has seen housekeeping out in the hall so we went out to ask if there was something we were missing to turn it on. She looked but said she would call maintenance. We were not sure what to do as we couldn't stay and wait as we had reservations for the Circle Line Boat cruise. I suggested we head out and deal with it when we returned. Again, so pleasantly surprised when we returned to see it up and working! They had taken care of it while we were gone. The views were amazing and the location cannot be beat.

From the very beginning we were greeted with a smile & warm welcome.  We felt incredibly safe, heard, valued, & comfortable!  \n\nMichael upgraded us to one of the top floor, corner room, king suites declaring it was the biggest room they had!  We were thrilled especially since it was our 20th wedding anniversary however Michael did the upgrade without even knowing about our celebration!  Then when we told him we had experienced something disheartening earlier in the day (which happened before ever arriving at this hotel) He asked how he could help & offered to give us something free from the Market (its like a small grocery area near the check in area)   Talk about GREAT service!!!!!\n\nWe checked in to room 6109 and were just blown away!  It was GORGEOUS with windows everywhere overlooking the Hudson River in the distance, Central park in the distance, & Broadway below.  The room had a refrigerator, microwave, toaster oven, Dishwasher, plates, utensils, pots and pans - really anything you would need!  The bathroom was large, bright, & clean.  The furniture & d\u00e9cor was modern and sleek.  To say we were delighted was an understatement.  \n\nEvery time we left the hotel and returned Michael always said some kind of greeting to us whether it be - \"Welcome back\" , \"did you have a great day\" \" Have a great day\" etc.\n One night we stopped by the desk to say hi to Michael and he enthusiastically said - \"now listen is there anything I can do for you guys - seriously please let me know\"   \nLoved him - he needs a raise or promotion or SOMETHING !!!!\n\nHOTEL OVERVIEW: Lobby is clean, open, well laid out traffic flow with clear and concise directions regarding check in procedure.  Lobby furniture is a white leather consisting of mostly chairs.  The tile is a sleek black.  The elevators require a room key to activate them which allows you access to your floor.  \nBreakfast is FREE every morning.  It is a hot breakfast with eggs, potatoes, sausage, fresh made waffles, oatmeal, cereals, muffins, bagels, an assortment of meats, cheeses, & fruit as well as fruit juices, teas, coffees.  It was wonderful!  \nThe hotel is centrally located with only a short walk to either Times Square, Central Park, & is located right on Broadway for all the great shows including Hamilton!!  \nIt has a nice restaurant, fitness center, & conference rooms.  \n\nWe HIGHLY recommend staying here!

Arriving early as the hotel was advised, although there was no room available, informed it would be OK to change my shoes in the lobby as there is plenty of fresh air and then to leave my luggage with the bell desk.  Unlike my experiences at other New York hotels there was no message to say when a room became available.  Returning in the evening, I was assigned a room on a high floor; no one was on duty in the lobby to retrieve my luggage that eventually was delivered to the room.  The well-equipped kitchenette stocked with coffee, a bag of popcorn, two bottles of water priced at $7 each with no complimentary bottled water provided.\nThe very light colored early washroom-style-design walls of the elevators contrasted with the dark corridors that led to the room.  The door opened onto a small kitchenette adjacent to the bedroom which had a separate bathroom with a shower.  The telephone in the room was not working. Using a mobile phone I contacted the front desk who sent up two engineers.  The engineers mentioned that earlier in the day room telephones in the same line of rooms were out of order requiring the service provider to come to the hotel to reprogram them.  Not all of the rooms in this line were checked; I was advised to wait until the next day to be moved since no other room was available.  A duty manager came up to the room to apologize.  He confirmed he would arrange to add points for the inconvenience and move me to another room that had a bath tub.  \nThe following evening I was assigned another room (with a shower and no bath tub) to which my luggage had already been relocated.  There was armchair which I used to place a suitcase as there was no luggage rack available; the same as with the previous room. \nThe hotel has a laundry room for guests that is equipped with many washers ($2.75\/load) and dryers (from $0.25\/six minutes) but no laundry detergent.\nThe hotel provided complimentary copies of the USA Today newspaper.  When asked about the local newspaper, The New York Times, I was directed to an 8th Avenue news stand since the hotel didn\u2019t offer that newspaper.\nAt breakfast in the morning, which ended at 09:30 am, there was an uninspired selection of hot and cold dishes.  Although the skim milk dispenser was empty every morning, on one occasion there was a skim milk container on the counter.  Replenishment was slow.  An empty fruit container with two fruits (oranges and bananas) was eventually replaced with a container of oranges.  On my last morning, there were no ceramic cups available; when departing a staff member told me she would get some, however when I returned an hour later there were still none available.  It was explained all ceramic cups put out had been used, the hotel being short staffed was given as a reason for not having any washed cups. Probably explaining why the breakfast tables were messy and not cleaned.\nOn the last day of my stay, I phoned guest services explaining I had a late check out and would appreciate the room being serviced if possible, which I was told it was.  Returning an hour later I repeated this request which was again accepted.  When checking out I was informed the room was not serviced because the hotel was not a full service hotel and it did not provide such courtesies. I was offered some more points for the various additional inconveniences.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We were eventually assigned a two-bed suite on the 54th floor on Broadway, which offered the same lovely sunrise view as our first stay there. We did ask about the possibility of a suite with a different view, in particular the Central Park, but were told that two-bed suites are all on this side of the building with the same view. \n\nOur last experience had been that breakfast was below standard, in terms of food quality and service\u2014by the standards of NYC hotels and Residence Inns elsewhere such as London. We thought we should give it another chance, but it turned out to be a mistake. Tough luck.\n\nOne small problem was that the coffee maker in our suite was broken.

It was a last minute trip but we were still able to get a good rate.  I chose this hotel based on location, name and price, and it more than met our expectations.  We booked a park view room, but at check in my husband told them we were celebrating my birthday and a kind young woman upgraded us to a room with a better view. (I'm sorry I don't remember her name, Victoria??)  When we entered our room we actually laughed as it was so tiny, smaller than the pictures make it look.  That said it was full of small spaces, drawers, cupboards, shelves and we were able to manage quite well even finding spots to stash our suitcases. We've been in larger rooms that weren't this efficient!!  This tiny suite had a kitchen with dishwasher, microwave. and fridge and everything is faced so seamlessly we didn't  discover the freezer until the last day. The \"kitchen\" was handy for reheating leftovers, and chilling sodas and beer.  \nThe upgraded view was incredible!!! There were two windows and we had fabulous views of Times Square and the River, including beautiful sunsets. Thank you!!\nWe did not take advantage of breakfast but instead headed to Nosh for Lattes every morning to have with pastries we picked up at local bakeries. \nAs others have mentioned the location is excellent for walking around the city, and a perfect base to come back and rest. The bed was quite comfortable, and we slept well!!  \nThe staff members were helpful and welcoming, and we appreciated their part in making this an excellent Birthday adventure.

The property is extremely well maintained, for the amount of traffic it gets.    The staff was extremely professional and very accommodating....I had requested that if a room on 65 was available - that I would certainly appreciate that floor - and sure enough - 6503 was my room assignment.

Granted, I am a Gold level member\u2014\u2014but that was above and beyond.....just kicked off the 2 day visit so favorably.     Everything in the room worked perfectly.

The kitchen and bathroom drains were very slow, and the shower drain was completely blocked with hair. Rather than removing the hair, someone just pulled out the drain stopper and sat it on the side of the tub. Maintenance came and removed the hair but left the drain stopper on the side of the tub and poured chemicals down all the drains, but they continued to drain slowly the rest of my stay. Many of the light bulbs in the room were burnt out, and two lights over the kitchen counter were just hanging down by the wires and were inoperable until maintenance repaired them. The carpet in the rooms is in dire need of cleaning or replacement and was held down with duct tape in my coworker's room. The sheets on the beds had holes in them, and the white blanket at the end of the bed was yellowed and very, very worn out. \n\nThe rooms are not suitable for extended stays or for work.  Some coworkers had rooms with no desks and some coworkers had no drawers or space to store their luggage.  The rooms that did have desks did not have an adjustable chair.  I was unable to reach the desk unless I sat on pillows, and a much taller coworker had to do the same.  \n\nThe location of this hotel was convenient to Central Park, Times Square, many train lines, and great food.

We could get around the city easily and walk to some of New York\u2019s best highlights. The hotel itself was comfortable but a bit tight although our view was amazing which we paid top dollar for. service was very good and we were treated to a complementary dessert and sparking wine delivered our room because it was our anniversary. Much appreciated. The  king room was fine but it was literally all bed with very little walking space. Ok for one person but not ideal for two adults. Can\u2019t imagine a family sharing a room with double beds if it is comparable to the king room. Overall, we were happy not overjoyed or overwhelmed. Super busy as to be expected for NYE. I got the feeling that we over paid by buying through the Marriott site. I checked out rates on Trip Advisor and they were much cheaper. Highlight of the hotel is the workout area. Big and has everything you need and more. It overlooks the city...breathtaking view. Do not bother with the cafe on the 3rd floor. It is only there for convenience but has no atmosphere. Maybe a good spot if you need to work and want to get out of your room. Regular coffee was good but anything more, best to go off property.

Our room was not ready and we had to wait about an hour. We checked in...went up to our room. View of \"Central Park\" that I expected was more of a peak between buildings. Still a nice view of the city as we were on the 60th floor. Just not the romantic central park view of invisioned. I noticed I had been charged an additional $60 for my stay. After calling the front desk.. I was told it was a $20 per night for incidentals. Nice to be notified in advance. We were expected \"plush\" bedding. Hotel beds are always the best part of vacation. Well we had a \"pad\" inbetween 2 sheets. It was cold in the room and couldn't regulate the temperature. We requested blankets and waited 2 hours for them. After using the app to explain the situation..we were sent up wine. Heat barely worked. They had to send someone to fix the heat. It was 1 thing after another. I tried to talk to the manager Kenny to possibly be moved. Since it was so cold in our room. No rooms available. I was just very unimpressed and dissapointed with my stay here.

Stayed over the Martin Luther King, Jr. weekend. The hotel is strategically placed between bucolic Central Park and frenetic Times Square, and you are close enough to walk conveniently to either. Subway entrances are also close by. \n\nThe hotel is one of those hybrid Marriott properties that is half Residence Inn and half Marriott Courtyard. Staff handle this mix of brand identities and guests very well. Indeed, the staff were outstanding - welcoming, professional and helpful. \n\nRooms are nicely designed, a bit compact but more space than many other rooms in New York City. A large overstuffed chair takes up way to much area but, otherwise, everything was fine. A wand shower head was a highlight in the bathroom, the lighting was good, and the Marriott bedding is always top notch. \n\nThe hallways leading to the rooms, however, are very dark, almost scary - it was hard even to see the room numbers beside each door.  \n\nHuge, pleasant common areas on the third and fourth floors for business and hanging out and for the complimentary breakfast are graced with tall windows that look out over Broadway. \n\nMy only real complaint is that external calls to the hotel don't seem to be answered. On two different days I called to confirm my reservation that had been made through a third-party vendor, and no one answered the phone. On the second day, I tried (no kidding) 8-10 times before finally reaching a very pleasant person. Maybe this was just a glitch, but it is something that management might want to address. \n\nAll in all, I had a wonderful stay, would stay there again, and recommend this property highly.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

The staff are top-notch professionals:  pleasant, responsive, efficient and helpful.  Check in was quick and easy.\n\nThe view from our room (54th floor) was spectacular, a big selling point! Our room was not large but was roomy by New York standards with a convenient layout. Two bedside tables, multiple lamps and lighting options, closet, bureaus, desk, two chairs, a safe, and a kitchenette, complete with fridge, microwave, cutlery, dishes, pots and pans, cabinets and drawers, and coffee maker.  The rainforest shower was delightful, and bathroom vanity space was generous.  The exhaust fan in the bath was whisper quiet - unusual in our experience and much appreciated.  The bath could use more towel racks (towels fell off the shiny hooks).  Linens were fresh and fluffy, and toiletries were good.  The bed was okay, not as comfortable as other hotels in the same mid-price range; that was a surprise considering the overall quality of our stay.  Heating unit worked well.\n\nNoise separation among rooms was not great, and we could hear conversations of our neighbors; but everyone on our floor seemed to be mindful of not speaking loudly and keeping TV volumes to reasonable levels.  Free wifi worked well.  Elevators are fast, and come quickly at certain times, but long waits may occur during heavy traffic times.\n\nThe breakfast buffet, also free, was better than the customary free breakfast offerings at moderate hotels.  Cold meats, spinach salad and yogurts were added to the usual breads, muffins and cold items.  Hot choices included not just pork sausage but also turkey sausage, and almond milk was included as well as typical dairy-based milk.  A word to the wise:  go early to breakfast, as lines form by 8 am and the serving stations get very crowded, with diners bumping each other and creating a not entirely relaxing environment.  The breakfast room is large with high ceilings and excellent views, but, at peak times, it still feels crowded.\n\nOverall, we could not have been more pleased.

We were spread over 3 floors, 45, 53 and 55 so I got to see the views from different levels and each one was great. Of course the higher you go the better the view but it was nice not to look out at a brick wall or fire escape for a change. We had a view that captured a bit of Times Square and some of the Hudson. \n\nWe did have to get one of our rooms changed as it was located directly next to the elevator shaft and the noise was bad. It sounded like a storm blowing through, especially at the busy breakfast times when all the elevators are being heavily used (this is also the time where you should expect to wait longer than usual for an elevator). As soon we we mentioned this problem to reception they were very helpful and moved the guests to a better room on floor 53 (from a lower floor) immediately. We got the impression that this was not an uncommon issue. However the change was swift and hassle free.\n\nThe in room kitchen was very useful and added a nice bit of extra space to the room that you don't usually get in New York hotels. It had a fridge, microwave, sink, kettle, coffee maker, slow cooker, cutlery, dishes, pans, some had toasters and a counter top stove could be requested from reception. There was also a dishwasher which would be loaded and turned on by housekeeping when there were enough dishes to warrant it (we didn't use this though). It is quite handy if you don't want to eat out or want to keep your costs down and make your own meals. There are a couple of Duane Reade's nearby where you could get a limited selection of groceries.\n\nBreakfast is served on the lower floors and serves both hotels. It can get quite busy but the selection of food was good. Cereal, fruit, pastries, yoghurt, waffles, hot selection, toast, muffins etc and hot drinks and juice. It was a good way to get set up for the day ahead. The elevators do have useful guides in as to when they are at their busiest at breakfast time so that gives a good indication of when the breakfast room is busy. I went down around 8am and this seemed to be a good time. When waiting for an elevator at the breakfast room when you finish it may be wise to jump in one that is going down instead of waiting for one going up as you could be there a while. It is sometimes quicker to go down to go up and saves waiting in the queue as when we were there, the queue didn't go down because people at the front wouldn't get in the elevator unless it was already going up. If you are prepared to go down a few floors first, you can jump the queue this way. \n\nThe location was great, really easy to get to everywhere.\n\nOne thing to note is the windows in our rooms had an opening at floor level and one of them did not close properly. Regardless, it would be something to be aware of if staying with children as it would be fairly easy for them to open. There is a heavy armchair in the room that could block access to it but just worth being aware of.\n\nI would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Unfortunately, when we first began our research for hotels in New York, the Residence Inn New York Manhattan\/Central Park was fully booked. We did extensive research on countless hotels. Everywhere from the Upper West Side, Midtown, Financial District, Soho, Battery, and South Street Seaport. Nothing excited us in comparison to the jaw-dropping views that Residence Inn New York Manhattan\/Central Park offers. We booked several hotels with free cancelation policies and four days before our trip the Residence Inn became available. We immediately booked the King Studio Central Park View room and canceled all of our previous reservations. \n\nResidence Inn New York Manhattan\/Central Park is in a perfect location, walking distance to Times Square, two blocks from the 7th avenue Subway Station, and a very short walk to many broadway theaters. We saw King Kong and it was amazing. I highly recommend buying a seven day unlimited metro card to easily travel around Manhattan. We were in New York for only four days and took the subway about twenty times. The subway made it very easy to avoid walking in the cold. I also highly recommend going to TKTS at the Lincoln Center location instead of Times Square to avoid the long lines. TKTS offers broadway show tickets at a good discount. \n\nResidence Inn New York Manhattan\/Central Park is clean and very accommodating. They met every special request I had and provided excellent hospitality. I definitely recommend using the Marriott app to check-in and make requests for your stay. The front desk staff and concierge greeted us with a smile, our housekeeper was very nice and payed attention to detail when cleaning our room, we always had fresh towels.  Residence Inn New York Manhattan\/Central Park is tallest sole purpose hotel in North America. Our room was located on the 62nd floor and had a complete 180 degree view. We could see the Hudson River, Central Park, East River, Midtown, and part of Times Square. Awesome views of the One57 building and 432 Park Avenue building. I will recommend this hotel to my family and friends as well as anyone I speak to about traveling to New York. Our trip couldn\u2019t have been any better. The view from the room was unlike anything I have ever experienced at a hotel. The photo I have attached will speak for itself.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location is amazing! Within walking distance to many iconic landmarks, Time Square, Broadway shows, Central Park,  Museums and an abundance of restaurants. \n\nWe were given a beautiful room on the 50th floor with an absolutely STUNNING 180 degree view. With the Hudson river, Time Square and Central Park all within view! Lovely during the day, mesmerising at night! \n\nDuring the first night of our stay a water pipe burst below us causing the hot water to the entire hotel to be shut off for repairs. This resulted in freezing cold showers and the uncomfortable exspirence of washing my hair in the shallow bathroom sink but understandably there was nothing that could be done by the hotel staff. The hot water remained off for the 2 days of our stay. \n\nThe bigger problem was that the water damage caused 2 of the 4 elevators unusable. In such a large hotel with many higher levels unable to navigate coming and going any other way, this was extremely inconvenient and problematic. 30-45 minute waits for every elevator. Angry guests pushing and shoving into over crowded elevators. Again the unforseen event was not any fault of the hotel, these things sometimes happen, but I was disappointed that I did not see the hotel staff helping to maintain order better. \n\nAfter our trip I contacted corprate customer service to request part of my points refunded due to the difficulties during my stay. It was difficult to maintain communications but after the hotel manager made contact with me I was HIGHLY impressed with the excellent customer service. Not only did the manager validate my concerns and refund the points I had requested,  but went the extra mile and invited my husband and I back when we visit New York in the future, where we would be given VIP treatment. An unexpected and impressive offer!\n\nOccationally things will happen that is out of the control of a business. The water pipe brake was such an event. The type of follow-up and attention a company extends after such an event says a lot about that companies customer service quality. Marriott continues to impress me as a company. \n\nThis hotel displayed excellent customer service the entire time. From the friendly and accommodating front desk staff, breakfast staff, room attendants, and ending with the hotel manager addressing our situation. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to my friends and family. ","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":6023925,"title":"We were actually there for 5 nights the good and bad ..","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-12-06","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I stay at a lot of hotels and consider myself someone who knows what to look for.  So my review is solely my perspective of a 5 night stay in Nov 2018 over Thanksgiving.  We actually were checked in to 2 different rooms.  There are specific things you should know about this hotel.\n#1 - it has a very small lobby and shares the space with Courtyard.  Based on daily lobbies packed with luggage and waiting guests- it seems like early checkins may be problematic.  The same checkin desk handles both Residence inn And Courtyard.  The lobby in the winter cold had free hot chocolate and marshmallows.  That was awesome.  The first 30ish floors are Courtyard.  They have their own set of elevators.  The Residence Inn rooms start on floor 35 and they also have their own elevators.  About 5 elevators total for that side.  And the elevators are super tiny. While we were there at least one broke down daily.  So waiting for the elevator happened daily; but, it was maybe 5 minutes or less.  The harder part was if people were already with luggage as the elevator was super small.\nThere are only a few rooms per floor.  I want to say about 9 rooms.  I was told that rooms with 2 beds are not on the highest of floors - so something to keep in mind.\nWe were seeking a room with a spectacular view. The first room we got was a high floor ADA room that did not have the layout we were seeking.  The view had a small smidgen of Central Park but, was mostly buildings and construction.  But, that room did have a college sized separate refridgerator and a larger bathroom.  It did not have that plush white chair that you can see in some pictures on their website.  \nThe second room we moved to the next day had an amazing view on the 50th floor of Times Square, downtown and also the Hudson.  Ask for one of those rooms that has floor to ceiling windows- and also the plush white chair\/table.  We thought the 50th floor was not high enough; but, we were actually able to see Macys balloons in the far distance from our room.  We also had an amazing view of times square.  There was a smaller tv- and not much else.  If you are thinking the room will be functional because of the kitchenette- it really is not.  The fridge is in a drawer and it is literally the size of a silverware drawer.  It is super small.  Completely not functional.  The freezer did not work right even after maintenance came.  There is a ice machine in the freezer; but, it did not work.  There is a hotel ice machine on a lower floor.  The microwave was fine.  But, we mainly wanted to use the fridge to store thanksgiving dinner.  Truthfully the drawer was just sad.  Do not think this is a typical Residence functional inn in that respect.  The fridge drawer never got cold enough.  Maintenance just couldn't get it cold enough.  We finally resorted to adding ice from the hotel ice machine in the freezer and fridge drawers.  Check online for videos that show you exactly what the kitchenette is.  If you are not needing a functional fridge to store things that really need to be cold - than it would be ok.  Other than the disappointment to no real fridge-  the room was amazing.  The bed was very comfortable.  The room was very clean.  The shower was walkin glass and very large.  The bathroom was smaller and the toilet was stuffed in between the wall and a counter; but, it worked.  The room had an amazing view and we never closed the curtains.  The city lights were spectacular from the bed.  One night it snowed and these Floridians cheered like kids on xmc morning.  Be aware though that the room is really small.  As most NYC rooms are.  We were lucky to get that comfy plush small white chair and table in the corner of the windows.  I can not stress this enough.  If you want to just sit and admire the view that chair is crucial.  So ask for a room with it.  The linens were upgraded.  The internet had a strong signal.   The best part of the hotel is the staff.  There is absolutely nothing they will not to do to make your stay amazing.  We interacted with many different staff members from maintenance, breakfast attendants, porters and front desk.  There was a complimentary breakfast every morning.  Standard fare.  No evening reception.  There was not one staff member that took away from our stay.  They each took a \"can do\" attitude to a new level.  They greeted us enthusiastically and just really made us feel as though our business was so appreciated.  The hotel was sold out several nights yet they handled the volume perfectly.  We were there over Thanksgiving and could not have had more memorable stay between the view and the staff.  If you are considering this location know that there are many restaurants and fast food within close walking distance.  A nice Italian and steak restaurant almost inside the hotel.  You are right down the street from where Stephen Colbert tapes.  Times Square is about 5 blocks away.  You are close to Central Park.  You are close to so much.  The area was good and we felt safe walking around.  I travel a lot for work and have a lot of experience with hotels and staff. This location is high on the list of my favorites.  We struggled whether to stay at this particular hotel and I am so glad we did.  Thankyou to the amazing staff for making our stay so memorable and special.  I highly recommend giving this hotel a try.\nIf you are cruising the taxi ride was about $5. to the port.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was a good size and had lots of drawer space. Everything was kept clean and the bed was very comfortable. However It took 2 notes two days running to housekeeping, 2 messages via the Marriott app a call to reception and a actual visit to reception before I finally got a shower cap in the third day - by which time I\u2019d bought one from Duane Reade. (A small problem - unless you have long curly hair and the hotel has hairdryers but no diffuser and mine doesn\u2019t fit theirs so I was trying to reduce the amount of mornings I had wet hair. )\n\nBreakfast is in an enormous room and is adequate. we had no problem finding space but the food area is a little cramped. I generally grabbed a piece of fruit and a coffee but there was a \u2018hot\u2019 buffet, a cold section with cheese and yoghurts, cereals, a waffle maker and a selection of bread stuff. \n\nThe \u2018bar\u2019 is just miserable. The only reason to go here is to continue using the hotels WiFi. It\u2019s just a big open room with TVs. And the bar selections are quite limited which is probably why no one goes here. This is a monster space and could be a money generator for the hotel.... but sadly not. There is s nice bar next door though ! \n\nOn a rainy day we were told by the duty manager \u2018we don\u2019t have umbrellas - you can go outside and buy one\u2019. I was completely shocked.

With our positive experience with the Residence Inn London Bridge, we had high hopes for this NYC stay in late September. It didn\u2019t disappoint. The tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere, it offers the best views of Manhattan imaginable. Thanks to the friendly Front Desk Manager, Melissa, our suite is on the very high 56th floor (highest is 65th) on the Broadway side. Before arrival we had hoped for a corner suite with also the Central Park view, but it seemed that none of the corner suites was in our preferred twin-bed setting. Anyway, the view of sunrise through the floor to ceiling window impressed us enough and made up for everything. An added bonus was that we could check the temperature and weather by taking a quick look at the Weather Star on the roof of 1740 Broadway before going out!\n\nThere was nothing we didn\u2019t like about our suite. It was very spacious, with one queen and one twin beds (both very comfortable) and, good news for those who had work to deal with, also a huge (I mean huge) desk. The bathroom, also spacious, was clean and offered good-quality toiletries and plenty of towels. If we had to make a suggestion for improvement, it would be a replacement of the towels that were too tired and rough (one of my biggest pet peeves). \n\nLike other Residence Inns, there is a fully-equipped kitchen in every suite. Since we were in The Big Apple, we thought we might skip cooking altogether and instead try out different highly-rated restaurants. Free breakfast was offered on the 4th floor (shared with guests of the Courtyard by Marriott which occupies the lower floors), again as with Residence Inns elsewhere. Unfortunately, the breakfast was rather disappointing, with limited choices and slow refill of food and coffee\u2014quite unlike what we had experienced in other Marriott\u2019s and Residence Inns. On the second morning, we decided to try somewhere else, and chanced upon Astro. We were happy we did! Their pancakes and omelette were delicious and served quickly.\n\nWill we be back to Residence Inn by Marriott NY Manhattan\/Central Park? Certainly, because of the view, the home-away-from-home convenience, the location and, of course, Melissa.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The little restaurant on the fourth floor has a lot of issues. I ordered an $18 personal pepperoni pizza for dinner since we were running low on time before our Broadway show. It was one of the worst pizzas I have ever eaten, and it wasn't cheap. I could go to the grocery store, buy a $3.00 Red Baron frozen pepperoni pizza, heat it up in the oven for 15 minutes, and it would be significantly better than the pizza this restaurant is serving. The restaurant\/cafe also sells individual bananas, which cost about 10 cents each, for $3.00.

The hotel is well located (within a few blocks of Times Square, theaters, and a number of subway lines), clean, comfortable, well maintained (caveat as to elevators), and (for NYC) reasonably priced. We had a room on the 50th floor with a nice view, and a kitchenette (microwave, refrigerator, sink, and dishwasher).  I would think twice about staying here again, however,  as opposed to the many other properties in the neighborhood based on:\n\nReally small room.  Gracious, there was literally no place to put our suitcases down!  The closet is quite small, too.  Mind you, we've been to NYC at least 10 times, and we know the rooms are small, but this seemed particularly so.  Its an odd shaped building on the upper floors, so some rooms are likely to be better in this respect than others.\n\nElevator service.  The Residence Inn portion of this property (the top half, the bottom is a Courtyard with its own elevators) has 4 elevators.  Obviously if you're on the 50th floor, you need to use them.  Suffice it to say each elevator has posted in it a sign warning of the times of the day when traffic is such that you may need to wait for an elevator for some time.  When we tried to check out on Sat. (and hence had our suitcases with us) we actually had 2 different groups give up and WALK DOWN rather than continuing to wait. (Two of the 4 elevators were out of service.)\n\nBreakfast.  Yup its included, and the room (shared with the Courtyard people) is actually nice.  I wouldn't bother with it though, because apparently the staff doesn't bother either. When we came down they were out of scrambled eggs and meat and it didn't get refilled until after we had already had a hard boiled egg and yogurt instead.  The croissants were just bread shaped like a croissant. Ugh.  We did not go back after that first morning. You can do better for a reasonable price elsewhere. \n\nConcierge.  We have been to NYC enough that we don't often use this service, but if its important to you, it seems to be an afterthought for the hotel. It is stuck in the back of a hall where the elevator bank is, in a dark corner.  It didn't even have the current week's \"Time Out\" magazine when we asked for a copy, nor were we impressed by the staff's attitude about it.\n\nWe thought that there had been little thought given to how the kitchen was stocked.  For one thing, there was a full panoply of metal cooking pans in the drawer, but no stove to use them on- just a microwave.  So they are wasted. There is a dishwasher, but frankly it seems easier to just hand wash and rinse the few dishes we used.  Too bad there is no dish soap (when we asked, we got additional dishwasher soap) or a sponge or something to wash them with. (Just a query:  what happens when a guest fails to wash the dishes in the dishwasher?  Does the staff actually run the dishwasher to clean them before the next guest?  That would take quite some time!  As in any place where you don't know, I would wash the dishes and silverware myself before using them.)\n\nFinally, housekeeping on one day managed not to get to our room at all by the time we had returned at about 4:30 pm.  By that time, we just wanted to lie down for a bit, so we missed out on the housekeeping that day.\n\nSo, the hotel is ok, but but they have issues to work on!","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon arrival front desk notified me that I checked in already and my room was ready. Someone on the hotels end checked in for me which I don\u2019t know how. I wanted a Central Park View room. The woman who was helping us told me they were sold out but that she\u2019s making a note for us to be moved the next day which was fine. No one ever called the next day to move us or to follow up with the request AT ALL. No one ever called throughout our entire stay.The second night we had plumbing issues. We couldn\u2019t use the bathroom all night because water kept randomly filling up and wouldn\u2019t flush. We forced ourselves to sleep and the next morning it still didn\u2019t work. I called and explained to them that my husband and I are germaphobes and if they had another room my husband could use the bathroom in that would be great. The man went on to tell me how my husband and I can use the bathroom on the third or fourth floor. This was the bathroom all of the guests were using during breakfast.I told him that\u2019s not an option for us and I would appreciate it if he could us a bathroom in a clean room.He told me all the rooms are sold out. I don\u2019t know how Check in promised us another room to move into the next day if they are ALL SOLD OUT. Not sure who was lying and who was just plain lazy to move us to the room that was promised to us. The conversation went nowhere and he abruptly ends the call with me. He hung up on me while I was still talking to him. Twenty minutes later the engineer comes to our room with a plastic bag and a huge plunger. Water is spilling out everywhere and he puts the plunger in a plastic bag over the towels, our shoes etc and leaves. I called front desk immediately and asked for them to send housekeeping to disinfect our room (toilet, bathroom floor and door handles). I also called them back two minutes later and asked if housekeeping could bring us more towels and those were never brought to us either. The guy I was speaking too could care less and the staff members were promising things that were clearly out of their control.For someone who is staying at the hotel and using their points during their honeymoon they could\u2019ve handled both situations much better and with less of an attitude towards silver elite Marriott rewards members. I want my points back! I will not be recommending this hotel or ever returning.What was suppose to be a memorable trip was not because staff could care less about their guests!","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We noticed that after a night, and did not want to move to another room due to heavy luggage. And what about there were other problems even though we moved to another room? \n5. If you open the window due to the dust, you could have a good sleep with mosquitoes. We also found one big fly.\n6. If you want to get some mail, well, they never notice you. You have to check all the time. Once I checked up whether I had a package for me, they said there wasn't a package for me. However, I logged in to UPS to track and found the name of the person who recevied my package! I went down there again to tell his name to get my package. If you meet the one staff I mentioned above, you may feel very bad due to her annoyed look and rude behavior.\n7. Never expect to have a late-check out for an hour. Even though we have stayed there for more than 15 days, she(unfortunately I had to speak to her as there were no other staff at that time.) said, \"Well, only 30 minutes. not 13. 30.\" How grateful!\n\nI hope that you have a good sense of chooosing a nice hotel in NY.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

But this hotel has specific pluses and minuses that some visitors might need to consider before booking.  On the plus side - the breakfast buffet includes hot cooked oatmeal and has plenty of protein offerings including rarely offered cheese to put on bread.  But the popular banana was in short supply, unfortunately.  On the minus side, there are two.  The first is the bathroom lighting.  The designers aimed to create a sophisticated NY city feel to the rooms but forgot to consider that dimly lit bathrooms create shadows that flatter no one but the twenty somethings and don't create good feelings about ourselves - not how you want to feel when away!  The second is the reservation mishaps.  Twice, I reserved a room and twice, the room I reserved was taken by the time I got to the hotel.  Each time, I had to settle for a temporary downgrade and the inconvenience of having to move from room to room during my stay.  The second time, I had to insist that the hotel offer me some freebies to make up for the extra money I had already paid for the better room.    \n     Finally, there are two things to note.  First, the peculiarity of having pots and pans in the kitchenette but no stove to use them on!  Second, there is no longer any advantage to a room overlooking Central Park.  Three new skyscrapers plus more coming are blocking the view so wall to wall windows are great but now even those rooms just have a \"city\" view.  That eliminated this hotel's plus for me.  Next time, all things being equal, I'll pick the hotel with the well lit bathroom!","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I had stayed here last summer and had a great experience but the friend who came with me hadn't stayed here before. We both thought the hotel was all around a great hotel- the room was small but big enough for two people and our combined 4 suitcases. We had the Grand Times Square view (room 6108) which was amazing- our view was of the Hudson River and dock where cruise ships come in, along with great city views and of course times square. We had a king bed, which was nice because we had a nice chair to sit in by the window along with the chair at the desk area. Even though we didn't have a totally panoramic view, it was totally worth it because we were so high- we even got to see fireworks from 3+ shows that were happening all over New Jersey right from our hotel room! Breakfast was fine, decent variety and not too crowded, especially on weekdays. Both times I've been here I noticed that it sometimes takes a little while to get an elevator, especially if you are coming down from one of the top floors, but it never was an unreasonable amount of time, especially given how many floors you are moving and the views you get because of this. Check-in and check out were fine, at check out the bellman was actually able to reserve us the hotel car so we could get a ride to LGA for a flat fee- it was around $50 plus tip I think.

I would definitely choose to stay at this hotel again when I return to NYC. \n\nService: wonderful and friendly. We checked in around 9pm, and were greeted warmly then and throughout our stay. Our customer care specialist helpfully recommended several restaurants in the area, another helped us get a cab.\n\nRooms: as pictured. Modern, clean. We requested and received a high floor (57th) with spectacular views of the city...a glimpse of Central Park between buildings when we looked left out of the floor-to-ceiling windows, and a glimpse of Times Square looking right. The floor at this height is small...I think there were perhaps 10 or so rooms on this floor. The room is smaller but definitely adequate with a small kitchenette that is well-stocked. Key operates lights. Beds very comfy (typical for a Marriott IMHO), but with surprisingly noisy sheets (super crisp?) A little getting used to: the toilet is about 3-4 feet from the bed on the other side of a sliding door (definitely not much auditory or olfactory privacy). Bathroom wall likely shares a wall with the elevators, which were not noisy but a slight whooshing noise can occasionally be heard. Pillows on the double bed were along a wall where the HVAC unit was installed, which also was (thankfully) not noisy. Very effective A\/C and heating. Overall, a quiet location...rarely heard doors closing from other rooms, never heard other guests.\n\nBathroom: modern. Paul Mitchell products, and more offered in the room than other Marriotts (plus lotion and bath gel). Bath tub with hand-held shower head. Shower head mount definitely will fit taller people (I am nearly 6'). Water pressure effective, especially for being 57 floors up.\n\nElevators: FAST. Ears routinely popped near the 42nd floor. Key is required to get to guest room floors. \n\nHousekeeping: so helpful and nice! Requested extra shampoo. Toothbrushes are complimentary (ask a customer care specialist in the lobby). I'm not sure how they knew we were not in our room in the morning, but every time we came back from breakfast our room was clean. Thanks, Gigi!\n\nBreakfast: very good, large selection, wonderful dining room. Get there early. We arrived about 30 minutes before closing; food selection was still good, seating was tight but clearing (we sat along the bar near the windows), coffee was out. \n\nThank you, Marriott!","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

She blamed booking.com for the error with the credit card even though we had a confirmation from booking.com. This is odd given that we had used the same credit card to make several hundred dollars in charges both locally at home as well as in nyc within the past 24-48 hours without difficulty. \n\nAs the hotel was overbooked, the manager told us to go to the sister hotel residence inn in Times Square. She did not offer any further assistance, and told us she was very busy and had other customers to assist. We found this preposterous; this is a terrible establishment. \n\nWe arrived after a 4hr train ride to be told by staff here that our reservation had been cancelled. That our credit card had not gone through. Because the hotel was overbooked they could not reinstate the reservation! So we had nowhere to go. The mgr suggested we go to their sister residence inn in times square. She then said she had a lot of customers to assist so could we please step aside. Generally,when a hotel is overbooked, the courteous thing to do is help arrange for accommodations elsewhere. She told us to straighten out our finances!!!  We were obviously irate. We insisted that she contact this other hotel and help us make reservations. She fled the desk at this point claiming that she could not reach the hotel and would try to email them from the office. \n\nWhile she was nowhere to be found for the next 30 minutes, we contacted our credit card company who confirmed that no recent charges were denied and they in fact had record of a successful test charge of $1 from this hotel. I finally caught the manager out in the lobby again, and she said we \u201chad a room\u201d at the residence inn Times Square. She wrote the address on a post-it and that was it. She expected us to leave. When I turned my back to her to get my card from my wallet, she again disappeared. \n\nAfter this her staff could not get her to leave her office to talk to me again. We had a crying baby in the lobby, we were exhausted, and we weren\u2019t sure we had a room anywhere in the city. We were highly suspicious that the hotel had overbooked and punted our reservation, while dishonestly blaming booking.com.\n\nAnother staff member made like he called the other residence inn and found out the mgr had never made any reservation for us. He then told us he made a reservation for us and that this other hotel was $100 cheaper than the rate we would have paid. \n\nWe finally headed over to the other residence inn in Times Square, and surprise surprise, they knew nothing about any reservation. They also explained that residence inns usually compensate customers in overbooked situations by arranging alternative accommodations and giving the first night free. They also make sure you arrive at the alternate hotel safely.  We got none of that. We were insulted and told our credit card was no good, lied to several times, and basically ignored until we left. The managers behavior was absolutely abominable given the situation where the mistake was theirs and we were left basically homeless.\n\nThis hotel cannot be expected to honor online reservations.

We're both first-timers to NYC and wanted to be in a very central location while sticking to a reasonable budget.  This hotel checked all the boxes for us. \n\nOur hotel flew into JFK so in order to get to the hotel, we took the air train and 1 subway line.  Once we got off the subway, we had to walk about 2 blocks (and passed by Stephen Colbert's studio while doing so!).  We arrived early in the morning so we knew our room wasn't going to be ready so we were able to leave our bags at the hotel and do some sight seeing of the city while we waited for our room. \n\nHere's where it got a little tricky - I used the Marriott iPhone app to check the status of our room.  We didn't want to end up walking any further than we had to if our room was available since we had to make it back in time to change and go up to the Bronx for a Yankees game.  The chat feature on the app said our room was ready so we headed on back to the hotel.  \n\nWhen we go to the desk, they said the room wasn't actually ready.  Now I was miffed because we had just marched from the other side of town in hopes of taking a quick shower and heading up to the Bronx.  To rectify this, they said they could \"upgrade us\" to a room with a Time Square view but it was on a lower floor than we had hoped.  We went up and took a look at the room to notice the lamp shade and chair were dirty and the floor height and view were NOT what we were expecting (I had called back in February 2018 when I made the reservation to see what \"side\" of the building to reserve a room on for a view of the Hudson river).  We went back down to the front desk and requested a different room.  This time, we were given a king size corner room on the 56th floor (5607) with a view of Time Square and the Hudson.  We went back up and the room was laid out MUCH better. \n\nThe hotel room was clean and the layout was very functional for a small space.  There was plenty of room for the king bed as well as a desk and a chair to sit in front of the window to take in the views.  The bed itself was EXTREMELY comfortable and the staff brought up extra pillows for us. The bathroom was very modern and clean as well.  The kitchenette area included a microwave, fridge, freezer, and various cooking utensils (we didn't stay long enough to use any of these, but it was nice to have them available). \n\nI'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about with the elevator rides taking a long time.  There are several elevators and we never had to wait long for one to take us up or down (and we were there on a holiday weekend).  The actual elevator ride itself is VERY quick. \n\nAs far as complimentary breakfast - GET THERE EARLY.  I read reviews ahead of time that breakfast gets very crowded and\/or runs out quick.  Knowing this, we set our alarm to get down to the third floor breakfast area as soon as it opened each morning.  We never had any issue getting food and there were PLENTY of options available.  There was also plenty of seating.  Also, the coffee is fine.  If you want fancy coffee, step outside the hotel and walk 5 feet to a dedicated coffee shop.  On our last day, we did take trays and brought our breakfast back up to our room so we could enjoy our last day overlooking the Hudson.  We had no issues whatsoever with breakfast. \n\nChecking out was easy as it was done all on the Marriott iPhone app.  Our flight wasn't until later in the day so once again we left our bags with the hotel and then spent the day exploring Central Park.  \n\nAs far as service\/staff goes, everyone we encountered was super friendly.  Even though we had a minor hiccup with our check-in process, the employees were all very willing to work with us to make sure we were happy.  \n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful stay and this hotel is on my list of favorites in the NYC area.","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The biggest advantage is location, especially if you're in NY for the first time, because it's very central and close to several sights and subway stations. The rooms themselves are pretty standard but nicely decorated and clean. They are very small but we were expecting that. Each room also includes a kitchenette which turned out to be really useful to store food in the fridge or reheat some takeout. \nThe biggest drawback of this hotel was the service and the staff and a few small things that just shouldn't be happening in a hotel of this standard and ruined the experience for us. After booking I sent the hotel a few messages to let them know we were coming for our honeymoon and asked if we could have a room on a higher floor. Never got an acknowledgment of receipt. When we arrived we were given a room on one of the lowest floors. That's fine, I understand not every request can be accommodated but the hotel didn't acknowledge in any way we were there for a special occasion which I'd expect from a hotel of this standard (a simple fruit basket or prosecco bottle comes at no extra cost and would have been a nice touch). When we asked if we could potentially move to a room higher up later in the week as we were there for a long time the people in reception looked at us almost with disdain. We were told to come back the next day and ask when the manager was there which we did but again were treated with a look of disdain, a comment that they were full and the manager was standing right behind the desk and also just looked at us with pity and like he just wanted to get rid of us.\nWe had a few small requests\/ questions like whether they had a plug adapter or could tell us where to buy one, what the latest we can check out is etc. Each time we felt like we were just disturbing them  or like we were second rate guests. Wioleta in reception was particularly unpleasant. I guess they know the hotel is fully booked anyway so they don't need to try hard (or at all)\nThe other thing that was just unacceptable was the behaviour of the cleaner. She was incredibly rude and behaving like she was doing us a favour. She knocked on the door a few times ready to clean but we were in the room and asked if she could come back in half an hour as we will be leaving then and each time this was met with a sigh and her mumbling something to herself unhappily under her nose. One day she then said \"ok, I won't come today then\". My husband said no, we still want the room made up today and she just left without a word clearly upset. We used up the one bottle of shower gel we had in the room within two days and this was not replenished for the next 3 days. In the end we asked her if she could please bring us some shower gel so when we left for the day she brought us 10 bottles of shower gel and like 10 towels (which by the way had stains on them). Very passive aggressive. She then didn't turn up the following day clearly thinking we don't deserve her attention. Totally unacceptable. Seeing as the manager tolerated rude behaviour from staff downstairs we didn't even bother complaining.\n\nThere's not much more to say about breakfast as all has already been said in other reviews. It is great to have breakfast included in a hotel in NY as it saves you time and money. Overall we found it to be sufficient but it is very limited and is not replenished regularly which can make for a frustrating experience. Be warned- the coffee is disgusting. It does also get busy and the use of space isn't very smart so you might have to wait for a table.\nTwo other things- one day of our stay two out of the four elevators were out of order which resulted in ridiculous queues to get to breakfast or back to your room. We waited for over 10 minutes on our floor to be able to get down. When you're on the 35th floor or higher it's not really reasonable to expect people to take the stairs. Again, I understand things like that happen but I have stayed in many hotels and have never seen anything like that. One evening we also turned the aircon on in our room and after a few minutes a terrible smell of old frying oil came out of the unit. Probably from the bar which serves snacks until late. It was absolutely disgusting and left me gagging. It took us an hour to air the room out so we could actually go to sleep. These might be small things to some people but they ruined the experience of staying in this hotel for us.\nAnd actually this stay has put me off staying in any Marriott hotel in the future, it's just ruined the brand for me.\nConsidering the really high price we paid for our stay and that we were staying there for a whole week (you'd think they'd treat guests like that with respect) it was not worth it, I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend this hotel. There are far better options in New York for that same or lower price","travelDate":"2018-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Was not happy but the ladies on the Marriott call centre were excellent.\nWe were on the 48th floor of the residence inn. We were greeted by Kimberley at the front desk who was so nice and bubbly it was infectious. What a credit to the organisation she is. Anyways the room while not big was Ok in size and had a fridge (which didn't keep things real cold), but the ice machine on L35 was there to cool things down without issue if required.We had a view of the Hudson and were lucky enough for the clouds to break up and had 2 excellent sunsets. One thing was the the aircon was loud, but we didn't have it on at night so it wasn't a big deal. Also consider the hotels transfer deals. As an example they quoted $95 for transfer to Newark airport. We booked with another transfer company and the cost ended up being $90 with tolls and tips thrown in, so it wasn't worth all the hassle.\nCannot comment on breakfast as for me a piece of fruit will suffice.

However, I still decided to stay here as I would like to experience the view from \"the tallest hotel in North America\" \n\nBelow I would write about what I did experience from this place starting with the plus side:\n\nI stayed here for two period: the first period for two night while the latter is just for a night (being upgraded from the Courtyard). I got the room on high floor -- 63rd and 62nd respectively. Unbeatable view of Manhattan. Really impressive. The location is at the heart of midtown. 5 minutes away to both Central Park, TOTR, and Time Square. The fist period I stayed in Grand Time Square View Room. The room is pretty small. However, for the latter period, I got bigger room with one-king size bed and one single bed that comes with bathtub. Somewhat enjoyable.\n\nHowever, it seems like there are many negative issues I have to share. All are related to their service. Similar to other \"hotels\", the service provided by \"hotels\" are really drain and dry. It is like you are having a frozen food. Just unpack and put in the microwave. All guests received the same standard taste (a bit poor tho).  There is no spiritual. Staffs work as if they are robot. Working for money and forget their passions somewhere between homes and their workplace. (I would like to give a special credit to Rebecca -- the front desk staff who took care me when I checked out in the morning of 18\/3\/18. She is the only one I feel \"wow\" by her energetic hospitality.) Everyone is trained to focus on one job. Do not have ability of multi-tasking. Front desk staffs will know only check in and check out process. They dont even inform me about St.Patrick's parade. Dont know even when and where did it start. For this sort of information, you have to go to concierge counter which located in a small corner in front of Residence Inn's elevators. You may think that, you know, this is true. Front desk is for check in not for information. But this is what I regard as \"robotic service.\" It would be more \"cool\" if you just let the machines do the job (self-check in\/out) and provide 5 (or more ) laptops for customers' self service. At least the customers do not require to pay for tip. lol They also responded annoyingly slow for my emails. Prior to my arrival, I had to make an international call from Bangkok to the hotel as they did not reply my email for over 3 days. Once I called they let me wait for over 5 minutes for answering my simple question. (I asked whether they allowed me to store luggage during both periods of my stay or not). You may read my previous review about this. The peak story was, due to the snow storm, all flights cancelled. I cannot make it to the hotel for my second period. I sent them a message telling them my difficult circumstance asking whether I could be able to cancel my first night of the second period or not. Believe it or not, they replied after I checked out and on my flight back to Bangkok! Ridiculously true story.      \n\nThe facilities in the room is somewhat not useful. My first impression I admitted I was pretty excited seeing kitchen amenities. However, once my feeling was \"cool down\" I asked myself whether I need all those stuffs or not. As a tourist, nobody want to cook when they stay are surrounded by millions of restaurants. What I want is a bathrobe, slippers, \"good quality\" breakfast in which they did not provide. Bathroom amenities was also lacking. I did ask twice for more soap and shampoo.\n\nAll in all, If you would like to experience the view, book here with the high floor. Stay here for a night not more than two. And move to any other better service (or reviews) hotels.","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Was apprehensive having read some reviews particularly regarding room size and breakfast. I needn't have worried. We were met by a very friendly receptionist and despite arriving at midday, our room was ready. We found the room size and layout  just perfect. Space has been used really well with lots of storage. We had a wonderful corner room with views of Times Square. We were on the 40th floor (room 4005) which was high enough to avoid most of the street noise. We went for breakfast each morning. We are early risers so maybe avoided some of the complaints other visitors mentioned regarding lack of space and choice. We found a good selection of hot and cold food (hot maybe a bit limited) but overall perfect for setting us up for the day. The breakfast room was very clean and staff were helpful. The location of the hotel is excellent for discovering New York on foot. For those not wishing to walk there is a subway station nearby. Times Square is approx 5 minute walk and the hotel is located close to all theatres. We arrived in New York a night early and unfortunately this hotel was fully booked. We instead stayed in Row NYC. Suffice to say we will not be staying there again. We were just so relieved to check in to Residence Inn and would recommend it to anyone visiting New York. We also requested a late check out of 1pm which was accommodated without any problems. Overall a wonderful stay. ","travelDate":"2018-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is in a great location, a few blocks from central park and Times square, with supermarkets, restaurants, bars shopping centres, subways within easy walking distance.\n\nThe checkin staff are friendly and professional, and as we arrived early, we were offered an early checkin in the courtyard part of the hotel.

The hotel was heavily booked the next day, so we were offered a discount to stay in our current room, which we accepted.\n\nThe breakfast is excellent \u2013 plenty of choices, and space on the third level with suitable healthy options available for someone like me.  \n\nWifi in the hotel was good, the free version is all that is required, although you can upgrade if you want for 7 usd approx. a day (not needed). \n\nRooms.  The views from the rooms are excellent, especially on the Residence in levels where we were on floor 63.  The addition of a kitchenette is nice, however the actual room was so small that we would have preferred to move back to the courtyard ones.  It was really pokey, with very little space to put a bag and just enough to move around the bed.  The bathrooms in both were great though.\n\nAll in all, we had a great stay, and we will recommend it to others \u2013 it is disappointing that they do not have a bar etc on one of the higher levels, although the 4 level bar was a great place to hang out and the staff were brilliant.

We have a baby in a stroller, and you cannot enter the hotel from the double doors; they are locked and the access button does not work.  Even though the staff could clearly see us trying to enter (a couple of times) with a sleeping baby in a stroller, no one made any effort to open the doors for us.  We had to back out and go through the turnstile entrance, lifting the stroller onto two wheels to try and fit the stroller in.

N\u00e3o obtive resposta alguma. Em segundo lugar, cheguei no hotel em torno das 7:00 am e, como o check in era s\u00f3 a partir das 16:00, pedi novamente na recep\u00e7\u00e3o se seria poss\u00edvel o quarto com final 02. Nada feito. Em terceiro lugar, o check s\u00f3 foi feito \u00e0s 17:00 hs. Em quarto lugar, o quarto que me deram foi justamente aquele que eu menos queria. Mesmo sendo o Park View, tinha uma parede enorme em frente \u00e0 cama  (quarto final 01). A diferen\u00e7a de um quarto para o outro \u00e9 gritante. O quarto final 02 n\u00e3o tem parede alguma, s\u00f3 a janela com vista incr\u00edvel. O quarto final 01 tem uma parede consider\u00e1vel. O que mais me decepcionou foi a falta da resposta do Facebook e uma certa pregui\u00e7a de atender um pedido simples, visto que fiz a reserva com 4 meses de anteced\u00eancia. Em quinto lugar, um dia depois do Reveillon, foi dito que o caf\u00e9 da manh\u00e3 seria restrito. E, realmente foi, com pouqu\u00edssimas op\u00e7\u00f5es.

Maybe move the waffle station to a different part of the seating area (side wall next to the food area)? Eggs were very cold.  Fruit was empty (eventually refilled).  Tea selection was empty.  Maybe it was a staffing issue?  The staff was friendly, however.  Just seemed over-worked.   It's a HUGE area for people to sit and such a small area for the breakfast food area.  \n\nAfter the first morning (of three), we chose to actually go to the diner around the corner and pay for breakfast since we knew it would be better.  Kind of a shame since it's one of the reasons we chose this hotel again.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I found on check in we had a grumpy woman who checked us in who needs to learn how to smile to guests but the others each day when we wanted little things if we didn\u2019t get her the rest were nice. \n\nThe big issue was breakfast, because we arrived on New Year\u2019s Eve I presume the hotel was just full but at breakfast it was like people fighting over the last croissant and juice cup, there was no system whatsoever, the other 5 mornings we were there were still the same but with less people and nowhere to sit once we had our plate of food, the only one morning where we actually enjoyed the breakfast was when they had a receptionist on the door checking names and rooms which made it have a little bit more of a system to it, so I\u2019d highly recommend them to do that in the future as it can get like a zoo in there!! Animals fighting for food lol. \n\nOther than this, be patient with the lifts - they do have a lot of floors to go through and you may have to stop on every one at some point on your holiday.

From the start of our stay we were disappointed in the service provided and the cleanliness of the room.  When we first arrived from the airport we stopped at the front desk and the first young lady we spoke with was very rude and told us to come back at 3:30.  We left and came back at 3 and spoke with another young lady who was extremely polite and helpful.  She told us our room was ready and had been ready.  She got us checked in, took are Marriott gift cards off the bill (which the first lady said couldn't be done til the end of the stay).  We got to the room, the 64th floor, we will say the view was breathtaking.  Hudson River on one side and Central Park on the other.  The room was not clean, we found other guests dirty socks on the floor, food crumbs all over the floor, the sheets did not look clean.  We were too tired to call downstairs so I got clean sheets from housekeeping and changed the sheets myself.  Yes changed the sheets myself as I did not want to deal with anymore rudeness from the staff.  The room needed some freshing up.  Lamp shades were stained, furnishings were very worn. Just not Residence Inn standards.  One day they had only 1 elevator working but none of the staff could tell you that.  Overall staff were rude except for the bellmen and the second lady who checked us in.  Also make sure you check your bill really good.  They like to slip charges in there for $6.00 bottles of water you never drank. Free breakfast became old after the second day as they serve the same thing every day.

After I called for assistance, a cheerful maintenance guy arrived within 30 minutes with a replacement. Very impressive! \n\nMy 49th-floor room was compact by Residence Inn standards though not, necessarily, NYC spaces. The comfortable king-sized bed pretty much filled the living space with the remainder taken by a desk and an over-sized chair and ottoman. The view down Broadway was spectacular.  In the entrance corridor, a long counter with cabinets contained all the typical Residence Inn equipment. \n\nThe highlight of the bathroom was a large spacious shower. The sink area was compact - not really room for two people to lay out toiletries. The commode was 3\/4-sized - it almost looked like a child\u2019s toilet, but It it worked ok. \n\nThe breakfast area is gorgeous, highlighted by tall windows that offer sweeping views of the streets below.

{"helpfulVotes":6,"locationId":6023925,"title":"Not your normal Residence Inn, in many ways","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-01-12","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"I've stayed at a lot of Residence Inn hotels and this is by far the most unique.  Here's what I found good and bad about it. \n\nThis is a VERY high rise hotel, and the Residence Inn occupies the top half of the building so views are amazing.  I was on the 50th floor looking north and could see the Hudson River, Central Park and lots of New York.  The windows in the room are floor to ceiling so you really get to enjoy the views.   Apparently rooms on the south side look over Times Square and most of Manhattan.  If you've never been to New York, or just enjoy skyline views, it would be worth booking this hotel just for that. \n\nThe decor looks like it was lifted directly from the Mondrian Hotel in SoHo (now the NoMo Hotel).  Lots of clean blue, white, black and hip furnishings.  Not at all like many Residence Inns that appear to have been furnished from the generic furniture department at Home Depot.   Might not be everyone's taste, but I appreciated it. \n\nThe shower is amazing.  Great shower head, lots of water pressure, a real shower so you're not just standing in a bathtub, and a floor to ceiling window in the bathroom so you can look out over Manhattan while showering.  Very cool!  (There is a window blind if you're particularly modest, but when you're on the 50th floor I wasn't worried about people peeking in the window). \n\nThe bed is very comfortable, the heating \/ AC works well, WiFi is reliable if not particularly fast and I never had to wait long for elevators which is a good thing in a big hotel that goes up to 65 floors high. \n\nFor the downside, I was on a business trip and Residence Inn's almost always have a useful (often very large) work desk and work style chair.  My room had a small round table and dining chair.  I made it work, but it was a serious flaw in what should be a room you can work in.  There was one section of the room with a white leather chair and another round table in a corner.  A desk would have been great there. \n\nThe only place you can see the TV is from the bed.  There are two chairs in the room,\nbut their placement and the floorplan mean you can't use them to watch TV.  I was thinking the TV might be on a swivel mount so you could adjust it a bit - but it wasn't.  \n\nA key element of a Residence Inn is a kitchen which I always enjoy to be able to keep a snack or light meal.  The one here is small, which isn't bad considering it's in the heart of New York, but it didn't have any cooktop - only a microwave.  However somebody managed to stock it with pots and pans (probably Marriott standard issue for a Residence Inn) even though you have no way to use them.  Seems like nobody thought that one through. \n\nOne evening I went down to the bar area on the 4th floor.  It's large and nicely done and has huge windows to look out at the street scenes.  It wasn't crowded but at least 50% of the empty tables had dirty glasses and dishes on them.  Not sure if a big party just left but it was a mess.  Then a few minutes after I got my drink the lights got much brighter and they started a painting class in a section of the lounge.   It's a really nice space, but didn't end up being welcoming or relaxing. \n\nOverall I would recommend this hotel for visitors to New York.  The views from the rooms are incredible.  The rooms are comfortable, showers are great, and staff are friendly.   If you're going to need to do much work in your room - or thinking you might actually prepare a light meal or relax and watch some TV it's not going to be your best choice.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I was upgraded to a corner room on the 39th floor w\/city view. The rooms are contemporary & \"cozy\" with floor-to-ceiling glass on two sides. This is not an asset in winter, as the heating system cannot keep up with (and blows air directly on) the cold, drafty windows. After you set thermostat to desired temp, the system shuts off & will not go on again until temp. is 68 degrees or less. (I don't know if this was a flaw or hotel \"energy-conservation.\") Overnight, I woke up chilled 3x & had to turn the temp setting higher for warmth. Also, as guests from London & Boston reported, the b'fast experience was a disaster. Even though the lounge area is large w\/many seating options, the architect failed w\/a service area that is too small for the volume of guests. I saw only two (2) staff on duty. One could not keep up w\/outages of food, silverware & beverages. The other was fighting a loosing battle against dirty dishes left on tables & drop-off station.

The service area was far too small to cope with the amount of residents and there were very few staff on hand to top up the platters of food that were running low or out.   In the dining area tables were not cleared and there was an alcove stacked high with dirty plates and crockery. Staffing seemed to be a problem here.

However, the view was worth it - we had a perfect view of sunset, and corner views of the city and of Central Park.  I checked in by phone the day before and was guaranteed a two double room, but upon onsite check-in was given a different room.  I insisted on what I had been told, and due to my elite status, I got what I wanted, but I don't know how other guests would have been treated. The limo service provided by bell desk seemed pretty shady.  He didn't confirm my destination, he had no change and told me my credit card didn't work.  I insisted on trying it myself and it worked just fine.  It felt like a scam to get more tip from me.  Use Lyft instead.  Breakfast felt like a low rate diner  or bad airline club - I did not go back the second day.

We wanted to be near Broadway & Central Park (our old stomping grounds) and used points for our stay. We were upgraded to a room with a spectacular view overlooking Central Park ...

Additionally, the entire bathroom smelled heavily of urine during our whole stay, as if people had been peeing down the shower drain.

There was also an issue printing our boarding passes so I had to do it at the front desk and there were problems there as well because front desk staff obviously needed to be assisting check-ins.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Choose between the Hudson River (watch the ships), Central Park, or Downtown -- all are amazing. The rooms themselves are top notch -- spacious, clean, good fixtures in the bathrooms, and all the right amenities (large desktop, large TV, comfortable side chair, great shower, bath with large sink, and kitchen counter with sink and small refrigerator and freezer). And don't forget the location -- just blocks from Times Square, the theatre district, MOMA, and much more.\n\nHowever, the rest leaves me with a 1-1\/2*\nThere were three areas that left me wondering how I could end up in a hotel this bad. I also wish to share with you that this is my fifth visit to this property, and each time it gets worse. Perhaps they'll read this review and do something about it. Here we go:\n\na) There are only 4 elevators servicing this 64-story hotel (only the top half has rooms for this property, but there are still a lot of guests using the property. There are times during hotel \"rush hour\" where I've had to wait over 5 minutes for an elevator, and several times they are full. Part of the problem is that hotel staff (e.g., housekeeping and maintenance, each with their carts) share the same 4 elevators, and tend to go in the elevators during rush hour too; they ring for the elevator, it stops, they see that there is no room for their carts, and they let the door close; they then repeat to process. If that doesn't slow the elevators down even further,...! It is not practical to add another elevator. But it would be practical to either devote one elevator to service (at least at rush hour) or to have such staff plan their travels so they don't need to bring their carts with them during rush hour (even if they must leave them in a closet on each floor).\n\nb) Breakfast comes included with the rooms. It is a self-service buffet comprised of a couple of fresh fruits, a few cheeses, oatmeal, waffles, scrambled eggs, meats, breads, yogurts, coffee, juice, etc. So why would I prefer to go down the street and buy a breakfast? Because this place is totally mismanaged. Food runs out; no one does anything about it until this happens, and then someone must go into the kitchen and look for it; sometimes the reinforcements are on another floor; and if it is within 20 minutes of closing time (9:30am), they don't even bother. If you wait for the food to come, any hot food you've taken will be cold. Coffee runs out (especially decaf), and no staff knows until it is reported. Has anyone in management heard of the term \"proactive?\" This atmosphere even causes frustration with the guests, resulting in the food hall equivalent of road rage! Once, I even had someone \"steal\" my waffle out of the iron as I was reaching toward it to put it on my plate! What this place needs is a full-time staff to stay in the food hall; give them an iPad to alert kitchen staff when each food is getting low, and when it needs to be replaced; also, keep general order in the area. It's not hard!\n\nc) It shouldn't take 10 minutes for the front desk to pick up the phone. And when one tells them that the shower stayed locked in the on position and wouldn't shut off, and the bathroom was flooding, one shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes to discover that the front desk person got distracted and forgot to report it to maintenance (this was discovered when I had to call the desk again 10 minutes later); finally maintenance came up and fixed the problem, needing a special tool.\n\nThese are all examples of things that can be fixed, as long as management is doing its job. \n\nSo to sum it all up, a 3 stars. Everything there was either great (*****) or really bad (*). The good news is that the bad can be fixed -- all it takes is better management. Let's hope it happens!","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff are all friendly and all really helpful.\n\nOur room was on the 40th floor and had a view towards the river and we could see the cruise ships as they pulled in to dock.  The room was not a bad size, it had a huge bed that was really comfy.  There is a small kitchenette which includes a fridge and freezer, really useful for storing drinks.  The bathroom is a good size with great water pressure from the shower, i'm not sure if it was a deep shower tray or very shallow bath.\n\nBreakfast is included but is a bit of a gimmick, they are not very quick at replenishing stocks, and it seems like when it's gone it's gone.\n\nThe location is brilliant it's a short walk to either Central Park or Time Square, there are also loads of subway stations nearby.  There are also loads of shops, bars and restaurants all really close.  There is also good Wi-Fi in the room, which is free to guests.\n\nAfter getting a cab to the hotel we were offered a hotel car to the airport, it was a little bit dearer than the cab but should've been so much easier.  Sadly the driver was shocking, I think he kept falling asleep as he was drifting all over the road and there were lots of sudden braking incidents.\n\nThey add about 3 different taxes to the room cost which puts it up quite a lot, this can be a shock if you're not aware of them, which we weren't.\n\nA great hotel that I would stay at again if I was to return to NYC.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our last NYC visit, we stayed in lower Manhattan & visited the WTC memorial, S-of-Liberty.  This time we wanted to be up north closer to Central Park & the Theatre district.  \n\nPositives:\nOur suite was on the 63rd floor and we had views of CP (partially blocked by a building in construction) & Hudson River. The room had a kitchenette w\/ stuff for cooking (you can request a hotplate from housekeeping).  We mainly used the frig & microwave for heating leftovers and keeping our drinks, fruit, Juniors cheesecake chilled.  Comfy bed; soft sheets; good shower pressure; fluffy towels.  Good gym; no pool.\n\nGiving 1 less star due to these negatives; not up to Marriott standards:\n- Our room had a wheel-chair accessible shower & the overall design needs to be redone.  The open shower sloped away from the drain & left the bath floor totally flooded after a shower.  To remedy this, we made a dam of towels to prevent water from flooding the floor.  Being an ADA room; we were curious that the sink\/counter-top was taller than normal.  There was a round table (for extra towels) in the corner that partially blocked the doorway and took space away from the bathroom.  Shelves & hooks can be used for this instead?  The room decor is a little worn out (carpet stains, shreds), nicked furniture, sticking drawers.\n\n- The breakfast lounge w\/ plenty of tables & seating is very large & shared w\/ the Courtyard.  The buffet service area & layout is way too tight to accommodate that many ppl trying to get food.  If you go during peak hrs (after 8:30am), food runs out quickly and you won't find a clean space to eat.  The tables are not bused or cleaned timely.  Sorry to say, the breakfast attendants were going through the motions to minimally get by.  \n\nOverall, this RI is due for a remodel\/refresh (suites, hallways are dark\/depressing, slow & tiny elevators); re-layout of the breakfast buffet service area.  The staff are professional, but not as warm\/service-oriented as other Marriott properties I've stayed. Prime location; easy walking to CP, Theatres, Hell's Kitchen restaurants & public transport. Probably would not stay here again as there are plenty of other Marriott branded hotels in NYC to experience.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The bed was comfortable and laundry facilities proved useful. Not many choices for food at the bar on the 4th floor, but it was nice to be able to pop down for a drink. Breakfast was included and available on the 3rd floor.\n\nWe did have some problems with very rude staff early in our stay- to the point that we almost left the hotel- but after speaking to district manager, things were rectified and we felt comfortable enough to stay the rest of week. Overall the majority of the staff were professional, we just encountered a couple were over-the-top rude and inappropriate, such as the kitchen manager who chased my husband down to tell him he couldn't take a breakfast tray to our room despite being told by other staff it was okay and despite many other guests doing the same without issue.

Although the cost of the room is higher than what I usually pay, I splurged on this one because of the views. I surprised my husband with his first trip to NYC for his birthday. I requested a high floor, and was assigned 6402. There are 65 floors, so we were close to the top. When I made my online reservation, I noted this was a surprise for my husband's birthday. The view from the room is nothing like I've seen before. This room has a panoramic window where you could see Central Park to the north and Times Square to the south. We kept the curtains pulled open all the way the entire time we were here. To fall asleep with the lights of the city, and to wake up with the sunrise was wonderful. The bed is very comfortable. When you enter the room, you must insert your room key into a slot on the wall in order for the lights to work. Very interesting and caused no problem at all. It was nice because we always knew where one of our keys were. After our first full day out touring the city, when we arrived back to our room there was a birthday cake with a candle and champagne to celebrate my husbands birthday from the Guest Relations Manager, Jamie Bond. We were so impressed by this kind gesture. Every morning we went down to the 3rd floor for breakfast. It had a very good selection of hot and cold items, fruits, oatmeal, bagels, toast, etc. The only thing I feel that would have made my stay better was for the hotel to offer complimentary bottles of water for tourists who have been out in the heat all day. The 4th floor did have complimentary ice cold water that was easily accessible, but with tiny plastic cups. Overall, I do hope to stay here again in the future and do highly recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This was our first trip to New York. We found the location of the hotel just perfect for what we wanted to see and visit (the usual stuff I guess : Manhattan, Times Square, Central Park, 9\/11 memorial and museum, One World, Top of the Rock, Liberty, Ellis, \u2026). We had booked a superior room with view on Times Square. On check-in I asked for a room on higher floors and we got a room on 59th floor, room 5907. The view was stunning ! On the right, view on the Hudson, on the front, view on Times Square. The only downside on the view was a building of about the same height under construction, which partly obstructed the view, but the hotel can\u2019t help that and the view was great nevertheless. \n\nThe room itself was very nice, rather small but with all you need, bed very comfortable. The only points that could be improved : the air-conditioning is rather noisy, and some details could be given more attention (joints between tiles on the shower floor not all the same color, furniture shows some signs of \u201cwear & tear\u201d). This room had a kitchenette with fridge (even with ice-maker), micro-wave, tea and coffee-making facilities, plates, glasses, cups, cutlery and dish-washing machine\u2026 This has been useful for having a snack in the room on some occasions. \n\nBased on many reviews we read here, we were skeptical about breakfast, but we found it very good actually. To be fair you really need to be there before 8.30 otherwise it gets very busy and you may not find correct seating. But they mention it in the lobby, so that doesn\u2019t come as a surprise. If you go after 9.00, which we did once, they don\u2019t refill the buffet anymore as they close at 9.30  so the available choice selection really shrinks.  But with all there is to see and do in NYC and also with the jet lag the first days, we didn\u2019t feel like getting up late  and were there around 7.00 or 7.30 on most days, and that was perfect. \n\nThe staff is very friendly, we did not ask much help as we had made our program already, but when we did they helped us and we got the answers we needed. \n\nWe surely recommend this hotel !","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we arrived they tried to put us in a room with ONE king size bed! According to them, the booking was done for 2 people. I had a printout to prove that we had a reservation for 2 adults and 2 children but the guy at the check-in was not very helpful or understanding. He first told us to look at other hotels outside of Manhattan and blamed everything on Booking.com and said that the hotel was overbooked already and he could not help us.\nNot until I asked to talk to the manager a solution was found. We were put in the Courtyard by Marriot hotel (in the same building) for one night and then moved to a Studio with two beds after that.\nWe had already prepaid for the rooms and we got no compensation for staying one night in a cheaper hotel.\nTwo things are upsetting about this:\n1. He blamed everything on booking.com and said that this has happened many times before. Then why don't they fix that problem or stop using third party bookings?\n2. The attitude of the guy at the reception. When you are tired and jetlagged you do not want to hear that you should go look elsewhere for accomodation.\n\nOtherwise the hotel is OK. The view (when we finally got our room) was nice. The location is good. The Studio is spatious. The breakfast is OK, but was very crowded.

I emailed the hotel beforehand and Jamie replied. He was extremely helpful and kind, and ensured us he would do his best to make it a special stay.\n\nThe hotel is in an excellent location, between Central Park and Times Square, both of which are perfectly walkable. It is the top half of a building that belongs to Marriott (the bottom half being the Courtyard Hotel). The rooms start at level 36 and so all have excellent views. We were allocated a room on the 65th floor and it was STUNNING. It completely made our trip. In the room were some goodies for our anniversary as well which was a lovely touch, and a card. For a hotel this large, to have such a personal touch, was simply fantastic. \n\nThe room, was a reasonable size with a brilliant bathroom (the shower was great). It was great to have a kitchenette and the popcorn was a wonderful touch. The bed was VERY comfortable.\n\nI have to have a separate paragraph dedicated to Housekeeping. If the hotel reads this, PLEASE thank the lady who made our room. She was the best we have EVER had. She went way beyond her duty, even emptying our dishwasher, tidying everything to an excellent degree each day, etc. The most impressive thing was one morning when I pulled the towel too hard and the towel rail came out on one side. I popped it back into the wall and you wouldn't have known it was damaged, and I intended to tell reception later in the day. When we got back a few hours later, it was already fully repaired...\nShe had spotted the dust on the floor from the plaster, informed maintenance, and they had repaired it back to perfection all in the few hours we were out. Contrast this to some hotels where you never get something repaired, we didn't even have to notify anyone. It was fixed before we could! Absolutely amazing.\n\nBreakfast was reasonable and there was a nice selection. It was never too busy. \n\nIf you want a special place to stay, then pick this hotel.

We had hoped on the wrong subway which resulted in us walking nearly 20 blocks during the weekend's one and only downpour. Needless to say we weren't in the best of moods when we arrived. \n\nKenya at the Front Desk changed that in an instant. After apologizing that our larger room was not yet available she got us in a room that was a bit smaller but still had a wonderful view - 5408. We could see Times Square and the Hudson River. To be honest, i enjoyed this more! We could see cruise ships docked etc. After hearing us apologize for getting water all over the floor (we were soaked) she gave us free drinks in the lounge. Now that is a way to kick off our trip. \n\nThe room itself was great, no complaints there! \n\nBreakfast was wonderful every morning and I loved the free water station. We would fill up our bottles before heading out each day! \n\nCentrally located near Rockefeller Center and Stephen Colbert. It's about 6 blocks away from Times Square and one block from a subway stop on 53rd. \n\nAll and all Kenya made this trip. She is truly an asset to the property! Fantastic customer service!","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We requested a high floor for old views and we weren't disappointed! The room was clean and perfectly big enough for our stay. \n\nBreakfast had a range of choice from bagels to waffles to fruit to hot food. The hot food was very limited and some I would say had to be to your liking, especially as we were from the uk, we weren't familiar with some of the meats on offer.\n\nThe hotel was very central to where we wanted to be, it was within a good walking distance of Times Square, Central Park and various other areas.\n\nThe staff were lovely and very accommodating. Our only disappointment was on my birthday, we returned to our room after being out all day to find our room door had been left open by housekeeping. We contacted reception and complained. Within 5 minutes the duty manager phoned back and we were compensated with a free drink and appetiser at the bar. Luckily nothing was taken from the room but we requested no further housekeeping for the remainder of the stay. I think the hotel was as mortified as we were this had happened.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant and comfortable stay.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}
{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":6023925,"title":"Great location, beautiful View","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-05-06","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"We booked the hotel room a few hours before our arrival to New York City for an event the next day.  Since I arrived first, I attempted to check in at the Residence Inn by Marriott under my partner\u2019s name (he booked it); however, the lovely lady who was helping us could not find us in the systems.  After multiple attempts to check the system in various ways, she told me to contact Booking.com (where we booked the hotel room) to verify the booking and to check if there was an error on their end, especially considering that my partner has a longer, complicated name that has given us grief in the past.  As soon as my partner landed in NYC and was en-route to the hotel, he called Booking.com to sort out the matter.  The agent at Booking.com called the hotel and spoke with Claire (I believe that was her name) regarding the issue to see what was going on.  At that point, I had been speaking with another receptionist, in case the system had updated; however, once my partner told me that the agent from Booking.com was speaking with Claire, I went over to her.  She told the agent that she would hold a room for us, and asked the agent if we were en-route.  As soon as I heard that, I let her know that I was there but my partner was en-route.  She offered to take my information and get me a room, but to avoid any further issues and\/or duplicity in charges, I opted to wait until my partner arrived.\n\nFrom what my partner was told, when you make a reservation on Booking.com, the reservation goes onto a server shared between the provider and the hotel.  This server must be accessed by someone to update the reservations in the hotel\u2019s reservation systems.  Usually, the only people that have access to this system are the managers, so once they go home at the end of their shifts, and you book late, the hotel\u2019s list of arrivals will not automatically update with the reservation.  As such, you\u2019re a little out of luck with that.  This is good information to know for future reference when booking through third-party providers such as Booking.com and TripAdvisor. \n\nOnce my partner arrived (past midnight), we went up to Claire, and she put in all the relevant information-name and credit card.  She honored the price that was initially shown by Booking.com when we reserved the room, and clarified that she will let her managers know about the issue we experienced.  We voiced our concerns about being charged twice for the hotel room (because Booking.com always says they will charge us), and she stated that Booking.com does not charge the clients; only the hotel does.  She eased our worries by saying that she will let her manager know via email about the name; that way, when he and other managers see our name in the shared server, they will know not to process that request and double charge us.  After a few more minutes of talk, she checked us into room on the sixty-second (62) floor of the Residence Inn (word of caution: there are two hotels, the Courtyard and Residence Inn, in one building).  \n\nGreat customer service! I could not be more pleased by how everything was handled by the team at reception. In addition, I forgot my battery pack for my phone in the lobby, and when I returned to retrieve it, Claire and the other person at reception turned to the security guy to ask him if he found it.  Immediately, he went out and got it for me, after checking to make sure that I didn\u2019t lose anything else.  He also told me where he found the battery pack (behind the pillow on one of the chairs). It was a good reminder that I should never ever let things out of my sight. \n\nThe room was a nice, medium sized room.  When we walked into the room, on our left, we saw a sink and countertop with lots of cabinet-space, and a coffeemaker, popcorn and some water (you have to pay for the water, everything else is free).  We were a little confused as to what that layout was for, until we realized that it is part of a kitchen (you can ask for electric stovetops).  We didn\u2019t use it as we were staying for one night, and breakfast was included in our reservation.  I\u2019m still not quite sure why we would want a kitchen in the hotel room, especially when you have breakfast included, but perhaps that is a good idea for lunch and dinner if you don\u2019t want to eat out in NYC and spend a lot of money.  That said, it\u2019s the first time I have seen a hotel provide a microwave and popcorn. I LOVED that idea!\n\nIn front of us, as we entered the room, there was a sliding door to the bathroom.  Toiletries (we asked for toothpaste and a toothbrush) were provided, and below the sink, I found a hair-dryer in a bag, next to extra towels.  The shower was a nice sized shower, with (what I like to call) a European showerhead.  It is one of those showerheads that you can remove from the hook and move it around to wash yourself or place it on a lower hook in case you didn\u2019t want to wash your hair and good for children to shower. \n\nOn the right side of the entrance, there was a little closet which had a safe, an iron, an ironing board and enough space to hang up clothes.  A little further down was the entrance to the room, through which you could see the king-sized bed, and the chair by the window.  To the left of the entrance, in the bedroom space, there was a large desk with a lamp and a chair.  There was plenty of space to put both my partner\u2019s and my items.  Over it, there was a large TV, and next to it, was another table so the desk seemed longer than it was.  By the large windows, there was an ottoman and the chair, as I mentioned above.  It was comfortable to sit in and look out the windows to enjoy the beautiful views.  Each side of the bed had its own nightstand and light, with space to plug in our phones.  Everything in the room was clean, and fresh.\n\nThe views were absolutely gorgeous! We were enthralled by them and spent a good many minutes both at night and in the morning taking it in.  Our room faced towards Times Square, and you could see the bright billboards and people streaming even at such a late hour (it was almost 1 am at this point).  It was a good thing that the room came with light-blocking curtains because the lights from Times Square are so bright that they lit up the room all on their own when we tried to sleep.  On the other hand, I loved waking up in the morning to the views and seeing New York City wake up.  At five am, you could see that Times Square was quiet and empty, but by seven or eight am, people trickled in. \n\nThe bed was comfortable and very big\u2014more than enough for two people.  One thing that I am not a fan of\u2014although I understand that it\u2019s purely for aesthetic reasons\u2014is having more than four pillows on the bed.  These extra pillows are mostly for decorative purposes as opposed to being used for sleeping.  Due to the roughness of the material on these decorative pillows, the fact that there are so many of them, and the hardness of the pillows, we simply had to get rid of them by pushing them to the sides.  The pillows provided for sleeping purposes, however, were divine.  They have a good balance of being soft and being supportive of the neck and head, aligning the spinal column for the night.  We slept very well despite going to bed around one am and having to wake up at around seven-thirty am.\n\nWe headed for breakfast, which is served from seven to around ten am on weekends.  It was all you can eat buffet in a small area within a larger, very classy area.  I loved the breakfast, especially the waffles and the apple crumble cake; however, my partner lamented the fact that there was no bacon to go with the eggs, and the eggs were a little cold and bland.  Outside of the small buffet area, there was a second area for the coffees and teas.  We sat close to the entrance to the buffet area, underneath a huge tv, in big white chairs, which were comfortable.  The rest of the area was set up with different chairs and in different configurations, all of which were done with some forethought of the guests at the hotel.  On numerous occasions, we observed guests from the hotel next door looking out of their windows, and into the dining area of our hotel.  It was a little strange to be eating breakfast while being stared at, but you can\u2019t really help it because the dining area has huge, ceiling to floor windows, and you have a view of the street.  \n\nAfter breakfast, we took one of the four elevators from the third floor (breakfast area) up to the sixty-second floor.  The elevators are very fast but very small, and get packed quickly, which is a con.  If you are claustrophobic this is not the place for you to be unless you miraculously find and get on an empty elevator.  During the ride up, we spoke with someone on the forty-second floor, who had views to Central Park, and said that it was beautiful, even though some of the views are getting obstructed by buildings at this point.  Perhaps the next time we stay at the Residence Inn, we will get attempt to get a room with a view of Central Park.  As a nature\/urban photographer, I would really love to get a few shots of the park as the sun is rising.\n\nCheck out was a breeze because all we had to do was stop by a counter, give our cards in and state our hotel and room number.  No hassle, not much waiting (at nine fourty-five am, it was getting very busy with people checking in and out), and we were on our way out.  \n\nTo clarify about the two-hotels-in-one that I mentioned earlier:  The building is a joint Courtyard and Residence Inn building.  You check in for both hotels at the one reception area where they do everything relating to both hotels on two separate systems; however, the hotels are split by the elevators and there does not appear to be an interchangeable floor between the hotels above the lobby.  So if you\u2019re in the Residence Inn, and take the elevator for it, you stay in the Residence Inn.  The way that the elevators work is if you\u2019re in the lobby and looking at the black wall at the end of the lobby on the left side, closest to reception, are the elevators for the Residence Inn.  On the right side, further away from reception, are the elevators for the Courtyard.  I am not sure how the floors are laid out, because the Residence Inn seems to be facing Times Square, yet the individual on the forty-second floor was facing Central Park, even though he was in the Residence Inn.  \n\nAlso, you need your keycards for the elevator to work (there is a black circular sensor on the wall to swipe\/ press the keycard), and for the lights and A\/C in your room to turn on in the Residence Inn.  As summers tend to get hot and humid in NYC, if you are coming during the next few months, you might want to ask for an extra key card (especially if you\u2019re a couple or with kids), so that you can leave one keycard in the room to keep the A\/C going. \n\nI would love to return to the Residence Inn if I ever decide to stay in NYC proper again.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Senior personnel such as duty management staff set a bad example, in my view.

Auch die Aussicht auf Broadway und Central Park ist selbst aus den unteren Etagen, aber sicher nicht in allen Zimmern, noch ein Highlight. Der Empfang war sehr freundlich.\nDie Zimmer sind von der Einrichtung ok aber nicht wirklich praktisch, die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe unseres Zimmers war recht knapp. Die kleine K\u00fcche nimmt zudem viel zu viel Platz in Anspruch. Praktische L\u00f6sungen wie Kofferablage, Kleiderst\u00e4nder oder einfach ein paar Garderobenhaken fehlen dagegen komplett. Auch im Bad w\u00e4ren praktische L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr Handtuchhalter oder Ablagen sicher besser als Designl\u00f6sungen. Pluspunkt ist das gro\u00dfe Bett.\nZimmerservice - na ja, meist erst am Nachmittag und doch ein wenig oberfl\u00e4chlich, z. Bsp. das Radio die ganze Woche verstaubt. \nWir hatten mit Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck gebucht, unsere Erwartungen waren nicht hoch aber f\u00fcr diese Preisklasse erwarte ich mehr als Kantinenflair. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksangebot war gut aber doch recht \u00fcberschaubar. Das Geschirr aus Plastik - geht gar nicht! Ansonsten komplette Selbstbedienung, es wurde nur \"abger\u00e4umt\" und selbst das haben die meisten G\u00e4ste noch selbst \u00fcbernommen. Wenn das dann schon Mal die Mitarbeiter ber\u00e4umt haben, dann w\u00fcrde das mit Plastekiste eingesammelt und im Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksraum schon, wenig diskret, k\u00fcchenfertig vorsortiert. \nFazit: die gl\u00e4nzende Fassade ist nicht alles. F\u00fcr \u00dcbernachtung in Manhatten ok - aber den Preis bezahlt man hier f\u00fcr Lage und Aussicht, aber nicht f\u00fcr Qualit\u00e4t, Service und Wohlf\u00fchlen.

The rooms are much smaller than the usual Residence Inn properties where I've stayed, HOWEVER, the views from every room are spectacular. The hotel sacrificed room space to insure every room got a beautiful view. My room was a corner room (which I believe they all may be given the floor plan) with floor to ceiling windows on the outside walls. For those of us who are sensitive to light, the room has heavy duty, floor to ceiling curtains that block out all of the light. The room was quiet and clean and the bed comfortable and the linens of good quality. My only minor complaint was with the AC\/Heating unit.(The thorn in many a frequent traveler's side). It was a tad noisy and, due to the smaller size of the room and where the vent was located,  blew with great gusto right on to my face all night. I did figure out how to close the vent at the ceiling as I found I needed to keep it on to prevent the room from getting too stuffy.  I would still stay here again, to spite the AC unit, as the hotel has so many good qualities.

Our 2nd visit to this hotel, in just over 12 months. \n\nThe Good:\n1) The views from room 5207 were outstanding; a king bed, city view room. We could see the Hudson on one side and the top of the ball-drop to the other; just stunning.\n \n2) Fantastic location between Central Park and Times Square. Slightly closer to the park than the square. Tasty 99c pizza (shop) just around the corner (broadway), subway just down the road and at the other end (turn right) there's a Macdonalds\/ Wendy's. Across that road is the Westerly Natural Market which sells amazing (natural) fresh salads (starting at $3.49) sandwiches and soup(s) - a vitamin lovers paradise too!! \n\n3)The staff were polite and helpful. \n\nThe Bad:\n1) Over a 10 day period the breakfast options barely changed; variations between sausage\/ turkey patties (looked vile), spicy sausages (husband loved these), scrambled egg (tasteless) and\/ or bread\/ gravy (didn't try this). On one occasion, over cooked bacon was served. On the hot side, they serve porridge too (didn't try this). Two kinds of  fresh fruit (chopped) are served daily, there was usually apples\/ bananas in limited supply and on a couple of days, we had lovely tasty strawberries. The yougurt selection (not bad) also varies daily, bread\/ bagels, fresh cheese (one choice daily) and theres the usual condiments (jam, nutella, syrup, philidelphia etc). The best (and only thing) that was really good about breakfast was the waffle machine - lovely fresh waffles in abundance IF you beat the crowds to one of the two machines. Beware of the dust up the walls to the ceiling, as you stand in front of the waffle machine though (its clearly visible). Theres also cake (tasteless stodgy junk) served daily, along with 3 choices of juice (concentrated\/ sweet junk), coffee (quite good) and milk available - along with 3\/4 choices of cereal (no granola though). \n\nIf you are an early riser you'll beat the crowds (<8am) but after that be prepared to queue\/ wait for trays, plates\/ cutlery (check these are clean, as I encountered some that weren't), waffles, toasted 'anything' and for the hot food to be replenished. During the week you'll quite easily find a seat but of a weekend, you may well have to wait to sit and eat your breakfast comfortably; you are probably better off taking it back to your room in this instance. The breakfast area where the food is, gets very, very busy, very quickly - to the extent you are knocking into others. So my advice is get there early if you want to eat without any hassle at all. Newspapers are available to read and there are TVs dotted around the room. The longest I waited for a lift to\/ from breakfast was approx' 5 minutes. That's breakfast in a nutshell!! \n\nAfter 3\/4 days breakfast becomes very tiresome, due to a lack of variation. Why is there only scrambled eggs everyday? Cooking up fried\/ poached eggs would make a nice change!! Don't overcook the bacon, throw on some beans, cooked tomatoes and some mushrooms in the mix please!!? My husband can eat for England but even he was fed up after a few days, to the extent he stopped going down for breakfast. He also couldn't tolerate the rude people who'd literally stand and watch you eat (3\/4 feet away) - ready and waiting to pounce when you moved from the table. \n\nFact is - we\/ you pay for the breakfast as it's included in the price - it's not free. Take or leave it folks, it fills a void but that's about it. Certainly nothing to get excited about. \n\nThe Ugly:\n1) From the point of arrival onwards, there was constant layer of dust around the whole room which seems to get worse when the air-cons switched on. I could write my name in this on the bedside table. This never seemed to go away and I also noticed the floor could have done with a really good\/ proper hoover (dyson kind x 2!!). On our arrival, we also found the remnants of cardboard shoe shapers (cardboard things that go in shoes to help them retain their shape) under the chair in our room. The cleaners surface clean - but the room clearly needed a proper, deep clean. It felt dusty\/ dirty and when we switched the air-con on, every single time we both start coughing (uncontrollably) - I presumed this was all dust related too. \n\n2) Following my first nights sleep - I awoke to a huge, swollen 'nasty' bite on the back of my neck. I didn't see any bugs (and didn't check for any, as that would have freaked me out) - but given that it normally takes 12 hours for a bite to show\/ come up - the timing indicated that it happened in the room. Obviously - I'm unable to prove this was the case. \n\n3) The bed sheets were not changed for at least 5 nights - how and why I do not know. When they were changed the top (noisy, crinkly) sheet\/ cover had part of a sweet stuck to it !! Not the standard we expect in any hotel. The pillowcases were changed after a couple of days. Otherwise, the bed was very comfy. \n\n4) On some days the clean towels were stark white, lovely and fluffy - but on others they were thin\/ tired and stained. \n\n5) We stayed in room 5207 which was near the lifts. As soon as those lifts moved we could hear them from our room. Not to the extent they would keep us awake at night but they certainly woke me up a couple of mornings (very early); I'm not a light sleeper either. I'd ask for a room that's located as far away from the lifts, as possible. \n\nOther:\n1) A very comfy SUV to JFK or Newark from the hotel door, will cost you $75 (inc tip) and $95 (inc tip) respectively. Last year the journey to JFK took us nearly two hours and this year, the journey to Newark took us approx 25 minutes. The luggage guys in the hotel lobby will organise this for you; just ask. A cab to Penn Station\/ MSG will set you back around $11 (without tip).\n\n2) The shopping is amazing (not cheap due to the exchange rate) - but beware all UK shoppers, you'll pay New York tax on anything over $109. I purchased some running pants which cost $115 and the New York tax on top of this was $10; so the pants actually cost me $125. \n\nWoodbury Common (outlet) - is a nice\/ worthwhile shopping day out; clothes, shoes, bags etc. It's not unlike the outlet villages in the UK - it's about an hour from the city and costs $40 return per person. Check out 'Woodbury Common' online for the booking and pick-up\/ drop-off details; 3 morning\/ evening, pick-up\/ drop-off times but the locations vary for pick-ups and there's only one drop-off point (not far from Times Sq area). \nNote - on both occasions when I've been, I did not book online - I went to the pick-up point at the Sheraton Hotel (8am) and spoke to the driver who said I could pay on the bus. That said, the website states you aren't guaranteed a seat on the busy if it's full but it wasn't on either occasion, when I went in January.  \n\n3) I've flown with AA (JFK) and UA (Newark) direct from\/ to the UK. The latter was after Virgin changed my return direct flight to indirect, so I cancelled with them and I eventually rebooked with UA. Both flights were absolutely fine; I rated our UA flight better (overall) as we had in seat entertainment (free with free headphones) and the staff were up\/ down the cabin, constantly serving drinks etc....whereas with AA there was no in seat entertainment and the regularity of service was less frequent. \n\nSo - that covers the things I think are worth mentioning and the rest is up to you decide. \n\nWould I stay in this hotel again? - maybe\/ possibly - but that would solely depend upon the price. That said there are plenty of hotels to choose from; they all have their pros and cons!! Like I've said, the pros with this hotel are the location and views!!!\n\nOne constant is the fact that NYC is a totally, amazing city to visit - for anyone of any age. So don't hesitate in booking!!","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Wound up at Residence Inn.  Pretty bad experience.  \n\nThere were 2 primary problems we had with this stay.  First is the size of the room.  It's  so damn small.  I get it that NYC has small hotel rooms, but for two people it's just too small, and the layout of the room is terrible where the area for the entry and little kitchenette is really wasted space.  There was nowhere really good for us to put our suitcase so it was left just kind of sitting on the floor in that area.  And there was nowhere comfortable to sit.  There was one chair that one person could sit in, so then the other person was left sitting on the bed which isn't comfortable as a place to sit upright.  \n\nBut the real significant problem was noise.  The heater is horrible and blows like a jet engine when it's on.  Why hotels end up having small rooms with loud jet engines is beyond me.  But that's what this one was.  Then there was the elevator.  We still don't understand how that made so much noise in our room.  Our best theory is that it was the rattling of the counterweights of the elevator (which you can hear just standing there waiting for an elevator) and that the noise came in the room through the vents.  Regardless, the noise from the elevators was seriously like a truck driving through the room.  You'd hear it at a distance, then it would get louder and louder, rattling, and then pass.  The third noise was the refrigerator in the room which rattled and was horrible.  Thankfully we were able to pull the refrigerator out from under the counter and unplug it so at least we could eliminate 1 out of the 3 noises.  \n\nThis all added up to a terrible stay.  Not a single restful night's sleep out of the 3 nights we stayed there.  \n\nBeyond that, the room was mostly clean, although the packet of sugar sitting under the bed stayed there through our entire stay so the cleaning folk's attention to detail was not the highest.  The hotel itself is a bit run down overall.  In hindsight we should have stayed at the Hilton next door.  \n\nDefinitely will never stay at this particular property again.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

You come in and if you walk directly left past the coffee, and\n    place you put your dirty dishes - turn left and there are 3 booths (highly coveted)\n    with their own tvs.  \n6.  My wife is Gluten Free and if you ask - they have gluten free bread.  Breakfast\n    was juices, fresh scrambled eggs, tortillas (warm), a meat (usually sausage but \n    once there was bacon), hot self make waffles, rolls\/danishes, boiled eggs, \n   yogurt, diet yogurt, some kind of veggie dish that was hot, etc.  \n7.  Their \"Happy Hour\" was really nice - good prices and hot appetizers4902.  These \n    appetizers are priced individually but were a good size for 2.  \n8.  Rooms had kitchen, microwave, dishes, dishwasher (did not have stove \n    burners but you could order a portable one for no charge.)  The fridge is set up\n  in roll out drawers and was very spiffy.  You can get ice on 35th floor for no\n  cost.\n9.  We had room 4902 and it was a corner room with great views.\n10. We also saw \"On Your Feet\" which was good and wanted to see \"Dear\n     Evan Hanson\" but ran out of time!\n\nWe plan to use this hotel again next year because of location, safety, quality of room\nand friendliness of staff.","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It went on a couple times every 5 minutes, we both didn't get to sleep till about 2 am as that's when the noise finally started to slow down and we were up by 5 am. At times the elevator had such force we could feel the vibration in our room. Actually we should have just slept at a subway station for free! I have been in rooms near elevator at other hotels and it was nothing like this. Luckily our stay was just one night or we would have checked out and went somewhere else, that's how bad it was.

Our experience in 2015 was outstanding and we had fond memories associated with staying there, so when planning our next trip to New York City for December 2016 we didn't have to think twice on where to stay. Our fond memories and feelings of this accomodation fell well short of everything we imagined it could be. It is safe to say that all our troubles began the moment we checked in with hostile and unfriendly staff at the desk, not even bothering to glance up at us to warmly welcome us. Our room was not ready for a 'couple of hours', it was a little after 1pm at this point in time. By the time we arrived later at 5pm our room was finally ready!  My partner and I had requested a specific room type that was booked online according to images and description, obviously costing a lot more than the standard room. We did not receive a room that matched the description or photos that they included on their website. When this was communicated to an employee I said that this is considered false and deceptive advertising and he agreed! We communicated this to other staff at the desk but the issues we were experiencing went unresolved. We spoke with the reservation team on the phone at least twice and also approached reception twice. We were given the repeated line that the hotel's itinerary was undergoing an update because we had checked availability of the room we sought (and not received) and found several vacancies. This ultimately left us upset and confused that the room we had paid for was still available but we had not been given it. After also having contact with the 'manager' who was unhelpful and did not seem to understand our issues we finally went downstairs again for a third visit to a staff member in person. It took this many times to finally get our issue resolved, this staff member was the only employee to treat us with the upmost respect and kindness to ensure we were comfortable, happy and satisfied with our stay. As a result of all the trouble we went through, we checked out the very next day, even though we had a two week long stay that was prepaid. We have never been disrespected, treated this poorly or spoken down to before. It took far too many times finally have our feelings and thoughts understood correctly. We repeat that this was at the exception of only one employee there, because it is clear that everyone else we dealt with need a refresher on their customer service skills, and basic manners. To anyone reading this, yes it has great location near Times Square but you're wasting your time to book here. If you have any issues, I wish you luck in having them resolved, as they will fall upon deaf ears. In our experience, this hotel will not cater to even the simplest requests. It is safe to say we will not be staying here ever again. \n\nNB. A rating needs to be included but if I could, I would put 0\/5. ","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Normally RI's are in the outskirts of central city locations; this one was perfect for us.  Further, this is the most stylish of any of the perhaps dozen RI's I've stayed in over the decades. The view from our corner room was also the best we've had in NYC.  The downside was the breakfast service.  The food was among the poorest in part because things ran out and were slow to be replenished, the toaster required several trips through to properly toast anything, the juice dispenser more often than not dispensed the wrong beverage and was dilute.  The dining room staff was hostile (note that all other staff were very pleasant and gracious consistent with Marriott standards).  Perhaps some of this is due to the arrangement of the breakfast room which simply can't cope with the throngs of people.  I would think that it would be a simple thing to rearrange how the food was provided and the comfortable but very inefficient seating area.

The bathroom was nicely situated (I had changed my reservation from the Renaissance Manhattan Midtown when I read they had a glass-walled bathroom and door) and had surfaces and drawers so you could unpack your toiletries.  The shower was good too, with an option of handheld shower head and actual temperature controls.  Would be nice to have a towel rod or hook inside the shower, though, as there is not one on either side of the shower door and, as it is completely enclosed door to ceiling, no option to hang it across the top. \n\nAlthough we didn't need it on this trip, the kitchenette had everything you need including pans\/dishes\/silverware as well as teapot\/coffeepot\/microwave\/fridge\/dishwasher, with an option to request a stovetop if needed, and you can also request groceries delivered and expensed to your room. \n\nAlthough we were high above the street level noise so the room was quiet, if you are a light sleeper I would recommend a sound machine to camouflage the sound of the elevator all night.

Excellent location, right on Broadway, a few blocks south of Central Park & north of Times Square, so lots of places within easy walking distance. The Courtyard is basically floors 5-35 of the tower, & the Residence Inn is floors 36-65, so it has the better views of the two.

We had a corner room (request one if possible) on the 62nd floor and had a fantastic view of both the park & back down into the city. Complimentary breakfast on the 3rd floor, which had more choices than your typical hotel of this type. There was also a bar\/Starbucks on the 4th floor. My only complaint as far as the rooms went was that we requested extra pillows & towels both before our stay and after we arrived, and they were never brought up- not a huge deal though.\n\nWe had a mid-afternoon flight on Sunday so we stored our bags, and it took a little while for them to be brought out because a lot of other people were in the same situation, so make sure to plan a few extra minutes for that. The hotel arranged for a car service to take us to the airport when we dropped our bags off, and they were waiting when we walked out- very easy.

The rooms are very clean. Great mini kitchen is nice to have (coffee maker, fridge, freezer, microwave, etc.).  Free breakfast and internet were huge pluses.  But now the bad.  \n\nWe made our reservations 5 months ahead of time (based on Trip Advisor reviews).  I called the hotel directly and requested a corner room.  When we checked in we were given a very small studio room.  I told the clerk we had requested a corner room to which she replied \"we're sold out\".  I asked her how they could be sold out when I made my reservations more than 5 months ago. She shrugged her shoulders and said I made the wrong type of reservation.  I asked her if I had made the wrong type of reservation, why had I not been told that when I called to request a corner room.  Again, she just shrugged.  Never once did she try to escalate to a manager or offer any type of solution. She just handed our key cards to us and smiled. My second complaint is breakfast.  Breakfast ends at 10 AM sharp on weekends.  I got my breakfast items and set them down at a table.  I went back to make a waffle and a Marriott employee closed the sliding door before I got back to the kitchen area.  I got up to the door and told her I needed to make my waffle and she said no.  I looked at her with a funny look and she said absolutely no exceptions after the door is closed.  I wanted to say \"Lady, this is breakfast not world peace. I'm paying $500 a night so give me my damn waffle.\"  Nope. No waffle, no hot coffee, nada.  Marriott really needs to work on their check-in and breakfast Nazis. A smile and a little kindness goes a long way.  Management might want to remind their employees of this.  \n\nBut the final insult was the bellman who hailed a taxi for us as we were leaving.  Money changed hands and words were mumbled.  We were all settled and ready to pull away from the curb when the taxi driver told us there was a lot of traffic on the way to JFK.  We told him we were only going to Penn Station and he stopped the taxi and told us to get out.  Apparently the \"deal\" he had with the bellman was for long trips and we were not worthy.  The taxi driver even tried to find the bellman to ask him what was going on (and get his money back) but couldn't find him.  So there we were, kicked out of a taxi and left to our devices to get to Penn Station.  One of the other bellman saw what happened and tried to help but at that point we were DONE!!!  \n\nSo for all of these things (mainly the check-in clerk), we will not stay here again.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

With great sterility, the agent gave me a room key.  My Marriott elite status was even not mentioned.  I went to the assigned room, which smelled foul.  I then returned to the front desk, waited on line again, and reported the problem.  The new desk agent said only, \"What room was it?,\" then gave me a new key card.  No \"sorry for the inconvenience of lugging suitcases up and down, for having to wait on line, etc.\"  In the new room, the heat turned on only when the thermostat was set at the maximum temperature of 80 degrees.

The location is fabulous, given the easy walks to Central Park, Broadway theaters, Times Square and Rockefeller Center.  Rooms were well arranged, the white and navy bedding, furnishings and carpet is beautiful and clean, and the beds are cozy.  The kitchenware, refrigerator and microwave were all welcome.  Closet space was adequate.  Water pressure in shower and space to place toiletries in the bathroom are excellent.  Could have used more large towels.  Constructive criticisms:  1.  Room could have more chairs for eating -- we had one for 3 people; 2. I could not find a good space for placing 3 bags so we were tripping on them; 3. Breakfast service ran out of hot foot for extended periods all 3 mornings and fruit once -- need to fix that; 4. Breakfast ends too early for vacationers in a late night city -- latest is 10 on weekends and then they literally closed the doors to those still in the dining area so we could not get more food; 5.  Organization of plates and utensils in the breakfast area is lousy -- one guest and I fixed it ourselves to put them by the door rather than having guests have to reach through folks waiting in line for waffle makers -- better to have at both door entries too than none by the hot food; 6. Check-in was easy as was valet service for car and bag check at the outset, but getting car at the end takes a half hour so plan ahead!  One overall negative of our stay is that we asked for a Central Park facing view and a corner room (I had read they are bigger) and the view of park was a 2-foot window with a much bigger (5 or so foot) view of the Hudson River.  Given that this was my first NYC trip with my children and selecting this hotel was in large part due to the views pictured on the website, that was a big disappointment.  Of course, there is high rise going up right in the path of the park view so it blocked our view even from the top floor, but I suspect Marriott cannot do anything about that!  Other negative is that because I used points I was not allowed to reserve a room with two queen beds as I had requested; was left to the manager's discretion upon our arrival.  We made due with the king bed for 3 of us, which worked out okay.  We had a delicious, reasonably priced Thanksgiving turkey dinner at Iguana right across the street; both the hostess and our server Juan were top notch!  We also loved 99c Pizza!!!","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This is the first time that we have stayed at this hotel and it's been a wonderful experience and we likely will stay here every year when we come back. They gave us a corner room and we had a beautiful view of central park and the city facing east. The north and east side of our room is all windows and we literally have a 180 degree panoramic view...by far the best view that we've ever had in New York.  The room is NOT small as described by another reviewer maybe because it is a corner room. Our room was actually large by New York standards with a refrigerator, freezer, dish washer. There is a clothes washer and dryer on another floor. The bed is firm and comfortable and the pillows are just the right size, not overstuffed and too thick like you see in other hotels now days. We brought our own pillows but in retrospect didn't really need to. The only disappointment in regards to the room was the shower which had minimal pressure but that's not a deal breaker. The breakfast is average but complimentary. Review of the staff is mixed. The lady that checked us in was very pleasant and professional but interaction with other front desk staff since check in have not been as impressive.  The room was very clean...and my wife has very high standards in this regard and housekeeping were also very pleasant and professional.

There are literally hundreds of hotels in New York but none of them have this view if you can get one of the top floors which is why we keep coming back.\n\nGood points:\nFantastic and safe location just a few minutes walk from Times square and Central Park, \nUnbeatable views, \nspacious and modern rooms (by New York standards) if you get a corner room.\nFree breakfast\nFree WiFi in your room\n\nBad points:\n\nBreakfast is free but make sure you are there early! Breakfast finishes at 9.30 on week days and 10.00 on weekends and when i say finish, i really mean it! I saw the door shut right in the face of some guests at 9.25 without any warning and all the food is cleared like its black Friday at Harrods! I understand that there is a time to clear up but it could be done with a bit more grace. The breakfast staff always seemed to be in a bad mood and reluctant to help...this is not the case for the rest of the hotel staff which have always been very professional, attentive and happy to help.\nThe dining area for breakfast  as well as the pantry is WAY too small for the number of guests. The seating in the dining area consists of very large chairs which take up far too much room and would be much better if replaced with smaller ones allowing more people to eat rather than standing around or having to take their food back to their rooms.\n\nWhen checking out we were told that our bags could be stored safely at the hotel while we enjoyed our last few hours. This however is not the case nor was it last year. We requested to store our bags but they were just left in the hotel reception along with dozens of others being told that the room was full. This area is fully open to anyone who walks in off the street so we were forced to pack anything of value into one bag and drag it around New York to ensure it was safe. Upon returning to collect the bags we were not even challenged for our baggage slip or identity when i took them straight out the door.\n\nTips:\nGet a corner room! The 05 rooms have the best overall view ( ie. 6505, 6405 etc)\nFrom these rooms you can see all of Times Square, the Hudson river, and if you stretch your neck you can even see Central Park. These corner rooms also have the most windows.\nTurn the air con OFF at night, it makes so much noise when it starts it will wake you!\n\nWhen booking avoid the online compare sites such as Hotels and Booking.com. Call the hotel direct and ask for the Manager's special, this will always be cheaper and you can specify the corner room which is referred to as 'Times Square Grand View'\n\nThis review may look like the hotel is a bad choice but it is not.

Decent views - although there is a new construction high rise going up creating a bit of an obstruction to the park - obviously not the hotel's fault. Breakfast was OK - was pretty hectic down there and the staff seemed to have a bit of a struggle keeping up (although they tried!). No real lobby - common areas are on the 3rd and 4th floors. I am SPG gold and did not get much in elite status value. No complimentary waters or anything - I think they put me a high floor facing the park as my gold status upgrade. The location works - its not a particularly exciting place to be - Midtown west between the park and times square but its close to broadway and the subways. The bed was OK.

However one individual- the front office manager Ashley Diechert has gone out of her way to make my stays not only uncomfortable, but antagonistic. \nI am a platinum elite through Marriott and utilize the benefits and rewards. One of them being mobile check in. Back on October 8th, I contacted the hotel two hours before my arrival. I was told that the room would be available in an hour or an hour and a half. Upon checking in, one of the newer front desk reps told me the room that I requested was not available. I told her that I did a mobile check in for a Park view on a high floor which I paid for.  She went back into the office and talked to guess who- Ms. Diechert. She told the rep to tell me to come back at 4PM- regular check in. Now, with 125 nights in Marriott's this year- not one property ever stated that to a platinum elite member. \nWhen I dug a bit deeper- I was told that the people in that room were in it until 4  manager would do her best to get me in by 5pm. One of the front desk specialist whom I know by name- checked the system and came over to me and stated the room became available when the previous guest kid out at noon. He stated \"what the manager is doing to you is plain wrong\"\nI confronted the girl and asked to speak to the manager on duty but was told \"they are in a meeting (Sunday at 2:30 pm- yeah-right).\nThen the new excuse was the maids would get to the room in rotation. I offered that if you have a platinum guest waiting in the lobby for a room they were told they can check into through mobile check-in at 2PM, you think they would get to that room as quickly as possible. That would've been the right thing to do. When the front desk girl went back to the manager I overheard the manager say  \"let them wait\".\nThis manager- Ms. Diechert was so unprofessional and used her authority to make it a point OR statement that she had control over me. I came to find out from an employee that he issue with me was that I tend to request the 65\/64th floors overlooking the park. Prior to her coming to the hotel, the staff always accommodated my request asa platinum member. She put a stop to that and I always have had problems since.\nWhile the staff overall is outstanding, I do not think Marriott or Interstate Hotels and Resorts who owns the property even knows of this woman's hostility and behavior towards their guests.\nI recommend that if you want to pay these prices- there are more luxurious hotels with views. By the way, the park view is now obstructed  by a new high rise apartment building going up literally in front of the Residence Inn. They won't tell you that- I just did.\nMost likely will not go back after spending 35 nights at this hotel so far in 2016.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This time I was staying alone again on a business trip.  It did not fail to satisfy me!  On one night I dropped my contact lens into bathroom sinc drainage, the front desk I called sent a janitor in right away.  I forgot his name, but he was a very nice and pleasant person, sympathetic and searched for my lens hard and found it!  I had a meeting on the following day, so he saved my day!!   On the same night, I used up all the toilet roll I had, but a call gave me a new roll right away.  I appreciated their attentivenss.  I was a little shocked to find a thin, tall building(probably a new or renovated hotel) standing inbetween me and the central park which was not there two years ago, but the veiw was still great.  I also appreciate the mini kitchen.  I do not cook in the room, but coffee maker, kettle, microwave PLUS plates and utencils are nice things to have in your room, when you stay for more than one night.  Keep up the good service!  I will definitely come back for my business trip next time.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The Residence Inn at 1717 Broadway was at the right location for the places we were to visit. we alway choose a Marriott Brand since we are reward members and they are always consistent across the brand.  I signed on to the Marriott website and intended to reserve a room for the night of October 17th.  I did reserve the room but I failed to update the date and reserved a room for the night I logged on, October 11.  \n\nThe Marriott website has a feature which shows you upcoming reservations.  I logged on the morning of October 12th and was surprised when I didn't see the reservation I thought I'd made the night before.  When I looked further, I realized my mistake, this was at 6:00 AM.  I immediately called the reservation desk at the hotel.  The young lady who answered was very pleasant, saying that this had happened in the past.  She could not do anything about the charge but did make the correct reservation and referred me to the front desk manager.  I was transferred to the font desk and asked for the manager.  I was sent to a voicemail.  I left a message.  I did not receive a call back.  I called back 2 additional times, leaving voicemail with my phone number on both occasions.  I never got the courtesy of a return call.\n\nI am a longtime customer of Marriott and I did expect some kind of accommodation for my expensive error. I would have accepted a response that the hotel policy is to expect full charge on a mistaken reservation.  What really annoys me is that there was no return call.  Very poor customer service on the part of the front desk manager.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There's plenty of equipment in the gym also. The location is just the right distance from central park and times square. You can get a great view of Times square from the terrace if it's open (Door seemed to be locked the one time we tried to visit, but assuming weather etc dictates access).\nOf course this hasn't put us off and wouldn't stop us staying here again.\n\nIt's a pity also that there appears to be a new building being put up in front of the Central Park view. This doesn't take the affect of the high rise views though as there is plenty to look at and Central Park can still be seen either side.\n\nTo reiterate, this is a great hotel, but i'm writing this so that guests might be able to request one of the 'better' views unlike us who didn't know.\n\nThanks again for the experiance","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

After booking the room (Times Square view category), I called the hotel to request one specific floor plan of the three they had listed on their website, based on a tip from a fellow Tripadvisor member. It was the only one with a tub and had much larger windows than the other two. The woman who took my request sounded hurried and hung up before I could even thank her.\n\nWhen we arrived, there was no note about our request on our reservation, but the woman at the front desk (I regret that I did not get her name) was very friendly and accommodating. She did however inform us that none of the rooms in the category we booked had tubs. We said fine, it wasn't about the tub, more about the larger windows. We had only one night, we really wanted to sit by the window and gaze at the city lights.\n\nWhen we got to our room, I was disappointed to find the small window and view completely blocked by a desk with no room to lounge or even walk up to the window. Not at all what was represented on the floor plans I saw. We went back to her and explained our disappointment. She upgraded us to a Grand Times Square view room, which did have a fantastic view (still no tub, though).\n\nWe enjoyed the room, mostly because of the view, but noticed that it wasn't very clean. Nightstand and desk felt dirty and dust was on my hand when I wiped the surface. A stray shampoo bottle cap was on the ground next to the bed. The sliding door between bathroom and bedroom didn't offer much privacy. Kitchenette is nice for longer stays and was well-appointed.\n\nBreakfast was included and the offerings were more than adequate. However, service a little less so. I could not find salt & pepper and when I asked, the bus boy just pointed at the general area of the buffet from the next room and said \"It's in there.\" Well yes, I knew that, but where exactly? Just a little thing, but in the hospitality business, friendliness matters.\n\nThings we missed in comparison to hotels in the same price class: room service, robes and complimentary water.

Now, keep in mind that a couple buildings block part of the view, but you can still get to see a good portion of the park.  Also, the hotel is barely 3 years old, so the furniture and decor still feel very new.  Though, in our bathroom, our shower drain was very slow, even after the maintenance staff came to fix it, but that was the only setback we had.\n\nLocation - The hotel is within walking distance of both Times Square, Central Park and restaurants.\n\nBreakfast - The food was comparable to other Residence Inn locations.

We're from the UK and wanted a good base from which to explore NYC by foot and subway.\n\nThe Residence Inn proved the perfect hotel for this. Our room, on the 41st floor, had a 'city view' which wowed us as soon as we walked in the door. It was a 'studio' (as all the rooms are) and included a little kitchen part with fridge, microwave, cutlery and crockery, and a lovely bathroom with huge shower. The bedroom part was relatively small compared to other US hotels we've stayed in, but this is completely expected in New York. However, the space was filled so well - with a huge comfy king size bed, armchair and desk. Our view looked out to the Met Life building and we could even see down to the Hudson river.\n\nWe found the hotel a great base for exploring - it was a short walk to several subway stations, and only a 10 minute walk to Central Park and Times Square. It was so nice to come back to such a comfy, well air conditioned room after exploring a hot and humid New York all day! Being near Times Square was great for the evenings when we could go out to eat an shop, and just wander.\n\nBreakfast was included (think it is for all residents). There was a good selection - it's self serve and there are hot options, like scrambled egg, sausage and bacon, and even waffle machines, where you can make your own waffle. There are also fruit, pastries, bagels, muffins, toast etc. The breakfast room is on the 3rd floor and has floor to ceiling windows, so it's a great place to watch the world go by. It has more of a comfy lounge feel than a dining room feel, which was lovely.\n\nAll the staff we encountered were very nice and always polite. They were especially helpful in organising a taxi (more like a massive luxury SUV) to Newark airport for us at the end of our trip. Thanks to everyone who made our stay so wonderful - we'd definitely love to return some day and will be recommending this hotel to our friends.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As far as location goes, we loved this hotel.  Close to many subway stations to get you anywhere.  We checked in on a Tuesday.  We requested a check in time of 2:30 knowing it wasn't guaranteed until 4.  Got there at 2:30 and was told our Central Park view room wasn't ready.  It was fine, they stored our luggage for us and we wandered down to Times Square.  What annoyed the hell out of me is when I had to come back 2x times to finally get our room.  By 4 we wound up just sitting in the lobby waiting for them to finish.  I don't understand why they didn't clean our room when they knew we were there at 230.  We didn't get up there until 4:30 which is a half hour past their \"guaranteed\" check-in time.  \n\nAnyway... Back to the hotel.  Once we got in our room we were pleasantly surprised by the views.... Mostly.  The hotel has failed to mention a huge building is currently being built between the hotel and the park.  The views you see online of Central Park? Not what you currently see.  Still great views nonetheless, I just think they should be a little more honest.  Beds were super comfortable and the kitchen area was nice.  As a whole the hotel wasn't as clean as I expected it to be but then again either is New York!!! \n\nWill I stay again? Probably not.  Was it a good hotel to feel safe and comfortable at our first time? Yes.  ","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The hotel was centrally located, and places like times square and central park were just walking distance from there. There was also easy access to many of the nearby subway stations. \nI wanted to take the time to really commend and show my utmost appreciation for Nicole Bautista, who had helped us with booking a room during our stay. Nicole was so kind and extremely helpful, and she was able to block a phenomenal corner room that gave an excellent view of times square and the rest of the city. She went above and beyond to make sure that we were comfortable and that all of our needs were met. She is truly an excellent employee and a wonderful person. \nThe room that I had stayed it truly made the whole trip to NYC. Windows replace the outside facing walls in order to give guests a breath-taking panoramic view of the city. It also lovely to have breakfast included with our room.The breakfast buffet was very good, and had a many different choices and options for people each day. After walking around NYC and taking in all the sights and people, it was lively to come back to the hotel in the evenings and just sit with a glass of wine and look at the spectacular view. It still made you feel like you were immersed in the city. \nOverall, the Residence Inn was an amazing find, and really made our trip to New York memorable. The room was amazing, the staff were extremely courteous and helpful, and the central location made it extremely easy to visit and navigate nearby attractions. I would definitely give this hotel an outstanding recommendation and highly encourage people to stay here for one of the best experiences in New York!","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

While when you select the \"Studio GRAND Times Sq. view\" they don't show any floor plan, just the awesome bedroom with the huge window. So as this one is more expensive, you assume you'll get the cool bedroom for sure.\n\nOur surprise was when, although we booked \"GRAND Times Square View\" we were given a small room like the ones shown in the \"Studio Times Sq. view\" (see picture with floor plan). \n\nDon't get me wrong, they also have great views and you can perfectly see Times Square, but if you can be given that room when you book a \"Studio GRAND Times Sq. view\", why is it more expensive?!?!\n\nWe felt disappointed with this. We were spending only one night and we were so exhausted from our trip that we didn't have the energy to go down again with our luggage and ask for an explanation that would end up in the typical \"website states that pictures shown may not match your final bedroom\". \n\nAnyways, I suggest you don't go with high expectations, so that you are amazed by the views anyways.\n\nAlso, if you book a Central Park View room, take into account they're building a new building between central Park and the Hotel. So 70% of the views over central park are about to disappear (although they don't tell you this on their website).\n\nHaving said that: it has a great location, nice views and nice breakfast. \n\nAnyways, we wouldn't go back unless they could guarantee we could have the exact room we wanted. And even like that, we felt deceived so we would probably look for other options.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I am that pain in the butt person who wants a certain type of bread, egg whites only, etc.  The Whole Foods at Columbus Circle is a 10 minute walk away and there is plenty of room to store your own food choices.\n\nIt is quiet and the sleep quality is very good.  The bathroom is clean and efficiently designed.\n\nThe gym is large enough, has nice equipment and very clean.\n\nOne thing to note that is a little confusing upon arrival\u2026the address says 1717 Broadway but the entrance is actually around the corner on 54th Street.\n\nShould you stay at this spot, Serafina just across the street is a very good restaurant.

I will write a separate review on the Courtyard. We really enjoyed our stay overall and highly recommend both the Residence Inn and Courtyard at this location. The location is superb right there on Broadway and W 54th. So many great restaurants and all manner of shops within walking distance as well as Central Park, fifth ave and Columbus circle shopping, Broadway, you name it, it was right at our doorstep. Our room at Residence Inn was fab! I considered it spacious by new York city standards, very clean, modern, nicely laid out. Neat contemporary kitchenette with all of the necessary appliances for a comfortable stay and then some.  Quiet. We had no issues with noise although I will say that when the air con kicked on it was quite loud. Floor to ceiling windows even in the bathroom affording views of central park. Lovely! The bathroom was small and had just a shower stall but that was fine by me. I liked the showerhead and the water pressure was great. Just having the view while I sat on the loo was a good thing!  I can't say enough about this property. Our room was beautiful, we were comfortable, the location was first class and the price was very reasonable for what we got and when one considers the hotel rates generally in New York city. This hotel will not break the bank.  I will most definetly stay here again and have already recommended it to a few friends. Having had the benefit of staying in both properties in the building, I prefer the Residence Inn. I really was not expecting much as it had been a while since I stayed in a Residence Inn and it was very basic. This property far exceeded my expectations.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My husband is a platinum member and we booked corner suites and standard rooms in both hotels. So how do the rooms compare? Overall we would book the Courtyard again and preferred these rooms. The Courtyard corner suites are much more spacious and roomier. We had a room on the 29th floor. The view is just as nice as being on the 45th floor of the Residence Inn. Both hotels use the same staff and we found them very nice and helpful both trips. The bathroom in the corner suite for the Courtyard was also much bigger than the Residence Inn. It had a bathtub, plus shower, and floor to ceiling window versus the Residence Inn which was tight with no bathtub or window. We did not hear much street noise from either room. My son found the bed uncomfortable in his room at the Courtyard, but comfy at the RI. I thought both beds were great. All of our rooms were nicely decorated, clean and modern. Again, the corner suite is the room with more space. We stayed at another hotel further south and preferred this location. It's easy to get to Rockefeller Center, which I loved and also Central Park and shopping at Avenue of Americas. The only feature of the kitchenette  we care about is a mini frig and both rooms had that. I would definitely recommend a stay here regardless of whether it's the upper or lower half of the hotel. My husband stays at a lot of Marriott Hotels and he said this is one of the nicest ones in comparison to many others in the US.","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This trip was four nights in Corner View Room with spectacular views on the 60th floor \u2013 I believe it was worth extra cost (well, maybe not -they kill you w\/ weekday rates).  I\u2019ve had Central Park and Times Square views and like both.  Beware if booking standard room as they\u2019re matchboxes \u2013 fine if traveling alone and\/or if you truly don\u2019t care or spend time in your room except to sleep.  And not all rooms have great views.  I was w\/ my 10-yr-old and we had plenty of room.  It was compact but had everything we needed including kitchen (all rooms have kitchens).  This room had small closet, several large drawers and bathroom had good counter space, also bathrobes which was a first.  Very nice big walk-in shower.  The star of the room is the view - it was pretty spectacular.  I loved having glass of wine enjoying view at dusk before heading to dinner.  Unfortunately, there\u2019s only one chair to sit and enjoy the view!   Wifi is included. \n\nI am over the included breakfast and won't factor in when planning future trips.  It\u2019s pretty awful unless 1.  You'll eat anything  2. You simply want cereal or bagel and\/or 3.  you're trying to save money.  The hot (lukewarm) food items are tasteless. You can grab an apple or banana.  We ended up eating around corner at Applejack Diner a few days \u2013 decent old-school diner where you can get real eggs vs. powdered.\n\nMy son was unhappy there was no Golf Channel...not likely going to bother most of you!  \n\nYou\u2019ll be happy here if you book the right room and\/or temper your expectations re the size of room.

Exit hotel, turn right and you will find one at the first set of traffic lights, on the corner. Housekeeping was excellent. A laundry room is available with many washers and dryers. $1.75 is required for both. Free yoga classes are available at set times however sadly, although I wanted to do this I never got to do so during our 5 night stay. Our only little let down was breakfast. There never seemed to be enough tables for the volume of people regardless of the time you went. We also had a late check out, 2pm and then again the hotel held our bags until it was time to leave where we used the hotel's car service to JFK. Well worth the fixed rate of $75 including tolls and tip to airport. Special mentions...first go to Roger who looked after us so well. He was always asking how we were and if we'd had fun on that day's activity however the \"star\" for us was one, Mr Agron Hallil. He happened to over hear my asking for a hotel umbrella and disappointment when told there were none. it was pouring down.

It turned out to be a perfect choice!   My room had an incredible view of Central Park and Midtown.   It looked exactly like the featured picture, except for a new building under construction a few blocks to the north.   The room was very well designed and included a mini kitchenette.   The included breakfast was great, it included the largest selection I have ever seen for a hotel breakfast of its kind, and it was in a large room with great views on the third floor.   The location is perfect...close to Times Square (but far away from the chaos), Rockefeller Center, Columbus Circle, Central Park, and Lincoln Center.   The neighborhood is great with a nice mix of visitors and locals.  Most of all, the staff is superb.   This is clearly a well run operation based on the friendliness and upbeat demeanor of all of the staff I encountered.

This year we stayed here and had a great stay. As mentioned in other reviews the rooms are on the small side but the view more than makes up for it. We were on the 60th floor with a corner room looking at Times Square. You could also see the park looking back to the left. The view was simply amazing and even better at night when the city was bright with lights. Check in was easy and the elevators moved quickly considering how many floors there are. \nThe hotel is located directly across the street from the Stephen Colbert show and has many choices of restaurants and dive bars on the block it's located. Easy access to the subway is also a plus. You are a 5 minute walk from both then park and Times Square.  \nBreakfast was another plus. Getting up and not worrying about finding somewhere to eat each morning before a long day of walking the city was a huge plus for us. The area overlooks the streets so you can sit and eat breakfast and people watch to begin your day.
