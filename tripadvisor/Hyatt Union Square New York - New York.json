The bench in the shower is not useful, as water is going to be splashed on that bench. 4. The bed sheets were too small for the thickness of the mattress, and could not be tucked in properly. 5.

A dependable option for a small, clean room, consistent service, and lower cost than other NY Hyatts. It was the very definition of mid - and that was fine! It embraced it and provided a solid product in line with its lower price and competitors. \n\nPost-pandemic they slapped on a destination fee, added doormen, raised the prices, and project bougie energy without investing in the hard or soft product to match. The hotel is showing its age (rooms leaking on this trip, banged up interiors, etc), service is mediocre, and no obvious investment in either since my visits pre-pandemic except for seemingly more staff in the lobby. \n\nMy most recent stay involved some issue on each of my 5 days there - from my room not being ready until 5:30, trash on floor, missing towels, WiFi not working, errant fees on my bill, noisy elevator keeping me up at night. I\u2019m also a Lifetime Globalist, so you should expect an equal or worse experience than mine. \n\nAnd yes - the destination fee is a massive scam here. The perks are egregiously bad, to the point that the included \u201cPremium\u201d WiFi only allows two concurrent connections per room. All for $30\/day. \n\nThis Hyatt needs to do some soul searching and embrace its mid-tier status. Invest in fixing your hard and soft products, scrap the destination fee, and go back to being a solid, affordable option for a clean, NY-sized hotel room. \n\nUntil then, I\u2019d recommend another hotel unless you can find a room here for < 330\/nt (destination fee included \ud83d\ude09)","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":3533197,"title":"Location and not much else","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-07-25","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"The challenge with Hyatts in Manhattan is that you're either choosing between value-priced options with tiny rooms and minimal service on the seedy and sweaty long blocks of Midtown or the couple of higher-end properties where rates rarely fall below $600\/night. The Union Square property, well-rated and located, has always been sort of a wild card. Though not technically on Union Square, it's got a location with far more charm (and great subway access to Manhattan and Brooklyn) and the rates split the difference between the 3 and 4+-star Hyatts. \n\nPros: Location. The area around the hotel is one of Manhattan's nicer ones, with a good mix of tourists and locals. Great restaurant options are nearby. Union Square is lively and its greenmarket is a great place to hang out. While some parts of Manhattan are emptied out by WFH, Union Square is busy and feels safe at all but the wee-est hours.\n\nCons: Rooms are small, no bigger than the Hyatts in Midtown. (As a Hyatt Exporist I usually get some sort of upgrade in size or view, but was told it was impossible due to high occupancy.) King rooms have bathrooms that are split, with the sink exposed in the room. The only fully enclosed space was the toilet. The shower is entered and exited from an open area. The hotel charges a big premium for rooms with two beds, and this is apparently why. A number of things weren't working in our room, such as the phone, and though I reported it, there was no obvious action taken until the day I checked out. A request for morning housekeeping service was received as something beyond the hotel's control. Front desk staff was thin. There were often long waits to speak to a host and though a couple were amiable, others were indifferent and blas\u00e9. \n\nPost-pandemic, there has been a huge trade-down in the caliber of customer facing hotel workers in cities like NYC. They are uniformly under 30, with limited training, and many don't really have the personality for the work, nor can they relate to the needs and experience of travelers. So it is now commonplace not to be thanked at checkout or to receive anything close to a sincere welcome at arrival. Hyatt Union Square is typical of this trend. \n\nAs best as I can see, this property's rate premium is entirely due to its location, not its facilities or service. I would not avoid it in the future, but neither would I be eager to return. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They provide two metal water cantinas and a canvas bag which encourages health and reduces waste.

What an ingenious way to reduce the use of plastic bottles by providing metal water containers that can be refilled on site. This insightful generosity s the signature of authenticity setting the tone of their brand immediately. So smart. \n\nThis thoughtfulness carries over into the staff who are efficient and personable across the board. They helped me change reservations and provided for special needs that I had with kindness, prompt attention and professionalism. I\u2019ve been coming to nyc for business for 6 years and their hospitality is a total stand-out. Nobody is cross or vexed in the lobby because the staff has everyone taken care of. \n\nNow, having said that? The coffee in the lobby in the mornings could use some work! It\u2019s really weak and doesn\u2019t taste great. Fortunately there\u2019s a Starbucks a block away but who want to schlepp for coffee first thing in the morning? \n\nIf you don\u2019t know New York, Union Square Union Square is an ideal location for its beauty, merchant selection, restaurant density and best of all the union square train station where you can catch a train to any part of the city.

The location is VERY conveniently located next to Union Square with plenty of dining, shopping,entertainment, & transit options.  Attached directly to the hotel is Bowery Road restaurant with excellent food & cocktails.  Also attached is the Library of Distilled Spirits bar - amazing & low-key place to grab a drink & unwind with smooth jazz playing in the background.\n\nThe hotel room itself was cozy, but with all the amenities you need - even a King size bed (most places offer only Queens due to space restrictions).  The oversized walk-in shower was also quite nice.\n\nBut without question, the best quality of this hotel was the AMAZING staff!  From the days prior to my visit when I called with questions, to our arrival greeting, to everytime we passed through the lobby, the Staff was some of the friendliest I'd ever encountered in my travels.  Specifically, Roger, Kavina (Manager) & Lily treated us like family the entire time.  Every time we saw them, they asked how we were, how we are enjoying NYC, if there is anything they could do to enhance our stay, & even greeted us with hugs!  Lily was especially incredible.  She always remembered our names & treated us like she'd known us for years.  I have a very high bar of expectations in the Customer Service\/Hospitality industry.  But I am happy to say that Lily raised that bar to new heights.  She has raised the standard of what hospitality means & what I will look for in the future.\n\nI will likely need to visit NYC a few times per year for business.  And everytime I come back, I will be sure to stay at the Hyatt Union Square.  Thank you Lily, Kavina, Roger, & the entire staff for a wonderful experience!","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":3533197,"title":"Great Location, But Small and Noisy Rooms and Spotty Service","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-01-01","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"I hold top tier (Globalist) elite status with Hyatt; I spend a lot of nights in hotel rooms.\n\nI live a few blocks from the property; I spent six nights at the Hyatt right before Christmas as some work was being done on our apartment.  I regret that what follows is a less-than-stellar review.\n\nOne of the things I like about living in the area is the proximity to the subways (4,5, 6 and L, N, Q, R, W trains) and the busses on 3rd and 4th Avenues which makes it very easy to travel via mass transit. In the neighborhood are a lot of places in the Union Square and East Village area for coffee and other meals, including the new Urbanspace food hall on 14th between 4th and 3rd Avenues.\nThe front desk was kind enough to upgrade my reservation from the base King Courtyard to a King High Floor in recognition of my elite status. An additional benefit of Globalist status is free breakfast vouchers and waived destination fees. The free breakfast is ordered at the lobby restaurant and remains one entr\u00e9e and a hot drink - the steak and eggs entree has an additional $10 surcharge. I did the American Breakfast and hot tea a few days ($25) and it was fine; I mixed in other menu choices so I wasn't eating the same breakfast each day. Any gratuity is posted to the room folio as a food\/beverage charge. Upon check in, elite members are given a small paper bag with two mini water bottles, two packets of property-branded trail mix, and a card listing additional amenities covered under the Destination Fee.\n\nTwo failures from the amenities was the High-Speed Internet option which is often a different tier from the standard speed. That's not the case here; the entire property has a single, pokey 10 Mbps WiFi option. Worse was the $15 per day Dry Cleaning amenity, which I used to have my dress shirts pressed each day. The same day (drop off by 9am, get it back by 7 pm) service was horrible. My results were:\n\nMonday AM drop off: Returned Thursday AM\nTuesday AM drop off: Returned Tuesday PM\nWednesday AM drop off: Returned Thursday AM\nThursday AM drop off: Returned Friday PM\n\nI would not rely on their laundry service if it was important to have the items the next day; the staff confided in me that this is an ongoing problem with their dry cleaning vendor.\n\nThe laundry charges are posted to your folio and then manually wiped off at checkout so you can't do remote checkout unless you stop by the front desk in the morning to have them update your folio. The staff even had the nerve to post a laundry charge to my folio after I checked out; I had to call them back to get it reversed, Given how badly they failed to deliver the \"same day service\" I requested, the fact that they even put the charge on my folio was pretty galling.\n\nAs for the rooms; they are very small, even by NYC standards and if you are not staying alone, you'd better be intimately familiar with your travelling companion as there's no wall separating the bathroom area from the living area so there\u2019s basically no privacy when showering or changing clothes.\n\nMy room was on the 11th floor and faced 4th Avenue. Rooms on the 10th and 11th floors have floor-to-ceiling windows. There is a fire station across the street on 13th Street so that is a source of sirens at all hours of the day. My nearby apartment is also on the 11th floor, so I am used to a lot of NYC traffic noise in our neighborhood and it doesn't bother me or my sleep.  But, I will suspect that won\u2019t be the case for others, so bring quality earplugs if you want uninterrupted sleep. The soundproofing of the windows is better than my place but there's still a lot that gets through.\nI had a few annoying issues with the technology; the first was that the digital thermostat doesn't keep the room at a constant temperature. I set it at 74 and when I woke up in the morning, the room was at 68. When I bumped it to 76, once the morning sun came up, the room heated to 80. So, it was constant adjusting to get the temperature a steady level.  I\u2019m told the trick is to put the motion sensor on the thermostat into \u201cVIP Mode\u201d to disable it. More annoyingly, the Chromecast and HDMI inputs on my TV didn't work; this became problematic as I was working from the hotel all week using my 13\" laptop and I normally connect it via an HDMI cable to a TV so I can use it as a larger monitor. I limped through most of one day before asking an engineer to come up and check my TV. I was told I was doing everything right, connection and input selection-wise and there wasn't anything else that could be done. On Day 2 I gave up and went down to the Front Desk around lunchtime and asked to see other rooms. To their credit, the manager on duty came out and took my complaint seriously. We looked at a King Courtyard across the hall and yes, that TV worked with my HDMI cable. That room was much smaller so it wasn't even offered as an option for me to move into. We then went one floor down and looked at two empty King City Views facing 4th Ave. The first had the same non-operational Chromecast and HDMI ports, but the second one did (HDMI only; the Chromecast still didn't work); it helped that the room had a newer-model LG LCD. So, I moved my belongings one floor down. This room was right outside of the elevator, but the outside noise was minimal.\n This property is so inconsistent; my 11th floor room was lacking water glasses. My 10th floor room lacked a luggage stand and a do not disturb sign, which I had to get from housekeeping. The complementary water in the 11th floor room were two one-liter boxes of Just Water; the new room has .5 liter bottles. My new room was missing the backlight around the TV enclosure, so my room was darker at night. Most egregiously, the heating in the new room didn't work; it only blew cold air, so it was very cold in the room at night (mid 60s) and the engineer that came by the next day said the unit appears to be broken. As a remedy, I was given a space heater that, by the looks of it, was taken from someone's office or breakroom. Thankfully. it was good enough to keep my room at 72 when it was sub-freezing outside. No effort was made to repair the unit for the remainder of my stay, nor did anyone ask me if any of my reported issues had been resolved.\n\nI was so disappointed with my experience; I would love to put friends and family visiting us here, but the hard and soft product service hiccups and lack of follow-through are just too much to deal with. So, regretfully, I cannot recommend this property.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

And we paid almost $1600 for two nights.  \n\nThe room - minuscule, but that wasn't unexpected.  There's no place to lay a suitcase to unpack, no place to unpack into (2 tiny drawers, very small closet) and not enough light to see what you're doing.  No rugs or carpets on the floor which is fake wood (vinyl?) planks.  The refrigerator is unplugged with a note saying that if you want a refrigerator, you have to call the desk.  The room is blacks, greys and whites and feels like a 2-hr hotel.  The room safe did not work. \n\nThe bathroom - horrible lighting (tiny, very recessed LEDs) make it impossible to put on makeup in the dark shadowy room.  No counter space at all; better have a hanging Dopp kit.  The shower controls are BEHIND the shower door, so you have to be in the shower to turn it on.  \n\nThe bed - not uncomfortable, but it's a platform bed on an unfortunately squeaky platform.  \n\nThe staff - very good natured but totally incompetent.  Some examples:  it took 2 calls to get some extra pillows; when they finally arrived they didn't have pillowcases on them.  We called twice for ice; it never showed up and the front desk finally admitted that they just send the request to housekeeping and housekeeping is obviously not paying any attention (explains the pillows).  We called about the non-working safe; no one came to check it out (we assumed it just needed a new battery).  When we checked out, the valet whispered to us that we'd be better off retrieving the car ourselves from the garage because it would take him almost an hour to get it because no one else was valeting.  The garage was just a couple of blocks away.  \n\nWe're Hyatt regulars and this is the worst experience we've ever had.  Never again.  ","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The space may not be appropriate for large board-meeting type conferences, but the casual space for our group of about 20 made for productive sessions.\n\nThe hotel bar was a popular destination and the hotel did feel lively.

They gave us our keys and we headed up to the room, where we discovered we had been given a street-side room next to the elevators instead of the quiet \"courtyard view\" room we had booked. When I called down to the front desk they seemed surprised I wasn't happy with being silently given a different room type, and told me that the room type I had booked wasn't available. After some back and forth they told me to come back down to the front desk to get a different room. Someone else was at the front desk, and they quickly gave me the type of room I had booked, so I guess the story about it being unavailable was bogus.\n\nThe new room was much quieter, but not in great condition. The shower had mold all over the tiles around the bottom of the walls, especially in the corners. The door stuck, and there were big gouges in the floor from it. The coffee machine didn't work, producing a few drops of coffee on each attempt. The machine didn't look like it had been cleaned out very often (if ever), so probably something inside was clogged with old coffee residue. The blinds were nearly impossible to operate. We were only in town for one night so we cut our losses and didn't roll the dice on a third room. The beds were clean and comfortable, at least.\n\nWe booked the \"courtyard view\" to avoid the street noise, but if we had been in it for the view, we would have been sorely disappointed. Like the rest of the hotel it didn't seem to have gotten any maintenance since it was built, complete with tiles of fake greenery falling off the fencing around it.\n\nMobile checkout was smooth, but one of the two tiny elevators was broken, so it took us quite a while to get out as we had to wait for there to be room for our bags in the remaining elevator as everyone else was trying to leave.\n\nOverall quite disappointing for how expensive it was.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Having read all the reviews, I really wanted to avoid staying at this property, but the family event we were attending was just around the corner, and this is a part of Manhattan with very little choice of hotels. So, I reluctantly ponied up 25K Hyatt points\/night for my stay. At least that was way less painful than shelling out more than $500\/night, including tax, for such subpar accommodation. \n\nHaving been primed by all the negative reviews to lower my expectations, I wasn't too bitterly disappointed by my stay. The lobby is indeed tiny and crowded, front desk service is perfunctory, and the front entrance was boarded up with plywood during my stay. But, I did manage to check in without a long wait, so it could have been worse. My room, as expected, was small and dark, with outdated decor, and showed quite a bit of wear and tear. It faced the interior courtyard, so had no view to speak of, but the upside was an absence of traffic noise, so my sleep was undisturbed. One nice, unexpected amenity in my room was the mini-fridge, which allowed me to keep drinks and snacks chilled. The bathroom was clean and spacious enough, but the towels were thin and scratchy--the kind I'd expect in a budget motel. However, I was pleasantly surprised that when I texted the hotel asking for a bathrobe and extra toiletries, these items were delivered within five minutes. \n\nIt's a shame that the hotel's owners don't seem to have spent a dime on upkeep, maintenance, and service at this hotel, instead relying on its prime location to keep the rooms occupied. If I hadn't absolutely needed to stay right at this location, I would have been much happier spending my 25K Hyatt points per night at a much nicer hotel elsewhere in Manhattan, like the Thompson Central Park.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

I reviewed this location on google and it just did not measure up to the experience I HAD which is why I need to be more vigilant and review when VISITS ARE GREAT!  Upon arrival, I was blown away by the ambiance.  I arrived late and wanted to go right up to my room and sleep.  The room was very cold.  I called the front desk and they immediately sent up Engineer Sheldon Lawrence.  He was professionally dressed, pleasant with a smile and determined to get us heat.  While working, he let me know exactly what he was doing which was promising he knew what he was doing.  Getting in late - you just want to sleep, you don't want to have to sleep in the arctic cold nor have to change rooms.  Within minutes of troubleshooting, getting proper tools we felt warm air!  What a relief.  Sheldon gave it a few more minutes to make sure it stayed blowing warm air and assured us it was fixed.  I was very pleased with how he took ownership of the situation, was driven to fix it quickly and was so very pleasant in the process.  It hurts when you go somewhere, an employee takes their sweet old  time or has an attitude like you disturbed them to do THEIR JOB - THIS WAS NOT THE CASE!  Sheldon Lawrence, you are the reason my family enjoyed their stay.

A fraudulent charge was placed in New Jersey. We called the Hyatt General Manager to inform her that the ONLY time we had used this card in the last 4 months was when we checked in to her hotel. The GM was superficially polite but repeated to insist we contact the bank card issuer to resolve the issue - we had already done that. She completely missed the point.

I arrived at the property on Monday the week before Christmas and stayed for two nights.\n\nThe room was indeed small as others pointed out, but nicely equipped. I arrived off of a red eye from LAX and after a baggage fiasco, didn't get to the hotel until around noon. The did have a room available for me at this time, which was amazing. I instantly attempted to take a shower, but after about 30 seconds, the fire alarm started blaring. I assumed it was some building-wide event, but it was actually only in my room, and brought on by the steam from the shower! Kind of crazy. I was happy that they were able to move me to a different room, but I was warned that this is a problem the hotel has in general. Luckily, this didn't re-occur in the second room I was given. Besides for the shower fire alarm, my only other criticism that the hotel could somewhat easily address is the TV situation. The TVs seemed on the small side and the TV \/ entertainment console was this weird plastic material. It looked like it was taken from a Carnival cruise ship from 2002, definitely in need of an upgrade. Only other gripe is that Delta lost one of my bags. Unbeknownst to me, it was delivered at 9:00 pm on my second night. Since it had my name on it, it would've been easy for the staff to look up my reservation and give me a ring, but no such effort was made.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that the hotel had a hot tea and coffee stand setup in the lobby. Additionally, my Globalist status awarded me breakfast coupons that I could use in the restaurant. It was so nice to be able to wake up and have a fresh, hot breakfast and tasty coffee in the onsite restaurant. After two nights at this hotel, I moved to what was supposed to be a more luxe hotel uptown (Conrad Midtown) and even they couldn't provide these things for me! Bravo Hyatt! I didn't get the chance to checkout the cool bar \/ distillery attached to the hotel, but I'd like to in the future. And of course, the hotel's location in Union Square is fabulous. I paid around $250\/night and for the quality and location of the hotel, I thought that was very fair. I'd definitely return!","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The phone didn't work to call front desk, under the coffee pot was filthy from spilled coffee, the refrigerator didn't seem to work, the lighted makeup mirror didn't work, the handle to the shower fell off when my husband turned the water on and there was only one tissue in the tissue box.  All of these things were not a big deal if it was the only item, but collectively made us frustrated.  We were there for 5 days beginning Dec 1 to see our son.  We had upgraded the room to a city view and the total cost of our room was $3277.  When we approached the front desk to correct the items they were apologetic and quick to have the items resolved.  The crew that fixed or brought items were helpful and polite.  All and all the stay was good but I think that better attention to detail should be made.  In addition to all of this, I had checked in on line which i liked.  However, my requests were not met and front desk addressed those.  Also for some reason they checked me in twice and so funds on my card were doubled resulting in a declined payment at a restaurant.  I didn't realize this error until checking out and they asked about my second room.  We did not receive a discount on our room.  However, they refunded us in points. We generally don't stay at a Hyatt affiliated hotel (usually Hilton) so I'm not sure those points will be used.  Gave 3 stars because everything was addressed quickly and efficiently.

I stay in 15 or so  hotels a year and to be blunt, this was among the worst experiences I've had in quite some time. I infrequently stay in Hyatt-branded properties so as a \"new customer\", this place definitely left me with a bad impression of the brand.\n\nI will admit, the location of this hotel is excellent, one of the best in the whole city, but that's where most of my praise begins and ends. I arrived around 4 pm to a long check-in line and a front desk that would sit completely unmanned for the first 20 minutes of my wait. After finally getting to the front, I was told ny the agent that  the hotel double-charged me for tax and I had to wait another 20 minutes while she had to remove the excess charge. Why this would take that long was not explained but ok whatever, it happens. For my troubles, I was offered a very generous (not) bottle of water.\n\nFor this one-night December weekend stay, I paid just about $700 for a \"Junior Suite\" which was admittedly a generously-sized room with a comfortable bed and separate seating area but was otherwise pretty run-down and neither adequately cleaned nor maintained. Worn furniture, dusty fixtures and general grime were present all over the room and the condition of the bathroom wasn't much better. The toilet handle was broken, the grout in various areas was a color it should not have been, and the vanity was in quite rough shape. Not to mention, this 3rd floor room (which was the \"best [they] could do\" despite me checking in just about on-time), offered no view and was incredibly loud, both of which are not dealbreakers, it is New York, but again, at this price point...\n\nI very much feel for the staff here as everyone I interacted with were clearly trying their best, and I recognize the present labor difficulties, but the issues at this property were well-beyond what has become the norm. Calls to front desk went unanswered, in-person requests to desk, including waiting in line to speak to staff, not fulfilled, and messages to the \"text line\" were responded to with more of the same (not). Just one example, I needed an extra blanket which took me asking in person at the desk twice, a text to the text line, an attempt of a call to the desk (unanswered), another in-person visit to the desk, until finally I found a maintenance crew member in the hallway and he fulfilled my request. This is unacceptable at any price point, but $700 it is beyond so.\n\nI could go on, but in sum I'd be incredibly disappointed with my stay, regardless of price, but considering the exorbitant cost I paid to stay here, I feel totally ripped off. This whole experience definitely has soured my taste for the whole Hyatt brand.","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I booked the hotel because I was going to a concert two nights in a row (Fri & Sat) at Webster Hall, and the hotel was right around the corner. The artist I was going to see tore his vocal chords a week before the shows and had to cancel his remaining concerts for 2021.\n\nI called the hotel as soon as I found out to see if I could cancel the reservation, but it turns out I booked a non-refundable rate. I explained the situation and offered to pay a cancelation fee. They said it would be up to the GM and he\/she would get in touch with me. I NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THE GM, even though they confirmed my contact info (email & cell) before the call ended.\n\nThey stuck to their policy of not refunding a non-refundable rate, which is understandable, but at least give me the courtesy of responding if you say you are going to get back in touch with me. The following info was also shared during my conversation with the hotel. I'm a single father with two kids and I try to budget out for both adult and family vacations. This trip was a birthday gift to myself and I was traveling by myself. I was going to see one of my favorite artists, I had never seen him live, and there was no chance I was going to try to cancel had he been healthy. Given all these circumstances, I thought they would at least try to work with me to resolve the matter, but I never heard back from the GM.\n\nIt's NYC, so of course I still had an amazing time, and my experience with the hotel and it's staff during my stay was superb. I just wish the hotel\/GM would have worked with me so I could have saved the money and used it for the next time he is touring, because that was the primary reason for my trip.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The location was safe and convenient, the lobby was spacious and comfortable, rooms were clean, my calls to the concierge were always answered promptly, the room layout was perfect, everything worked, the morning coffee was delicious, room service was prompt, hot and delicious, but most of all, the personal attention of everyone at the front desk was extraordinary. \nFrom Anton rushing out in the rain to hail a taxi for me, to Daniel patiently working on my reservation to Lea recommending the best restaurants in the area, it was clear that this staff knows how to run a hotel so that guests will want to come back. \nIn fact, I renewed my Hyatt Membership upon leaving because I will always stay here whenever I visit New York, and my husband and I look forward to trying your other properties.

As soon as the city reopened, we redeemed all our Hyatt points for a one night stay to relive that experience. Our checkin last Sunday coincided with the pride parade. Nearby streets were closed to car traffic and jam packed with high spirited, boisterous celebrants. Tents lined the street fronting the hotel entrance making access to the lobby somewhat challenging. Our compact room was clean and comfortable.  However the overall stay experience was different this time as some hotel services and many nearby shops were not in full operation yet. To their credit, the hotel provided bottled water in our room and there was freshly brewed coffee in the lobby in the morning (something the Marriott Marquis where we stayed the previous 3 nights failed to do).","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My room rate included breakfast for two, but was surprised to find out breakfast was not provided upon checking in, and instead of breakfast i could be provided a \"to-go\" box. I found it strange considering the next morning the hotel restaurant on the first floor was serving patrons outdoors. The following morning i was given a small disposable lunchbox with a half frozen banana, a cup of yogurt and a small orange juice as a breakfast. I found this kind of laughable but maybe a mistake was made and management accidentally gave me their toddler's kindergarten snack instead of an actual breakfast. All I know is i will not stay again to test if my theory is correct. I digress - at the end of the day the hotel product i purchased was below average.","travelDate":"2020-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The second night I called the front desk to change room, she was surprised how loud it was since she could hear the noise even from the phone. I think the right thing to do is: if that was the only room left, they should have told me about this condition, instead of hoping I wouldn't notice. If this was not the only room left, then an alternative room should have been prioritized. Since this was not what happended, I can only infer that either the person who checked me in didn't know the situation of the elevator, which makes him not a professional employee, or he did this on purpose to get rid of a bad room, which is even more unacceptable. \nI thank the person who changed my room very efficiently.

The hotel check-in and check-out were simple and quick, the employees were friendly and accommodating, and the room was clean and in perfect condition. We even received a free room upgrade thanks to the hotel clerk Sharlene Quesni (unsure of name spelling) and because we are Hyatt Members. We would recommend this hotel to anyone. Location is great because the hotel is essentially in the middle of Manhattan. The hotel is two blocks from Union Square, very close to a lot of public transportation, and it is very easy to hail a cab at the front of the hotel. Employees offered to assist us in hailing a cab, but we didn't need their help.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I\u2019m a solo adult traveler who used to live in New York so I can\u2019t speak from a true tourist perspective. But I think the location is excellent. You\u2019re south of the midtown connection, but shopping and conveniences is only around the corner (DSW, Nordstrom Rack, MAC, Whole Foods a block away, higher end only a few more).  Subway station is both local and express stop so easy to get around). And taxis are about as plentiful there as you\u2019re going to get most times of day). I usually prefer something in Soho or Tribeca like Soho Grand or Sixty Thompson but I found this hotel have a cozier more personal feel than you\u2019d associate with a big chain. I liked the fact there was enough space in the lobby to meet a friend or sit for a moment plus a full restaurant and bar. The room was not particularly remarkable with regard to decor, but I still thought definitely better than average. Love that you can still get a coffee maker in the room. Tiny niggling thing was I wish they\u2019d update outlets to have more USB ports.  Pharmacopia amenities were great, bed was comfortable, room size was pretty good for New York, I\u2019ve definitely, definitely, paid more for smaller. Room service burger and fries were very good. Far and away the front desk staff was great. I wish I had caught their names. (Whoever was on desk from 13-19 December.).

This Hyatt has been very clever with their limited space and created what feels like a spacious room through streamlined, efficient design. My king room featured a robe and slippers, and an umbrella just in case. The \"closet\" is actually an in-room wardrobe with space to hang but no drawers to store smaller things, so I folded and piled my non-hangables on the taller part of the closet that held the safe and a smaller drawer below that (drawer-height, minus the drawers). Wall hooks by the door were a nice place to store my coat and purse. There are a lot of outlets in all the right places, the stand-up shower was spacious and modern with ok pressure and consistent temperature control. There is a sideboard-type table that holds a fridge on one side and the coffee maker on the other (mine was broken but they sent up a free pot in the morning and got me a replacement the next day). Real glass glasses (two sizes plus two wine glasses), a wine opener, and a nice desk setup helped make the space feel pretty cozy. There aren't a lot of surfaces to set things without clutter quickly taking over, but there is a bench seat as well as a desk chair and a carry-on stows nicely in the area under the TV.\n\nCons: The blackout curtain didn't lay flush with the walls so my east-facing window bled sunshine on my last morning (fortunately, it had been cloudy most of the trip). The pillows are down and a little too firm for my taste, and the HVAC doesn't run constantly so if you are a light sleeper, BRING A NOISE MACHINE OR AN APP because NYC is loud all the time. The hotel knows this, so earplugs are provided in the valet kit on the sink. Not much neighbor noise at all but the street is always going. My noise machine worked like a charm.\n\nI was alone on business but I can't imagine trying to stay here with another person. There's exactly enough room for one person's stuff for a short amount of time. This hotel is not for long stays, in my opinion. I will stay here again when I travel back to NYC though, it was perfect for me.\n\nClose to all public transit, a block from Union Square, and perfectly located for nice long walks to Midtown and the Village. Also, points for both a Trader Joe's and a Whole Foods mere blocks away.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The bed was incredibly comfortable, blackout shades for privacy and light blocking.

There are also white noise devices in the room, comfortable fleece bathrobes, and the alarm clocks are now Bluetooth speakers with wireless charging capabilities. The Hyatt staff was warm and accommodating each time I interacted with them and had excellent advice for directions or recommending places to eat in the area. Bowery Restaurant and Library of Distilled Spirits were also terrific options and the staff was fantastic at each establishment. Union Square is so central to everything in Manhattan I would definitely recommend staying here for work or pleasure - you can take the subway across the street, enjoy the park and farmers market and catching a cab was simple given the location.

The check in was slow but there were in two people there working this small lobby desk. The clerk was nice enough with a generic smile if you asked me. There was an issue with the canceling of my car from the airport, after finding out it would cost me $95 one way, I canceled the car with the HYATT but the customer agent didn\u2019t cancel and didn\u2019t really offer an reason why other than miscommunication. WHAT MISCOMMUNICATIONS? I Asked BRIANNA to cancel the car because I found other transportation cheaper. So, I was out of $200 for transportation and no one seemed to care. Ms. Brianna did say she called the air link transportation company and they said they would give me a partial refund but I won\u2019t hold my breath. Ms. Brianna was a lot nicer than the young lady that checked me in though. I never got her name. The trip to NY was overwhelming too expensive and too many people.

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":3533197,"title":"Good No-Nonsense Hotel in Downtown Manhattan","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-06-12","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Recently stayed at the Hyatt Union Square NYC for six nights and was overall quite happy with it. Located right at Union Square and close to the Flatiron district, the hotel location is the greatest plus - convenience stores such as Walgreen's are just steps away and there are all kinds of great restaurants within walking distance. Maison Kaiser, an all-day breakfast and pastries eatery, is just a block away. There's a Starbucks about two blocks away and an all-day Chinese dim-sum restaurant, Tim Ho Wan just half a block away. Reputable restaurants such as Gramercy Tavern, East 15th and the Union Square Cafe are all within walking distance.\nThe hotel's restaurant The Bowery Club did not have good breakfast (limited menu and bad coffee) but the Cobb Salad during dinner time was very good and reasonably priced. The hotel bar is actually quite beautiful and exotic during quiet times, but for most evenings, the bar was extremely noisy particularly during weeknights. The bar does not take reservations and good luck with finding a table. Drinks were good but very expensive!\nAt about USD$400 per night, the room was good value for money for a Manhattan Hotel. There's free Premium Wi-Fi (maybe because I'm a World of Hyatt member) everywhere for up to three devices anywhere in the hotel. I also had 2 free bottles of Evian water every day. I opted for the King-Bed room facing the Courtyard and the backs of other nearby buildings because the hotel is located near a fire station and I wanted to be free from sirens of fire trucks. The room was small but quite well equipped with sufficient closet space and drawers even with a big hotel umbrella inside the closet. The bathroom shower offered good water pressure but the water often overflowed beyond the shower stall if the door was not closed tightly. I particularly liked the edgy bathrobe with a hood - very nicely designed and hip! The King bed was comfortable but I missed my mini-fridge where I could have put my purchased fruits from Walgreen's. There was no doorman and no washroom in the lobby but front desk staff were always helpful and friendly.\nMy only complaint was that housekeeping staff, though conscientious, did not speak English well enough to understand my specific needs. The hotel also needs to change the duvets as I've discovered a blood stain on mine one night. A renovation might also be timely as my room looked quite tired and overall lighting was too dark.\nHyatt has recently changed its policy that making local calls from the room is no longer free. I never received any email about this policy change from the World of Hyatt and when I called reception, they told me it's still free. When I checked my bill prior to check-out, all my calls were charged $1 each plus telecommunications tax. When I complained that reception had told me a different story and they immediately apologized and took all those charges away from my bill.\nLocation location location was the biggest attribute of this hotel. Overall I was quite happy with my stay and would definitely consider going back on my next trip.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Since I'm a World of Hyatt member and the location is close to my office, I tried it once again after not visiting for a year. The experience was better, but I still had problems. Staff was courteous and overall service was good. F&B is provided by a 3rd party contractor that does only a mediocre job. This is a drawback to this hotel because the contractor does not have \"Hyatt standards\". \n\nThe problem I had was trusting the 4-hour Express dry cleaning service. I double-checked with Guest Services that 4 hours was \"in play\" before submitting slacks I needed for that evening. I was assured I would receive the order in 4 hours. I did not receive the dry cleaning in 4 hours, or 5 hours, or even that entire evening. They were brought to me the next morning a 6.30am  - knocking on my door and waking me up despite my \"do not disturb\" sign. That was very frustrating as nothing annoys me more than being promised something that can't be delivered. It would have been better to tell me 4 hours was not available. I could have then pressed the slacks myself. But in making a promise to me and breaking it, I had to cancel my plans that evening. It was very inconsiderate.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The bed was very comfortable and overall the room and bathroom were clean. We were on a high floor and could definitely hear every noise on the street below, but the street noise was quiet enough after midnight to get a good night of sleep.   \n\nOur only real issues with the room were some issues with the bathroom features and overall room lighting.  Our bathroom did not have any counter space - at all.  It was all sink, so while getting ready in the morning, everything had to go in the sink.  There also wasn't anywhere to hang the hand towel near the sink.  The lighting in the room was very minimal to begin with and one of the main lights in our room was broken during the duration of our stay which made the entire room very dark.  The light in the bathroom was also minimal which made it very difficult to even put makeup on.  \n\nOverall, we liked the hotel and location and would like to try to stay again with the hopes of getting a room with a little better lighting and bathroom sink situation.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The wifi was quite poor (worked better in the hallway) and the phone didn't work. Obviously a telecom problem in the room, but the lady at the front desk seemed determined to get it to work. After some back and forth (and several trips to the lobby since the phone didn't work), I requested a room change. What I got was a downgraded room (disappointing given the problem was with the hotel) on a lower floor that is much louder than the previous room, but hey the wifi works well...

Booked rooms more than a month in advance. We needed two connecting rooms so called them to ensure this. First response was a usual for hotel chains \u201cwe cannot guarantee you connecting rooms but will do our best\u201d. After some discussion I was assured that we would get connecting rooms and I received an email confirming this. A week before our arrival called to confirm and this is when some issues started - once you have a reservation, it is basically impossible to talk to a live representative-all automated responses. Tried to reach a representative a day before arrival - same result. And of course when we arrived (was not late at night) - we heard from the front desk \u201cwe gave all connecting rooms to other guests\u201d. I tried to explain to the front desk person that we had booked in advance, showed her the email confirmation but this was useless.  She was so rude and did not even try to pretend that she cared and wanted to help. She actually started lecturing me how hotels around the world worked and none could guarantee connecting rooms and some other non-sense.  I asked to talk to the manager on duty. Same result (at least he was not rude). Finally he promised to move us to connecting rooms next day (we booked for 5 nights). Of course nothing happened next day. They really do not care and this is not a cheap hotel to explain such attitude. \n\nHotel itself is ok but regular rooms are really small and \u201ccourtyard\u201d view is ugly and depressing even on high floor like 8.

I chose it because despite some of the negatives, it had a location that was good for me. I'm so glad I did. It was perfect. I was in town on business and also to visit my daughter who goes to school in the area. It was so nice to be in a quieter spot (versus Times Square area) and to walk around outside without being in the middle of chaos. I felt super safe and welcomed. The staff was extremely nice. Yes, the room was a bit small but not stupidly so. If I had one more person with me, we could manage but it would be tight. For a solo work trip it was just perfect. I LOVED my room with the terrace. Highly recommend. Ear plugs in cute little pouch on pillow was a nice touch but I didn't need them. Rooms and bathrooms were updated nicely. Pocket doors allow for more room in the bathroom and they don't skimp on towels. Slippers and nice robe for use. I read reviews that complained about the housekeeping. They leave a card in the room that clearly states how often your room will be cleaned and that it can be at any time between 9-6pm. If people read that stuff they wouldn't post negative comments. Just relax and enjoy the area. I have yet to find a hotel that has everything exactly as I want it but this one does a great job. Lots of outlets and ports on the desk and side tables. Lots of lights. One block from Union Square and the whole area is just so comfortable. This is my go-to hotel for my trips to New York from now on. ","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location is perfect and convenient to everything. The staff were all extremely attentive and professional. They quickly addressed and needs we had, and were always pleasant. Seriously can't say enough positive thing about the staff. \n\nWe also appreciated that the common bathrooms in the lower level are gender neutral and each stall is private. \n\nOur room was very comfortable overall. As with any hotel in NYC, it is on the smaller side. The only issue was lack of storage space - we had a hard time finding ways to organize our clothes and other items. \n\nOtherwise, it felt like enough space for a couple. The bathroom is a bit awkward and might be an issue for friends traveling together. The toilet is its own room with a pocket door and there is not much sound privacy. The shower has a frosted glass door but it is not completely private and is open to the rest of the room. Our toilet room could have benefited from a deep clean, but otherwise the room felt very clean. The toiletries are CO Bigelow and smell delish. The bed was comfortable and we did not find the street noise too loud (we were on the 10th floor). \n\nWe had room service a couple times; it was delicious and very fast. It is definitely on the expensive side, as was the minibar. We had to frequently ask for extra (free) coffee pods as only two were provided at a time. Also, the coffee pots were really inconsistent. Our first one stopped working altogether; we got a second one and it worked but didn't brew complete cups and leaked occasionally.\n\nWe stayed in an Urbane Sky room. It was nice, but not sure it was worth the added cost. It was nice to be on a higher floor and this likely limited the amount of street noise we had. Generally, the room was very quiet although if people stopped to talk in the hallway you could hear them very clearly.\n\nWe would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":3533197,"title":"Good location.  Poor housekeeping.  Loud, small rooms.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-01-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"We stayed here over the MLK weekend.\n\nI enjoyed the hotel's location, right off of Union Square.  It was a nice change from the big hotels in midtown Manhattan.  Subway stops were within steps of the hotel, as was the Union Square Green Market, a Whole Foods, a great NYC bookstore, and multiple restaurants.\n\nThe accommodation was okay.  The decor was stylish; the room was where-do-I-put-my-bags small--perhaps not unusual for NYC.  Some of the design elements in the room were not particularly well-thought-out:  the closet, for instance, was so small that it could barely hold one person's hanging clothes for 2 days, much less clothing for two.  The room needed more drawers; better furniture could have easily solved for that.  On the plus side, there were plenty of plugs, and the lighting was well-designed.\n\nThe sleep quality was average.  While the bed and linens were comfortable, our room was facing the street, and the noise control was very poor.  Admittedly, NYC is a loud city, but I have stayed in several properties that were better insulated against street noise.  Tons of sirens, etc., all night long--if you're a light sleeper, consider staying elsewhere or at least requesting a room that does not face the street.\n\nHousekeeping was very disappointing.  On the day I checked-in, soap was provided for the shower, but not for the sink.  On the next day, we left the room at 9:00a; when we returned to the hotel at 2:30p, our room had still not been cleaned.  I called to request housekeeping service after we left the room shortly thereafter; upon our return that evening, the service was sloppy:  the bed was made, but the trash cans had been emptied and sort of thrown back into the room (rather than placed under the desk), toiletries had not been refreshed, a bag of food waste had not been removed, dirty glassware had not been replaced, etc.  The pattern was similar the next day:  we were given conditioner instead of lotion, etc.  This poor attention-to-detail and incomplete service was surprising for a hotel of this price and brand.  To management's credit, when I complained about the service, I did receive an appropriate response.\n\nWhile the hotel worked fine for a personal stay, had I traveled there for business, I would feel mixed.  The lobby was small, with limited space to work or have conversations.  At night, it was very loud, due to the lobby bar.  The hotel does not have an executive lounge.  Internet service was somewhat slow, although free.\n\nAs a Hyatt Globalist, I was extended complimentary breakfast in the hotel's restaurant.  Service here was excellent and the food satisfactory.\n\nOverall, an average stay.  Given my experiences with the Hyatt brand, I expected a better experience than I had at this hotel.  I would consider staying there again, but I also would not make it my first choice in NYC.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We have stayed in a number of hotels, ranging from five star to barely one. We thought we had found our sweet spot with the Hyatt Union Square. We love the location and our previous couple of times had been fine. This trip however things went down hill fast. First we checked in and asked for a quiet room, preferably the same room as we have been staying in previously, 801. Floors 9-11 were closed to guess for some reason. Instead of a quiet room the front desk decided to surround us with a bus load of teenage girls who proceeded to stay up all night moving from one room to another with the music blaring.  This is why it was clear no guests were put on the upper three floors. It was more convenient to crowd every floor until it was full before opening up the next one. The next day after complaining to the front desk we went out from early morning, returning around 4:30pm only to find our room still not cleaned. We are frustrated as we have to wait in the lobby for 45 minutes only to discover the bed wasn't made, the room service trays and the trash was still in the room, after we were told the room was ready. Today we decided to be proactive let the front desk know that we would be out from 12-2 and could they please clean the room while were out. Came back, room hasn't been touched.

It was really surprising since the Hyatt product is usually fairly consistent but this was just so bad its hard to fathom why they would bother with having any room service at all.  Perhaps having ice machines and a small snack shop would do it and at least no one would expect anything more than that and likely would satisfy the majority of guests.\n\nWe still hand a wonderful time and again potentially would stay again since the location was so great and overall we had a good experience- we would just order in from Postmates or UberEats! \n\n","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The staff were polite, courteous and helpful. I usually stay exclusively at Hilton Hotels being a Diamond member but this time I thought I'd try something different.\n\nFirstly, the location of this hotel is excellent.\n\nThe hotel is very modern and clearly just been refurbished. The TV's are large flat screen LG's although for those who do this, I could not play films from USB key on them and had to use a HDMI lead from my laptop.\n\nWe never used the bar or ate breakfast. Breakfast is VERY expensive and there is a caf\u00e9 right over the road from the hotel called Sandwicherie which does a very good breakfast for $6.\n\nAfter the first night of our 7 day stay we found the housekeeping of the room to be a little sloppy having missed to clean \/ replace cups and glasses but this was not repeated so can be forgiven. We didn't raise this as a complaint, it was a minor misdemeanour. On another slightly negative note, when requesting some plates and cutlery to eat some cheese we purchased from a local shop, we had to request this twice as it was not delivered in the first instance.\n\nOverall it was a good stay and the best part was the location... If I am honest I'd probably stay elsewhere in future, not that there was anything wrong with the hotel but it didn't wow me.","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Nice restaurants around as well. The rooms are funky.  Hardwood floors are a plus.  The wardrobe in lieu of a closet is small but nice.  The technology is nice.  There are plenty of easily accessible plugs and lights. The beds were comfortable.Size was decent for NY.\n\nCons:  with the modern decor they put in a really weird bathroom.  The sink is outside the bathroom.  The bathroom has sliding glass doors that don't lock and don't close completely.  The shower is part of the bathroom with a drain floor.  I was not a fan of any of this.Also they used dark modern tile which is already showing signs of wear and lack of maintenance.  A bathroom like that is going to be very difficult to maintain.  They need to do a better job.  Though the bed was comfortable, the sheets were just okay. Not the finest linen.  \n\nOther:  there is a modern wine rack right when you walk into the room.

Whole Foods and Food Emporium are equally close. There's a great salad and sandwich place across the street that's open for breakfast. And there are restaurants for all budgets very close by.\n\nThe hotel is new, and free of the mustiness of some of its more famous competitors. Bed and bedding are both very good. However the rooms are small. I was traveling on my own this trip, so it was fine. But if my wife had been with me we would have been tripping over each other in the narrow space between bed and desk.\n\nShower but no bath.\n\nWiFi is \"free\", but only for the slowest speed of service. This is a bugaboo of mine; I figure if you're paying a couple of hundred bucks for a room, they can throw in an internet connection. So I stubbornly selected the Free option, and it was fine. Even with multiple devices. As the price list helpfully explains, you'll need to pay if you want video streaming (Skype, Netflix), but regular email, internet and even Netflix downloads were problem-free.\n\nCalls to Guest Services are answered promptly, and follow-up is quick.\n\nThere was no sign of a doorman when I arrived, which I assumed was part of the hotel's casual atmosphere. However every other time I went out or came back, there was someone to open the door or call a taxi.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the hotel is that the walls are thin and the doors are heavy. I had the misfortune to be next to a couple loudly in love, and it sounded like we were sharing a bed. Door closings are equally noisy. Bring ear plugs.\n\nWhile there are plusher hotels in more famous locations -- several of which I've stayed at for years -- there's a good chance I'll be back at the Hyatt Union Square on my next visit.

They did a great job fitting lots of amenities in a small space. The view from our eighth floor window was actually better than many I have seen in Manhattan.  The fitness room is in the basement level..well equipped, and well lit,  though no windows.\n\nTip:  valet parking is a bit pricey...$75 per night for an SUV.

Perfect spot for exploring the east village - don't miss Verameat for unique jewelry, Cloak and Dagger across the road for cute clothes and Oiji for a fabulous meal. Nearby Union Square market is fun as is a stroll up Broadway to Fishes Eddy, ABC Kitchen ( not food), Marimekko and their beautiful Dutch designs and then a lunch outside at Madison Square Park. Don't forget a stop at Eataly. The Hyatt was a solid base for our return to NYC - we lived here for a few years and did not want to stay in a tourist area - Hyatt is a great choice for this. Bowery Road restaurant in the hotel is a great place to grab lunch or dinner without spending too much money and it is a solid meal. Try the skirt steak and tomatoes if you a doing the carb free thing, yum. We could not get over how quiet the street was for sleeping. It can be noisy at night in the city ( you get use to it) but I never heard a thing and slept well. Bathroom had plenty of space, could use a make up mirror and the room for New York was a good size. Union Square is at the 14th street subway station which is a transfer station meaning you can get anywhere in the city. Use the subway it's easy and best way to see the city.

So comfy, I wore it around my room whilst doing email and meetings.  L O V E.  \n\nBesides that -it's a great location for the Union Square\/Flat Iron\/Shopping area.  Very close (shares the same big city block) with The Strand (18 miles of book shelves people) one of the oldest and certainly largest bookstores in Manhattan.  Great restaurants all around as well.  Tried the in room dining (Salmon and Roasted Cauliflower dish) my first night. yum. It's more boutique like than some of the other NYC Hyatthotels I've stayed at but nice.

The location is amazing because you are right off Union Square, with many subway lines and walking proximity to many neighborhoods in NYC: the East Village, NYU, Chelsea, the Flatiron, West Village, etc. \n\n1. Rooms: small by world standards, but standard when comparing to NYC hotels. We were upgraded to a room with a private balcony, which was lovely! The rooms are modern, with clean lines and many outlets. The separation between toilet and shower is a nice touch.\n\n2. Dining: We didn't eat at the hotel, but we had a couple drinks at the newly renovated bar. It's a nice place to grab a cocktail or a glass of wine before heading out.\n\n3. Gym: Very good!

On my first-day arrival, Sabeli patiently helped me to set up the Wi-Fi connection step-by-step.  In addition, she assisted me to call my shuttle bus company twice to confirm the pick-up service and advance the schedule. She was so considerate that she even actively inquire Uber about pick-up fee for my reference. Without her supports, I might be late for my flight. I could feel her passions for her job and I believe every customer enjoys her services.  Furthermore, I really appreciate the help of Francois Etienne. I had no idea that 4th road was blocked for marathons every weekend and waited for my shuttle bus to JFK airport on Sat morning. Francois actively contacted Supershuttle company and called the driver to change the meet-up location. Besides, he carried my big luggages and took me to the new pick-up place. It was a great support for tourists like me, who doesn't have local SIM card and can't contact shuttle bus driver for emergencies. Hyatt's service is indeed beyond my expectation.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

There were cars lined up but space was available quickly and going around the block once if you miss it is simple.  The front desk and bell team were excellent (thanks to Tenzing for all his help).  The hotel was very comfortable and the rooms were excellent and brand new.  The beds and pillows were excellent.  The mini-bar prices were extremely fair and not outlandish if you need a snack.

The service is very nice and helpful. Rooms are on the pricey side if there's high occupancy (like most of the hotels) but they're also very small. Nicely renovated, but there is every bit of space used. We stayed on the 7th floor and it wasn't too noisy (by NYC standards) but there is a fire department very nearby so we heard quite a few sirens through the nights. Loved our stay here. We had to change rooms (for a larger room) after a few nights and they moved us quickly and easily (for us).Nice fitness center on the bottom floor of the hotel.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

By next time, they will probably have been briefed. My standard room was small but adequate, especially by NY standards, and quiet. However, form did trump function in several respects: Clothing storage was minimal - room for one man traveling light for three ngihts but not much more. The only empty drawer was about a square foot in area and two inches deep!  A well-dressed couple who were attending the same event said they were living mainly out of their suitcases. Our group had a hospitality suite that included a wonderful outdoor patio. Free level of Internet service was good and usually worked with user-friendly credentials. There was a bi-lingual (Mac\/Windows) computer and printer off the lobby that let me print a return flight boarding pass. Lobby staff were very attentive and solicitous.

The room was large and clean and felt very new.\n\nDisclaimer: if you are traveling with children, this hotel may not be for you. The bathroom is an updated \"wet bathroom\" meaning once you step inside, whether you are showering or using the bathroom, you are in water. Example: my fiancee took a shower and got dressed. I then took a shower and during the time I was showering, my fiance needed to use the restroom. He had to take his pants and shoes back off because water from my shower was practically all over the toilet area floor. His feet were showered twice (lol!!) We laughed and said, if we had kids this would be really awkward and we would have sneaker mud prints everywhere. However, for 2 adults, we considered the design hip.\n\nThe food and drinks were delicious. There is a restaurant connected to the hotel that opened the weekend of our stay. We were going to eat out but are more than happy we stayed in. We loved the food so much that we had breakfast the next day inside the hotel. If anything, have the breakfast. It is in a quaint space with an open kitchen. Not pricey but delicious.\n\nThe doorman was so nice. He helped us find free street parking around 9pm right in front of the hotel.

When I told the front desk during checkin that I used to be a Platinum status years ago, they actually laughed and then told me to \"start over\" in World of Hyatt. Arrogant, weird service attitude. The room was small but nicely appointed. I never thought I would miss The Standard.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Rooms were nice and clean small for more than one person.  For the price I paid for this room I wouldn't expect to have construction going on and would expect top notch restaurant and bars but there was not because they were under construction.  They offered a 10% discount, doesn't seem like much for all the noise and lack of amenities.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were walking distance to just about everything we wanted to see and only a quick subway ride to Central Park.  Great restaurants, bars and coffee shops were all moments away.","travelDate":"2017-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}
