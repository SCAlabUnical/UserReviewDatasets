At least a complimentary morning cup of coffee with one's hotel key or a voucher, and possibly even an afternoon\/evening glass of wine, would have made the whole arrangement less off-putting for hotel guests. Barring that, put coffee-making facilities in the guest rooms (there were none).

The best attribute of the hotel is its location in Chelsea. It\u2019s fantastic. The rest was underwhelming. The hotel, in a\nRepurposed wing of the Episcopal seminary next door, is certainly shooting for an old New York aesthetic and in some aspects it succeeds. At the same time the experience, even when embracing it with goodwill, is death by a thousand cuts. The hotel is likely more pleasant in warmer months when it\u2019s outdoor space would allow guests to sprawl and take in the lively street scape. In the winter the pinched lobby feel claustrophobic (oddly a gorgeous interior staircase\u2014clearly once part of an entrance\u2014with cast iron balustrades is closed in and unseen; it serves only as an emergency exit. Sad design choice.  Hotel Customer service is lamentably inconsistent, a surprise for a high concept hotel at this price point, and the glacially-paced elevator is almost a character in the hotel\u2019s narrative, so often do waiting guests commiserate together about it. Our third-floor room was bright because of the lovely and enormous window looking out onto 10th Avenue. Heeding previous comments I requested a room on a higher floor on the back of the hotel but none was available. It was a situation I would come to regret. The bed was exceedingly comfortable and the small bathroom adequate (one can only do so much with a repurposed seminary dorm room). The ornamental fireplace added charm. Oddly there was no comfortable chair just a hard chair at the antique desk. The room size was also adequate (it is Manhattan) though it would have been better served by a queen-sized bed rather than a king, which made it feel cramped. The comfort of the bed cauls not compensate for the noise level, which made sleep impossible. As we knew it was likely to be loud we take responsibility; we would never stay at the hotel again simply because of this. The morning coffee bar and it\u2019s evening cocktail companion were nice touches, though the prices seems excessive for in-house services. The stay was fine but there are better options in the neighborhood. Overall, the hotel merits a \u201cmeh.\u201d","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Even more unfortunately, they will never guarantee requests will be honored. I booked the room over the phone this time and begged for a quiet room. The person I spoke with volunteered to put us on the back side of the hotel, gave us the room number and said he would mark it \"Do Not Move\" so that we would definitely be in that room. When we arrived we were led to Room 2- second floor, right on 10th Ave. It's not an exaggeration when I say it felt like we were right in the street. It's an old hotel and there was an AC unit in the window without any seal so essentially the window was open to the street. It was awful.

When we went downstairs to enquire on the first day, we were told that you have to run the tap for up to 15 minutes for the water to heat up! On two subsequent mornings when we tried this and there was still no hot water, we were advised that the boiler was out. On our final day, having had our plans delayed for the third time because of the lack of hot water, we informed reception that we needed to go out and would check out later in the evening before our flight because we needed to shower before travelling. When we checked out and I enquired about compensation for the bad experience we had had during our stay, the receptionist stated that they had generously waived a late check out fee... \n\nThere only ever seemed to be one member of staff in the hotel at any given time and each of them was equally indifferent and unhelpful. No one offered to help with our bags and there was generally no proactive effort to make us feel comfortable or welcome, I requested to speak to the manager several times during our stay and was advised each time they would call me, but they never did. On the final morning, when we did manage to see the manager in person, he was just as ambivalent as every other employee. \n\nOn top of all this, the rooms are tired and dark. There is a certain charm to the decor, but it feels worn and uncomfortable and there is no sound proofing. The net curtains were torn and stained brown. We spent the entire trip trying to avoid spending any time in our $900\/night room. New York is a great city, but our experience at the High Line put a real dampener on it. I couldn't recommend it less and still have an angry feeling in the pit of my stomach about being thoroughly ripped off. I really wish we had left and found another hotel on our first night. Never to be repeated.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Having previously stayed at the property several years ago, both the quality of service and the hotel itself are seriously diminished. They stuck us in what was clearly a former boiler room located literally in the lobby (Rm #6)  and across from the elevators. \n\nWhen we inquired about switching rooms, the woman who checked us in, was dismissive, unhelpful, and unfriendly. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to check on the availability of any other room, merely saying that the hotel was fully booked. We were checking in at 4pm, so it was highly unlikely that all the rooms had already been allocated. Don\u2019t worry - there wasn\u2019t a single person behind us waiting to be checked in, so time was not of the essence. Unfortunately she was the only available staff to communicate with. Later in the evening when we explained that the AC did not seem to be properly working, the same woman told us it was \u201c motion detecting and energy efficient\u201d and that it would start working after 15 minutes of being in the room. After spending an entire night in the room, I\u2019ve never experienced a balmier 65 degrees in my life. The system clearly never caught on to the two humans and a dog who were in there as it continued to blow warm air at us. It\u2019s ok - the people directly on the other side of our window - where the bar is located - looked like they were enjoying the cooler night air. \n\nHotel amenities were also sparse - one bar of soap between the sink and bath, no shower cap, and one stained robe (see photo). No extras in sight. There was nothing in the room that wasn\u2019t nailed down. The dimly lit room was sparsely decorated, and unfortunately we couldn\u2019t even offset with natural light without the guests at the bar being privy to our every move and nook and cranny. \n\nThe misery of this room didn\u2019t last too long because at 5:50 am the hotel staff were coming and going from the adjacent storage room, as they were getting ready for their day. As the room is located in the lobby we were also lucky enough to be part of every single conversation between the elevator and hotel front door. And while this hotel claims to be pet friendly, sticking a dog with every imaginable stimuli isn\u2019t friendly at all. Even our poor pup didn\u2019t get a good nights sleep. None of our issues were at all COVID - related, and I would suggest that the high line hotel adjust their prices to reflect their updated quality. I\u2019m contrast - we stayed that the Greenwich Hotel a few weeks ago, and could not be happier with every single element of our stay. Highly recommend them, and really any other number of fabulous hotels we\u2019ve stayed at. Sorry to say that high line is no longer among them. \n\nPhotos: stained robe, disgusting bathroom tiles, missing hooks, gross sink.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The location is amazing - in the heart of charming and historic Chelsea. The building is beautiful and historic - connected to the General Seminary. The al fresco bar out front (not affiliated with the hotel) is quite nice. The hotel? Disappointing. There is no doorman to assist with luggage or hail cabs, which is customary for this level of hotel in the city. The hotel rooms need a refresh - the furniture is scratched and scuffed; my lampshade had been bashed in and not replaced. Light bulbs were out. The mattress is old. But the worst is the nonexistent and indifferent service. The lobby is very small. Due to Covid, a coffee bar that is probably usually quite lively was closed, and coffee service is set up outside instead. There were several large cardboard boxes piled on top of the closed coffee bar. But the real issue is that the one person manning the lobby is almost always seated looking away from incoming guests, staring at a computer, and rarely turns their head to welcome or speak to guests. New York was just opening up when we were there, and all restrictions had just been lifted, but businesses had discretion to require masks or not. So it was confusing all over the city. Upon entering the lobby for check-in, I was greeted with, \u201cyou need a mask.\u201d Not hello, welcome, would you please wear a mask?\u201d I was given a room on the first floor, immediately facing bar tables (full of people) right outside my window. From the street you could see into my room. All in all, not what I had expected based on reading about and seeing photos of the hotel. Let\u2019s just say the lobby person didn\u2019t handle my request to move professionally - she said there were no solutions and suggested I just close my blackout curtains the whole time. In fairness, the manager contacted me the next day and offered to move me, but this was after I had already unpacked and made peace with all the people right outside my window because I had been told I had no other options. Only after several days did I stumble upon the fact that there was an honor bar with bottled water, snacks, wine, etc. No one bothered to tell us anything about the amenities. I won\u2019t be back unless I read about a major upgrade in the service level and refurbished rooms. It\u2019s a shame, because the concept of the hotel with its historic ambience is so appealing.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The official check in time is 3pm, but I was not able to get in until 4:30pm.  I never received any apology for the delay in the room preparation.  I got a lame excuse for such delay, but no apology.  The explanation for such delay and inconvenience was that the hotel was fully sold out, which meant the hotel was fully occupied to the extent permitted by the current covid rules.  My take on this sorry excuse is that if the hotel is not ready to accept guests at the published check-in time because the house keeping crew cannot handle the demand, then it should not accept that many guests.  The reception also told us that they were doing the best they could.  Well, their best was not good enough when the guest had to wait 1 hour and 30 mins to get in the room she\/he paid for.  Such excuse is only valid if the guest is asking for something he\/she is not entitled to have. The reception kept telling me to wait 10 mins more.  When did 10 mins start to mean 90 mins?   Having said that, one room out of 2 rooms I booked was ready on time, but not without trouble.  The reception gave my mother the wrong room number and the keys to the wrong room,, so my mother had to go up and down to get the correct room number and the corresponding key.  The reception kindly reminded me that the other room was ready when I complained about the delay in getting my room.  I had no clue as to what she was trying to tell me.  There is a reason why you book 2 rooms instead of one.  It's because you want your own room.  If I wanted to share a room with another person, I would have booked one room and pay for one instead of two!  The reception staff also told me that she had tried calling me when the room was ready which was between 4 and 4:30.  I never received any call from the hotel that day.  I even took a screenshot of my incoming call history to prove that no such call was made.  To add more stress to the situation, when my mother (72 years old) and I tried to use the restroom in the lobby, we were told to go elsewhere because the restroom was closed.  I told her that we were guests of the hotel and she said that it was recommended that we use the restroom in our room....  At that time, not one room was ready for our use....  Further, the restroom was occupied by someone and we were waiting for that person to finish using the rest room.  I was totally confused at that point.  The rest room is open for some people but not for us???  There are so many hotels with 4 stars in NYC.

The place is charming with a beauty outdoor patio for you to grab the perfect cup of espresso by Intelligentsia. The rooms are big and the address is central if you need to be downtown. Bed comfortable. Soap and shampoo by Bigelow which I love. And water pressure in shower is amazing. Upon check in. We were upgraded. Thank you. \n\nNow, no one to take luggage to the room. No room service no breakfast at hotel or even lunch. AC didn\u2019t work they even brought a fan and changed the filter and still no go. Had to leave window open and then there is the noise of all the construction on the Highline. On Night two of 4 I asked to move my room please and was ignored. Wrong person to ignore. No one should be ignored. Better to say we can\u2019t accommodate sorry. Saw rodent run across patio dinning area freaked me out so closed window there is no screen. Didn\u2019t sleep well at all. Staff not attentive. Again wanted to love this spot and come back. \n\nWhat they need to do to up their A game in the hotel industry and do it now. Yes I\u2019m an expert so I will share. \n\nKeep all the charm. The building the fixtures the antiques especially rugs  and furniture in the room. DO NOT MODERNIZE this beautiful building. \nMorning this patio is packed... so silly distance of course. It\u2019s a great opportunity to be able to provide some food more than just a few muffins and morning pastries. \nPerhaps an avocado toast a ricotta toast and egg salad toast things that can be easily made and quick. \nUpgrade or heating and air-conditioning units make sure that things work in the room including light fixtures which was another issue in my room. It\u2019s New York City so rodents are expected. Have someone take my luggage up to my room I know it\u2019s an extra expense but the state wasn\u2019t cheap you can certainly have someone socially distant and wearing gloves taking up the luggage so I don\u2019t have to take it up all the stairs before I get to the elevator. \nFix all the cracks on the floors in the rooms the ceilings the bathrooms nobody wants to see that it\u2019s kind of gross you can still look vintage but I have a clean finish. \nUp the age bracket of the people you have handling the front desk or just train your current stuff a little bit better in hospitality I get it that this is like a BoHo chic property but still being that all this is happening on the Highline right now you\u2019re going to get the upper scale guests staying here might as well get them to come back. \nOverall as much as I\u2019d like to give it a four out of five I\u2019m really at a three 3 1\/2 and that\u2019s because the outside bus is the biggest attraction to this place.

Not only was the staff extremely courteous and accommodating, but the rooms' unique features take you back in time. Since the property was a dormitory for Episcopalian priests in the late 19th century, the exterior's gothic architecture and the interior's classic design transport you to this bygone era . This old world sensibility was reflected in my room's rotary, landline phone and in the 1890's pencil sharpener that was mounted to my desk! Just as another reviewer stated, there is a magic in the air at this hotel. What is more, the hotel is just steps away from the High Line Park. With its lush, elevated gardens the park seems to float above the city, exuding the fresh, fragrant scents of seasonal wildflowers and rich foliage.

After quite a wait we asked for some water and were told we could have some but it would be charged to our room which we declined. The manager said yes it was a smaller room but still in the upgraded class of king size room that i paid for.  He did not care about the air conditioning or lack of help moving rooms.

Its location is perfect: we were easily able to walk to Soho, the Flatiron district, midtown and Tribeca.  And it feels like you're staying in the New Yorkers' New York, not in the main tourist areas.  But we had a couple of experiences that let us down.  Firstly when we arrived and checked in we flopped on the bed and my hand fell to the floor and there, half under the bed, was a broken tumbler smashed into pieces; not just a few fragments - a fairly sizeable pile of glass.  Which was really worrying given we could easily have walked through it. I didn't cut my hand but that's by luck.  I called down to concierge to explain that there were dozens of pieces of broken glass by the bed and she replied \"Oh, and were they already there when you entered the room?\" - as though she thought perhaps I had smashed the glass myself.\nSecondly during our stay New York was locked down due to COVID-19 and most people checked out and left.  My partner and I were one of only two rooms still occupied at the hotel. On our last day, Virgin cancelled our flight back to London due to flight restrictions and we didn't know how or when we were going to get home. Hopeful I could get us on an emergency flight that night, I asked the hotel if we could remain in our room a few hours more to sort it out.  Despite there only being one other room occupied, the concierge refused to let us stay in the room to sort out an emergency flight and said if we wanted to use the facilities past our check-out time she would have to charge us another full day's rate.\nGiven that it was an emergency and we had literally no way of knowing if\/ when we would get home to our families and jobs and dogs back in the UK, I would have thought we'd be allowed a few hours in the room to try to make arrangements.  \nOverall it just left us with a sour taste in our mouths.  Which is a pity because the hotel is lovely and the porters downstairs in reception were lovely.","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"NONE"}

You can barely close the bathroom door. The bathroom is so small, they don't even have a towel rack. The waste basket had to be placed behind the toilet it was so small in there.No counter space either. The vent up above was caked with dust and debris. There was no filter.

The walls inside were slanted like an attic and my husband hit his head twice. There is no bar, restaurant nor room service available.

Once inside, a low-key friendly check-in process introduces you to their personable staff. In the best sense of the word, this hotel has a casual (but professional) tone that makes for a nice decompression from the busy dynamics of Manhattan. 'Warm and cozy' are two words that come to mind. Is this a shiny, high-tech, officious wham-bam experience? Hardly. I do know I've never slept in a hotel bed as comfortable as the one in our room. Ever. The weekend we stayed there was a sweet Dog Parade\/Halloween morning event that saw both local toddlers, parents, and doggies in their best Halloween finery(I wish coming back in the next life as a pampered canine living in Chelsea).

Old manual typewriters sit on the lobby coffee tables, which you should use to bust out an impromptu poem. Beds were cozy, the room was clean and nicely decorated, and the shower was strong. Each room is different. Wooden floors creaked in places, which you could hear occasionally from room to room, but that only added to the charm for us. They have bikes you can borrow, and the hotel is only a block or two from the Greenway bike trail, which is amaze-balls. Runs all up and down and around he revitalized Manhattan riverfront (both rivers!).\n\nThe staff couldn't have been sweeter or more helpful, from recommendations to bike borrowing to a friendly smile. Extra special appreciation goes out to Emily, Tidi, Joan (jo-ahn'), and Christian.\n\nOnly a few blocks from Chelsea Market, and right next to the High Line trail. A couple of spots we loved were the Cookshop right next door and Bathtub Gin (which is set up like a speakeasy, so enter at the address and don't try to look for a sign). Wanted to hit the Empire Diner but ran out of time. Also bummed we ran out of time to hit the Sullivan Street Bakery. \n\nOther trip highlights: Nix restaurant (vegetarian) in the East Village, Palma in Greenwich, Osteria 57, Becco, and a tour of a small, indoor vertical farm (the future, people!!!) that grows microgreens called Farm.One in Tribeca.

I had a nice walk to the fitness center early in the morning and found top of line fitness equipment in a HUGE facility.  \n\nLater, we walked across to the High Line Park, which is almost like being in a different location all together.\n\nThe hotel decor is very nice and the coffee shop on the first floor is a popular place among locals.  Always full of people inside and out.  The rooms were large compared to other hotels in New York.  Sleep was peaceful and the beds were really comfortable.  \n\nIt is going to be hard staying anywhere else when visiting New York in the future.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It was bizarrely uncomfortable physically and interpersonally. \n\nI arrived when a magic show (?) was getting out in the tiny lobby so it was essentially as busy as Times Square at rush hour. No one helped me get my bag inside and I had to wander around getting buttressed by the sea of magic show (??) attendees before someone realized I was trying to check in. At that point the bellman took my bag and had me sit on a couch, where I waited in a chaotic rush of people until someone who worked there finally arrived to check me in. She was distracted and not terribly nice, mainly concerned about telling me what the hotel does not have (food, room service: no; magic show: yes (???)). When I called down later to ask if they would let a delivery guy bring takeout to my room (a fair question, i thought, since the tiny elevator requires key-card access) the front desk snapped at me that they don't have room service. (Which, yes, I know, that is why I am ordering takeout to my hotel room after a 12 hour travel day at 10pm, thanks SO MUCH for your help). Which is a long of saying: frictive, claustrophobic atmosphere, where you are made to feel like a problem. Not a good vibe from a hotel that seems to mainly offer vibe as its primary amenity.\n\nDuring the daytime the lobby turns into an Intelligentsia, and since it is tiny, it is just as rammed as when the magic show (????) is happening, plus full of dogs, one of which I tripped over trying to get up to my room. The front patio was closed for some reason, the back patio is tiny, the bar closes at 1030, there is no restaurant aside from the coffee shop. Our room was fine, deliberately shabby, kind of like if you stayed at the clean, bland guest room in your rich friend's parent's pied-a-terre, except they would at least have a kitchen and their living room would not be filled with dogs and a magic show (?????)\n\nIf this hotel were not charging $500 a night I would be more tolerant of its \"quirks\" but it is actively unpleasant getting in and out of, there is no lobbyish space to unwind, and they could be a lot more charming or at least less confrontational about offering zero percent of the basics i could get with a smile at the denver airport courtyard marriott. \n\nbut i hear the magic show (???????) is just great.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is in a repurposed religious seminary, occupying a magnificant old building. Our room was quite large by NYC standards, and featured a view of the quiet courtyard at the rear of the building. Everything is done in dark wood tones, especially the lobby, which is luxurious, warm and welcoming. The hotel lobby, and its espresso bar, appear to be a meeting point for the community (and their dogs!). It helped us feel like we were part of the community and not just tourists passing through. \n\nWe found the hotel to be well situated near the High Line itself (well, obviously!), as well as Chelsea and the Meat Packing district. We walked down into the West Village quite easily. We are in NYC quite often, and we are always looking for hotels that are away from the traditional tourist areas. This fits the bill.\n\nWe went in the winter, so we couldn't take advantage of their bicycle rental, but I definitely will take one out on the west side bike trail next time we are there in better weather. \n\nOne heads up: there are short flights of stairs that join the various wings of the old building, so I would think that you should let them know ahead of time if you need an accessible room. The staff was really friendly, and the espresso bar in the lobby made really great bevvies.\n\nWe will definitely be staying here again.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We treated another couple so we got to experience two rooms. I cannot overstate how delighted we were with every aspect of the hotel. First, the rooms were larger than expected and especially compared to usual boutique NY hotels that are less than $500 a night. Both the king room and queen rooms had a walk in closet and plenty of room to move around. Another amazing thing for an old quirky building: silence. We were on the 4th floor over a semi busy road and never heard traffic or even sirens. Lovely bath with good shower\/water pressure. And (see other reviews) we had zero issues with HVAC. \n\nNext, the vibe. The coffee shop which turns into a bar at 6pm is happy and a mix of residents and locals and lots of dogs. We were there on a cold winter weekend, so it was a tad chilly, but it was warm in spirit. If you come in the summer (we have been for drinks) there is lovely outdoor space, all ok for dogs.

Really my only complaint was the lack of light in the room - brighter bulbs & more light is definitely needed, as is a light in the closet. There's a very popular coffee bar in the \"lobby\" which has some indoor & outdoor seating - it gets a big crowd & since it's a dog friendly hotel, there are lots of pups around too. The hotel staff was very friendly & helpful. The location is excellent, especially if you want to go over to the High Line or to Chelsea Piers.

We wanted to be near as many art galleries as possible, and we spent one entire day checking out exhibit after exhibit quietly tucked away in the blocks near the hotel.\n\nThe hotel is a funky appealing mixture of old and modern. We were warmly greeted by the staff and checked in via laptop, no desk! The mosaic-tiled lobby is small and packed with hipsters perusing their laptops and phones. A coffee station\/bar is off to one side. The space gives way to a generous patio out back, with numerous tables and chairs surrounded by a courtyard wtih large leafy trees.\n\nWe were quickly and cheerfully check in. Room 1 is a King Suite, gargantuan by New York standards. Wood floors,. The ceilings are high, there is wooden molding everywhere, the furniture is second hand, but in a good way, not shabby. The bed is completely modern, a veritable cloud of crisp white linen comfort.\n\nWe had a seating area with table, couch and two chairs, various side tables, a desk with chair and stool, flat screen large TV, The mini bar and fridge is cleverly housed in a mid-century modern cabinet. I should add, they should call it a maxi-bar. Man was it packed with every kind of booze you could want. Check the price list provided before you start popping those bottles!\n\nThe room has huge windows covered by sheers and velvet floor-length curtains. Beyond the windows is a quiet grass filled courtyard dotted with large trees. Serene space, accessible through the hotel's aforementioned patio.\n\nThe bathroom was enormous and I loved it. Old New York bathroom black and white tiled floor. Sparkling clean new sink encased in a generous marble counter. A nice little selection of amenities, plenty of towels, large fluffy robes and slippers. I padded around in the robe a lot, loved it for lounging. \n\nThe shower is spotless, could use a grab bar. Terrific water pressure. Shower curtain did that billowy thing that gets a little irritating when it sticks to your body. Bench in the bathroom very handy for laying out clothes. Could use another bar to hang towels.\n\nThe lobby features a coffee station that converts to a bar at night. A wonderful caramelized-sugar aroma greeted us every morning from the lobby.  I ordered an oat-milk latte and was bowled over. I ordered two the next day!\n\nIf you exit the hotel and turn left, you'll get to a small grocer that has provisions. For the mini-bar averse, this grocer will save you some $$$. Good beverages, made-to-order salads and sandwiches. You can get what you need here to tide you over. I even saw them cutting wheat grass for a fancy fresh juice. They call themselves Chelsea Market, but don't be fooled, this is not THE Chelsea Market, more on that later.\n\nOf course the High Line walkway is right there, across the street from the hotel and down one block.\n\nDon't miss the Chelsea Market. It's amazing and about five blocks from the hotel. We were looking for Los Taco restaurant and didn't realize it was inside the Market. The CM is an amazing indoor complex of cool shops, specialty vendors, eateries and watering holes. What a find. We loaded up on amazing tacos and had dinner in Manhattan for under $20.Mind you, we were eating off paper plates, standing up at a table shared with strangers, but, still, it was delicious.\n\nThe room was quiet and comfortable, the hotel is charming, the staff is friendly. Two nights cost us upwards of $1400. This was a splurge for a big birthday. For that much money, I want 24-hour room service and the ability to make coffee in my room. Despite the many positives, my next splurge in Manhattan will be with a hotel that offers more bang for the buck.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Bathrooms have vintage tile, but old-school tub-showers.  Windows aren't triple-glazed so 10th Ave noise is an issue. If you are arriving by cab\/uber for a night or two and just want to enjoy High Line and Chelsea galleries, it's perfectly fine.

You walk into an over-crowded, tiny and noisy lobby -- these are all underdressed people poring over their electronic devices and looking as though they are waiting for a Greyhound bus.  There is no check-in desk -- no room for one, so you stand in the middle of the crowd (these are not hotel guests) and try to register.  Upstairs the hallways are dimly lit and smell bad.  Our suite was the size of a regular hotel room elsewhere, and the bathroom was tiny and dated.  The furnishings were straight out of Goodwill, and if they paid retail for anything in there, they got scammed.  The room was a strange shape -- not cool strange -- and in order to get into and out of the bed, I had to duck under an eve next to the window, (which was missing a screen).  The bookshelves were stocked with dusty old and honestly, who reads Voltaire on vacation?  Four bright spots -- the bed itself, which was comfortable -- the in-room a\/c, which was easy to use -- the oversize bathrobes, which were super comfortable -- and a well-stocked mini bar.  But for $625 dollars, it ought to have a few good qualities, right?.  I like the fact that it's dog friendly, though an early morning barking match between a dachshund and a lab in the lobby was a rude awakening.  I kept thinking the place would grow on me.

From the second we came in the greeting was warm and casual.   We were all given wonderful, large rooms ( a request for a special room for my mom was granted -  the 5th floor plus a sitting area that provided a great space for the 5 of us to catch up ! ) The charming decor, fab mini bar\/ snack basket - windows that open!... onto a courtyard and  the most comfortable bed ever made the rooms a hit.  Situated steps from the High Line, a few blocks from Chelsea market  - the location was perfect. And the wonderful staff ( thank you Robert for printing boarding passes, tracking down forgotten clothes in closets. sigh ) were always there when you needed them, discreetly.  But there is something else at work here and that is in their overall decision to be a part of their New York neighbourhood.  They chose to have the coolest coffee house in town in town, Intelligentsia instead of a formal lobby.  Smart.   They allow dogs! They welcome local children ( and parents ) to their Annual Easter party!  This meant there was always a local to chat with if you wanted to or a couch to read on.  We never felt like tourists, just a bunch of regulars sipping on our coffees before heading out to do our thing...","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Chelsea location right off the High Line (as the name suggests) is great for ready access to lower Manhattan and is much more sedate than Midtown.  The building is very cool and it was a nice reno job.  This is not a full service luxury property, but it also is not priced like one and is a good value.  There is no full service restaurant -- just pastries and espresso for breakfast at the small bar\/coffee house that is also the very small lobby.  Still, that type of intimacy is part of the charm.  The room was very comfortable, albeit smallish (typical NY).  It was quiet, with a comfortable bed and good shower.

The first comment my mom made was \"This is a 'young' hotel.\"  And it's true, it did feel a little hip for a traditional hotel.  The small lobby with funky-cool decor and old typewriters has a daytime coffee bar that converts to a bar in the evenings and there are bespoke bikes available to borrow for hotel guests.\n\nThere is no restaurant in the hotel or associated with it, so it's just the coffee bar with a few pastries (but no bagels!) for food options.  There is a popular restaurant next door that had an hour-long wait Friday evening and a 30 minute wait for Saturday brunch.  We skipped the hour wait for dinner, but did stick it out for the brunch and thought it very good.  The room also came generously stocked with a tray full of snacks and a fridge full of drinks, all for the typical price for such conveniences.  But there is a bodega just a block and a half away where you can get less expensive versions of the same things.\n\nAccording to the website and the staff we talked to, this hotel used to be dorms for the adjacent seminary.  The layout seems to jive with that.  We were on the third floor very near the elevator, which made me anxious, but I honestly never heard or was annoyed by hallway noises.  Likewise, I did not hear noises from the next rooms either.\n\nThe air conditioner in our room was on the fritz, but the hotel staff acted quickly to remediate it.  The hotel was full that evening, but they offered to move us to another room the next day.  We ended up staying in the original room (our choice) after they installed a window unit.\n\nTo note: there is a city bus stop nearby, but the nearest subway stop is several blocks away.  We ended up hailing cabs for most excursions, which wasn't the cheapest option, but certainly made things easier for my senior mom.  And this hotel may not be 100% accessible, as there were a few steps down into the hotel lobby and I didn't notice an alternate entrance or ramp.\n\nThe hotel was very nice and generally quiet, and the staff eager to help.  The bed was comfortable, too.  The proximity to the High Line was great (and the room even had a beautiful book all about the High Line).  I would stay here again, but not with a senior companion.","travelDate":"2017-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":4283443,"title":"A True Gem in Chelsea","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-10-24","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Trying to find a unique property in any unfamiliar location can be challenging, especially when you are relying on the internet. Couple that with very strict requirements and expectations may leave you with virtually no options. I contacted The High Line Hotel through their contact link on their website and received my first response very timely. From that moment forward, no matter my request or question, I was never left without an answer. \n\nI would like to mention a few people that helped me make my 2-day event perfect: \nMadeline Aguiar - Sr. Sales Manager; Tara Lissade - Director of Special Events Sales; David Quins - Front Office Manager and Andy Patel - Director of Special Events Operations\n\nMy expectations would not have been met without this team and their extremely professional staff. \n\nThe Hotel: Location is not in the chaos of areas like Times Square. It's in quaint and lovely Chelsea. You can grab a taxi from any of the three major airports (LGA, EWR, JFK) and get to the property. It's within walking distance of the Chelsea Market which is a food emporium along with some shopping. It's steps away from the High Line, which is a wonderful 1.45 mile elevated walking park that is created on the former NY Central Railroad. I encourage you to look up the history of the building - you will be amazed. One of the most amazing facts is that the story 'Twas the Night Before Christmas was written at the High Line Hotel. I understand Christmas is extra special and the decorations are spectacular. I was here in the fall and there was over 800 gourds and pumpkins of every size decorating the property - it was just lovely. The exterior and interior is extra special. If you love historic, wonderful, charming and a boutique style - this is the place for you. Pick up a book or two, sit in the front courtyard or back courtyard and have a cup of coffee or a cocktail and just enjoy the scenery. Note: the restaurant was closed for the season.\n\nThe Room: There are only 60 and they are spacious - not at all what you would think for NY. The beds are to die for and pure charm is oozing from the wooden floors to the old fireplace (no, they don't work) to the windows to furnishings. Again, plenty of reading material if you are a book person. I had plenty of closet space (two closets in fact). The bathroom was roomy with plenty of towels and toiletries. If you are concerned with the lighting (too dark), take note - the wall switches all have dimmers - you can adjust as needed. The only negative that I have to mention is the bathroom shade was broken (in the down position) and it was stained. I was actually quite surprised by this. The furnishings have some paint chips and dents but this IS NOT a negative - this adds to the look and feel of being in a building that was completed in 1895 (originally a seminary and a portion of the building still is - again, look up the history or ask someone at the hotel).\n\nMy reason for being in NY was for business. I planned a sit down plated dinner for 36 at this property with a bar set up outside of the room we ate in. I also had a breakfast, lunch and snack the next day along with an all-day meeting. The rooms were set up exactly as I needed and a special mention to Andy who saved the day by finding me the right connection to their video equipment. Service on all levels at this property was outstanding. \n\nIt won't matter why you need to come to NY. I encourage you to book at The High Line Hotel - you will not be disappointed! Remember, everything is a walk or a taxi away.\n\nSafe travels!","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location can't be beat--right off the High Line park, and very close to great galleries and restaurants in Chelsea.\n\nIf you haven't researched it yet, the High Line Hotel is built in part of the old Episcopal Seminary building (another part of the same building is still active as a seminary). The rooms are quite spacious, especially for New York. On this visit, we had a standard room which was quite large. There was plenty of room for a king sized bed, a small sofa and sitting chair with a coffee table, and a small desk. Because the guest rooms were created from seminary rooms, the proportions can be odd but this really adds to the charm, in my opinion. Our room happened to be at ground level, right on the corner of 10th Ave and 21st St. I was worried about traffic noise but they must have triple-paned windows because we heard nothing from the street. In addition, they have heavy velvet drapes which also block our light and sound. In fact, the only issue we had with sound was hearing the thumping bass from a wedding party occurring elsewhere in the hotel.\n\nThe hotel has two courtyards--one on the exterior of the building, where there are cafe tables and an Intelligentsia Coffee truck, and another on the interior of the building with built in benches. Many neighborhood residents come here for the coffee and the wifi, often bringing their dogs. The whole hotel is dog-friendly, even offering a bowl of treats by the door.\n\nWe really love this place and will come back again. Not the cheapest place but definitely high quality and friendly.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It's in an old church and has a lot of character.  Old wooden floors, an old elevator with a door that closes to operate, an old working rotary phone in the room.  Neat.  The rooms are large (not New York large, large by any measure).  The water pressure was amazing. There is a nice courtyard in front of the hotel and a very comfortable lobby inside.  There is coffee most all day and cocktails with a full bar at night to be enjoyed in either location.  We wanted to love the High Line, but didn't.  \n\nWhat we didn't like is that the High Line is rough in too many areas.  The linens are poor quality and the mattress even worse.  The mattress had sunken spots, so the solution was a thick comforter under the bottom sheet.  The bed was one of the worst I've ever slept on and the combination of the duvet on top and the bulk underneath was awful  The rug in our room was worn through due to foot traffic\/vacuum\/etc.  The bathroom, while nice, had a gouge in the toilet lid and poor caulk work.  The furniture has rub marks on virtually every edge (even the newer furniture).  Our overall impression was that the High Line missed great by just a little more invested in the maintenance and renovation.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Intelligentsia coffee bar in the lobby with breakfast treats converts to a bar in the evenings - just the right ambiance for a quiet drink or nightcap.   \n\nAnd for those of you looking for more to do...steps away you can find world class dining, shopping, views, bars and nightlife. \n\nI highly recommend The High Line Hotel to anyone looking for a step above the ordinary in NY.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It has to be one of the worst rooms in the entire building. While it's on the top floor, the room is located directly across from the incredibly loud elevator and is facing 10th Ave, which sounds like a highway no matter what time it is. Even though the room has double-paned glass windows, the traffic noise sounds like the windows are wide open. The hotel does not proactively provide earplugs (only when asked), which are basically required if you are looking to get any sleep in room 51. Earplugs should be given by default to all rooms, or at least all rooms facing 10th! Additionally, I was not told about the free guest pass to Equinox during my stay nor were we given slippers in our room. During our 2nd and 3rd nights, housekeeping removed the rug towel in the bathroom and never replaced it. Room 51 also has a tiny bathroom, but a large, walk-in closet.\n\nEach room comes with a bluetooth speaker but the one in room 51 had a broken USB cable and didn't charge. I had to use the USB cable I brought to charge it. Additionally, all the power outlets are old and awful, all my chargers fell out of the outlets!

Room 56 has a spacious bathroom and a small closet. It is silent at night because it's not facing a busy street. This marginally redeemed my stay here.\n\nIf you value sleep and rest, demand a room facing the courtyard and refuse to stay in anything facing 10th ave or a room on the 1st floor. If they can't accommodate you, go elsewhere.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It's become my go-to favorite hotel in the Chelsea\/Meatpacking area. Rooms are charming, clean and cozy - filled with character and well-designed details like beautiful Arts and Crafts wallpaper, fireplaces, and plants. The rooms feel homey, but in an elevated, chic way. The lobby is gorgeous, and the Intelligentsia coffee bar in the morning turns over to a cozy cocktail bar in the evening (complete with great prices on bottles of Veuve). It's dog friendly, and the staff is always welcoming and helpful. I also love how close it is to the high line, and the west side waterfront - great for running on the river, or walking the high line at night. Lastly, there's no gym in premises, but that means access to the Equinox a couple of blocks away (way better than a tiny hotel gym in my book).","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It is directly across from a parking lot, and the outside looks kind of \"usual,\" but when you step through the gates your entire view changes. There is a wonderful courtyard with benches and places to sit and relax. The check in area is strange. You walk in the door and there is a person standing there with a computer right next to the bar, and that is the check in. It feels weird but the staff is very nice and you will be on your way rather quickly. The room was large and my bed was very comfortable.  There was a very good HVAC system, and the bathroom was very nice as well, with great water pressure in the shower. The towels were upscale, which I particularly enjoy. Room was decorated in an antique way and very nice. I also have to mention there were plenty of outlets. \n\nSo why the bad review? There are a few rooms that are on the first floor, directly across from the bar and because I checked in late, I was unlucky enough to get one of these rooms. They tried to bill it as an upgrade, but this was far from the truth. The room is absolutely terrible because you can hear absolutely everything from the person checking in guests, to the bar tender clanking glasses while he fills them or cleans them. Now this went on till about 11:30pm when it closed, but that bar turned into a coffee bar in the morning that they started setting up at 6am, so the noise started all over again. So basically you can only sleep between those hours. They try to compensate by placing a large air purifier in the room to create a white noise mask, which actually works slightly. They really should not sell these rooms because they make it impossible for e to recommend this hotel to anyone.","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Walk the High Line a mile south and you are in the Meatpacking District or the East Village.  \n\nService: impressive.  I read about the High LIne Hotel's non traditional check-in and was worried.  True, there isn't any \"front desk\" but there were always staff people in the lobby area eager to help.  We arrived early, the staff bought us coffee and later delivered our bags straight to our room.  \n\nLocation and service are standard expectations.  The hotel itself is what sets it apart.  Lovingly restored, the hotel has the modern necessities - high-thread count sheets, docking station, flatscreen, central air - but it also has period furniture, a rotary phone, well-worn oriental rugs, and many other details that remind you are staying a place older than yourself.  I hope you are supposed to take a few High Line Hotel pencils with you b\/c I certainly did.

It's close to so much of what we love, the High Line, Chelsea Market, walkable to the West Village, if you're game, and surrounded by some of the best food and drink in the city. \nOur room was on the 5th floor, facing 10th Avenue, and the traffic wasn't too bothersome, but the floors below us, might experience a little more noise. Next time, we'll ask for a room on the courtyard in the back. But, as NYC rooms go, it was a nice size, and the closet was large enough to unpack a month's worth of clothes, which is unheard of, in the city. The bathroom was also nicely appointed, but a little small, for sharing. \nAnd, for coffee in the morning, throw on your jeans, and run downstairs to Intelligentsia. It's worth getting out of bed for. Great lattes, pastries, it's a lovely way to start the day; and, the secret must be out around the neighborhood, because people walking their dogs stop by to grab their cups, on their way out in the morning. \nIt's a really fun place, with great staff that live to help you, and know your name and needs.

One of the other doormen put my suitcase in the cab's trunk and when I handed him back the hotel's signature sturdy High Line umbrella, he said, \" Its really coming down, why don't you take it with you\".  I said, \"But I'm not coming back\". He said, \"it's OK; you stay here don't you?\"  It's the kind of small thing that makes you want to come back.\n\nThis is a quiet hotel - the lobby is not filled with 20-something hipsters or loud music. The lobby is small but a nice to take a break, have a coffee or tea.  There are also two nice outdoor seating areas, one of them shaded by tall trees.

It's also pet and kid friendly.\n\nOnly thing lacking, to my knowledge, is room service but with Intelligensia Coffee in the lobby, excellent coffee is at hand (I'm guessing you might be able to call down and place an order).  The food is also great at the on-site dinner restaurant.  No breakfast or lunch, but Cookshop and the Empire Diner (newly spiffed up) are a half block or less in either direction.

For a personal weekend trip with my wife, I just wanted to be comfortable in a quaint yet convenient neighborhood, and a room that feels more \"homey\".   The High Line Hotel was perfect.  Chelsea is the perfect neighborhood to stay in with plenty of restaurants, shopping and activity.   Add in the proximity of the High Line, which in my opinion is one of the City's great passive amenities, and the hotel offers an extremely unique set of options.\nThe building itself is well worth seeing.   The exterior stonework and details provide the feeling of a castle, while the woodwork and interior furnishings are warm and inviting.  I'm admittedly a fan of architectural history and enjoy seeing that in the midst of urban modernity.   If you share that interest, this building is worth seeing regardless of where you stay.\nJust as the building is unique, the grounds are equally interesting.   Make a point of going into the exterior space in back, taking the stairs up to the courtyard that looks out at the Seminary's space, sit on the grass or the steps and look up at the trees, check out the stained glass windows, and you'll find yourself in a garden that pulls you into a different world.   We sat out there and enjoyed a coffee in the morning, and then a pre-dinner glass of wine.  I highly recommend doing the same.\nFinally, the staff did everything they could to contribute to our feeling at home.   The High Line is not a glitzy, stuffy hotel with extra services for \"status\" members.   It's a quaint yet trendy boutique hotel, and the staff treat you in the same manner as every other guest.   The lobby is your living room, the grounds are your garden, and the staff are your concierges.   There was always someone in the lobby to answer questions, make suggestions or provide assistance.   All of the staff were friendly and accommodating, and made us feel like we'd been friends for awhile.   Again, this is very unique to NY in my experience...\nWithout question, we'll stay here again.   The only hesitation I have in recommending it, is trying to keep it a little bit of a personal secret for my own benefit.   I'm afraid that's no longer possible regardless...  Stay here if you want a perfect personal experience in NY without the glitz and glammer, and you'll be very happy!","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Having stayed there three times now, it is officially our go-to place for a great place to stay in New York City. But it's not for everyone. If you want a standard hotel experience, with all the standard amenities, and standard furniture in all the standard places, you may want to look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a unique, on-of-a-kind experience, give it a try. I would describe it as the anti-hotel hotel. It doesn't look like a hotel and there is no front desk. The entrance area (I don't want to call it a lobby) has a coffee shop with the best coffee you will find anywhere. Since a lot of neighborhood residents come in for coffee, it's great for people watching.  Hotel guests and neighborhood residents intersect in a way that seems unforced and very authentic. Proceeding to your room, it feels more like you are going to your own private space in your friend's apartment building rather than going to a typical hotel room. Floors are hardwood, stained black, with hand-knotted antique carpets scattered around. The furnishings are unique and arranged in an idiosyncratic way that makes the room feel very personal. It's not the typical hotel room  formula arrangement that you expect to see at any hotel anywhere in the world. For instance, the room we stayed in this time did not have a closet. A freestanding, ample-sized clothing rack was provided instead.  I suspect some people would find this off-putting, but it's the sort of thing we have in the guest rooms of our own old house, where some rooms simply don't have closets. The bed is wonderfully comfortable and always a pleasure to retreat to after a long  day tromping the city streets. The shower is great, with lots of pressure. We were short on hot water one late morning, but it's easy to forgive in light of all the many positives, and I would say that just contributes to a feeling of authenticity. The room has lots of quality snack choices and an assortment of drinks. You don't need to leave the room if you don\u2019t want to. Lastly, if you are looking for a low-key place to stay and enjoy the city, you can't beat the location. It's in a real neighborhood with real restaurants and shopping close by. The High Line is right out your front door. There's a subway stop close by, and the hotel is easy to get to by car if you are taking taxis or ride-share. Interestingly, we found that most drivers are unfamiliar with the hotel, which we think only adds to the charm. So if you are looking for an off-beat place, give The High Line Hotel a try. We can't wait to go back.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Once you go inside though it does go downhill.  We arrived at 6.30pm - the entrance area was really busy and the reception is not a reception - its a computer in a cupboard on one side of the area. You immediately feel in the way of people there drinking (and probably not staying) - not a good experience when you are paying a high price for a room and they are paying $5 for a coffee!\n\nWe got shown to our room (27 & a half) which was tiny! A lovely comfy bed, a metal clothes rail and a big cupboard in the corner that contained safe, iron, fridge but no draws or areas to store clothes. And on the other wall was a table that again was covered with books and other \"trinkets\" that were of no use but rendered the table useless. We arrived with 2 large suitcases as NY was a part of our trip and not only was there no room to unpack anything but there was no room to put our suitcases down either without moving the rail across the door.  The only part of the room that had any space was the bathroom!\n\nHaving arrived after a long journey we wanted a drink straightaway,(there is no room service) so we went down to the communal area \/ reception area where there is a bar, but was told we couldn't get a coffee as its was after 6pm!  We then sat down (expecting the barman to come & take an order) but that didn't happen either - even though there were several hotel staff just standing around talking. It was only the following day that we realized that the bar and coffee area are probably franchises of some sorts and run separately to one another and to the hotel too (and both are really expensive and offer a limited choice!).\n\nThe only positive experience was after we complained the following morning, they then moved us to a room where we could unpack and move around (No.21).\n\nI won't be back for sure.

We stayed in this hotel as it was 100% convenient to where we wanted to be in - Chelsea, just blocks from my brother's apartment.  the Location was great, and there are a number of great restaurants nearby - handy since there's no full - service restaurant on the premises.  Also, the hotel is right near the high line ( hence the name), so it's great for exploring.  I liked the hotel, but I'll be the first to say it's not for everybody.  It's an old, historic building.  With a lovely court yard and a great patio out front with seating.  Everybody tells me its great for drinks outside at night in the summer.  Due to the size of the building, each room is unique, and some are very small, some are a bit bigger.  Clearly, this is NYC and that's to be expected.  Our room was small - it had a comfortable king size bed.  I liked it, but my partner - and my parents in their room - commented that it was a tad too soft for their tastes.  Linens, though, were extremely soft and comfortable.  Towels in the bathroom were excellent.  I also liked the toiletires - CO Bigelow - high quality.  furniture throughout the hotel is mismatched, on purpose.  People will either like that or not.  Delightfully quirky.  Our room, being small, might have been only truly for one person, as there was only one bedside table, which made it inconvenient for whoever was on that side of the bed.  Also, I noticed that plugs\/ power outlets througout my room were sparse - which was difficult for charging phones\/ electronics.  IN addition, it was tough for ironing - we had to plug the iron into the outlet in our bathroom.  My parents room, slightly larger, had two bedside tables.  It also had an intersting couch.  Good to have a couch, but honestly, there was no practical way to sit in it other than laying back entirely.  The hotel also had some moderate wear and tear in places - the rug in the elevator in our section of the building was completely stained\/ scruffed, and there were nicks\/ tears in certain areas in our room (in the wall paper behind the bed, chipped paint, etc).   Also, this definitely isnt (in my opinion) a hotel if you're a business traveler - desks are small, there arent business services, and there arent enough plugs.  THAT SAID, we loved the vibe in the lobby - great coffee from intelligentsia.  There definitely is a quaint and quirky charm to the whole premises.  And we loved the mix of locals with their dogs and guests in the coffee area (bar at night) and in the patio\/ courtyard.

This is not a touristy area, but rather a lively family neighborhood full of young professionals and families. The restaurants nearby are excellent and laid-back. You'll notice the neighborhood in the morning when the superb lobby coffee shop (Intelligentsia) develops a line full of locals and their dogs out for morning coffee. Yes, the hotel is dog-friendly--there is even a bowl of dog treats by the entrance.\n     The rooms are really converted from the old seminary rooms, so they have a lot of personality. Our room, a deluxe King, was quite large and had a fireplace and two closets. The bathroom still had the original floor tile. The beds are new and modern but much of the furniture comes from local flea markets and antique shops. It does feel quite a bit like staying in a wealthy friend's country 'cottage.' But the amenities you are about are great--sheets are luxurious, the AC works well, good water pressure, nice shampoos, etc.\n     The hotel also has a lovely courtyard with tables where you can have a quiet coffee under the trees. It seems as if quite a few locals come in to do some work out of their apartments. This does not feel like New York--it feels secluded and relaxing. They also lend out a fleet of Shinola bikes if you'd like, and they provide a good local bike map.\n     About the only complaint you could have is that there is no on-site restaurant. Intelligentsia provides coffees and pastries for breakfast but for something more substantial, you have to walk a half-block down 10th Ave to a local restaurant (which is also very good!).\n     Uber cars are plentiful in the neighborhood.

If you would enjoy staying in an historic setting with gas lamps outside and a welcoming staff inside, then make reservations here.  A stones throw from the High Line, galleries, Chelsea Market and numerous restaurants, it's a great central location for visiting this end of Manhattan.\n\nThe single small check-in area, that appeared to irritate another reviewer, was actually very efficient, charming and functional, and did not impede our check-in at all.  Our host at that desk, Dan, was very warm and knowledgeable about the history of the hotel, and offered to show us around the next day when he had more time.  Parts of this seminary and grounds are still in use, we were told, which adds to the charm and historical significance of the site. \n\nWhile the hotel does not have its own restaurant, a coffee bar off the lobby, was very popular, and again added to the hotel's ambience.  We found an incredible restaurant for dinner on Saturday night (The Red Cat) on a block or two away.  Right next to the hotel is the Cook Shop, which we did not try, but seems to have great on-line reviews.  \n\nOur room and bed was very comfortable, and decorated with comfortable period furniture.

I really did feel sorry for them not being allowed to sit down all day. We were shown to a well appointed large room on the 3rd floor overlooking a quiet courtyard. A big plus is that the windows opened easily but there is no air conditioning only very noisy heating. The bed was a bit on the soft side but comfortable. Very little storage space as the room is full of vintage furniture without drawers. The bathroom is old fashioned and lacked adequate lighting or a make up mirror. There are no services to speak of so it is bit like staying in a rented room rather than a hotel. The small lobby houses a public coffee bar with free wifi so any seating is constantly taken up by locals with their dogs who stay for hours. This is extremely annoying and it is like staying in a branch of Starbucks. There is no dining room but the hotel is very near restaurants, diners and Chelsea Market and a 24 hour drugstore.

My impression of the hotel, no matter the room itself or the services, are the worst in my experience in travelling around the world.\n\nBelow are my personal experience with the hotel to share with you:-\n\n1.\tCan u believe that a hotel with a daily rate of around US$450+ does not have a proper reception at the so-called lobby? Actually, there is no lobby in the hotel.\n\n2.\tWhen you go into the hotel, you will see a coffee bar and few tables that are always full of ppl.  On one side of the bar, you will see a staff standing in front of a computer and that\u2019s the so-called reception.  Apart from check in and check out, the staff at the computer will never say \u2018hi\u2019 or greet you.  It seems that clients living in the hotel are transparent to them but the \u2018reception staff\u2019 just enjoy greeting those in the coffee bar.  Indeed, I feel like going and staying in a motel during the whole period.\n\n3.\tThe above in fact do not bother me more than its services.  Since the day I stayed there, the bedside lamp and one of the light bulbs in the bathroom were not working.  One week after I stayed there, they were still out of order and only did I leave a complaint note to them did they fix them.  Unbelievable!\n\n4.\tFor refilling the fridge or snack bar, No and Never did they do it.\n\n5.\tTwo of their staff were helpful, namely Romeo and Daniel.  But, the problems were even though their attitudes were helpful and kind but the messages which I left for them to convey to their manager or the reply they subsequently gave me were very misunderstood or not-well communicated.  I really feel very disappointed at the communication amongst the staff of the hotel.  Seems like the hierarchy is having problem and the chain of command of leadership are completely in lack of.\n\n6.\tAt the last day when I left the hotel, I checked out in the early morning and departed for the JFK airport and when in the Uber on the way, I suddenly learned that the flight was delayed and so I returned to the hotel.  I was told by a staff that if I stayed after 1:30 pm, I needed to pay a half-day rate for which I agreed (but I was later told by the hotel manager that there was no thing called half-day rate. Indeed, for the overstay for few hours, I was charged US$485).  I told him to proceed and to inform the manager and for which he said he would.  But, when I stayed in the room from 10:00 to 11:00 am and hang a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign at the door, 3 different staff locked at my door for different purposes.  All of them said they thought I had checked out.  For the first one, it\u2019s ok and I assumed that the message of my staying in the room had not been well conveyed to the others. But, for the subsequent two disturbances, how could the hotel be accounted for that?\n\n7.\tWhat\u2019s more ridiculous was when I went out later and returned to the hotel room to pick up my stuff for departure to the airport, when checking out again, the staff gave me a parcel which I had been waiting for few days.  I asked her why she didn\u2019t give me that earlier (for other parcels I received, they would place it in my room) so that I can pack it into my luggages.  She replied me as I had put a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign at the room and therefore she didn\u2019t do it.  Oh, I really have nothing to say about that.  They could keep disturbing me when I  hanged a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign but why this time could not?\n\n8.\tOne advice for you is when you checked out at the hotel, you better check carefully the invoice.  For my morning check out on 11 Feb, nothing mentioned about my laundry expenses or even \u2018fine of US$250\u2019 per day for \u2018smoking in the room\u2019.  When checked out in the afternoon again, the invoice had suddenly appeared these two items but not the room rate for that extra-day.  I told the manager that if there\u2019s a fine for \u2018smoking in the room\u2019, firstly, there must be warning to alert the clients and secondly, there must be some kind of evidence but not from the smell or my clothes or any other unsubstantiated matters.  Besides, if such a fine is to be levied, should the hotel forewarn the client first?  I indeed smoke and may have the smell with my clothes but when in the hotel, I didn\u2019t smoke in the room but rather I had gone downstairs to the street to smoke.  If using the smell in the room to fine me of US$250 per day, they should tell me earlier rather than having the bill of US$250 per day x 13 days stated there at the time so sudden when check-out.  Up till now, the hotel invoices were still chaotic and I still need to spend effort to clarify with them.  How horrible this is?\n\n9.\tAnother encounter was with the room-keeper.  One day when I went out at around noon and hang the door sign of \u201cmake up the room\u201d, when I returned to the room at around 5 pm, I found the room had not been done yet and so I called the \u2018reception\u2019 to make arrangement.  Then, a room-keeper came and said that when she came earlier that afternoon, I had the sign of \u201cdo not disturb\u201d hanging there and therefore she didn\u2019t do it.  As well, by that time so late, she was not going to do it.  But, as I didn\u2019t want to argue with her on the \u201cdoor sign\u201d, I just told her to do it and she replied me \u201cyou want to do it now\u201d? OMG, should I repeat my request which being a hotel client is totally entitled to.\n\nAll in all, if you plan to stay in that hotel, think twice before you act. \n\nDon\u2019t be misled that the heritage means vintage.  Rather, it means obsolete and out-of-order only \u2013 not to mention that the water drained away slowly in the bath tub when you have a shower.  \n\nAlso, don\u2019t mix this High Line Hotel up with the Standard High Line Hotel which I had stayed before.  For the latter one, I am happy with its services and hardwares.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This was huge for us, as we had nearly a full day of meetings planned. He then sent the car to our office where we were picked up with ease, our bags having already been loaded. \n \nPrior to meeting Alvin, I was worried about how we would get from our meeting back to the hotel to get our bags in time to get a car to JFK. But Alvin handled this all seamlessly for us, even offering his personal cell phone number in case we encountered any changes in plans. He promptly confirmed all of the services and everything ran exceedingly smoothly. The driver he sent was equally as helpful, which was appreciated. \n \nAlvin is a gem - in all of our days of travel we rarely run into someone as proactive, thoughtful and caring as him. \n \nThank you for a great stay!","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We stayed here with a group of family members who chose this hotel .  Our group  was 3 adults 1 teen and 1 baby 14months.  We were housed on the top floor together for 5 nights which was very good in a quiet area .    The rooms were very \"wow\" on arrival and very clean. Beds comfortable with a feather soft topper but personally I prefer a firm pillow not mushy feather pillows.   But I can't praise much more.   The heating was too warm \/ stuffy and even though it was winter we had the window open most days and nights and heating off.    The room had too many impracticle ornaments which just got In the way especially with a young toddler both rooms totally impractical with Sharpe corners and ornaments  .  The  mini bar was so overstocked with alcohol and junk food even a lovers kit which my teen daughter thought hilarious.   The fridge was so full we had to remove cans to fit in a tub of  yoghurt.    There was no wardrobe in our room  but a clothes rack which was ok and 2  small drawers  and nowhere to store luggage.  The bathroom was nice looking and clean however the lighting was useless and seemed to have 2 globes above mirror which grew brighter the longer the light was turned on but this took all day and night and if the room maid turned the light off then start the process again.  We resorted to using the torch on my mobile phone to get a bit of decent lighting to apply makeup etc.   This hotel has no breakfast room but does have a coffee \/bar for guests and non guests which I found crowded in the small space and unfriendly with people watching you  .  A family member   commented that the coffee was too strong but I did not use.   The location of the hotel is in Chelsea close to the highline, markets and a supermarket.  The nearest subway is 23rd street on 8th ave  which is a good 10 minute walk which becomes tedious when out sightseeing everyday.  The nearby restuarants are very good especially the Park.  I wouldn't have chosen this hotel based on previous  not so good reviews   which for me were confirmed and for the location but as a family member chose, I went  along with the choice.

We booked here based on TA reviews and were very pleased with our choice.  This hotel has an old, classic feel to it (looks just as pictured on their website).  Stately and tastefully decorated, creaky floors, yet they somehow avoid that \"old smell\" common to such establishments.\n\nPros:  Upon arrival, Alvin had our bags out of the taxi before I could even make it back to the trunk.  Danny was friendly and had us checked in promptly.  We were upgraded to a more spacious room (gotta love that!).  The rooms were a little larger than I imagined - definitely roomy for NYC standards.  Excellent toiletries and good quality towels.  Two umbrellas & two robes with slippers provided.  There is no password required for WiFi and there are lots of outlets available for charging.  Everything was kept very clean and the bed was wonderfully comfortable.\n\nCons:  Although the rooms were of comfortable size, there was not a lot of space available to put things.  Spouse and I had to dance around each other to get ready and had to get in and out of our suitcases a lot.  The room got a little too warm at night (even with our heat off), but the windows opened to cool things off a bit.  The coffee shop in the lobby stays pretty busy.  The line was too long one morning (and there is no coffee available in the room) so we had to venture out a few blocks for coffee.\nOverall, we were charmed by this place and would definitely recommend the High Line to friends traveling to NYC.","travelDate":"2016-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The check in staff meet you face to face in a small, quaint, lobby which smells of the most amazing coffee! In <1 minute after showing my ID and credit card, I was off to my room AND I received a free upgrade. The rooms were completely spotless which is amazing considering the property is historic (could not find a single speck of dust). The TV was HD, and the bed was very comfortable (down feather sheets). The rooms are well appointed with snacks, drinks, and booze (for a fee!) as well as two robes and slippers. You are very close to Chelsea market and Chelsea Piers. The only complaint I had was the noise. I had a room facing 10th Avenue, and, as it is a dog friendly property, I had to listen to the dog next door barking and crying while trying to go to sleep. It is expensive but was priced competitively with other hotels in the area. In spite of the noise which is forgivable since you are in NYC, I would definitely consider coming back for a second or third visit.","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This is my favorite hotel in the city to date. The taxi deposited me at the curb in a rain shower, and before I could blink, their bellman had an umbrella over my head and my bag in tow. Very welcoming check-in staff. I had booked a Standard Queen room, some of which are reported to be VERY small, but because the hotel wasn't full and I was staying for 3 week-nights, I was upgraded to a beautiful suite on the top floor, #5, at no additional charge. I was so impressed with the very personal service. The small lobby is warm and clubby and incorporates a cute coffee bar\/liquor bar (depending on the hour) where you can lounge and people watch. Public areas and rooms have vintage Oriental carpets over wood floors, eclectic antique decor, shabby-chic done well.  Super-comfortable beds and pillows. Outside the front entrance is a large park-like area with lots of tables and a coffee truck. (I believe this area is a full service restaurant during warmer weather, but it had just closed for the season.) Several fun restaurants\/bars within a block or two (CookShop and Tipsy Parson), and the beautiful High Line elevated park just steps away.

Although I don't think it warrants the price, the rooms are more like mini-apartments with a lot of original detailing, and the bikes available for use are a nice touch. But the first room we were given, a supposed \"upgrade,\" was on the first floor directly above the restaurant with a wall-unit AC that made the place smell mildewy. Thankfully, our request to move was accommodated.There is no room service, often times there was no answer at the front desk (which is only a person at a computer in a cute ground-floor coffee shop), and I chose to walk up several flights of stairs rather than use the elevator, which was old and which seemed to break down frequently (at least judging from the alarms I heard throughout the day).The bed could have been better appointed. I found stains on the feather bed underneath the sheets, which was also molting feathers. \n\nThat said, the location is beautiful, on the far west side. NYC is very walkable, and you are near the High Line, the Whitney, Chelsea Market and loads of good restaurants (like Del Posto). You could even walk to the theater district in nice weather. As a native New Yorker, I'm often in town related to business so I prefer a hotel with a few more amenities, including room service. The Bowery manages both charm and comfort a little better for about the same price.","travelDate":"2016-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Even though we're both architects (who can geek-out on things like the High Line's cloistered courtyard, or its collegiate gothic style), everyone can enjoy the charm of this former theological seminary turned hotel. Fans of Wes Anderson films will appreciate the eclectic interior design which utilizes vintage wallpapers, Victorian antiques, Oriental rugs, taxidermy, vintage typewriters and rotary phones in the rooms and main floor lobby.  Although there's no dining room for breakfast, Cookshop is amazing and just a 30-second walk away. Intelligentsia Coffee is located in the main lobby and also serves out of the coolest-looking 1963 Citroen van parked in the front courtyard. On warm weather evenings, that same courtyard turns into the pop-up restaurant, Alta Linea (but don't eat there without trying their frozen Negronis--they're so lit!). The hotel offers guests complimentary Shinola bicycles that you can take over to the Hudson River Greenway or after dinner or brunch at Alta Linea, go for a stroll along the High Line Park.

The lobby is cozy and inviting with a bar that serves coffee and snacks in the morning.

We stayed in room #10 which we accessed by taking the elevator up one floor, or the stairs behind the bar. Our room was very spacious, had old wood floors and a fireplace, and two (!) large closets. The bath was also roomy with a shower-in-tub, lots of thick white towels and toiletries. There's a very well stocked mini-bar and snack tray. The king bed was comfortable and the linens super soft. The flat-screen TV was conveniently placed on the wall across from the bed. Our window was one floor up overlooking the popular Alta Linea garden restaurant near the restaurant's \"food truck\" but we simply closed the curtains when we wanted to be sure no one could see in. It didn't bother us at all since we got up early and went out each night, but very light sleepers may be troubled by noise from the restaurant.

Despite the proximity to the street, the room was sound proof and completely dark thanks to formidable curtains.  My only complaint regarding the room was the dim lights in the bathroom that made it difficult to see whether I was brushing my teeth with toothpaste or body lotion. \n\nThe ideally located hotel is close to the Village, Soho, and mid-town without their hustle and bustle. A few steps from the front door is the entrance to the High Line Park which is an absolute must see. Within one block there are divine breakfast places including Cook Shop and La Bergamote. \n\nDo yourself a favor and take advantage of the Shinola bikes they have available. The hotel's proximity to the West Side Highway Bike Path makes a great launching site for a day of cycling around town.\n\nWe are not fancy folks and staying at a 4 star hotel could have made us feel like Kay Jewelers'  shoppers at Harry Winston.

Unfortunately, our experience soured him on the hotel so much that we checked out early and found a room somewhere else.  In fact, he emailed the GM of the hotel before we checked in to introduce himself as a repeat guest who had, in fact, recommended the High Line to a celebrity client who stayed for a nearly two-week visit.  He never heard back from the GM, before or after our stay.\n\nLast time he stayed there, my husband was in a small suite, which was more than enough room for him.  This time we had a standard room, which was tiny, even by NYC standards.  There are no drawers in the room at all, literally none.  Two people, four days' worth of luggage, no drawers.  \n\nThe drain in the tub was slow and clogged.  We asked the young man at the front \"desk\" (there is no front desk in this tiny lobby and the people who greet and check you in are clearly not polished in the ways of luxury hotels) to call engineering.  Nobody came.  We checked in on a Thursday afternoon.  Upon leaving for dinner we asked the same young man to call for turndown service.  Nobody came.\n\nThe poor service and cramped quarters weren't enough to make up for the good things the hotel has to offer so we left the next morning.  Like the Gaansvoort Hotel down the street, the staff seem more concerned with the hotel's hip factor and self-importance and less concerned with delivering a first-class experience.  \n\nWe won't be back.","travelDate":"2016-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Again, the attention to detail on the decor made it a terrific break from my Hilton business travel. Bathrooms are small but nicely appointed. Beds were very comfortable.

Hotel has an outside restaurant during warmer months but it wasn't open yet during my stay. \n\nAnd an entry point to the Highline is just across the street. Try an early morning visit as it does get really crowded. Well worth walking the entire length and back. In fact, the new extension ends right at the Jacob Javits Convention Center.

I loved this hotel, it has a great feel to it, as it's quirky, furnished in vintage but trendy furniture and decor, with fairly spacious rooms and comfy beds and plenty of lovely bathroom toiletries. Coffee shop on site is 'hipster' with great coffee but the result is that there's never any room to sit down and relax as it's open to outside guests and the area is simply too small, especially when it's too cold to sit in the beautiful courtyard. There is no reception as such which is also yeah, trendy but painful. You check in and out standing in front of someone with an ipad, with people walking past you and all. If you need to wait for a taxi, then again you have to share the space with trendinistas having loud conference calls all over, using the free wifi and drinking hipster coffee. Again, if you are a paying guest, would be good to have perhaps a separate area. One afternoon I waited for a coffee so long I gave up and went back to my room; the next afternoon it was so packed I went to the really nice coffee shop across the road. \nnevertheless I loved this hotel and would love to stay here again","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From the moment we arrived until the day we left we just kept falling further in love with the place.  The location is great \u2013 close to everything but far enough away to feel like you escape the busyness of New York.\n\nThe building itself is stunning.  The conversion into a hotel has been done extremely well with a lot of thought going into even the smallest of details \u2013 never have I stayed in a hotel where mouth-wash is one of the amenities provided and refreshed daily!  Our room was at the rear of the hotel and overlooked the courtyard there.  Spacious, light and extremely comfortable.  It really was a great place to come back to each day after a lot of exploring!\n\nWe were there for 13 nights and found every member of the team at The High Line Hotel to be brilliant.  Everyone was courteous, professional, welcoming and nothing was ever a problem.  A special mention to the Housekeeping team who do such a magnificent job keeping the rooms and the public areas so immaculate.  We were so impressed by everyone there!\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The High Line Hotel and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone going to New York.  The only thing that could possibly be improved on would be to arrange a charge-back facility with the bar and coffee shop businesses.  I know they are separate business from the hotel but can be set up very simply.  I include their teams in the above as they were all wonderful and happy to give advice as to what to see and do!","travelDate":"2015-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The following days Emily was also a big help with our luggage situation which I am pleased to say got resolved. All staff were very friendly in the hotel, but we made a bit more of a bond with the three mentioned. Throughout our two weeks stay we were given plenty of help and advice from everybody, nothing was to much trouble for them and we became very chatty with everyone. The hotel is excellent! very relaxing and we would say it felt like home. The dogs that are allowed to come in give it that homely feeling even more and the fact that a lot of locals use the coffee bar and evening drinks bar shows how good it is, considering the choices you have in NYC. We also became friendly with Mike that works behind the be in the evenings. A great guy that does a mean Manhattan! along with many other drinks\/cocktails. I would very strongly recommend staying here for the perfect New York experience in trendy Chelsea. You can get to every tourist attraction if thats what you wish to do very easily via the subway only 3 blocks away. There are loads of choices for morning, afternoon and evening meals within a very short walk, and the famous chelsea market only 5 blocks away! I would go as far to say the best hotel I've stayed in (which has been a fair few) We will certainly return one day without a second thought.

No chance - it comes dry and as displayed with no extras and a wooden throwaway knife to boot.\n\nFancy a cocktail in the bar which looks so lovely on the website? Forget it unless you want to be surrounded by friends of the staff and you want to stand up to enjoy your drink.\n\nComfortable hotel room?  If you like antique furniture, crooked tables that rock when you lean on them and sofas you can't sit on - no problem. And an air conditioning unit that is so noisy you can't have a conversation while it is on and is ineffective anyway so no point turning it on.\n\nComfy bed?  Yes absolutely  - that was the only saving grace of our stay here.\n\nFriendly reception staff? Definitely friendly,  only they weren't very efficient - they forgot to book our restaurant twice, didn't send our laundry off so it took 2 days to come back and got our bill wrong with a significant overcharge which took us a week to get back - without much of an apology.\n\nLocation - brilliant with great restaurants nearby and The High Line park.","travelDate":"2015-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

You know when booking that you're in for something different and there are some real pluses to High Line: best coffee I've ever had outside New Zealand; cute hipster lobby, dogs welcome; really great location in Chelsea; pretty patio which must be fun in summer.  But this hotel has some problems that you should consider when booking.  First thing, my room while very quaint, was tiny and had no wardrobe or drawers and nowhere to put a medium sized suitcase.  Secondly, the check in system is chaotic. This hotel hasn't adjusted its processes for volume and the lobby doubles as the neighborhood coffee shop so is busy and confusing.  Third, this is a very old building with some old building problems - on my checkout day the hot water was out in the whole hotel so no showers for anyone. Also the heating and aircon is very antiquated so is also problematic.  All of these problems however (apart from the water - that's a red line for me) would have been minor irritations if the hotel was priced as a two or three star.  But with room prices equivalent to a Sofitel you do leave feeling cheesed off.  I think on balance the unique charm of this hotel doesn't outweigh its problems, at least not at that price.

But not the greatest as far as room accommodation and amenities. The staff is great-young and very very friendly and efficient --and the coffee bar\/cocktail bar after 6 PM is also a fun hangout and well staffed.  However,  I was pretty taken aback when I walked into the \"lobby\" and found it to be a small room with a podium and a staff member with an iPad\u2026 but with a super cute coffee bar.   Another person checking in asked me where the lobby was, and I surprised them when I told them that \"this is it.\"  There is no restaurant, and therefore no room service\u2026and no wait staff after 6 PM for cocktails... You simply order your drinks at the bar and take them back to your table.  The biggest problem for us was the lack of air conditioning\u2026 As it is a refurbished seminary -  there is no temperature adjustment in the rooms. There are just two dials\u2026 One for warmer air and one for cooler air\u2026 We could never get the cooler air to work\u2026 Only warm air would come out of the vent.  Fortunately, the hotel has windows that actually open so we were able to sleep with the windows open at night to keep the room cool. At checkout, I mentioned it to one of the staff members and he said that during the fall\/winter -- only warm air is available in the rooms. Fortunately, the hotel is in a quieter section of Manhattan so the noise level wasn't bad; and I stayed there in October when the evening outside temperature is not too warm or too cold. But for the price you pay for accommodations there\u2026 guests should have access to some sort of air conditioning.  I have stayed at other similar hotels-- the Bowery, the Marlton, the Nomad and Ludlow...and found that they offer more amenities (although the Ludlow did not have a restaurant attached either).   Overall, it was a pleasant stay in that it's in a great neighborhood, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the room was a decent size for NYC.  My daughter (who lives in Manhattan and moved into the hotel with me during my stay) and I would recommend staying there during the summer as they have bicycles for loan and the fun front courtyard and patio in the back for drinks...(but you might have trouble keeping the room cool). Bottom line, they really need to do something about their air\/heating system. ","travelDate":"2015-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

It tries to pass itself off as a unique, comfortable option in a neighborhood (west chelsea) that is becoming increasingly over crowded, with most other hotels catering to the party crowd (high line, dream).  However true this may be - it certainly *is* an option - it is a poor one.  In fact, I am very surprised to see the glowing reviews on tripadvisor - actually makes me suspicious given my experience here, and the fact I rely on this site for unbiased feedback on travel options.  \n\nFirst, arrival is confusing and rushed - you find yourself competing for attention from a receptionist walking around armed with nothing more than an ipad, among crowds gathered in the lobby coffee bar.  The lobby is tiny, and multi-purpose ... which also contributes to extreme frustration - the last thing any of us want to do after a long journey is arrive in a confusing, tiny lobby, and search for a receptionist.  \n\nAfter a terrible check in experience, I was led to the room, a \"high line suite\" (not a suite at all), bordering a playground serving a nearby school... cute but really noisy.  And while the furnishings attempt to be retro chic, they are just retro retro - AKA tired, including a very uncomfortable bed.  This bed, and the fact that somehow in the conversion from former monastery to hotel they managed to make the walls paper thin, contributed to one of the worst stays I've had in NYC.  \n\nNothing much else to report other than there's no room service, one day our room wasn't even cleaned, and in general I have no idea why I would ever be motivated to stay here again.  On top of the crowded lobby, poor service, bad furnishings, and uncomfortable bed (even lack of room service), I learned that most of the hotel business is via overflow from conferences that attend the nearby Javitz Center, so clearly no motivation to improve here.\n\nThe standard, the new edition, or even the dream are far better options.

My Partner and I had booked in for 10 nights at the end of a long stay in city and really did have high hopes for the hotel. The stay started off well, fast check in and the room was beautiful but on the ground floor facing the courtyard cafe at the back and the street on the side, so super noisy we asked to move but unfortunately they were fully booked but would be back in touch the following day, they did not get back to us. The bathroom was not properly cleaned with mildew in the shower, no toiletries and weird red stains on the shelf above the sink. House keeping did not come until 3 days later when we asked them to come, then on the 4th day after being out all day we come back to find house keeping had not come again despite putting the cleaning sign on the door which had been removed and replaced back in the room but without actually cleaning the room. I went to speak to the concierge staff who said they would alert house keeping, i had asked for clean towels so we could shower, 2 hours later no sign of anyone. I went back out to speak to concierge who again told me they would alert house keeping. After returning back after dinner we find a coupon for a free coffee as some sort of apology... The next 2 days were pretty much the same, no cleaning unless we chased, no products in the bathroom, the red stains still on the shelf the whole time but strangely had house keeping coming early to check the mini bar only. The location is great and the rooms are big, but the service is absolutely terrible, we tried to move hotels after 1 night but couldn't find anywhere at such late notice for such a length of time. The staff are very polite but utterly unhelpful. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.","travelDate":"2015-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location of this hotel is excellent, right across the street from the High Line Park. There are many places to eat in the area. However we had some issues with the hotel. The cold water tap in the bathroom sink was almost as hot as the hot water tap -- it never really cooled much even when left to run for a long time. The hotel automatically added a \"contribution\" to the High Line Association on my checkout bill without asking me or without giving me the option to opt in beforehand. I had to ask them to remove the charge when I discovered it in my review of the final bill. I think this practice is deceptive when charges like this are added without notice. \nNote also that many residents of this area of NYC own dogs and take them with them everywhere they go -- including in the High Line Hotel lobby, coffee shop and bar, in the hotel garden area, and in the hotel restaurant area.

I particularly liked the reading list in my room #43, with a choice of the 'At the Court of Louis XIV' or 'Orchids for Mother' and 'A Long Desire' provided plenty of bedtime fodder. \n\nBut, my love affair with the room quickly evaporated mainly because of the road noise, which was constant night and day, and the air conditioners, 2 for a smallish room which when operating generated 747 jet-engine like noise. The air con units looked as if they were purchased in the 1970s .... \n\nBeware ear plugs for the roadside rooms are essential. The bathroom's quaintness also waned because the water pressure was poor and shower pipe leaked. \n\nOverall, the hotel needs to do the following: (a) invest in triple glazing on the 10th Avenue side; (b) get more modern air conditioning units and (c) pay attention to the substance and not just the style. \n\nDespite this I would come back again to try and give love a second chance, but only in a courtyard facing room.

The interior one is pleasant as well although it's a bit plain as compared to others courtyards in the city. There are issues which to be fair I'm not sure are because of sub-par planning\/layout or because the building is historical meaning certain things can't be adjusted. That being said they still exist. The primary one being noise. This is a noisy hotel, a bit is understood but the windows appear to be paper thin. I could hear everything outside. I was in the Thom Browne store on Hudson St (busy) in Tribeca that day and couldn't hear a peep. More importantly several of the rooms are right near the lobby. That is unquestionably a design mistake. These rooms should not be placed here and frankly to sell them at all is ridiculous. It's akin to having a room next to a bustling coffee shop.

It has a nice front courtyard, pleasant staff, a tiny lobby area with bar, and warm furnishings.\n\nI read elsewhere that the rooms were small - au contraire! Our room was huge by NYC standards, perhaps because we asked for a room with two double beds. Spacious, comfortable, and a lack of street or lobby\/bar noise even though we were only on the second floor. \n\nNow for the negatives - which were minor. The cold water tap and the hot water tap both gave only hot water. If you let it run for 15 minutes or so, the cold water tap gave water cool enough to shower in. How this could be, given that the staff must run the water whenever they clean the room was totally beyond me. And there is no room service. If you are a person for whom room service (even at the outlandish price you typically pay) is an important component of the hotel experience, skip the High Line Hotel. \n\nBut it was a fine landing place for a combination business\/pleasure trip for this over 50 couple making it back to Chelsea for some gallery hopping for a couple of days.

The hotel is beautiful with loads of character. There is a busy coffee cart and seating area in the front courtyard, which converts into a relaxed bar in the evening. The decor is great with an eclectic mix of furniture and uber cool and very friendly staff. There is another cafe located in the lobby that also serves cocktails later in the evening.\n\nThe initial impression is of a sleek, funky hotel with a very friendly, relaxed vibe. The staff immediately engage you on entry and are very approachable.\n\nMy room was excellent. The furniture was in-line with the lobby of the hotel. A mix of modern, antiques, statement pieces and a wonderful bed. Similarly, the bathroom was beautifully appointed with amenities and remaining true to the overall eclectic style of the hotel, with antique fittings and great tiles. Overall, it felt very comfortable and relaxing from the outset.\n\nThe neighbourhood is delightful. The buildings are lovely. It is quiet but only a short walk into the heart of NYC. Additionally, the High Line park is around 50 metres away and is a brilliant way to see parts of the city.\n\nI will hopefully be staying at this hotel again in September and don't hesitate to recommend it.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

And this hotel is very nice. \n\nThe rooms are fairly small (but not tiny) and very quaint, kind of like staying at your grandmother's place (assuming she had a place that was a converted Episcopalian seminary). \n\nPlus, free Shinola bikes, free wifi. \n\nI enjoyed this hotel. \n\nI only had a few (minor) issues: \n\n-Water pressure in the shower is atrocious. Very weak. \n-No early morning dining and evening dining ends at (I think) 9 pm outside. But hey, you're in Chelsea, great food is a block away. \n- Bathroom is a bit small, the challenge being \"where do I put my toilet kit\". Then again, I just put my toilet kit on the dresser outside and it was fine. \n- A lack of emergency amenities -- I ran out of dental floss, and most hotels have supplies for weary travelers. Not this hotel. No biggie, I took a walk down to the local CVS pharmacy a block away.\n\nIt is not a fully-staffed big hotel. It's a converted seminary that is being run as a boutique hotel. For example, there is no registration. It's very casual, a very nice lady signs you in on her ipad. Might be a bit confusing to some, but it's really okay. \n\nStaff is polite. Rooms are clean. Bed is reasonably comfortable. \n\nOverall, however, if I have to go to Chelsea again (and I do hope I do), this will be the hotel I will stay at. And certainly I'm thinking of a romantic weekend with my wife, eating delicious Chelsea food and biking around on the complimentary bikes. \n\nYou get the picture.","travelDate":"2015-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

I immediately thought it could be a problem, but when I mentioned it to the staff, they said that was the last room they had and couldn't move us.  They also said that things quiet down after the coffee bar closes.  Guess what?  After the coffee bar closes, it becomes a cocktail bar.  Guess what else?  The noise level outside our room was absolutely shocking and even though we had ear plugs, neither of us got much sleep until the bar quieted down, which I believe was around 3 or 4am.  Guess what else?  The coffee bar then opens at 6am.  My advice for this hotel is: do not stay in the rooms across from the coffee\/cocktail bar.  The manager told us they could comp us, but never did.  What a pity too, because the hotel is gorgeous -- well-appointed rooms, beautiful architecture, fantastic service from the front desk.  Just zero sleep that night.  And after reading some of the other reviews about this issue, I noticed that someone from the management staff replies to each one saying they have fixed the noise issue, but they really haven't because people were complaining about this exactly issue in 2012.

Me and my partner both had rooms next door to eachother so our wedding party could bounce back and forth to help us get ready for our special day. However, we experienced a handful of issues with the staff upon arrival.\n\nFrom the moment we checked in, we had submitted a credit card pre-authorization for both of our rooms so that all charges and incidentals would be on a family member's card (as our wedding night at this wonderful, yet slightly expensive hotel, was a gift to us from them). Unfortunately when we went to checkin they notified us that they couldn't grant that authorization even though I showed them the form I submitted. So we had to put our personal credit cards on file.\n\nFrom there, I had requested and paid for a half-day rate for the second room so we could stay until 4pm (as our wedding wasn't until 5pm). I called the night before as suggested to ensure availability, they gave me verbal confirmation over the phone that everything was taken care of. However, at 11am, we were notified that we must vacate the room as it was past checkout time and must pay a full day rate and move to another room if we chose to stay. Why would I go through all that trouble to avoid extra stress on our wedding day only to have to move and pay for rooms in the end!? The wedding party was in the middle of getting ready for the big day and after the Maid of Honor debated with the manager, I, the bride, finally called back down to argue with them a bit more and finally got them to agree to the late check out terms I had paid for. \n\nAnd last but certainly not least, as our wedding party hurried to clear the Suite after the wedding night so we could all go to brunch before the 11am checkout, we realized that the Maid of Honor's computer was left in the room. We called the hotel no later than 2 hours after checkout only to find that the room was cleaned and vetted through their 3-step approval process and \"nothing\" was found. That is a complete lie. We could describe the exact location in which it was left, and they claim that absolutely nothing was left in the room. Beyond that, I intentionally left a couple of items behind that I didn't feel like carrying back...a cooler with wine in it, some candles and some hair products. And they still claim that we left nothing in the room.\n\nI am incredibly disappointed with the hotel staff's catering to my bridal party during our two-night stay at The High Line Hotel. As beautiful and charming the space is, the staff does not make it worth recommending to my friends and family.","travelDate":"2015-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Beautiful polished woods paired with trendy gothic wall and floor coverings make for luxurious furnishment, but the \"Full Sized Room\" leaves you feeling beyond cramped. (Although I should have guessed something was to be amiss when the check in valet referred to our room as \"The Harry Potter Room.\") Gabled ceilings with walls a mere 10 inches from the edge of our bed to either side of the room, my husband and I were left with about 10 square feet of standing room within our unit, and could touch the ceilings. There was not enough room to open a suitcase, and the room was not equipped with a closet. We literally had to open our suitcase in the bathroom when needed, as it was the only space available. Luckily we only had one piece of luggage- 2 would not have fit, even under the bed! There was no suitcase rack, as there was not enough room to make use of it. We had to ask for the robes to be removed from the bathroom so we could use their hooks to store our clothing--as opening\/closing our suitcases was not an option throughout our 5 day stay. I've lived in the city for over 10 years and have seen my fair share of \"tiny\" hotel rooms for friends and family- this one beyond took the cake. On the top floor, the air conditioning did not work, but the front desk installed a window unit when we complained...but there went our view!\n\nMy recommendation would be if you book a standard full\/queen room, do not let them place you in one of their (1\/2) rooms; ie Room 57 1\/2.

Frequent trips the past two years have shown me all types of accomodations, from B&Bs to luxe hotels to just-the-solid-basics, but for my money, I want to stay here every chance that I get.\n\nThe second I roll up, I'm greeted - and remembered as a repeat guest, even though my stays have been short (and booked through a third-party app). I'm welcomed, shown every courtesy, checked in quickly - and if I'm early, bags are stowed and I'm given a call when the room's ready. I get back and am given my key; the bags follow me to my room. Even the smallest rooms feel cozy in the best way, with dashes of vintage, eclectic and modern decor (from the books in the shelf to the small live plants placed throughout the room - and check out the wallpaper, and the taxidermy!) and the bed and towels and bath are all luxurious. I always get a phenomenal night's sleep. Many of my favorite things are within a short walk (I'm very partial to Chelsea) - and the High Line park is a must-stroll if you want to see the most smiles in New York City.\n\nI'm normally a bit of a bargain hunter for my Manhattan trips (with as often as I go, you have to be); the highest compliment I can give a hotel is to say it's worth its standard rate and then some, which is the case for the High Line Hotel. A point in fact: this past weekend, I had booked at a place I'd stayed at previously that recently changed ownership, and the service level had declined significantly. The accommodations were comfortable and clean, but there were so many snafus that when I was presented with the option to stay an extra night in Manhattan, I chose to leave the other establishment for the High Line, which was slightly higher in price. The way I was treated at the High Line - and the comfort of the accommodations - was worth the price difference and then some. No smoother experience can be had, and they pay attention to the little things. It's appreciated more than I can say, and was an exceptionally welcome relief.\n\nThe vibe and the staff are exactly right for me, and I can't wait to go back.","travelDate":"2015-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

Going down to the lobby to get coffee and treats in the am was perfect as well, and then we hopped across the street for an insane brunch\/bloody mary's at Cookshop followed by a nice long (but way too crowded) Highline walk.  I'd imagine that for an out of towner the location is also pretty amazing for accessing the rest of the city.  You are two long avenues away from a subway but it's a great midway point between Chelsea and Meatpacking, which are really fun neighborhoods to stay in bc of all of the fantastic food and drink options.  And to get to museums and other tourist attractions you can walk the 12 minutes to the train at 23rd street.  \n\nFyi there's no front desk - just a few people with iPads in the lobby.

The building just stands out, a classy historic boutique in the heart of Chelsea, directly on the High Line.  There is no hotel parking, but there is a really affordable lot directly across the street ($32 for 24 hrs!).  As soon as you approach the hotel, staff comes to greet you.  They opened the door, asked to help with bags, and walked us to the check-in area.  There is not check-in desk, which was different, but cool.  The staff member takes your name and scans your credit card with an iPad - simple as that.  Our room was so bright, quiet, clean and comfortable.  Tons of character with old creaky wood floors and huge doors, and the room was decorated with cool antique furniture.  The bed was actually one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept on - perfect pillows and blankets too.  In the room, there was a complete fully stocked snack bar - including craft beers, top shelf liquor, wine, water, candies, chips and goodies - it was all shockingly affordable!  They didn't try to kill you with over-priced stuff if you were dying for a snack.   They also had an \"intimate kit,\" just in case ;)  The bathroom was small but suitable in size, the complimentary soaps and shampoos were seriously great - C.O. Bigelow products, which smell amazing.  The towels were huge and soft and luxurious.  There were comfy bathrobes and slippers to use in the room, as well as free wi-fi and a nice big flat screen TV.  There's a really nice courtyard in the front of the building where you can sit and read, or have a snack, or just enjoy a sunny day.  The only negatives that I can point out: no in house restaurant or room service (which actually was no problem whatsoever because there are an abundance of AMAZING restaurants just footsteps away), and the fact that there was an air conditioner unit in the window.  The issue with that was that it blocked a bit of our view, but really it was not that big of a deal at all.  I got a great deal on this hotel using the \"Hotel Tonight\" app, and it was quite a bit less expensive than similar high end hotels.  I would highly recommend this place for a nice few days in the city - I cannot wait to come back.","travelDate":"2015-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Also the faucet in the bathroom is one of those auto on\/off faucets where you were unable to control the temperature of the water. But there was plenty of hot water in the shower and the Bigelow toiletries made everything smell so nice.  \nThere is no lobby to speak of and the entryway was crowded with coffee drinkers fraternizing the local coffee shop set up in what would be the lobby.

After a few problems with check in and a free coffee to make up for it we were up in our rooms and i felt instantly at home. My room, a deluxe king, was huge with a massive extremely comfortable bed. The room over looked the garden but being on the top floor also had a magical view of the empire state over the roof tops. Being at the back of the hotel meant it was incredibly quiet and calm. One draw back of being in the attic however was that the shower was too low and standing at 6' it comfortably washed my shoulders and nothing higher. One minor room detail was the lack of luggage stand, one big detail is the lack of restaurant and subsequently room service. It would be incredible if the great hall was turned into somewhere to eat as although the rooms are lovely the hotel overall lacks any kind of vibe, the only real common area is the coffee shop as you come in which feels a bit like sitting in a hallway and isn't really somewhere you want to hang out. Staff were half and half in terms of friendliness and I often felt the people working in the coffee shop wanted nothing more than for you to leave them alone. In saying all of this i would stay again purely for the room and location, if they eventually include the addition of a restaurant i'd probably stay on the majority of my frequent visits to New York.","travelDate":"2015-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

To shorten the story, I was ready to award two dots to the hotel, at most.  But our welcome was incredibly friendly and a pack and play was ready and waiting in the room for us.  The amenities in the room were nice, except there was a great deal of booze and no coffee.  Getting dressed to go down to a (fair) coffee shop is not ideal in the morning.  The beds are very comfortable, but expect quite a bit of noise from the street (the snowplows were LOUD.  I don't mind this in NYC, but a big chain is your answer if you want soundproofing).  The location is extremely lovely, quite near the high line itself.  But the food options are slim, especially for breakfast (due to the lease they have, unfortunately, that's out of the control of the hotel.  I did have pizza delivered one night without a problem).

We were not disappointed.  Christmas music greeted us in the outside courtyard, adorned with a glorious 15 foot lighted tree. Entering the front door there is a busy coffee bar with lots of people and their dogs relaxing. The check in station is a small alcove to your right. Our rooms were not ready, so we checked our bags and set out to walk the High Line, one of Manhattan\u2019s newest attractions, an elevated train track turned into an aerial walking park.  It is a great way to get to Chelsea Market and enjoy a wide range of food choices and gift shops.  It seems Chelsea is the new Soho with over 300 galleries and new apartments popping up all around.  Returning at 4:30 still no room.  We were told it was because we had requested a courtyard view on 5th floor (to avoid street noise).  We finally got to our room at 5:15.  Room 57 is about 12\u2019 by 12 in size\u2019, with dark original hard wood floors covered by a made to look old oriental rug, king bed billowing with a fluffy comforter,  lots of pillows, an old writing desk, rotary telephone and small cabinet with two draws, hidden refrigerator and safe.  A basket of snacks and a wide range of adult beverages for purchase are also in the room.  There was no closet, however a rolling hanging rack was provided.  The bathroom was small but adequate and very clean.  Plenty of towels, toiletries, hairdryer, robe and slippers were in place. Internet is complimentary and we found the connection to be great. There was a 42 inch flat screen TV. Interestingly, no clock or radio. Old books bedside and an odd terrarium enhance the feel you have stepped back in time. Lighting is very dim however. You need to call downstairs for ice to be delivered. The staff is friendly and helpful, particularly Paul.  We enjoyed the neighborhood feel, the small hotel experience (less than 60 rooms) and the really comfortable bed.  I asked Paul and was told rooms 3, 4 and 5 are larger.  We will definitely stay again. My only complaint is the coffee bar's bakery items are NOT good and cocktail service is only a few hours in the afternoon.

We arrived late (around midnight) on a Thursday night and departed on Saturday morning. The hotel itself is a very nice renovation of an old religious building in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. The rooms were decent sized (for New York City) and reasonably well appointed. There was a very small, but comfortable, sitting area and a desk with a queen size bed that barely fit in the rest of the room. The bathroom was small, but up-to-date. The only complaint about the room was that the mattress was quite soft. It's more of a personal preference, but we would rather sleep on a firm mattress.\n\nThere is a very nice coffee bar in the lobby of the hotel, but very little space to hang around and enjoy it. Also, the lobby was quite cold in November because The doors on either side of the lobby opened to the outside (without any vestibule) creating a wind tunnel effect in the lobby.\n\nThe location is great \u2013 accessible to the Highline, the Chelsea market and lots of other places to see in the neighborhood.

Disorienting at first, until the incredible aroma of hand crafted coffee beverages hits you and you realize that the lobby doubles as a lounge for Intelligentsia Coffee, and these are local denizens enjoying the afternoon. \n\nJust before being sucked into the coffee scene, you're greeted by the \"front desk\", which is a small kiosk opposite the barista. That everything Daniel greeted us and proceeded to check us in and direct is to our rooms, while also assuring us that he would find us a table at one of the two hot spots in the neighborhood for dinner. \n\nWe ascended to our room and found it to be a toasty, cozy place, decorated with a loyalty to its origins but with a flat panel tv and new bathroom. The phone was a replica of a 1940s rotary model - who uses these anyway other than to dual zero?!  As we settled in with our dogs - yes this is a pet friendly hotel - Daniel knocked to say we were all set for dinner. I half considered staying in though, popping the cork on the bottle of red wine and nibbling some of the snacks offered for purchase in the room, it was so inviting on a chilly night. \n\nYou can't beat the location of this spot. Between the High Line and lots of great eating places and galleries, there is no shortage of things to do on an weekend whim, a a short walk from the hotel. The coffee, by the way, is quite good. No syrups or trendy drinks here - this is the real deal, seriously prepared coffee, served by serious people that raise the foaming and decorating of milk in your latte to an art form. \n\nThis is a perfect place for an escape from suburbia, even for just a night.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":4283443,"title":"Great for a boutique hotel - mostly because of the staff","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2014-11-23","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"I really debated between giving this hotel 3 or 4 stars... wish I could give it 3 and a half. Also note that I think it's really decent for being a boutique hotel, but then I generally think boutique is code for \"it's crappy but we'll call it boutique and charge more\".  Also note that if you're a hipster, you'll probably think you've died and gone to heaven at this hotel.\n\nSo, on with the review. The biggest pro by FAR is the staff. They were nothing short of amazing... so kind and attentive, knew our room number and the details of our reservation. We were truly impressed, and very appreciative that they were so on top of everything. If this review were based on  staff alone, I would enthusiastically give it 5 stars.  Definitely keep in mind that my opinion of the staff does NOT include the staff at the Intelligentsia coffee bar located in the lobby. I'll reserve a later paragraph to tell you all about those special folks.\n\nFirst impressions: The first impression of the room is that it was much nicer than we anticipated. The staff member mentioned to us that all of the rooms in the hotel are different. Ours was very nice... plenty of space, two large closets, huge bathroom, wood floors, felt very homey.\n\nNoise: The room we got, room #10, is on the first floor and looks directly out the front of the hotel onto the street. We voiced a bit of concern to the staff about the potential noise, and they assured us that if there were any issues, they'd see about changing our room. And truly, everything seemed fine, we couldn't really hear any street noise, and we assumed the other trip advisor reviews we read were being a bit too picky. We went to bed that night and slept soundly - until 2:00 am when the garbage got collected. Scared the crap out of us! Loud banging noises, people yelling as the dumpsters got lifted up and emptied into the truck.. there was truly no attempt by the garbage people to even be a tiny bit quiet. We didn't say anything about it to the staff, but it happened every single night between 1:30am and 2:30am, and there was truly no way to sleep through that. By the end of our stay, the husband and I were sort of resigned to it, but I would seriously recommend getting a room that doesn't point toward the street.\n\nHeat: We are pretty sure that the heat control in our room was nothing more than a placebo. You can control how fast the fan blows, but there did not seem to be any control whatsoever over whether hot or cold air was blowing. Keep in mind that it was unseasonably cold in NYC last week, impossible to go outside without scarf, gloves and big fluffy coat. Our room was so warm that by the third night, we ended up cracking a window to be able to get the room cool enough so that we could sleep (which made the 2am garbage truck even more of a nightmare). Again, we did not say anything to the staff because we figured there probably isn't much they can do if that's how the heat system is set up. Also worth noting, my husband's coworker staying in the same hotel mentioned that he had absolutely zero heat in his room and was freezing the whole time.\n\nBathroom: nice and big, tiled floors, has a bathtub. The water pressure is absolutely incredible. Gigantic wonderful towels. Just two nitpicky things here - there were wafts of strange smells in our bathroom. Almost like maybe the bathroom was cleaned with a dirty sponge or mop. Or possibly this is just how bathrooms in old buildings smell? The other thing is that there wasn't an extra roll of toilet paper, and we ended up running out. We didn't get cleaning service every single day, so perhaps this is our own fault, but I've never actually stayed in a hotel room that doesn't have at least one extra roll of TP available.\n\nBed: The bed was fine - not the worst hotel bed I've slept on and not the best. Felt like a spring mattress with a feather bed on top of it. Totally functional. We always travel with out own pillows because we never like hotel pillows, so no comment there.\n\nNow, as for the staff at the Intelligentsia Coffee stand inside the lobby. Oh boy. They were awful. Keep in mind that the husband and I are total coffee snobs and were actually excited about staying in a place that offered Intelligentsia pour-overs. At home, we subscribe to freshly roasted beans and always make our own pour-overs, so we can appreciate a little snobbery in this area considering that it takes actual talent to pour a good cup. We know it takes 5 minutes to do a good pour over and weren't concerned about it being speedy. The problem is, the staff at the coffee bar have all of the attitude and snobbery and none of the talent that goes into making a stellar cup of coffee. After the second day with the same crappy cup of coffee, I gave up ordering pour-overs and opted for lattes instead which were much better. But the staff are astounding - they just come across as lazy lazy lazy. Reluctant to take an order, no real appreciation for their product, but tons of better-than-thou attitude, and the only interest they seemed to have in their job was chatting with co-workers. They truly make you feel like you are inconveniencing them for wanting a cup of coffee. Not cool.\n\nSo, those are the things that stand out in my mind. I'm assuming you all already know that the location is great, good neighborhood, easy access to all of Manhattan, etc, etc. \n\nAfter talking to other folks staying at the hotel, I think whether or not you are happy here will depend entirely on which room you get (not pointing at the street) and whether or not your heater works. The hotel staff are truly a joy though and I can't say enough positive things about them.","travelDate":"2014-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Because the heating unit was quite loud and there was a dehumidifier in the room (which in November was quite interesting - makes you wonder how humid the room is in the summer), there was enough \"white noise\" in the room that I couldn't hear much of the coffee grinder or people in the hallway.

The price can be right too;  we paid $320 (all in) per night, although prices vary.  We're walkers, and so walking an hour to theater or other midtown venues is fine with us; anything to avoid staying midtown.   Intelligentsia runs a fantastic espresso bar with really, really nice baristas in the lobby, and there's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (if you don't mind rubbing shoulders with a preponderance of small dogs).  The good news is that you too can bring your dog for a sleepover if you so desire.   Here are the downsides:  1) the lobby is downright cold because of the draft from the front doors.   2) The lighting in the room is too dim, especially in the bathroom. Unless you are about 18 years old and have excellent eyesight, I would not attempt to put make-up on in here.  3) The bathroom door gets in the way and if you want to dry your hair in front of the mirror, you will have a view of exactly half of your head.  4) This is most important to me: the bed is too, too soft.  Even my husband, who can sleep, upright, through Armageddon, complained this morning that his back was sore. 5) The coffee bar is only open from 5-9 pm at night;  I think it'd be nice to hang around for a drink after a show.  6) Only one ADA room and the outside courtyard (which beckons invitingly, were it warm outside) is not accessible.  But, I must reiterate, the price, location and ambiance make this hotel completely worthwhile for a return trip, in my estimation.

I had to wait with the car while my wife searched around the entrance for somebody to help with our bags. There is no Front Desk by the way, and the employees do not wear any discerning clothes or name tags. They all look like guests wondering around paying no attention who comes and goes. Hint: look for the very young person wearing jeans and a sweater holding a walkie-talkie.  There is a computer terminal in a cabinet which is where you may find a person staring into. \n\nNeedless to say we were told that we could not check-in until exactly 3:00pm, and we could just come back then because the \u201cHousekeeping\u201d was very busy. \n\nWe were very disappointed with our weekend stay here. We reserved a \"Deluxe\" room, upgraded from their \"Standard\" room for the night. What we got was a tiny room not more than 250 SqFt with a large bed, desk and a completely useless love seat couch. It is impossible to sit comfortably on this thing because there is no back to it! The bathroom was extremely tiny. Only one person could occupy it at a time. Lighting was minimal and my wife had to use her iPhone light to see! There was no closet, only a Wardrobe cabinet that also was extremely small. \n\nThis room was on the first floor facing 10th Ave, and the outdoor public restaurant\/bar. It was very noisy. You could look right into our room from the outside. In addition the lights from the building were directed directly into the room. When I inquired about a change in rooms, I was told that none were available and in fact this was a \u201cDeluxe\u201d room, and every room was different.\nI was also concerned with security at this hotel. The \u201clobby\/coffee bar\u201d area and bathrooms are open to the public. Anyone can come and go and in fact there was a long line waiting opposite the elevators for public bathroom use. The staircase next to the coffee\/bar is completely accessible to the floor above, right opposite our room! ANYONE can come and go without question.\nI\u2019m not sure why this is so poorly run. Very amateurish. I get the \u201cBoutique\u201d or \u201cBed and Breakfast\u201d thing, but at $500\/nite this is not a \u201cBed & Breakfast\u201d property. (No breakfast offered, BTW).\n\nOverall, a very disappointing experience. There other GREAT choices nearby for you to consider.","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room was spacious and modern and the bed was very comfortable.

There is construction going on across the street that prevents sleeping past 7 am on Saturday.  There is not a traditional bell staff, kitchen or business center, which makes it an inconvenient place at times.

What a wonderful experience! The moment our cab stopped in front of the hotel, the staff greeted us like family. I travel quite a bit for business and rarely receive the warm welcome we got from Daniel, Tidi, Fazl and the rest of the staff. They were not only helpful and polite (expected) but outgoing and playful (unexpected). It was like being greeted at a friend's house. The hotel is part of a former seminary and the architecture is gorgeous. The wedding was held in a beautiful room that looked like a scene out of a Harry Potter movie - in fact another room in the building was used in the movie. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we extended out stay another day. Every single time we met any of the hotel staff we were greeted by name, asked how they could make our stay better and just treated like old friends. As a small business owner, I know the challenges involved in getting, training and retaining good staff. The High Line has figured it out. The staff is excellent. The hotel itself is a gem, close to all kinds of interesting things to do and see. If you're looking for a unique experience for your next visit to New York, give this hotel a try.

Really enjoyed the hotel's ambience and retro vibe.  Hotel staff was very helpful and pleasant.  Rooms were a tad on the small side, though perhaps not by NYC standards.  The bathroom was tight and presented me with some difficulty when getting ready for the evening.  A girl needs a place for her toiletries!  Also, when my husband showered, there was absolutely NO hot water.  When we inquired about it on our way to dinner, we were told there had been an issue but that it had already been resolved.  So, I guess just bad luck in timing for him.    Bed was the most comfortable I've slept in EVER.  I also appreciated the well stocked mini bar at reasonable prices.  $2.00 for Twix bar and $5.00 for Fiji water.  Another nice touch wad bottle of wine in our room compliments of the hotel for our anniversary.   Wonderful location close to Higline and Chelsea Market.  \nNow the cons (aside from the lack of hot water):  my husband had requested early check in which was not able to be granted.  Ok, I understand there is no guarantee.  When we did check in, I asked if we had a standard King (which we had booked) or a Deluxe King (was hoping for an upgrade since we were celebrating an anniversary).  I was told we had a \"Superior King\" which I thought might have been an upgrade but turns out was a regular Standard King.  Not sure why there was confusion on the terminology.  Again, the room was lovely, nonetheless.  However, upon check out we found that we were charged $399.  When we booked (several weeks ago) we were told the rate was $340, I believe.  I say I believe, because even after 2 phone calls to request one, we never received an email confirmation.  So, no way to prove discrepancy.  I am certain we did not originally book at $399 because we had a budget.  \nStill, all in all, a wonderful stay.  Will be back again!","travelDate":"2014-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It''s a bit of a palaver with all the pouring into different hot bowls and stuff for the tea, but quite mesmeric if you're not in a hurry. The room was a nice cosy size, and attractively organised. There were really really good bottles of whisky, proper sizes, from the mini bar. More of a midi bar really. And, best of all, when my husband left all his underwear in a drawer, they mailed it back, without writing UNDERWEAR on the label. The bar out the front is a good place for social and business meetings, and the service is nice, friendly. The room was a bit overpriced, but that is presumably because it's in Chelsea.

It was a fast visit, check in at 4 and out at 830 am the next day. \n\nIt's a hot and muggy 90 degrees out and right when we got to our room, we noticed the AC was not functioning. We expressed our concern and we were assured that an engineer would be up to address the problem. We asked to be moved to another room and were told that the engineer had to come up first. So we left our bags packed and went out to see the neighborhood. It is a great area of Manhattan to explore with excellent shopping.  We asked the staff to give us a cal and let us know status (so we can decide if we are going to stay there or not) \n\nWe got back and were told that the engineer had been up and indeed the AC was not working but that they could not move us. They offered us a fan. My husband asked to speak to a manager and waited in the lobby for 20 minutes. At this point we need to get to our friend's party so we start to get ready while our room is basically broiling hot -- it faces the hudson. \n\nThere is no bathmat and we cannot find a hair dryer but no one at the front desk will take our calls now and our multiple calls to inquire about a hair dryer or a fan all roll into a general hotel reservation line.  Still no fan and no manager. The manager shows up after 45 minutes since we first asked and the fan never showed up.  He has nothing new to add but that the engineer is working on the problem and doesn't seem to be aware that we wanted to change rooms the second we stepped into the 80 degree room. News to him. He promises to update us but makes no effort to ease the situation and tells us we cannot be moved bc they are \"fully committed\" ...still no fan. \n\nHaving stayed in all manner of hotel, I found the level of service and attention here to be JV at best.  I don't think it was too much to ask for an option to change rooms or a  more information when our room was 80 degrees and uninhabitable.\n\nWe leave for the party at 7. When we return at midnight, the room seems to be cooler but by no means at the level we would have expected as the ac is marginally functioning. No fan. \n\nAt check-out, all this information is new again to the check-out person who asked cheerfully about our stay at their ultra groovy hotel.  As I explain that our stay was pretty awful and why, she muses about hearing the the AC went down briefly. She offers to call the manager who \"might\" be able to offer us a credit. \n\nSince we are on our way to catch a plane and have no real confidence that the manager will show up in a timely fashion, I encouraged her to explain the situation to her manager and would look forward to a response from the hotel. I double checked if she had my email and phone number. \n\n That was 8 hours ago and nothing but an email of our bill. Is it now my job to pursue a credit from the hotel? \n\nSo yes the hotel is charming and cool. The room on the 4th floor had a view of the river. The bathroom, however, was TINY, very mad men era, and looked nothing like the picture on the website for a king deluxe room.  Since we had no bath mat, we had to put a towel down, when we took it up to dry it, it was smeared with rust brown gunk from the floor.  The bed was comfy and the sheets were fine. There was free WIFI and a safe and a fridge and a well-stocked mini bar--all the amenities one might expect. \n\nAll in all, it's more like a private room at a youth hostel but with a $500 price tag (room rate was $429-- hurts to even think about it.)","travelDate":"2014-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The absence of a reception desk made dealing with staff while standing in the foyer quite awkward - particularly as it never seemed quite clear as to who exactly was in charge of operations.  A person who is indentifiable as the manager would be a useful feature as we had little success dealing with a problem that arose.\nOn arrival we were assigned a room which could be best described as \"compact\", lacking any facility to hang clothes - possibly not a major issue if one was staying for a single night but four nights.....?   We were initially assured that, due to the hotel being fully booked on our first night, we could not be reassigned a larger room until the next day.  Upon checking the next morning, the story remained the same - hotel still fully booked, nothing could be done for us.  So there the matter rested and we remained in what was cheekily named Room 36 and a half for our full stay.\nWhat proved to be the most frustrating aspect was the failure of somebody to present themselves as management and explain why the problem could not be dealt with.","travelDate":"2014-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We arrived at the hotel, and everyone was absolutely amazing.  They greeted us with kindness and offered to assist us any way possible.  We stepped away to chelsea market was fascinating, and it was my first time.  Great experience.  As we came back from the market and arrived at the hotel to get ready to step out for dinner.  We noticed the air conditioner wasn't working very well.  So we called room service and had someone assist us right away.  They were not able to get it working so they moved us to another room right above ours.  Packed all of our things and headed to our new room immediately.  I looked like a crazy woman with my wedding dress shoes, etc.  At this point I was a bit furious since I was trying to keep a little bit of a tradition going and didn't want my husband to be to see my dress. Nonetheless we were in our new room now, took a deep breathe and moved on.  Felt great, we got ready, and went to a marvelous dinner with our friends, and loved ones.  \n\nWhen we arrived back our room around 10p or so our room was still a bit warm-ish.  We asked for a fan, and unfortunately the hotel didn't have one.  We decided to leave things as they were and went to bed.  Laid in bed, and felt something poking us, weird right? so we got up, and lifted the sheet that was on top of the feather quilt toper that was on top of the mattress.  I didn't expect the bed to be made this way, didn't think anything crazy but was a little disappointed.  We decided to remove the feather topper, and and just leave the sheet on top of the mattress.  Started folding the feather topper when we came across a stain of blood which was very visible.  Such a disappointment. I know it happens, but gosh, not this, not the night before our wedding.  Come on now!!\n\nJuly 5th morning, our wedding day, woke up really early and stepped out for breakfast.  We spoke to someone at the front desk regarding the room situation and the gal on staff advised that she would speak to her manager and have the manager call me as soon as they could.  Got back to the room to get ready for our big day, and the staff brought up things to us as we called it in.  No complaints.  Our day went smooth. And we went on with our special wedding day.  \n\nAs I write this, on Sunday, August 10th I realize that I still have not yet received a call from this so called manager.  It's the little things in life that make a difference.  Not sure if this person is busy, whatever it is\/was, this was our wedding day.  Not a regular stay at a hotel, but a special day that people should sympathise with especially since it's such a sacred and special day.  I hear of stories all the time, and well I just thought that at least the hotel part would be at it's best with these little things, and the wedding part would be a little crazy because things happen.  We decided to stay here because I had a great experience when I attended our last Christmas party that was held here. If it wasn't because the staff, we would've checked out that same night!  \n\nI have to say that I'm the easy person to please in life, it's the little things that make my day.  I was proud to say that I was not your typical bride at all, not a bridezilla, but am proud to tell you our side of the story.  Our special day!  \n\nI hope the manager at this location gets it together.  Make sure your beds are made correctly and the air conditioner is working well.  As for the staff, they are all amazing and I'm glad you got that part right!  You're on the right path, work on everything else!","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We chose this place particularly for its location near the High Line.  Another charm of this hotel is that it occupies part of the General Theological Seminary (built in the 1820's) and is a Federal Historic Landmark.  As a point of trivia, Clement Clark Moore wrote \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\" here in his 17th century apple orchard!\n\nEvery single staff member was super helpful and seemed happy to be doing their job.  At check-in, we even got a great recommendation of where to get a bite to eat at midnight.   As you would expect for a property with this history, our room was reached by walking up a few steps into a tiny hallway to reach one of those old elevators where you open a hinged door to access the elevator once it slides open.  \n\nOur room (facing the courtyard) was large for a NYC hotel, with a high pillow-top king bed and windows tucked into thick, almost 200 year old walls.   The bed was fairly comfortable - it had one of those big feather duvets on it as so many hotels now like to do.  I find that sleeping with the duvet on is too warm and without it is too cold.  The room was very clean, with the exception of a dirty smudge on one of the curtains, right where one would grab them to pull them back.  The window a\/c did a decent job.  \n\nThe bathroom was also large and nicely appointed (other reviewers were right about the shower water getting really hot really fast, btw).  The towels were particularly thick and fluffy, but we had no wash cloths.  Our chief complaint was that the lighting in the bathroom was EXTREMELY dim - we looked around for a dimmer switch but only found a basic on\/off switch.  Really, you could barely see in there - it was as if there was only a night light on, which made it very difficult to deal with contact lenses, for example.  I don't know if this is the usual lighting or if both bulbs were on their way out, but it should be addressed.  We arrived so late and by the time we got some midnight dinner and returned, we just didn't have the energy to pursue a lighting remedy with the staff.\n\nOne of the great features of this hotel is that they have a little coffee bar in the lobby featuring Intelligensia Coffee and baked goods from a variety of highly regarded NYC bakeries.  (There is also an Intelligensia truck in the front courtyard area.). So we got to sit in the little side courtyard with our dried cherry scones and beverages before launching on our day, which was a lovely moment.","travelDate":"2014-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel can best be described as \"boutique\" and I thought it rather lovely.  There isn't a lobby as such; the check in staff operate from a small desk via iPads within the Intelligentsia coffee bar - great coffee and tea was to be had here and indoor and outdoor seating was available.  \n\nThe rooms were quirky, individual and interesting:  mine was on the 5th floor and had two dormer windows; a largish bathroom with an excellent shower; a huge bed with a feather mattress topper and the best hotel pillows I have ever slept on; a fully stocked mini bar; air conditioning; and lovely old furniture.  The only downsides were that the room faced 10th Avenue which was very busy all the time (there was also construction going on across the road which was obviously not in the hotel's control) and there was no wardrobe.  However there was a small cupboard with a drawer and shelves and I used the coat hangers from the bathrobes so managed OK.  I had some problems with the light in my room but the staff were very helpful and sent the maintenance man up to sort things out.  Most of the guests seemed to be youngish which gave the hotel a \"trendy\" feel.\n\nThe location was great as an entrance to the High Line was located opposite across 10th Avenue.  10-12 minutes walk will get you to a subway entrance and there are loads of excellent restaurants on 9th and 10th Avenues.  The Chelsea Piers are a 10 minute walk away and using the High Line one can walk down to Greenwich Village and on to Soho.  The Chelsea area is leafy, clean and quieter than Midtown and seems to be family orientated which makes it a perfect area for strolling rather than rushing!\n\nI loved the High Line Hotel and won't hesitate to stay there again when visiting New York.","travelDate":"2014-05","tripType":"SOLO"}

Also the room is directly across from the coffee bar, so it can be loud. With that said, you get what you pay for.

It was a little on the expensive side, but actually not that much more than some much-less-nice places nearby.\n\nThe check-in process was quick and easy, and the girl at the desk gave us a Superior King room (described as \"one of the best rooms in the hotel\") even though we had registered for a Standard King. Points right off the bat! Our room was on the fifth floor, which meant we were under the eaves, and it was spacious, homey, beautifully and tastefully decorated with antiques and extremely clean. In fact, we joked that if it had even a small kitchen, we could have lived there forever! We had a view of the High Line park across the street.\n\nThe location was convenient - we were attending Sleep No More, which is nearby, and had dinner planned at a restaurant close by as well. It was a great chance to stay in an area of the city other than the usual touristy neighborhoods.\n\nThe room had so many small details that really added up to make it special. The decorative accents were clearly carefully chosen, and one of the coolest little things was that each room seemed to have a different embosser screwed into the desktop. It worked (I embossed a piece of their stationery just to try it out!) and once I saw it I realized that the patterns on the coasters and the pattern engraved in the door of our room also matched it. The rooms on either side had different designs on the door, so I assume they had different accents. A small thing, but the sign of a place that truly takes care to make every little detail special for its guests.\n\nThe bed was huge and extremely comfortable - like floating on air. We slept like babies! We didn't sample from the mini-bar, but it was incredibly well stocked, and I was tempted by the Haribo gummy bears (my faves!). \n\nMy one tiny complaint is that the tub in the bathroom could have drained a little bit better - but the tub and whole bathroom were so clean that it really wasn't even gross the way it normally would be. \n\nOverall, we were just thrilled with our stay, and wished we could have stayed longer.

Despite each employee being polite and always agreeing with me over months of interactions, the hotel has never followed through correctly and I have spent far too much time trying to troubleshoot their mistakes. \n\nBefore my stay, I called to let the hotel know I would be checking in late due to a funeral. When I arrived exhausted at midnight, my pre-paid room had been overbooked and I had to stay in a tiny room without a closet. The front desk assured me I would be discounted for the downgrade but on the last day I was billed the original amount. \n\nI asked for an updated invoice as I checked out and paid all mini-bar charges separately on my personal credit card. The front desk had a line of people waiting and asked if they could re-bill me by email. The new invoice still overcharged for the room, plus added a duplicate mini-bar charge (charging me once on my work account and once on my personal card for the same amount).\n\nWhat followed next was months of painful back-and-forth and six revised invoices, finally ending with credits for all incorrect charges but also adding a new mystery charge on my work account months after my stay. I contested that too but after no credit appeared for the new charge, I had to contest it with my credit card company. Had this been my personal card, I would have rather paid money I didn't owe than waste any more time but with a work account, I was not willing to file a new expense report to explain an unknown charge.\n\nBased on my experience and looking at other reviews on TripAdvisor, High Line Hotel's terrible customer service and billing are not an isolated incident. If they could address this problem, it could still be a great hotel, but that seems like it would take a major shift in their operations and culture.

The location is interesting (more so for those who have been to Manhattan before); it's a funky area close to the High Line and Chelsea Market. The staff are friendly. However the hotel is disappointing on several levels; the young staff are friendly but a bit directionless. I was kept waiting over an hour for my room (post check in time) and heard a couple of people complain about things (quite validly I thought), only to be given the phone number of the manager!! There is no room service or restaurant at the hotel and the public space is very limited. The daily room servicing was a touch sloppy...dirty glasses not cleared away, towels not replaced, no supplements in bathroom like shower cap, cotton buds etc. However I wouldn't post a negative review based on these relatively trivial complaints. What really upset me was arriving home on my first night there to be greeted by loud music and bright lights streaming in to my room at 10.45 pm. There was a function in the courtyard. I rang to enquire how much longer it was to go on and was told it would be over at 11. When I called back an hour later to complain about the ongoing noise I was offered the email of the manager so I \"could reach out with my concerns\"! I suggested someone might reach out to me....and despite the nice young desk boy's efforts, needless to say that never happened.

The High Line, as the name implies, is directly across 10th avenue from its namesake, making a visit to that landmark, the Chelsea galleries or the meatpacking district all very convenient.\n\nThe hotel itself has been carved out of a massive Richardsonian Romanesque pile that must have served as a seminary back in its former life.  Now the twisting halls, cold metal stairs, tiny elevators and passages lead to a warren of rooms of differing sizes and features.  I was kindly upgraded by the NYU art student\/aspiring model staff to a large room overlooking 10th avenue and the epinoumous city park.  The room was cozy and well equipped with a small sofa (a davenport as my grandmother would have called this one), a non-working but atmospheric fireplace, a small but functional desk with plenty of outlets, and a ridiculously well stocked bar and snack set up.  There was a small closet and the large and extraordinarily comfortable bed with a featherbed, deep sheets and very soft pillows.\n\nAs far as things I was less than happy with, I could point to the fact that the hotel basically has no lobby, per se.  For a place of this size they\u2019ve converted a very small area to the lobby function and the check in is literally a wardrobe that the staff opens when guests arrive.  If it\u2019s at all busy, it makes for something of a cluster in there.  In the room itself, I will note that I was assigned to an accessible room with some very odd bathroom features.  The sink was equipped with a sensor faucet which seems like a great idea at first except ask yourself, have you ever been able to vary the temperature of the water in a public bathroom equipped with sensor activated faucets?  The answer is no, as I realized at the High Line.  Thus, having no way to change between tooth-brushing cold and shaving-hot, I was forced to turn plumber commando and screw around with the valves in the wall to change the temp every time I needed to!  This combined with the total lack of counter space for my toiletries (a real pet peeve of mine) and an accessible shower that literally poured water all over the room with each use made the bathroom a real drag.  \n\nIn the end however, these issues were tolerable, particularly given that the bathroom issues are unique to the room in which I stayed.","travelDate":"2014-02","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This was our first stay in Chelsea and we loved not only the neighborhood, but the hotel itself. When they renovated this property, it was done in such a way that the 1800's theology school can still be felt in the building, yet  you are staying in a very hip, chic and interesting hotel.\n\nWe loved that the architecture of the building and it's furnishings  were true to the original  buildings purpose, with original doorways, stained glass, period furnishings, fireplaces and old school desks and hand presses in the rooms, as well as old rotary phones. The interior space provided a small lobby with no registration desk. Instead, there was an employee or two with a lap top monitoring check ins, security and guests needs from the lobby. Bell staff handled bags and opened doors. There was an outstanding coffee bar that takes up half the lobby space and was always busy. We loved the outside interior courtyard\u2026.great place to sit and read or grab a coffee. Bicycles were available for guests use upon request.\n\nOur room, #20 faced the High Line and was spacious with two double beds, two closets and a large bathroom. Again, decorated in period furnishings and colors, the room captured both the needs of today while still echoing it's history. Beds were VERY comfortable with plush down mattress pads and comforters. \n\nOne of the very best things about The High Line Hotel was it's location. Not only are you across the street from the High Line Park, but you are surrounded by GREAT local, neighborhood restaurants, Chelsea Piers, The Park along the Hudson to ride bikes, jog, roller blade or walk for miles and miles, Chelsea Market, and tons of outstanding art galleries. We loved Cookshop for brunch next door and Red Cat for dinner or brunch. Porteno Restaurant  down the block on 10th was OUTSTANDING for Argentinean food, we had a very memorable and delicious dinner there. It is small, so make reservations.\n\nWe had no issues with the staff, they were young but attentive and interested in meeting and exceeding our needs. Do not come to this hotel if you are expecting the Ritz Carlton or The St. Regis. Although The High Line Hotel is an upscale boutique hotel, and a property well worth staying in and returning to, it is because it is a historical gem with amenities and a great location in West Chelsea.

Bottom line: if you pay for a room, from 3 p.m. till 12 p.m. the next day, and you can't have your room for a large proportion of the time,  and they charge you the full amount, that is theft. This might sound harsh, but we actually arrived at mid-day very tired and told \"just a few more minutes\", with vague allusions to pillowcases. It does seem there are systemic issues with organization at this hotel. This went on for several hours. We left and came back several times and wasted the first precious day of our short stay, trusting they were telling us the truth that we could, in a few minutes, check-in. I don't think we would have actually been given our room had we not, after an 8 hour (yes 8 hour) wait, refused to leave reception until they sorted it out.  Add to this a myriad of other perfect examples of how to alienate and upset your guests, and I give it 3 stars (contact me if you want details of further mishaps - too long and boring to go into here). After paying nearly $1800 for two nights (because they don't provide roll-outs for big delux double rooms), I was told on check out to please contact the general manager, he is very good at responding.  So the unconscionable: it's mean to leave bad reviews if the general manager had no idea this problem arose and is not given the opportunity to make amends. As such, I wrote to the general manager... twice, and after dead silence, asked his staff to forward my email, which they kindly did. The problems with service seem to extend to their email servers. Despite Mr. Migoya having ample time over the past 10 days to respond to others on tripadvisor making public announcements about the disaster that is this hotel, my discreet inquiries remain unheeded.

My room was off the lobby, which for a few twentysomethings who stay out late was fine but the fact that within minutes of us returning to the room the coffee bar was opening or preparing for the day - the clinking and clanging from that right outside our door before the sun even rose was brutal. That was, however, a minor issue compared to the temperature of our room. It was stuffy and unbearably warm upon arrival. We turned the thermostat all the way to cold on the highest setting before going out for the night.

When we finally got in, the room was 10 times hotter than it was before we left. We opened the windows, only half of which had screens, so we had to keep only those two open. We barely slept because of how unbelievably hot the room was and being on street level with open windows did not help that.

The receptionist, which is basically you standing in the middle of the coffee shop talking to a member of staff with a screen, told us she was moving things around to give us a bigger room. Great I think, once in the room we are met with just 1 king size bed. I return to reception to be told that is what I booked, yes I say I appreciate the room type but this is what was offered to me when I put in our search criteria I was expecting a sofa bed\/single bed to be added to the room. She said I should have requested a rollaway bed for a further $75 on top of the $400 already paid. I don't think so I reply, initially she said this is the room you have booked, I state the fact and show my booking confirm clearly stating 2 adults, 1 child, she'd does say this has happened before, the website should really tell the booker, but it doesn't I say, I need a bed for my daughter. She calls another member, dithers around, we decide to get a drink she finally tells me a rollaway is being set up now, we gave it a further 5 mins, it's now 1.30 am we return to the room to no bed, no-one putting up a bed. I return again, now very frustrated to be told I have to be patient!! The cheek of it I say you told me now 10 mins ago the bed was being put up. I return again and eventually a bed arrives,, it's now 2 am before I can finally get my daughter to bed. Throughout the whole episode I was made to feel like it was my fault, certainly very poor customer service, with the conversation being held for all to hear.

Very well renovated with some really classy touches. The rooms are pretty small, but from what I hear that's typical of NYC. The service on the other hand is absolutely appalling!\n\nOne or two of the staff were very moody and elitist, as though any basic question was beneath them - although I do have to point out that this was the minority as some were quite the opposite. It's just the bad experiences seem to really sour the whole experience. Part of the package is access to a local gym. I was assured by hotel staff that I just needed to let them know my name as they would call ahead, although when I arrived at the gym nobody there seemed to know that there was even a deal in place. I did manage to get in, but only after calling the hotel and getting them to have a conversation. These are minor problems though and we still would have been happy enough in the grand scheme of things until we were checking out.\n\nWhen arranging a cab back to JFK I was stupid enough to fall for a fairly hard sell into paying considerably more for a private hotel car. Worth travelling back in style we thought, but as it turns out the car was filthy, the boot was already full of random rubbish meaning getting our cases in was a challenge and there were a number of deep cracks all the way across the windscreen! This was genuinely far worse than any yellow cab we'd taken. We were really surprised about this as the hotel itself, is clean and classy, so why would they want to associate themselves with this?\n\nWorse still was the after service. I left an expensive pair of headphones in the room so emailed them from the UK asking if they had them. They were kind enough to call back and confirm this was the case so I arranged for a friend in NYC to collect them. I confirmed his name and details over email, but when he arrived he was told they had already been collected. I have no major objection to this as it must have been a mistake by somebody on reception and I understand these things happen (my fault for leaving them in the first place!) - although there is a slight question mark over why somebody else would come in and ask for them when nobody other than me, my wife, my friend and the hotel knew they were there. My big problem is the absolute zero contact from the High Line Hotel since this happened. I naturally emailed them to query the fact they had given them to somebody other than the person I'd specifically named, but had no reply. A couple of days later I repeated this, but again, nothing. As was the case on two or three other occasions. The headphones aren't the issue here, it's the fact that they refuse to even acknowledge the issue with a reply. Even if it wasn't what I wanted to hear, a reply of any form would have at least showed they have at least some concept of customer service. A very disappointing end to what had been a great trip.\n\nNext time we're in NYC we'll stay at The Jane.","travelDate":"2014-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We stayed in a Deluxe King.  The size of the room was excellent for the price we paid (thru booking.com) - at least for NYC.  We actually stayed in two different rooms after having an issue in the first room.  We moved from room 11 to room 19.  Room 11 was bigger but noisier.  Both rooms faced the front of the hotel on 10th Ave., which we liked.  The best thing about this place, that is hard to put into words, is its charm.  It's a very chic and trendy place in a good way.  It's also in a pretty fantastic location away from the tourist hordes.  The main down side is the same thing that gives the place charm.  The building is very old, so you can't expect everything to be in perfect condition.  For instance, the shower didn't drain properly.  When we moved rooms (that wasn't the issue) I thought the shower in the next room would be fine.  No such luck.  \n\nI do have a couple of suggestions for mgmt.  The elevator was small and dark, better lighting would help.  Also my wife said the wall sockets in both rooms were loose, i.e., her plugs were falling out.  Also, with somewhat limited counter space in the bathroom it would be helpful to permanently remove the knickknacks on the counters.   \n\nLike the hotel itself, the location might seem a bit questionable, until you get there and walk the neighborhood.  We used city buses to get around.  The bus stop is a half block away out the front door in either direction.  The no. 11 bus comes every 10-15 minutes and takes you right up 10th Ave. towards Midtown.  You can take the same no. 11 back down 9th Ave. to get back to the hotel.  But you'll need exact change ($2.75) or a metro card, which you can purchase at a subway station.  We had a really good breakfast at Le Grainne Cafe, a French diner, about 2 blocks away.  There's also a 24 hr. CVS one block away if you head out the front door to the right.  And at least 4 restaurants deliver to the hotel.  I have no doubt this place will be rising in the TA rankings.  The pros definitely outweigh the cons.  I can see why this place was ranked much higher a few years ago under previous management before it had to close due to Hurricane Sandy.  If you go, don't forget to check out the courtyard out back.  It's beautiful.  We will return.","travelDate":"2014-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I really needed an early check-in but could not be accommodated--even though they said they could do so-- and I ended up waiting awhile, not really knowing how long it would be.

The hot room: I opened the window and had it open to get through the night, which was okay because I was high up but would not have felt safe lower to the ground.

Furniture is quirky 1920s vintage desks and chairs, I liked it but may not be for everyone.  Bathroom is tiny which is typical New York but not typical for hotel of this level is tiny precast tub with shower curtain.

The design is atmospheric and quite pleasant. Super plush beds, although I know that's not everyone's cup of tea.\n\nThe standard queen sized room is advertised as 250 - 350 square feet. The first room they put me in was no more than 160 square feet, including the bathroom. (It was room 37 1\/2, go figure.)\nNot enough room to swing a cat, as the Brits say.  There wasn't even any hanging space, come to think of it.  After I protested, they put me in another room, which was no more than 180 square feet (and with pitched ceilings, so not ideal for tall people). To add insult to injury, they couldn't extend my stay for another evening because they were fully booked, so I had to lug all of my bags down to SoHo.  (Not entirely their fault, I know, although some hotels would find another way.) \n\nI specifically chose this hotel (instead of the hotel my colleagues were staying at) because of the advertised room size. I had several large bags because I was stopping over in New York before my move to Hong Kong, so you can imagine that I really needed that space. \n\nAll-in-all, this is not a full service hotel. Which is often fine in some cases, but when the rooms are microscopic, then you sort of like a bit of extra to compensate. It's really more of a too-cool-for-school coffee shop with some dorm rooms attached. And what's amazing is that it's always fully booked!

You're choosing to stay in a very old building that used to be dormitories for the surrounding church.  The hotel made the decision not to tear this pretty amazing building down (or more likely, I guess, it is protected as a historic building), but that inevitably leaves some oddities. So, while I really enjoyed it, I cannot say this would satisfy everyone.  I'm including about everything I can think of to help people make decisions here, but basically if you want brand new, the Standard is just down the street.\n\nFirst, the heating issue people have mentioned.  We visited mid-October.  Our room was quite warm when we checked in (74 or so), and the temp decreased slowly and steadily while we were there, to about 68 by night three.  Had we wanted to, the large windows in our room opened, so we could have cooled the room that way.  But we were comfortable.\n\nSo two weird things, neither of which really impacted our stay or would make me not stay there again, I just found them odd. And I know this is a soft opening, but our room didn't have a clock in it.  I just thought it was odd to open a hotel with no alarm clocks (I did look at the website and they say docks are \"coming soon\").  Also, the garbage can in our room was never emptied, not sure why.\n\nWe were almost sidewalk level, and had almost no noise, the soundproofing was excellent.  No horns, no traffic noise, no talking from pedestrians outside.  I heard people in the hallway outside, which is tiled (like a dorm would be!) rather than carpeted, maybe once or twice.  But not loud, nothing that would interrupt a stay, and I did see that there was at least one family near our room.\n\nThe room was ENORMOUS.  And not by NYC standards, by any standards.  Linens and towels were super high quality.  The Intelligentsia is great, I love having the option of getting really good coffee before heading out for the day.  The location is also great, close to trains to midtown and Tribeca, easily walkable to Meatpacking, West Village, Soho, etc, and a block to the High Line.  It was a bit chilly to take advantage of the outdoor seating space, but I would definitely come back in warmer weather just for that option.

There are some elements that hold great potential, and others that seem curious or even odd. We did enjoy our stay, and you have to give them credit for trying something new. Ultimately though, it feels more like a guest-house than a hotel. The services and amenities you might expect at this price point, are notably absent.  \n\nAlthough previous reviews seem to indicate a discounted \"soft-opening\" back in July and August, there is still on-going work on the front and back courtyards. The whole endeavor still feels like a work-in-progress. Despite that, prices have risen into the same lofty realm as the Standard (a much more polished full-service hotel - also on the High Line).  \n\nThe best feature is the location \u2013\u00a0across the street from a High Line entrance. Our suite (#3) was quite large with two closets, a desk and a sitting area. The bed was supremely comfortable and the bathroom was well-appointed. Our room was very quiet due to its view of the lovely, but incomplete, back courtyard.\n\nIt's a unique concept, and a unique aesthetic. An 1800s Seminary building has been remodeled to feel like a cross between the prohibition-era vibe you're seeing all-over and someone's 1050s college apartment building. It shows admirable restraint that there aren't faux-vintage filament light bulbs everywhere. The furniture has a quirky mis-matched thrift-store feel to it, but on closer inspection, it's much too pristine to actually be vintage. The black floors, fireplace and grey mouldings are a nice touch, but I assume that our room's Home Depot exposed-bulb ceiling fixtures were just temporary. It truly is a mixed bag.\n\nWould I recommend this property? I guess I'd give it a qualified \"not yet\"...at least not at this full-fare price. If you can wait until they finish the decor and grounds, this might be a good change of pace.","travelDate":"2013-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Our stay was soured by three important factors: hospitality, a continuous and unsolved temperature problem in our room, and smoking on a non-smoking floor. Our daughter has lived in the city for 3+ years and we have stayed in many NYC hotels; manhattan to brooklyn.  My husband and I travel consistently and regularly for business and feel very strongly about choosing hotels based on the quality of the hospitality and not just amenities.  It's simply such a crucial part to an enjoyable stay.  This past weekend we chose the Highline Hotel because of it's proximity to the West Village and that we wanted to bring our small dog with us for the weekend before traveling upstate, and the hotel is prominently advertised as a dog-friendly hotel, something we researched throughly.  On the surface, it seemed to be an important part of their business plan to cater to pet owners and to make human and canine guest alike feel at home.  The daily front desk and lobby staff is wonderful, incredibly warm and accommodating, and when I asked at check-in if I could take my dog outside to the gravel yard to walk her, I was told this was no problem.  She is a suburban dog who isn't familiar with a lot of concrete and throughout the next 2 days whenever she needed to go out to relieve herself I walked her in the front yard of the hotel and spoke to hotel staff and guests who never expressed a single comment about her being in the bushes outside.  On our last evening after dark, my daughters and I walked the dog outside on our way to dinner and noticed a large crowd in the lobby, coach buses out front and what was clearly a large amount of security and staff managing an important event that was taking place at the hotel.  When I took the dog outside and proceeded to walk her in the yard as I had consistently for 2 days prior, I was approached suddenly by not one but two aggressive staff members who announced that I wasn't allowed to walk my dog in front of the hotel, but I was welcome to on the city sidewalk outside the gates.  When I explained that they were prominently a dog-friendly hotel and that I had specifically asked and been told that this was an appropriate place to walk her, I was met with blank stares and sharp responses that it mattered because the general manager was present and insisted upon it.  I understand that NYC hotels walk the thin line of being both hotels and local event space, but the good ones manage to do both with the utmost hospitality. Even if the message that I couldn't walk my dog there for that evening was a fair one, the way that it was expressed was hostile and entirely unacceptable.  As a responsible pet owner I asked the questions I was supposed to ask before walking my dog, and was later admonished by a mismanaged hotel because they had an event that required that they keep up appearances.  I will never be comfortable in a hotel that puts its local event business over its guests, and in a city like New York with the best of the best at your fingertips, why should anyone settle for less than simple hospitality?\n\nIt's worth nothing that this issue occurred after the heat in my room (in mid October in 60-50 degree weather) would not turn off all night leaving us drenched in sweat all 3 nights, an issue which we repeatedly mentioned and was told could not be helped because of the way that the heating in the building functions.  Fair enough, not every problem can be fixed with miracles but there was absolutely no gesture of compensation or any response other than \"....well... sorry!\"  I let it go because what could I do, until the incident with the dog and the night we spent with a constant smell of smoke on a non-smoking floor. As a brand new hotel, The Highline would do well to get it's management in order and train on both consistency and a standard of guest service.  It's the largest and most well-equipped room I've stayed at in the city, but I left with a regrettably bad taste in my mouth and won't stay here again.","travelDate":"2013-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The staff noted my husband's birthday and greeted him with a happy birthday.  A small token was waiting in our room as well.  We both found this to be charming and unique.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience.","travelDate":"2013-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I checked in, unpacked most of my stuff, and went out for a few hours. I came back and the room door was open. Surprised, I go in, and find a used towel on my bed, coffee container on my nightstand, etc. I immediately go to the front desk, and they say, \"oh, We didn't realize someone was using that room so we let someone use it for a bit. We'll get you another one.\" ... They were nice enough, but no one seemed surprised in the least. Bizarre bizarre experience. \n\nIn other news, the rooms themselves are actually quite cool. Similar style\/feel as the Bowery hotel, but newer. ","travelDate":"2013-09","tripType":"NONE"}

It's front yard is great for coffees and its bar is full of fashionable hip crowds! No food is served but the pastries are very nice. Rooms are comfortable and the beds are extra super soft - if you like sleeping on feathers!!! \nThe location is very convenient with lots of zagat highly ranked places in the area. But...the main issue here is the noise! For a week I didn't get a days sleep!!! It's not not the location though, it's the building itself. We asked to be moved the first night and the staff happily did give us a new room but still chaos!! It is such a shame as the hotel is very recently renovated and it is obvious that no attention was paid to noise insulation. We were staying on the second floor and I could hear what people downstairs were talking about. \n\nI don't know if I would go again or recommend it to anyone. If they could guarantee a quiet room then I would have no second thoughts.","travelDate":"2013-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The interior rooms face a nice courtyard although there is construction on one side for new condos. It's a beautiful historic property and the rooms are nicely appointed and seem generally clean, though a few spots needed some more attention. The main problem was check-in. When I made the reservation I asked for a room on an upper floor away from the elevators facing the courtyard. So what did I get?  A room on the second floor right near the coffee bar and the elevator, plus facing the street. I could hear every clink of every spoon stirring a latte at the coffee bar. The staff was very accommodating when we asked to move and put us in a higher room facing the courtyard. Much improved.","travelDate":"2013-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I was given a room on the ground floor, almost directly across from the Intelligentsia Coffee bar and just steps from the front desk.  Initially, I was worried about the street noise, as my windows were right on 10th Avenue.  Street noise was not the problem, but the noise from the coffee bar and the front desk staff was quite annoying.  At midnight, the front desk staff were laughing and yukking it up and I could hear every bit of it.  The lobby is tiled with no textiles to absorb the sound - terrible.  In addition, the young boy who showed me to my room clearly was uncomfortable and had a difficult time explaining the room features.  The room itself was quite pretty and the bed was very comfy.  Unfortunately, there is no clothing storage space to speak of.  The closet rod was about 8 inches long and with 2 hotel robes already hanging there, there wasn't room for anything else.  There are also no hooks in the bathroom for robes, etc.  Phone didn't work, had  no hot water before 8am.  I understand that they are still working things out and if you can get the $229 Jetsetter rate, then I would stay there.  Unfortunately the current room rate is well over $500 and the hotel is just not worth that.","travelDate":"2013-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

After a long and difficult trip to NYC, we arrived early and were immediately shown to a room which was larger than the one we'd booked. The decor is interesting, dark and restful, reflecting the origins of the building.\nIt is a little disconcerting to arrive at a hotel with no reception however, the staff was attentive and thoughtful, and we were shown to our room within minutes of our arrival. The room itself was spacious and comfortable, if you admire the charm of an old residence. There were quirky selections of furnishings as well as luxurious linens to enjoy.\nThe location is perfect for a visit to the high line, as well as to shops and galleries in Chelsea. A visit to this hotel is more like a quick trip to Europe with all of the sensibilities of a bygone era.","travelDate":"2013-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}
