Check in was good and we got into our room on 24 floor early which was a Brucey bonus. We even had a balcony overlooking the city looking south towards Times Square which was fab. \n\nThe location was spot on with a subway station about 50 yards from the front door. Central Park about 5 minutes walk as was the Rockefeller and Times Square. \n\nWe were aware of the daily fee for breakfast and dinner so took advantage of it every day. In the evening we were well looked after by Victor and Raphael. They were good fun and meant our glasses were never empty. \n\nThere was loads of choice at breakfast so most people should be satisfied. Never found it too busy but were up and at it early with the time difference.\n\nThe evening tapas had a different theme each night and there was Prosecco, red, white wine and a choice of beers to wash down the grub. Each plate\/urn of food was always kept full so you could graze as you wished.\n\nIt was over $100 per day for two but considering the costs in NYC I would say it was well worth using the eat in option.\n\nThe room was a good size with the stunning city views and it was kept immaculately on a daily basis.\n\nThe restaurant and balcony is on floor 23 so we could walk there and back via the stairs.\n\nSo to sum up we had a fabulous mini break and would defo recommend it to anyone needing a wee bit of comfort in the city. As per usual in a hotel the friendly staff made all the difference to our stay.\n\nGreat work WedtHouse","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When we checked in we were told the resident fee was included in the booking fee so nothing further to pay and I double checked on checkout and was told the same.  So imagine my surprise to find they took the fee of $504 without providing a bill or talking to me about it on checkout. I never signed anything.  When I queried this there was no apology.  They seemed to think I was querying the fee when I was actually querying why they told me one thing to my face on both checkin and checkout. This left me with a very bad impression.   \nThe hotel is old so expect the normal wear and tear.  What I didn't expect was a very noisy aircon in the room and serious lack of light in the main bedroom.  The buffet staff are fantastic and we didn't mind tipping them at all, totally worth it, they were running around and making sure everyone was happy.  I have to say though if you are expecting Champagne there isn't any.  There is American sparkling wine which seems to be what you get when you ask for Champagne or Prosecco.  \nSo the $10 question; would we stay again.  Probably not as there as so many wonderful restaurants in NYC that I could have spent the $504 on.  ","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Unfortunately westhouse is nothing like what it promoted. It\u2019s 3 star at best. Think no room service, no turndown, no mini bar or snack to purchase.\n\nWhen we checked in, two one bedroom suites one was assigned to a view of a brick wall. When I ask about it I was told the 3rd party we booked through couldn\u2019t guarantee a city view, so we took them for the first night. I challenged it the next morning and showed them the booking confirmation from Luxury Escapes and they agreed to move one.  (I also called Luxury Escapes at the same time) we moved one room and have one good view and one very ordinary view.  \n\nThe rooms are very old. Ours has stains with urine under the toilet, cigarette burns in the couch and wallpaper pealed on most edges. Some days you get water in the room when it\u2019s made and some days you call and ask for water and wait four hours and call again. Some days you get 5 towels, some days one, some days four facecloths and some none, today we have four pillowcases on the sofa nicely ironed (but do we need to change them ourselves) my son used the iron in his room to iron a shirt and it pumped out rusty water on it, so he needed to come done to ours via the stairs (more on that later) to iron a shirt. I\u2019m convinced that the guest service number goes off site as they are so much more professional than people that work in the hotel. \n\nThe shower doesn\u2019t drain in both rooms. I called day two to ask for it to be serviced and was told that it would be the next day at 10am. 4 days later it hasn\u2019t. My wife and I take turns at flushing the toilet to get the water out of the shower when using (I know it disgusting but we have no choice, when I called Luxury Escapes I was offer a 2 day refund that they will only give me as a credit (so I need to use them again) and it was made very clear if I move we would get nothing and I would need to pay for a new hotel 3 days out from Christmas in NYC. Hence we had to stay!\n\nAs far as the buffet goes think nice airline lounge food but set in a food court with people waiting over you shoulder to grab your seat as it is so busy (don\u2019t judge them, you will be one of those people looking for a table for your family) the wine is the same cheap stuff ever night,  don\u2019t get excited about champagne in other reviews it\u2019s Prosecco, Stella Artois, and really bad red and white wine. \n\nWe assumed wrongly that the hotel would do something special for Christmas Eve, the only thing they did is not open the bar so you could only use the free bar with the fore mentioned bad wine. Nothing special at all just another disappointing night. \n\nThe lifts are horrendous, the hotel shares a list bank with the hotel next door. They have two shafts each. The ones next door have signs all over saying they are investigating $$ in fixing them. On our side nothing, and normally only one of the two work. So you need to wait 5-10 minutes each time you want to use. Sometimes we have needed to get out when it gets stuck with the door half open to walk up a flight of stairs to call a lift again so you get the other one, unfortunately people are so accustomed to it and just joke and laugh at passing each other walking up and down the stars (remember this hotel is 25 floors)\n\nAnyway as mentioned Luxury Escapes have given us a 20% discount on this overwhelming disappointing experience we are stuck in, I had no choice but to accept it but really wanted others to be cautious, it\u2019s nothing like what we expected for the price and listening to others in the lounge we are not the only ones feeling this way!","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Most staff friendly apart from one lady on reception who preferred to be on her phone rather than attending to the hotel\u2019s customers.  The resort fee is a bit high, seems people get charged different amounts.  We were charged 55 dollars per person and then tax on top of that making it 367 dollars for 2 of us for 3 nights.  The furniture was all worn in the bedroom with a cracked dirty mirror, not luxury at all.  Had a room on the 21st floor that looked onto a wall and there was some sort of generator noise outside the window the whole time. The room temperature was unbearable at times even though we had no heating on. The lifts are an actual nightmare, they were constantly not working or took absolutely ages to come. Some people actually got stuck in them during our stay.  I\u2019m still waiting for the 300 dollars put on hold on my bank account card to be realised back to my account.

This room has been converted from a bedroom to the breakfast room overflow\/prep area for staff. This has woken me up every morning & disturbed our sleep, this is persistent and ongoing until end of service at about 10am. I know the kitchen has to be somewhere, but above a guest bedroom, seriously?\n\nThere is a teeny tiny wardrobe, more like a cupboard, which has 5 hangers in (so I had to ask for some more), and because the room is so small there is nowhere to store your suitcases meaning it intrudes into your space even more. We are having to store some of our clothes on our cases as there are no drawers or anywhere to put anything \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nThere is a small dressing table which has the thinnest & most peculiar drawers which are not practical as you can\u2019t fit anything in them so a pointless piece of furniture.\nThe room is quite dark so I asked for an extra lamp which was provided. \nThe blinds at the windows are mucky & while this isn\u2019t a huge deal if you\u2019re saying you\u2019re a 5 star hotel it shouldn\u2019t be dirty. \n\nBreakfast\u2026. On our first day they ran out of plates by 8.30 so I asked the waiter if they had any\u2026 and their solution was paper plates! I actually laughed out loud thinking this was a joke and felt I was at a kids party! \n\nI am so disappointed in this hotel and the fact they have the audacity to charge well over $300 a night for this room is disgusting, they should be ashamed!!\n\nI would absolutely not stay here again.

The staff on 23 Floor are really friendly and helpful\nGreat view from our room and balcony on 23rd floor\nComfy bed\nNice bathroom with a good shower\n\nNegatives\nBoth elevators broke down during our stay and when they worked were slow.  We waited 15 minutes one evening for an elevator (and were on 21st floor)\n\nRoom was tired, furniture damaged, bed sheet didn't fit the bed so the mattress was exposed, lack of amenities in the room  - definitely not 5 star.  We paid for a luxury king and whilst the bathroom was nice, the room was not what we expected.\n\nThe breakfast room is far too small for the number of guests - difficult to get a table - you have to wait around and then grab a dirty table as someone leaves. Not what I would expect for 5 star.  There is a good selection of food but the constant queueing, bad quality coffee and lack of personal service makes it a poor experience.  It is not a nice way to start your day! We stopped going to breakfast halfway through our stay and ate out instead which was annoying as we were paying for breakfast.  As the space is too small for the number of guests they need to rethink offering breakfast as part of the resort fee and allow people to opt out and pay less.  \n\nNo bar, no room service.  We really like to have a drink in our hotel bar when we get back from dinner.  There is a bar in the lobby and its nice but just not in use.  They really need to open it.  I think its odd they lack facilities yet have a five star rating.\n\nOverall I would rate it 3.5 out of 5 and believe it is better suited to a 4 star rating not 5 star.\n\nWould I go back?  No, I don't think I would and have booked another hotel for my next trip in March.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were there for our daughters 18th birthday and Pagye had arranged a surprise cake, decorations and treats for her as well as an upgrade on the room.  The communications were really good thorugh pre-arrival and also when there- thank you Pagye.  If you can get a higher floor the views rae great, you get old New York and all the new sights and you may be able to see all the way down into Times Square, we were in 2006. \n\nThe breakfast buffet was good, a good choice for an all round breakfast, my only improvement would be some hot plates to keep the hot food hot. \n\nThe evening buffet changed everyday and it could certainly be enough for an evening meal. Drinks were freely available.  Our only suggestion would be that once the evneing service finishes everyone needs to vacate, including the terrace, some way to extend this with a paid bar service would be very welcome as I do not think they had a bar running in the hotel.  I must mention the team who work the buffet they were all stars and worked hard to keep it topped up, looking good and collecting all the used plates, super freindly crew. \n\nOverall I thought the resort fee was good value - if you can make use of it everyday and you drink.   We couldn't make the evening on 2 of the 5 nights and our daughter is not a drinker\/allowed to drink in the USA. That said NYC is crazy expensive so on balance its a benefit. \n\nLocation was great, subway next to the entrance and another two around the blocks so lots of options to get up and down town. \n\nA great bar acoss the road for late night drinks. \n\nOverall we were very pleased and look forward to returning to the WestHouse Hotel soon. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Their hospitality truly enhanced our overall experience during our stay.\n\nMy family and I thoroughly enjoyed our time in our hotel room; however, there was one aspect that left us somewhat disappointed. The handicap shower in our room was quite small and felt uncomfortably tight. It was not ideal for a comfortable shower experience.\n\nOn the flip side, the views from our room were absolutely breathtaking. We were treated to stunning vistas of the surrounding city buildings, which added a special touch to our stay.\n\nLocation-wise, the West House Hotel is perfectly situated for anyone looking to immerse themselves in the vibrant energy of New York City. It's conveniently close to the action, with Central Park and Broadway theaters just a stone's throw away.\n\nOne thing I'd like to mention is that my family and I follow a plant-based diet, and we were hoping for more accommodating breakfast options at the hotel's 23rd-floor breakfast area. Unfortunately, the selection was quite limited, primarily consisting of fruits. This left us somewhat disappointed as we were hoping for a more diverse breakfast menu.\n\nIn summary, the West House Hotel offers great value for its price and boasts an excellent location in the heart of Manhattan. If I were to book again in the future, I would certainly request a room with a larger shower to enhance the overall comfort of my stay. Despite this minor setback, I would highly recommend the West House Hotel to anyone seeking an enjoyable and conveniently located stay in New York City.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The bed was amazingly comfortable, my request for a top-floor room was honored and the fitness center was spotless and well-equipped.  However, for a five-star hotel, the room lacked basic amenities.  I had to request a robe. I did not have slippers in the room nor any kind of clock or alarm. The furniture was worn. The bathroom had zero counter space and poor lighting. \n\nI took advantage of the Terrace Lounge food offerings, including daily breakfast and evening \"Hours of Indulgence \". For the most part, food offerings were fresh, though limited for those who prefer healthier options. Beer, wine and prosecco was available in the evenings. Desserts were lackluster. Coffee, available during breakfast hours only, was bad (which I had read in previous reviews). \n\nI was disappointed that front desk personnel did not inquire about my stay upon checking out.

The lobby is small, but has a bar in the back that doesn't seem to get a lot of action. The real kicker is the breakfast and late afternoon wine buffet. I couldn't believe how much food was there for both seatings, and you can eat inside or out on a considerable patio with lovely views.

Which I hope to one day re-visit very soon. \nUpon arriving we were greeted by the ever so friendly & welcoming Chris Ortiz, who saw us comfortably up to our room.\nThe room we stayed in was on the 22nd floor a King Deluxe room. Furnished with a most comfortable bed and quality bedding. It was a feat to wrestle myself from the slumbers that the quality bedding and very comfortable bed provided. The room was spacious, very clean and with quality mahogany furnishings. The bathroom is a Pandora\u2019s box of truly great quality shampoo and conditioner provided by the hotel. The hair products sustainably sourced and blended into true quality, is a great gift of pleasure! The bathroom modern and exuding luxury and sophistication. Also, the two thick lush towel bathrobes were a great addition. I was pleasantly surprised to find my room had a GHD hairdryer which I took the pleasure in utilising. They also provided a premium body lotion too.\n Gloria, one of the House Keepers excelled in maintaining the clean and well made up \u201cWow!\u201d factor that we got every time, we returned from a full day out. \nThe resort fee which included breakfast, coffee and a selection of teas, plus soft drinks available throughout the day, and in the evening a hot meal, plus wines, beers and champagne.\nUpon returning to the hotel, after a full day and evening out, I went to the Terrace room (This is  the room which the resort fee pays for - breakfast and an evening meal) It was quite late and the room was now closed. However, Jose a very helpful member of staff enquired, if I was ok and did I need anything?\nI commented I would love a hot cup of tea. Jose went out of his way to get me a hot cup of tea and walked with me carrying some of the condiments. \nThe staff we encountered were all very friendly and super helpful, a real credit to this hotel! Quimby Hightower provided exceptional service in ensuring our comfort and enjoyment! Rafael in the Terrace room exuded warmth and an interest in our day. He always had a ready smile!\nMy biggest quandary was my desire to enjoy the wonderful amenities, as opposed to wanting to do as much sight seeing, as possible!\nThe location for us was perfect. Set in the heart of Manhattan we could walk to all the places we wanted to visit, such as Broadway, Stardust Diner, Times Square, Bryant Park and so on. \nI cannot rate this hotel enough  \u2026 in the words of Simon Cowell it\u2019s a \u201cYes!\u201d From me!!!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The subway is literally a few steps next to the hotel with Central Park only a couple of blocks away. \n\nIn terms of the why I feel improvement is required focusses on a couple of areas:\n\n- Resort Fee\n\nYou pay $50+ a night for food and drinks along with gym facilities and wifi (which is pretty standard across many hotels now). As part of this there is food, wine, beer and Prosecco each night. \n\nThe food is unfortunately not hot, not was it warm on many occasions, including breakfast which was cold on some mornings (scrambled egg, bacon and potatoes being the main options). I did highlight this to hotel management on day two, however there was no change in the temperature. \n\n- Rooms\n\nWith the hotel being older bear in mind that soundproofing does not seem to have been installed. We could hear all our neighbours, including what they were watching on tv to people  talking in the corridors. \n\nA rather minor inconvenience was the heating was also stuck on, which would automatically come on, even when turned off (and I did wonder why there was a fan in the room\u2026)\n\n- Facilities\n\nThere are only 2 lifts for the whole hotel that we could use, meaning a wait of up to 10 mins on some occasions to get to our room on the 20th floor. Other guests had told us they had waited for nearly 20 mins, just spending to bear in mind if you are on high room. \n\nOverall the hotel was nice, it was not worth the price tag I paid however, based on the service provision (with the exception of the reception and concierge team). \n\nI would be unlikely to return unless there was a promotion available.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I didn't get a reply.\nWe arrived late at night and check-in was fine (although no recognition of the birthday), they checked we were aware of the additional $49.99 per person per night residents fee (we were) and took our card details to cover this.\nWe got up to our room on the 19th floor and immediately realised we had been given the wrong room (this was a Standard King, we had booked a Deluxe King) so I went back down to tell them (and the requested tea making facilities were not there either).  The receptionist at first tried to argue that we had only booked a standard (even when I showed her my confirmation which clearly stated Deluxe!) then she blamed the booking company and said I'd have to call them!  However, when she realised this wasn't going to happen she said she's check with the manager (who was sitting at the desk on the higher level).  She agreed it was wrong but as they were fully booked that night I would have to stay there the night and come and see her again in the morning and she would move our room then.  She also said she would waive our first night\u2019s residence fee.\nThe following morning she was nowhere to be seen to I explained the situation to the (new) receptionist who told us no rooms were free yet so to pack our bags, leave them in the room and we would be moved on our return from our day out.\nWhen we got back at about 3.30pm I checked with (another new) receptionist who didn't seem to know anything about it but said she's give us a new room anyway - but when we got there it was exactly the same (wrong) room just a floor higher!!  So back down we went to explain that the whole reason for being moved was to get the Deluxe room we had booked (the difference being the Deluxe rooms are slightly bigger and have an outside street-view, not the inner courtyard view of the Standard rooms).  She then changed us again and this time we did actually get the correct Deluxe room (opposite the original one on the 19th floor with a nice view above 55th Street.\nWhile down at reception I had enquired about the whereabouts of our luggage we had left in the old room and she said it would be sent up but nearly an hour later no sign so I called down and was told it will be there soon - it took another half an hour.  Still no tea making facilities of course but by now we were too tired to bother asking for this again!\nSo after this complete shambles of an arrival there began to be some positives.\nThe room itself was a decent size, had a very large, comfortable bed, a large TV with many channels, a fridge, two bottles of water, air-con and windows that opened a few inches.  It was also very nice and quiet and there was good WI-FI.\nThe bathroom only had a shower (no bath) but it was a good, large one and there were decent toiletries and plenty of towels. Both were clean and the room was well serviced every day.\nThere were no robe or slippers though which really is standard for a hotel claiming to be 5-star (we've stayed at a lot and in comparison this one is really a 4 star).\nThe residents fee included the WI-WI plus breakfast and the evening \"hours of indulgence\" with food and drink from 5-8pm.\nThe breakfast was very good with a decent selection of hot food (omelette or scrambled egg, sausages or bacon and sauteed potatoes), cold meats\/cheeses\/salmon, fresh fruits, yogurts, rolls, bagels, pastries and muffins plus waffles or pancakes and toast.  There were three types of fruit juice, cereals and a machine that would make tea or various types of coffee (a second machine was unfortunately not working).\nThe breakfast was served in the 23rd floor terrace which also had a small outside terrace area with nice views.  Although it was often quite busy we always managed to find a table.  Staff were very good with replenishing items and clearing plates away.\nThe evening offering (served in the same room) was also very good.  There was a \"theme\" each day (we had Mexican, Oriental, Italian and Mediterranean) and always featured a hot meat dish, a rice\/pasta dish, a vegetable dish, salads and smaller appetiser type dishes with the theme.  It was mostly very tasty and was enough to be an actual dinner if you didn't want to go out\/eat later.  Water\/soft drinks were available in the fridge and there was a selection of white\/red wines, prosecco or beer.  Once you'd been asked your choice the brilliant waiters brought it to you and then just came round topping you up which was great!  Some cakes\/muffins also appeared later on.\nThe room was available to guests all day to help themselves to more water, soft drinks, tea or coffee so not having tea facilities in the room wasn't really an issue until later in the evening as they were not available after 8pm as the staff were cleaning up then.\nOn the last day we checked out and the door staff (all very helpful and friendly the whole stay) quickly asked if they could store our bags until out flight.\nWe were given the bill and i checked to see if the first nights residence fee had been taken off as promised but it made no sense,  I queried it and was told it had been removed for one of us on all five days instead (which was very good of them but not sure if this was just a miscommunication error!) but the one charge that remained had increased from $49,99 to $59.99 a night!  However, I felt that overall they had been fair even though I did wonder if they just made the numbers up!\nSo overall a mixed affair.  Terrible start - reception staff were trying their best to be helpful but do need to be better trained to allocate rooms correctly and actually read, take note and respond to customers requests on email.\nBut the room (when we finally got it) was great, the breakfast and evening food\/drink were excellent (and worth the residence fee) and being quiet we slept very well.\nPlus the location is also extremely good (15 mins walk to Times Square\/10 mins to Central Park, subway entrance right outside the hotel and 2 blocks from subway to JFK airport).\nTherefore, we would probably return here if in NY again.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The daily breakfast is decent, what you would expect and the evening cocktail time was wonderful. The food served could easily be a full dinner and it was tasty. All of this is on the 23rd floor with a small outdoor terrace (as well as a full indoor space) that offers a great view. The staff were quick to clean things up and keep the food replenished. You can't beat the location. It is within easy walking distance of Broadway, Times Square, 5th Ave, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, the subway, and so much more -- there'e a Starbucks just steps away as well. The downsides -- other than breakfast and cocktail hour there is no food or drink to be found on the premises, none. There are stores nearby to pick up snacks, but it would be nice to have another option. Also, the $49.99 daily fee is a bit steep and adds up quickly, so take that into account when booking.

The only thing missing is an indoor swimming pool, but that's ok. Each morning the hotel offers complimentary breakfast. Visitors can also sit and eat on the terrace if it isn't too crowded.

That being said, they brand themselves as luxury, and the hotel as a whole failed to live up to that.  The check-in area is quite small and was cramped with two families of four along with my wife and I.  The lobby area is called \u201cthe den,\u201d but it is a waste of space that could have been used better and more efficiently.\n\nWhen we checked in, only one person was working the desk (approx 4pm) which caused the uncomfortable jam in that area.  With 10 people and luggage, it was difficult to even move.  Another person finally showed up, but by then the area had cleared. \n\nAnother layout oddity are the elevators.  With 25 floors, there are only 2 working elevators (even though other floors have 4 elevator bays).  It took over 5 minutes for an elevator to arrive at our floor.  What happened to the other 2 elevators bays in the lobby?  Are they unused behind a wall?  Very inefficient.\n\nThe hotel offers a happy hour type event in their terrace area.  Overall it was fine, but when more than 10-15 guests are in the small space, their happy hour is not worth the drinks and average food.  Yes, it is something the hotel offers, but if it wants to be a destination hotel, it needs to refine this.  We\u2019ve been to many Marriott lounges that offer the same type of event, and it is much better.  The same can be said of the breakfast experience.  The staff in \u201cthe terrace\u201d was attentive and friendly - another plus.\n\nThe most disappointing part of our stay was when we returned to the hotel at around 10:30 on Friday evening.  Not wanting a loud atmosphere, we decided to sit at the hotel bar and have a drink.  When we entered the hotel and walked toward the bar, a staff member physically moved in front of me to ask where we were going.  When we told her, she and a co-worker behind the check-in desk told us it was closed.  There was no signage or any other way for us to know, and the way in which they spoke and acted was very unprofessional.  If you have a hotel bar and it\u2019s not open on a Friday night, it speaks to the poor layout and planning.  (Yes, we did ask the next morning if the bar is ever open, and the front desk worker replied \u201cusually not.\u201d).  \n\nIf the WestHouse wants to put itself in the luxury category, it needs to reevaluate how it gets there and if it is truly attainable.  Until that time, you are better off staying at the Sheraton down the street.  Because 2.5 wasn\u2019t an option, we rated the WestHouse a 3 due to the high quality job the housekeeping and food service staff did during our stay.  If only the other employees lived up to that standard.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Was told no need as we will press sign you a lux king with a pull out couch. I offered to pay more and they said no need. Arrived and told that was not the case and not available. So left early and went to the newly renovated Westin Grand Central which is amazing and over $300 less per night with free breakfast as well. \n\nBonus is I wasn\u2019t charged the resort fee when checking out, thinking it\u2019s because of the issues. \n\nNote: even if it doesn\u2019t have a bar and restaurant. This property is connected to its sister property the Park Central with a door next to the elevators and its bar is excellent.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It is a large hotel with bad service and mediocre rooms. \n\nThe staff is unhelpful and argumentative, instead of finding  solutions they try to blame the low standards of the hotel on the client. It seems trivial, but there is no one to open the very heavy revolving door and help with luggage - not ok if you declare to be a 5* hotel. The rooms are dated and dirty, fingerprints on the mirrors and light switches, stains on the cushions, disgustingly dirty windows, we even found a dead fly on a table (it was there even after they \"cleaned\" the room on the second day). The \"city view\" is a joke - our windows looked at a wall and into other rooms. They still tried to say there's a partial view of 7th ave.. you see a corner of scaffolding if you stick your neck out. There is no amenities kit, just a soap bar and hand lotion. Nowhere to put your toothbrush. No kettle and coffe\/tea in the room. None of this would be cause of complaint if this was a 3* hotel but for a 5* at over 400USD a night it's a flat out scam. Apparently it's listed on airbnb as well..as no luxury hotel ever would. I don't understand how anyone would find this ok - if you stay in a 5*  you'll know this place isn't. As others commented they even have compulsory extra charges for wifi and breakfast to raise your bill further. \n\nI can also confirm the underwhelming breakfast in an overcrowded room, with soggy pastries, stale bagels, rotting strawberries, and disposable cups (imagine the environmental cost), boxed fruit juice (not fresh) and a disgusting instant coffee machine...no cutleries or table cloths, you have to set your own table, the staff clears the tables by throwing disehs in a huge trolley. \n\nNothing about  this is 5*.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The rooms needed to be adjoining and I was advised this was available for our dates. The rate was excellent and good value for location in New York. I stayed here a few years ago pre Covid with my husband and was impressed and decided to take family back as soon as we could travel again. The girl I booked with was extremely helpful and pleasant. \nThe good points are that the rooms remain clean and of a good standard. Bathrooms were good and well maintained, towels were plentiful, beds comfortable, bed linen good quality and water replenished in the rooms. On this occasion neither room had a view. But not the end of the world. Breakfast was good quality and you get plenty for the rate charged. \nSome negatives though and I have taken some time to consider this and try to be fair. \nOn check in I met Vanessa and although she started very pleasant when she informed me that there were no adjoining rooms and I questioned her stating that I had booked them and emailed the hotel twice to place a reminder, Vanessa\u2019s facade changed. She became abrasive and abrupt. Telling me that she would have to downgrade one of the rooms to give me the adjoining ones. I accepted this because the adjoining was more important. Once this had been resolved she was all sweetness and light again. But it really struck me and my family members who stood beside me during the exchange. Also they take an amount on your card per room per day of 150 dollars. While this isn\u2019t the biggest deal I wondered what for. There is no bar and no menu so room service would be extremely limited. Vanessa tried to put through the rooms on a number of transactions on my card causing it to be blocked by the bank. She again became quite abrupt stating I need to pay the remainder up front. To give an idea she ended up putting through 1200 gbp on one card and 1k on the other. When I checked out the final bill was 1500 and went through on one card and the remaining 1200 cleared from the other card a week later. This member of staff was impatient and rude but maybe I just got her in a very bad day.. I was struck that if you only had one card her haste and impatient actions could have ruined a holiday for a whole family. \nThis was a fortieth birthday celebration it was noted on the booking and the guest relations failed to leave as much as a strawberry in the room to acknowledge it. There are few staff on at breakfast I counted three at most and they worked incredibly hard as the room was rammed every morning. They do a great  job but seem quite unsupported. The remainder of the  staff were lovely. But this has really annoyed me since I left and I did email feedback but it was not acknowledged. \nOne other small point the terrace in the evening now serves only soft drinks tea and coffee. That is fine but it is cheap own brand soft drinks. Not quite good enough for a five star hotel. This area is poorly maintained in the evening and was a disgrace. There was no milk the first night and it was filthy the second one. I gave it a kiss the remainder of the stay. \nAll in all I\u2019m not sure I would go back. I booked it with the hotel taking previous advice. Not quite as good as it should have been. It is good value but it\u2019s not 5 star unfortunately.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

After one evening in a one star hotel that made me extremely uncomfortable I found this hotel. Let\u2019s talk about what they did right\u2026\nFirst, the customer experience was amazing. Vanessa made my check in super smooth and made me feel right at home. Vanessa and Nick helped me check out, going above and beyond all of my needs. \nSecond, the cleanliness was on point. No dust on any surface I could find throughout the room. Even the communal areas were impeccable. \nThird, the amenities. I didn\u2019t get to go to the gym because I was on a rest day, but it has a 24 hour \u201cfitness center\u201d on the third floor for anyone who wants to work out at 3am. On the 23rd floor there is a terrace where you can get breakfast, do some \u201cworking from home\u201d and enjoy a pretty cool view of the area. \nFinally, the details. You wouldn\u2019t know it but things like hand soap, the remote to the tv, ample lighting and electrical outlets are things some hotels either forget to put in the room or just don\u2019t have any available. Besides a dental kit (I only packed enough toothpaste Bites for 3 days, not my updated 5) they had everything I called down for. \nI cannot wait to come visit this hotel again! The only thing that would make it better would be a pool and on site wash-and-fold. Because people like me wear too many shirts in one day.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Not even a shower cap. No minibar. Nothing. If you're expecting comfort then go elsewhere. \n\nWhilst the rooms are clean, I can't say much more. ii) breakfasts - staff filling fruit directly from plastic punnets in front of you, jagged edges on sliced bagels - just smacks of laziness and a lack of attention to detail. \n\nJust a real shame as this hotel is, to give it its due, well located. But the real problem of this hotel is that they seem to have outsourced their customer service outside of the hotel - you call (e.g. for the aforementioned shower cap or as I did for an extra pillow) and either it takes an age (the shower cap...) or it never comes at all (the pillow....). \n\nOther occasions - you email or try to call the reservations line (I lost something in the hotel) and they don't even have the courtesy to reply to a number of emails. For a hotel where you pay this amount of money, it's a real disappointment. \n\nMany hotels in NYC care about their clientele - this one cares more about your money. Keep hold of your belongings, bring your own shower cap(!) and just expect a budget 5* and you'll be bang on. A disappointment.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Our booking here then was a delight.  This is a great hotel.  Modern and bright,  it's in a great location but far enough of the street to let you get a good night's sleep.  Our rooms were immaculate with a super comfy bed.  We asked for a quiet room when booking and it was blissfully quiet.  Staff are charming too. Nothing to fault here then... \nWell there is one tiny thing that should be taken on board.  The hotel charges $49 per person per night as a supplementary charge.  This isn't city tax. Rather it's a charge for breakfast and use of the club room on the 23rd floor open in the morning for buffet breakfast and from 5 till 8 at night.  In the evenings they have hot food and a selection of cheeses\/ breads etc plus beer prosecco and wine,  unlimited soft drinks and so on.  \n\nTo be honest we wouldn't have wanted this if it hadn't been included in the price when we booked as we eat out in the evenings.  And it's per person per night so for four of you,  it soon adds up.  And lots of people seemed unaware of the charge when they arrived so do check what you're left to pay.  That's not to say it's not value for money.  The foods fine and if drinks your thing,  it's unlimited.

You can walk to the theater district from this hotel as it is very conveniently located.  The complimentary breakfast was very good.  The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Now the problems.  First, we were met by a reprpesentative from Diamond Resorts who kept insisting that we attend an Owners' Update meeting.  That is code for a sales pitch to upsell on your time share. We refused, and then she brought out her manager to pressue us to attend.  This became borderline harassment and we just had to leave.  Also, the promised welcome basket never materialized.  Second, the room was tight and there wasn't much space.  There was no horizontal space in the bathroom.  No shelves or counter for personal items, such as a shaving kit.  There were no luggage racks to hold your suitcase.  Third, it was noisy.  Our room was right next to the housekeeping area and every time that door was opened and closed, our room  door rattled.  It sounded like someone was constantly knocking on our front door.  Also, there was someone screaming in the hallway, which is behavior one might normally find at a cheap chain motel.  Fourth, the shower door leaked.

Pics included.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-02-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":1,"text":"My husband and I were very excited to go to NYC for a Valentine's weekend getaway.  We specifically booked a king room and called ahead to let them know we'd be arriving around 9pm Friday so to hold our room. We arrive, and get in the long line in front of the front desk.  There seems to be a few issues as none of the people in front of us seemed happy or satisfied as they left the front desk. When it is our turn, we are told that \"we have been upgraded to a double queen\".  First off, the double queen is a cheaper nightly rate than the room we booked, so that is the opposite of an upgrade.  They wanted to downgrade us, still charge us the king rate, and pretend they were doing us a favor and \"upgrading us\". We point that out, and say we specifically booked a king room which is what we want.  What I resent the most is being treated like I'm an idiot.  Downgrading us to a double queen and calling it an upgrade is treating their customers like we are dumb.  An actual upgrade would have been to a suite, which any other hotel I've stayed in would have done had they made the mistake of giving away reserved rooms.  Eventually the front desk admits they ran out of king rooms and we ask to speak to a manager.  The woman at the front desk then proceeds to call the night manager Alex and complain about us on the phone right in front of us so we can hear! The night manager came out and offered to waive the nightly resort fee, which did not help at all since we still did not have to accomadations we actually booked. After he left, the woman at the front desk, said \"he's not even a real manager anyways\".  What kind of people are they hiring at this hotel that the front desk person, the face of the hotel, is saying this to people?? She was rude, unprofessional, and not a person you should have interacting with guests. \nOnce we got to the room, oh boy, it was gross. It was covered in a layer of dust, as if it hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in years. The blankets were stained, (pic is of a burn mark on the blanket) the lampshades ripped, and the nightstand had dried white gross goo that had dripped down the side (it was grosser than the pic shows).  If the room had ever been thoroughly cleaned, that wouldn't have been there.  It was clear the bathroom vanity had not been wiped down or cleaned before we checked in the room. (all the water spots, toothpaste\/other dried stains in the pictures).  And the faucets hadn't been cleaned in so long that parts were no longer silver, parts had actually tarnished to a dull black from lack of cleaning. If the room had ever been thoroughly cleaned, that wouldn't have been there.  I am attaching pictures, but believe me, these don't even do justice to how disgusting this room was.  Please avoid this hotel if you can!","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

THIS PROPERTY IS BOTH \n\nI have stayed here many times in the last five years.  The food has improved dramatically.  The best part about this hotel is the 23rd floor lounge. The lounge is super comfy and warm and the breakfast and evening spread of complimentary food is fantastic.  They obviously have someone new in F & B who has made remarkable changes.  If you don't go out to many restaurants in New York, this is the place to stay based on food alone.The servers in the lounge work tediously and fast to make sure that the food not only taste incredible, but looks gorgeous always, and is alway hot and fresh.\n  \nHousekeeping doesn't seem to have any management.  There are no standards, noR consistency, just a total lack of training and poor supervision.  The list of complaints is too long, but here are a few:\n\n-I was told on one stay that only suites have robes, when I stayed in a suite the next visit there was no robe. but the following visit in a standard room there was a robe.  What is the standard?\n\n-I was told I had to call each night for turndown  if I wanted it the duration of my stay.  I did and never received it.  I did however have a pile of chocolates deposited on my nightstand, seemingly done with contempt. I was told by the housekeeper that I was not on the VIP list so she couldn't turn my room down.  No standard\n\n-Never EVER the same amount of towels and washcloths.  Upon checkin once,  there was one wash cloth. \n\n-They put body lotion in the shower in place of conditioner. That was awful to get out of my hair. Is there a supervisor who double checks rooms?  \n\n-The room is never straightened up.  They only make the bed and clean the sink. \n\n-Front Office manager offered me compensation, which I said was not commensurate with my dissatisfaction, and he said \" I always start with 50% off .\"  I was depersonalized.  I was just his \"usual complaining customer who got the usual compensation.\"  There was so much more he could have done, even to drop a short apology note. Remember I have stayed here frequently.\n\n-I have stayed in 3 suites.  The last two times it turned out to be the same room, very very dark. NO BATHTUB even in a suite.\n\n-No rooms have an extra blanket in the closet.  I always have to call for one.\n\n-For the amount of times I have stayed here I was disappointed that they charged me an upgrade fee for a  suite.  First the front desk agent  said $100 a night and he couldn't do any better, then he dropped it to $90 a night.  Do the front desk agents get a percentage of rewards for charging for upgrade? Is there a standard?\n\n-Front desk employees are not empowered to do what it takes to satisfy the guest.   They have to consult with a manager before making any adjustments.\n\n-No doorman outside to open door and welcome guests ever.\n\n-Bellman just drops bags.  No introduction to room.\n\n-I received a card in my key packet for Chrome-cast on my television.  I was transferred three times when I called to find out how to use it.  The last transfer was to a voicemail.  Nobody knows how to use it.  Lack of training.\n\nFront Office manager seen hanging out at front desk with agents.  Does he not have work to do?  Or why doesn't he come around by door and greet guests?\n\nOh MY!!!  Wish I could go in and train these people.\n\nI continue to stay here because food is great deal, room decor is beautiful, hotel is very well maintained,(continues to show no wear and tear), the location is perfect for me, and I get a good rate through Magellan. But it is not a five star property as Small Luxury Hotels of the world boasts that it is. \n\nThe good news is that they have a new General Manager with an extensive background  in impressive hotels.  The improvement made to the lounge food is significant.  I hope he can do the same with Housekeeping and the Front Office.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

This time was quite problematic.  It started with arriving after 10 pm and having to wait 40 minutes for my room to be ready.  The next morning I found there was no hair dryer in the room and it took two calls and 30 minutes to get one.  Room quality here varies considerably (no SLH upgrade was given; they may have been full) and this time I got one with wholly inadequate lighting in the hall and bedroom - it was difficult to read or even see the contents of my luggage.  After an email and a request at the front desk to have someone check the bulbs were not acted on, I was able to get an additional small table lamp delivered my second night, but note that two of three bulbs in the hall light remained burned out throughout my 3-night stay.  Even during the day, the room was too dark, in part because of the dirty window and the scaffolding that is STILL up (for at least 7-8 months now).\n\nOn the plus side, I thought the breakfast selection and quality was good (although I am not a fan of paying for it through the mandatory additional fee - if it.\u2019s mandatory, it should be part of the listed room rate), and most of the staff was friendly and tried to be helpful.  The decor is pleasant, tho somewhat marred by the presence of cleaning supply and linens carts left in the halls 24\/7 - apparently when they remodeled they forgot to include housekeeping closets.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Road construction had my turn onto 55th blocked which meant I couldn't access the hotel from my direction on 7th.  When I contacted The Westhouse, Jason McGrath an Asst.

By control I mean he put me on hold and ran out into the street  to speak to the NYC traffic cop to find out my options and then he  directed me how to get across 7th and to the hotel.  There was another little snag but in the end it all worked out.  Once in the room I found a nice gift of wine and chocolate and a hand written card from Jason apologizing for the trouble - which was obviously not the Westhouse's fault.

Having paid $49 per person for our 5 night stay, we were extremely dissappointed to not be able to get into breakfast on two mornings due to a lack of available seats.

Really, in order to ensure all hotel guests get a chance to experience the food and drink, the hotel should issue dining tickets meaning that one ticket can be used to to get breakfast\/evening food and this must be presented when going to get the food. This will stop people abusing the buffet and wasting a lot of food. It will also free up seating so more guests can get in. People seem to use it as a communal area and sit on laptops and don't eat anything.\n\nDue to unavailability we had to eat outside the hotel which added a further expense to our holiday.

I had full cognition and chose a property that wasn't discounted with their specials, etc.  \n\nThis is all on me.\n\nI had no issues with the check-in process, and I have no issues with the staff whatsoever.  So, as far as the rest is about to unfold, the actual people I interacted with were nothing but pleasant.\n\nThe room I booked was a luxury king with the typical amenities at around 550 USD per night.  Upon arrival to the room, I had to rush to the climate control and correct the temperature as the ambient range was around 85F.  I quickly kicked on the unit and started unpacking for the week I planned to stay.\n\nI left shortly after to grab dinner in the city and begin my vacation.  I was out of the room for around 6 hours.  When I returned, thinking my early-addressing of the climate would resolve the stagnant hell it was before, I was pretty far from the reality.  The room remained around 84-85F, even having the system unit circulating air in the 300 square-foot unit for several hours.\n\nNaturally, I phone the concierge around 12am local time and ask what was up with the air in the room.  They were quick to reply that they kick the entire system off for the season.  Makes sense, but let's remember, 5-star facility.  Their solution was to have us open a window.  A window, by the way, that faced a brick atrium with scaffolding and maintenance ropes dangling about.  Not the best view for a 5-star facility.  \n\nTo sum up, the solution wasn't helping in the least.  There was no outside circulation of air due to the closed-off atrium that barely saw sunlight, much less a puff of air.  The remainder of the stay maintained around an 80F average, with the single window wide open 24 hours a day in a city that was around 45F outside.  \n\nMoving on, housekeeping.  I'm not one to demand a room be turned over every morning.  It's a personal preference to not have staff knocking on my door in the early morning, as I like to sleep in.  So, I wait a few days then crank over the sign.  I had to hunt down a housekeeper when I left in the morning to make sure they knew I was out and could turn the room.\n\nI was out for the entire day, forgetting about the room entirely, until I made my return.  When I arrived back, the room was...turned, in a sense, but in a more hilarious, half-assed way one would expect a child to do while trying to make the best mark for a parent's approval.  The bed was partially made, the pillows and accent blankets for the bed were mashed into a ball and stuffed into the chair next to the bedside.  50% of the pillows had the covers removed entirely.  Not sure what happened there.\n\nThe bathroom was hastily wiped down, and dirty towels discarded and replaced.  Haphazardly-folded and tossed under the sink. The bathroom tissue was not restocked and the shampoos and soaps were not replaced.  Not even sure the shower was looked at.\n\nI know whoever reading this is wondering where the actual issues are, but again, refer to the opening statements.  \"5-star\", \"luxury\", \"550 USD per night\".  These highlights of a place makes one think there is more to it than one I expected. \n\nTo compare a bit, I left this facility and continued my trip at The Plaza hotel, which is actually a luxury facility and it showed in every regard to what I was paying for the room.  We had a butler!  Come on, WestHouse.\n\nI don't want remuneration, or an apology from them, I just want people to understand where their money goes at this establishment.\n\nI recommend to anyone reading this, stay elsewhere.  If you're spending the cash, there are way better places that will spend it right.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

I booked through lastminute.com and by the looks of things on there it was a stunning, luxurious 5 star hotel. I was so excited to treat my mum to this luxury experience. It was NOTHING like the photos. We arrived in the taxi and thought we had arrived to a wrong location. The entire building was covered from bottom to top in scaffolding and you couldn\u2019t even read the WestHouse sign. The lobby was small and one thing about this hotel is that there is such poor lighting! The lobby was quiet and dark with no sense of Christmassy feel or ambience. No doorman or friendly service from anyone on front desk. They seem bored and are just doing the bare minimum. I was very disappointed with the severe lack of Christmas decorations as that was one of the reasons I booked the hotel! On the website and on their Instagram, they talk about all things festive and how they have \u201cdecked the halls\u201d however their idea of this is a 4 foot tree in the lobby and a couple of plain wreaths on the window behind the curtains. Very disappointed after I was so looking forward to staying here. The first thing the lady said on check in was \u201ccan I have your ID and credit card\u201d and then proceeded to demand $500 dollars for a \u201cresident fee\u201d! I had paid everything upfront before arrival so this was a complete shock to us. I didn\u2019t see this advertised anywhere during booking and thankfully the receptionist waived the fee but this was not a great start. We were also asked to pay $250 for incidentals (which we would get back at check out but are still yet to receive). We then went up to our room and it was barely 3 star at the most. The room was small and again really dark. Everything was old and chipped and all the fixtures were wonky. There is no room service, mini bar, robe or slippers and our \u201ccity view\u201d that we were promised was a literal brick wall! So disappointing. USB plugs and lamps don\u2019t work either. It was however clean so can\u2019t complain on that front. Breakfast was good with a good selection of fruit, continental and \u201chot\u201d food (which was not hot as there is no kitchen on site and the food is transported from a nearby hotel!). Also not enough seating for all the residents or room to move around and serve your food. No decorations in this part of the hotel either. This is not a 5 star hotel and I would not stay here again. The only good thing was the choice of fruit at breakfast. ","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

For that you get bottled water in the room and a nice breakfast and an afternoon Happy Hour with nice wines and light food. The only issue was that the USB ports didn\u2019t work. We called the Front Desk, but, as it was a weekend??, they couldn\u2019t get it fixed. I sent an email to Petr Jurecka, the hotel manager, and he responded promptly, even on Sunday night.

Ashley at the front desk made sure we had rooms with unobstructed views and upgraded our birthday girl to a junior suite.  There is a elaborate spread for breakfast, with multiple American and European choices, as well an an equally fabulous early evening wine spread.  Honestly, enough food to have light \"dinner\" before WALKING to the theater.  The lobby bar is cozy and one night had a small jazz group.  Not too loud either!  Only negatives, was the \"hipster hotel\" lighting that made the public areas kinda dark.  The hotel gym was under construction, so I had to go outside to a complimentary local gym. Most unsettling of all was the \"air freshener, scented candle\" aroma.  My room was overwhelmed by it, and it was evident in our other rooms, as were the hallways.  Scents always make me think \"what are they hiding?\"  Or is it some \"hipster hotel\" amenity?  Take it from me WestHouse...ITS NOT NECESSARY  Ethan, the manager, had my room detoxified.

The area seemed good, close to Central Park, close to TimeSquare, and other usual tourist sites.\nWe had a large room on 25th floor which we were able to go straight into at 9:30 am having just disembarked the cruise ship that morning, - a welcome surprise, which was added to when we were invited to enjoy a coffee and complimentary breakfast (not that it was needed!). Having settled in the room we returned to the lobby to make enquiries about the area as we had plans for visits to sites and restaurants and was given great advice by the resident concierge who provided us with a map, arranged tickets, sorted a 3 day bus pass, and river sightseeing trip. He was great. The lobby area also had a lounge bar area- more later. The 23rd floor had a club area which served as the breakfast area, and also the place for a very nice complimentary early supper with drinks. The breakfasts were good, a self service selection with hot options, cold options fruit & cereals and yet, probably brought in, as I was not aware of any adjacent kitchen area. We spent most days and evenings out doing the usual sightseeing and visits to theatre land, and restaurants etc, returning to the hotel mid to late evening and the lounge bar which on one night had a live music trio with some easy to listen background numbers.

The position of the Hotel, comfort of room ( apart from air con) and the majority of staff were all good.\n\nDo not pay for a room with a view. The hotel facade is currently under renovation and all you will see out of your window will be scaffolding encased in netting. Luckily we were made aware of this through Trip Advisor reviews prior to our stay, otherwise we would have been sorely disappointed on entering our room. No notification from the Hotel concerning these building works.\n\nThe \u2018residents fee\u2019 is a huge add on, over $50 per night per adult, this added over $500 to our already substantial bill for 5 nights. The breakfast is a fair selection of hot and cold foods, but be aware the Hotel has no kitchen of its own, so \u2018 hot dishes\u2019 are transported in, therefore they are never hot, only warm at best. The evening \u2018hot\u2019 dishes were limited and whilst there we only ever saw pasta. Free wine, beer and soft drinks between 5-7, but small cakes, which would be perfect to have with a cup of tea around 5, do not appear until 6pm, which was disappointing as that is just when we arrived back from a long day sightseeing. If you intend to have this food as your evening meal and not eat out, then the residency fee would probably be more palatable. \n\nThe dinning room becomes extremely crowded, we struggled to find a table at breakfast a couple of times.\n\nAir conditioning seems to be hit and miss, we definitely found it hard to keep the room cool, and this is when it was only around 15c outside.\n\n","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We arrived around midnight on a weeknight and took the last King room available. \n\nAfter our first night in our room, we decided that while we enjoyed the hotel, we didn't like our specific room for many reasons. We approached the managers the next day to discuss what our options were. Darren helped us out and gave us options within Park Central and over at WestHouse. He very patiently and politely walked us through each option, showed us a potential room we could move over to, and took the lead on handling the entire transition to the WestHouse the following day. I had booked through a third party, so there were a few extra steps involved, but with Darren's attentive help, things were handling very smoothly and seamlessly! He even offered us some great perks to help offset the annoyance of needing to re-pack\/check-out and check-in to the new room. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I were both thoroughly impressed with Darren's attitude and his management skills. We're both engineers by trade and try to do our best at our job every single day. When I see someone in the service industry doing the same, I am very impressed. I know that it can be a high stress, high anxiety job, so to see someone go above and beyond is a breath of fresh air. We had a great and time during the rest of our stay in NYC and walked away with a very memorable experience, thanks to Darren.\n\nI also wanted to add that WestHouse in general was a great experience, even beyond only the management. All of the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and I felt as though we were receiving personalized service during every minute of our stay. The Happy Hour that is included with the facilities\/resort fee was delightful, but what made it even more-so was the head waiter\/head of staff that worked there every night of our stay (this past week).

Flew into Newark, caught the train to Penn Station and then a cab to the hotel.  On arrival the property doesn't look very impressive at the moment as there is scaffolding covering the front facade, so I can't comment on its kerb appeal.  The reception area is relatively small, and a little dark for my taste but the staff were very welcoming and check-in processed quickly, with all hotel information provided.  We stayed on the 19th floor, which was well away from the street noise.  We did get a little noise from the elevators, and the air conditioning unit was audible but neither of these detracted from our experience.  The room was spacious by NYC standards, and the bathroom well appointed with good quality toiletries, and both were spotless.  There is a fridge in the room, and housekeeping provide complimentary bottled water every day.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  Housekeeping keep their trolleys in the corridors, obviously to maximize guest accommodations, which seems a little odd, but we didn't find it a problem.  The hotel is located between 7th Avenue and Broadway, less than 10 minutes walk in either direction to Central Park or Times Square, and very close to subway stops, so ideally located for a weekend break in the city.  The unique selling point of this hotel is the inclusive breakfast and 5-7pm \"indulgence\" on the 23rd floor.  An excellent breakfast with hot and cold buffet in the morning, and an equally excellent hot and cold buffet with complimentary wine and beers in the evening.  We had events to attend 2 evenings we were in the city and didn't really have time to go to a restaurant ahead of them after sightseeing during the day, and felt it would be too late to eat afterwards.  Problem solved by the hotel indulgence.  We really didn't feel the need to go out to dinner!  The lounge does become very busy both at breakfast and in the evening, but the staff are very helpful at making sure nobody waits long for a table and that buffet items are replenished quickly and often - and one pointed out to me that they have plans to expand the lounge in the near future.  Is this hotel perfect?  No - there is no room service available, there are no tea\/coffee making facilities in-room, and the hotel bar on the ground floor is very expensive, however it does deserve an excellent review due to its location, the quality of the accommodation, the inclusive food and drink on offer, and its welcoming and helpful staff.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

This stay in July we were celebrating our 12th wedding anniversary. We love the proximity to the theater district as we see at least one show each stay. This hotel truly has that \"boutique\" feel. The staff once again did a wonderful job with our room accommodations upgrading us to a king corner room with a terrace. Plenty of light. Unfortunately due to all the construction on the facade of the building, the terrace was inaccessible. Would have been a cool experience to have breakfast on our own terrace. The room was very comfortable & clean overall. We also were disappointed in not having access to the 23rd floor terrace as that too was under construction. This terrace is one of our major considerations when booking this hotel as the views are amazing & it just enhances our breakfast & evening fare experiences. Being a beautiful weekend in July really made us feel that much more let down. I really wished that the hotel would have had some sort of disclosure. \n\nNow, for what they get right consistently & have enhanced over the past 5 years is the breakfast & evening reception. The breakfast choices are plentiful with scrambled eggs, chicken sausage( not my favorite), bacon & plenty of pastries, bagels with spreads & fruit & yogurt. The service has also been enhanced with more attendants working during this time cleaning tables assisting with any requests. They do a great job maintaining it clean & full of food. This same consistency is extended to the evening fare between 5-7pm as that too has expanded with more hot food such as fettuccine alfredo, mixed veggies one night & seafood paella,  cauliflower in brown butter & a very nice beet salad as sides the next. Also lots of charcuterie. Cheeses were very good but the prosciutto was my favorite. Plenty of very good belgium & domestic beer & quality red & white wines. Again worth the value if you are able to take advantage of it.\n\nOh, they also offer soda, bottled water & different coffees throughout the day so u pop in & out of the 23rd floor lounge throughout the day to help yourself.\n\nAll in all for this time of year, with the deal we were able to get on the Westhouse website thru my email offer it once again a great experience. \n\nHopefully the construction will be completed soon because ultimately that was the only real glitch in the hotel. It was so substantial that it definitely diminished our enjoyment.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Having stayed in a few wonderful 5-star hotels, I have some basis for comparison. But on the merits (or lack thereof) of Westhouse alone, had I not had prior exposure to a REAL 5-star, I would still say that this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had in New York City where I go 3 times a year. I checked in late and like RGSOUNDF the AC thermostat in my room could not be adjusted. The room, like the weather, was hot and humid. I went to the desk and asked for someone to repair the AC thermostat. I waited in the bar, by now it was almost midnight, and was told the technician was in the room. He was not. I went back to the desk and the extremely rude young woman at reception practically yelled at me before moving me to an \"upgraded\" room, or so she said, which did have a functioning AC. But this was no 5-star room. It was dark. It looked into a dark shaft that was surrounded by high walls on all sides so NO view and no direct light. The room was a nothingburger. The bathroom was spacious but there is no shower curtain so the marble floors are like an ice rink when you step out of the shower. Beware of slipping! The towel rack came off in my hand. The Terrace was also a vast disappointment. Like the rude reception clerk there were rude waiters in the breakfast room. The Terrace itself is covered in scaffolding so it cannot be used. So there was no view or light on one side and on the other the same dark shaft I saw from my room. The offerings were comparable to a breakfast buffet at a 3-star chain hotel. The \"cocktail\" hour was also a disappointment. There was a pasta dish and some cheese and free wine but this was not a noteworthy spread. Waiters still as rude as at breakfast. I want to go back to the reception desk experience because I have never been spoken to in that tone or in that way by a hotel employee. She came on at 11 pm on July 24th so the hotel can check on who this employee is. She needs some serious retraining. The Westhouse website describes the hotel in these terms \"incomparable design and elegant style\", \"finest luxury bedrooms in NY\", \"captivating views of the city\", unrivaled among luxury hotels in NY\", \"natural light floods interior space\", \"most exclusive roof deck terrace in NYC\", and so on. All lies. The corker on the website is this one, and although this is not an Onion article but it is worthy of satire \"chic art deco design is enhanced with a signature scent by ambient specialist 12.29.\" You cannot make this stuff up. Finally they wanted to charge me $49 for the breakfast and cocktail hour of the day I arrived. I arrived at 11pm so I was supposed to pay for amenities that I could not have enjoyed without time travel. The rude receptionist \"waived\" this fee - so very gracious of her.

As a result, H\u00f4tel Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e NYC is 5 stars, The Surrey Hotel (Relais & Ch\u00e2teaux) is 5 stars, Mr. C Seaport (Leading Hotels of the World) is 5 stars, and so is Peninsula, The Pierre, etc. And then you have Westhouse...\nWith batteries of housekeeping carts (noted by other reviewers) lined up, one after another, in the hallways, with outdated HVAC systems, loud and noisy, with AC thermostat that can't be adjusted (from 72 degrees, pre-set by the hotel, we set it up to 80, and upon coming back to our room 6 hours later, discovered that the room was freezing cold, our thermostat setting won't change the effectual temperature). And then, there is no turndown service, in a \"5-star\" hotel. And then, there are no electrical outlets next to bed; in the day and age of smartphones, the need to charge your devices on the desk is a major inconvenience. And then, the entire facade of the hotel (including one of the windows, in our corner room) is barred by scaffolding. Sure, renovations happen, but an honest practice in the industry mandates that a hotel makes an appropriate mention, a disclosure-type. Nothing, in the case of WestHouse.\nAnd then, there was a clump of hair, apparently left from the previous guests, on the floor, by the bathroom. \nThe room itself, its design, upkeep, the view, the furnishings, were quite average. The bathroom was arguably the tiniest among dozens and dozens of Manhattan hotels we have stayed at. \nBut then, there was a free breakfast. Not so much free, considering the so-called \"residency fee\" of 90-plus dollars which entitles a guest to a free breakfast, use of the hotel's fitness center, etc. The breakfast was as mediocre as it can only get; it is a breakfast buffet (scrambled eggs, blackened bacon, chicken sausage, hard-boiled eggs, breakfast potatoes, bagels and danishes), which is very often the case even with the \"real\" 5-star hotels, but WestHouse takes it a step down; you are supposed to make your own coffee, from a coffee machine at that (yes, you heard that right, not a coffee maker but a machine you see in hospital or school cafeterias). The breakfast self-service area is very narrow and cramped, resulting in unpleasant crowding. The name of the breakfast facility, \"The Terrace\" is as misleading as the 5-star rating, for there is nothing there of the terrace, except the top floor location. \nThe room mini-bar is nonexistent either. \nAnother major inconvenience: no overhead lighting; 2 bedside lamps and 2 desk lamps is all you get. \nSeveral elevators, even though sufficient in number, can't handle the guests volume adequately; there was a wait every time we used them. \nA nice touch was a text we received right after checking in, from the hotel staff, asking if we needed anything. We texted right back saying one of our magnetic keys wouldn't work. Everlasting silence followed. \nThe well-known dictum \"you get what you pay for\" wouldn't be the case, for our corner room ran us over $480. This is the price for a premium room in Dominick SoHo or Beakman, a different universe from WestHouse, so the monetary gain or budget-friendly aspect are nonexistent either. \nEvery discerning traveller or those who have plans to stay in an upscale property in Manhattan, shall better look elsewhere to avoid disappointment.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The price seemed to be fair, too, especially as we received a nice discount cupon. We didn't check the fine print, so the actual final rate we had to pay was about 30% higher than advertised. This hotel has a special pricing system: on top of basic hotel services (e.g., bed, linens, bathroom, cleaning, desk services) it charges extra (besides the \"rate) for other services, either you use them or not... So breakfast is obvious, but charging for a gym (even if you don't use it)? for concierge services (even if you don't use them)? We have to thank them for not charging for NYC view, or do they charge for it?\nIn summary, our frustration is great, so we couldn't appreciate other aspects of this hotel.

The hosts were working hard, pouring wine for guests and keeping the food well-stocked. Much finer experience than other places we\u2019ve stayed because it was actually enough for dinner: vegetable ravioli, roasted cauliflower, tomato\/mozzarella salad, charcuterie board and rolls, plus beer and wine. Seating was plentiful and very nice atmosphere. Breakfast was just as good: eggs, sausage, bacon, homefries, cereals, and plenty of pastries, from croissants to bagels. Room very comfortable, from bedding to a\/c control to bathroom. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others. We were very lucky to use points from Southwest for our stay; only thing not covered was $50 resort fee for me (no charge for kids) and valet.

And our son was getting married in the NY area so we chose WestHouse Hotel as our base of operation.  The bell and front desk staffs were always very welcoming during our comings and goings. The suites we stayed in were spacious and well decorated.  During our June stay, the friendly bellman heard us discussing NJ and talked to us about his choice to live there.  When we returned after the weekend we were welcomed warmly back.  \n\nAlthough it is located in northern midtown it is so simple to get to UES via Q (Second Avenue subway) and only a few blocks walk to Central Park where I used to run regularly (and the community still does), to say nothing of all the sites and park locales.  During the first part of our trip we saw the Cher Show in the nearby theater district, on Pride weekend - it was close by and fabulous! During the second part of the trip we had opportunity to see more sites downtown and in Tribeca, also very simple subway access without Tax or Uber hustle required.\n\nThe breakfast and evening light bite amenity are appropriate to the need in visiting New York: Many choices for hours in the morning and a few choices plus wine in the evening to either be your meal or tide you over til your next meal.  Both times we stayed in suites which in one case had a sleeper sofa and the other a private desk alcove.

No duvet cover just sheets either side of the duvet, which became especially irritating. No vegetarian choices for dinner on occasions in the 'happy hour' service. No slippers or gowns as you would expect as standard in a five star hotel and especially as one of the \"Small Luxury Hotels of the World\" - worn and a bit tatty in general.\nHowever, the hotel is positioned conveniently close to a Subway station and within walking distance of Times Square and Central Park and the beds were comfy!\nThe 'Bell Boys' were especially nice as were the waiters, although the maids we encountered were standoffish and rude. Unfortunately scaffolding was up at the front of the hotel during our stay which we were not informed about when we booked and it ruined any view we might have had.\nThere is a great bar just across the street and a half decent deli as well.\nThis hotel was basically clean and comfy enough for a short stay just not worthy of the money we paid or 5 stars!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We did not feel our stay lived up to that. \n\nThe GOOD: \nIt was very quiet, and everyone with whom we dealt was pleasant. To assure reduced city noise, we requested a \"courtyard\" view which we knew would be an air shaft, but it was a very large and nice air shaft, and on the 25th floor, just 1 floor below the sky. We didn't hear other guests when they were in their rooms. Our room was tastefully furnished and the drawers of the dresser were very clean. \n\nThe BAD: \nOur king size bed was actually on a queen frame (no box spring) so it was rather uncomfortable. I was pretty amazed when I noticed this in the morning after sleeping on it. That explains all the bedding coming untucked from the sides overnight...\nThe bathroom was really tiny. 5'x5' with a 2'x2.5' alcove for the sink. As the door opened into the bathroom, you had to either open the door fully while pressing back against the toilet or scrunch into the alcove with the sink to get the door by you. \nThe LED lights in the bathroom flickered (except the one over the sink). The flickering gave both my wife and me headaches.\nThere was no full-length mirror in the room. The one mirror that could have worked had a little unusable shelf-like projection at the bottom, which blocked the view of my ankles and feet. \nThere were no bathrobes in the room. Although I realize this is somewhat of an extravagance, the hotel had been promoted as \"luxury\" so we expected that. \nProbably not the hotel's fault but we expected a higher class of people than the inebriated (sounding) people talking loudly and for quite a while beginning at 2;30 AM right outside our door.\nFinally: valet parking--they should warn guests it will be approximately 25 minutes to retrieve their car, so the guests can plan appropriately.\n\nAnd one complaint against many NYC hotels - they tout \"free\" breakfast and cocktail hours but charge a mandatory $49\/person\/day to cover that. Please just add that to the room fee to accurately list the room price.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They graciously accommodated me with an early check in- and my room was a perfect corner city view. The lighting was great because of the windows; and in the evening, the lights in the room were bright where there were mirrors. The bed and pillows I found super comfortable. The room will probably need updating soon. There's some signs of wear and tear now-but I liked the decor and it was a huge space where I could do morning stretches and sort thru my luggage. I consider this more of a 4-4.5 star hotel. It would be even nicer if they provided robes and had room service. I read other reviews referencing the daily $49 resort fees-so this wasn't a surprise to me when I was billed at the end of the stay. It was actually perfect for me because as a solo traveler, I was able to grab breakfast from the buffet at the Terrace dining room and it was a wonderful assortment. The crowd was definitely mixed with families, couples, and adult groups. I worked from the hotel room-where the free wifi worked without any problems. All water bottles were complimentary.  Then there was happy hour 5-7pm with wine, beer, champagne and food, cheeses\/meats, dessert- the whole spread felt more like dinner. It was fabulous having the happy hour and easy for me to get back to my room to get ready for my shows. I didn't get a chance to check out The Den bar near the lobby. The hotel location was superb within 1-4 blocks of the theater shows I was attending. I felt completely safe. Central Park was a short walk-and I rode the subway to get to the Met Museum.

First of all the price was right!  Our room, however, was very small and we asked for an upgrade.  We got one for a bit of a price raise, but the room was a suite and absolutely fabulous.  Living room, couch, tv, dining room table--very roomy.  View of 7th Avenue looking down to Times Square.  They did have scaffolding around the building and you could not go out to the deck, but that was minor.\n\nFront desk service was fabulous.  Starting with arranging for a room change.  The front desk person Ashley was amazing, highly professional, and did everything with a very big smile.  So were Aleksandra and Moe.  \n\nThe concierge service was outstanding! Ben and Shawn made many arrangements for restaurants and visitor sites.  The best restaurants that we would not have know about were River Park and Milos (a very short walk from the hotel.)  Milos was the best Greek restaurant we every ate at!  Every time we went out we got advise on whether to take a taxi or the subway.  If we walked, we got excellent directions.  They made us feel so comfortable and nothing was too much to take time to speak to us and advise.\n\nThe hotel is close to everything!  The subway is about 15 steps away and they encouraged us to take it, even though I was hesitant.  We used it and loved it.  We felt like real New Yorkers!  We easily walked back to the hotel from the Theater District and even farther away areas like the Lower Eastside.  So many great restaurants close by.  Great neighborhood in Midtown--clean and safe.\n\nThe complimentary daily breakfast was a real plus and delicious.  Lattes and cappuccinos were available!  Never attended the complimentary afternoon appetizer and drink event but heard it was lovely.\n\nThe beds were super comfortable with wonderfully soft sheets.\n\nMaid service was excellent.\n\nIt is not the fanciest  or updated of hotels, but very clean, fabulous service and so centrally located.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

If you are in one of the hot rooms, like we were, even with the heat turned off you might just bake.

I certainly accept local city-taxes but at the check-in counter they asked friendly but strict for another 53,35 $ per person and night for a mantatory resident-fee. So another 320 bucks for 3 night\u00b4s. After a serious discussion I could negotiate and cutt off 50%, still had 160 bucks to pay extra, which is simply not correct and made my arrival not that good. After all I got an upgrade from queen to king. Besides  that the hotel was really great and it is a strong suggestion. Next to times-square, metro, bars, restaurants, central garden, etc., it is just a perfect coice and the service is really good. \nAfter check-out I wanted to call myself a cab to the airport but the door-man asked what I need and than he was extremely pushing and just called a cab for us. Instead of usually 70-90 bucks for the tranfer to Newark (took just 45 minutes at 3 p.m.) we paid 115, probable 20 bucks for the door-man included :) All together it\u00b4s a nice, clean and great located place just be careful with extras and fees than it works out perfectly! The staff was nice as well, big thanks! Yes, next time I book at the WestHouse Hotel directly all inclusive ;-) without discussion and than it\u00b4s a  5 star rating.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I came to the Westhouse hotel in celebration for my 21st birthday. My boyfriend at the time used to live in New York and we knew it'd be the perfect place to be for this pivotal moment. We had visited New York before and stayed in the Jane hotel. I was Curious as to why it *felt* we had decided to stay in a much nicer hotel this go round (to my surprise he later during this trip proposed.) And as a congratulatory gift from his mother she rented us this hotel room.\n\nOn arrival I used my card for a (refundable) $500 downpayment for incidentals. After a seemingly decent trip I returned and was never refunded the downpayment knowing full well we left the room in immaculate shape. When calling to see why I had never received a refund I was sent to department after department and wasted 30 minutes on the phone. I did this about 5 times. At this point it was nearing Christmas and not only did I not receive a refund I couldn't even get anyone on the phone to understand why I was being charged.\n\nAbout a month later I finally am able to get Juan Vargas the general manager of the hotel on the phone (after badgering a seemingly innocent concierge.) And I am told that this was NOT my downpayment, but the residence fee. He goes on to tell me it is made visible on the booking website, and after explaining that I am not the one who booked this room and that it was a gift and that I was never made aware of such fee that I was only told I would be charged for incidentals, he went on to tell me there was nothing he could do. \n\nFast forward to months later and hours upon hours spent on the phone with my bank. I look back on this stay (what should've been a magical time in my life) as nothing but a nightmare.\n\nIn addition the luxury items they boast about online are A LIE! Upon arrival there toiletries were nothing more than your standard inexpensive shampoo and conditioner, and the \"luxurious\" brand named heat appliances for your hair are LITERALLY CONAIR!! My straightener is better at home.\n\nAlso the residence fee for this \"Continental breakfast and cocktail hour\" is food straight out of a bag, and dried out, luke warm chafers full of average at best dishes. Oh! And don't forget the cheap champagne. So if you want to be spending $100 bucks night for halfway decent food when you can go ANYWHERE else in NY for better quality, AND you intend on being there to take full advantage every night than go right ahead, but I can say from experience you WILL be disappointed.\n\nLastly there is no restaurant and the bar is almost never open, the rooms are TINY and we faced a concrete wall. There are plenty of better hotels in regard to service, location, and size. \n\nIn conclusion. if you want to spend a good amount of money for hidden fees, and a headache than this is the spot for you!","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We had two rooms and both were SO HOT. Neither rooms slept well. Open windows did not help. When we complained we were told the AC had not been switched over yet but they were working on it. We stayed 3 nights, and never got AC. We also asked for fans and none were ever delivered. When we checked out, they did take off some of the resort fees. So, they did make up for it, but really, a hotel of that size should be able to accommodate the changing of the seasons.

Great breakfast but limited in choice if you\u2019re a fussy eater. Its America! Its cooked very well & you can eat as much as you want. Scrambled eggs & bagels were very tasty. Really good choice of beverages throughout the day. Paid residency with evening complimentary food & drinks (happy 2 hours) was amazing. Only one choice of meal plus cheeses, grapes & bread.

Breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, a bottle of water, a cocktail - you will pay more for these things in NYC than just about anywhere else in the world. Therefore, when a hotel offers a big breakfast (eggs, meats, potatoes, pastries, bagels, oatmeal, cereal, the works!) every morning, and a happy hour spread each night that includes gourmet salads, hot pasta dishes, cheeses, beer, wine, and champagne, and all of that is included (along with free wifi, access to a full gym, bottled water in your room, etc.) for a $49 per person\/per night fee (on top of the regular room rate) it is more than worth it. \n\nThis hotel is steps from Broadway and Times Square. It's cute and quiet, with a cozy decor and spacious rooms. The lobby is small and intimate, with a nice-looking bar off of it. The rooms are larger than most in NYC, with nice bath amenities and bottled water. Very clean and nicely appointed. \n\nThe real show-stopper is the aforementioned food - up on the 23rd floor Terrace. It's almost a shame because the food is so good here, you really could skip dinner but there are so many good places to eat in NYC, that you don't want to fully partake. My plan for next time is to have a 10 pm dinner reservation and enjoy a pre-dinner here at 5. \n\nThere are so many hotel options in NYC but I keep coming back to the WestHouse because it is a great value without feeling like a \"value\" hotel in the least.

Let me begin by saying that I have stayed at several hotels throughout the city so I had already prioritized what was important to me on this stay.  I chose the Westhouse due to reviews on their customer service, bed comfort, and high speed internet in the room.  I arrived around 7:45pm on a Sunday evening for check-in and from the moment I walked in the service was outstanding!  The hosts at the first desk were so accommodating and helpful.  Getting me settled and meeting my needs was a priority for them.  I booked directly through the hotel website which had offered a room upgrade and I was able to get a king size room.  When they rebooked my room, I was put in an accessible room which I did not want.  One of the front desk host took me around and showed me a few different rooms so I could choose a new room.  I took room 2301 which has a great view of the Empire State Buildong and happens to be down the hall from the Terrace where breakfast and happy hour are served.  If you are on business and want to make everything quick and easy, this is the room for you. Things that I noticed but are not deal breakers for me are no extra counter space in the bathroom, cabinet in the closet makes it tight for anything that hangs long and the housekeeping department is hit or miss with towels.  However, with all that being said, the breakfast And the happy hour are nice amd a nice way to compensate for the resort fee (don\u2019t be surprised by this as you pay it at any of the NYC hotels). There was a jazz band in the downstairs bar one evening and it was great to sit there and have a glass of wine and finish some computer work.  There is a Starbucks on the next block and a subway station as well.  You are a quick walk to Columbus Circle and Central Park if you want to go for a evening walk.

Our premium king room was clean and comfortable.  However, the layout of the room on this occassion was ridicoulus, the bathroom was the size of a matchbox. We have stayed at many hotels in the USA and this was by far the smallest bathroom we had ever encountered, very impactical.  Housekeeping was very average the only day the room was fully serviced was the day we checked in,  which was very dissappointing.  From the second day onwards we were continually short towels, no drinking classes, toiletries, i.e. shower, body wash not replenished. The final straw for this hotel was when we requested two glasses and ice to be sent to the room at 10.59pm after returning back from an evening out.....nothing, however a knock on the door at 7.51am the following day we were presented with 2 toothbrushes??? which they said were ordered at 10.59 the night before, seriously they need to get there act together!  \nI also think a 'Small Luxury Hotel'  should not be leaving their room service carts in the passage way all day and night, it really is not a good look.

The Westhouse hotel however fully disclose these fees on their website so we knew exactly what we were getting into. $47 (excluding city tax etc) per person, per night seemed quite steep at first however this allowed us to have breakfast at the hotel every morning (which was always absolutely delicious and really set us up for the long days) and take part in the hours of indulgence between 5-7 were they serve alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks together with a light evening meal for those opting not to venue out for dinner.

All hotels in NYC carry some \"resort fee\" now, so it's best to get a hotel where you get something for that fee (aka obligatory tax). And The WestHouse delivers.

The lobby was quaint and inviting and the staff (Christian, Juan, Tristan, Winston, Jesey, Hamza and Courtney) were exceptionally welcoming, accommodating, and extremely helpful for all of our guests.

Looking at previous reviews this seems to be the norm.\n\nFortunately the front desk staff were far more friendly and helpful. \n\nOur room was large for NYC standards and all the fixtures and fittings seemed fresh and well maintained. The bed and bedding was extremely comfortable and the bathroom amenities were high quality. It's worth noting however that there is no minibar, no room service and no turndown. \n\nThe breakfast buffet was good but not of a 5* standard and it starts to feel repetitive after a few days. The lounge staff were very friendly but they seemed overworked and tables took a while to be cleared at busy times. \n\nWe later had an issue with housekeeping who refused to collect laundry from the room because it was after 4pm and they had nowhere to store the clothing. Not something that should be an issue at a large, luxury hotel.\n\nAdmittedly WestHouse is better value than a lot of high end properties in the city but you'll be sacrificing a number of perks and the sort of proactive, can-do service you'd expect.","travelDate":"2018-11","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They also offered unlimited bottled water, coke, sprite and Diet Coke in glass bottles. Keep in mind that this is offered till 8 pm. They also have a happy hour from 5 pm to 7 pm. The breakfast was pretty good, but the room was crowded and I ended up standing for the most part. I haven't stood up and ate\/drank since I was bar\/club hopping in my younger years. The staff was good, but most of the guests are from Australia, Russia, UK, and other parts of Europe. An Australian guest said something racially insensitive to his kids about Asians and South Americans while I was there, but that isn't a ding on the hotel, but on his disgusting self. Overall, the breakfast was not ideal when you consider the crowd. I would have been better off at a Residence Inn or a Hampton, but I wanted to experience this 5 star hotel, and glad I did. If I was on another business trip, I would stay here again. If I was on my own dime, probably not for the $54 \"resident fee\".\n\nA week later, I received another charge on my credit card for $158.69. After calling the hotel's billing department and leaving them multiple voicemails, I finally received an email back telling me that they have reversed the charge. No apology or reason as to why the error was made. I had booked via Orbitz. While I was checking out at the hotel, another resident was agitated as the hotel had billed him roughly $1,600 after he had already paid via Expedia. This being the case, I would suggest checking your credit card bill after you pay via a 3rd party website. Most of the residents at this hotel are from Europe and Australia, and I am thinking this hotel takes the opportunity to \"confuse\" them with these sneaky additional charges.

The second day they moved me and the room was nice. Only twice did I call downstairs to ask for something to be brought to my room. The first after 40 minutes I had to go down myself to fetch it and the second it took over an hour and three phone calls for them to bring it up to my room. My return flight is only 9pm so I asked if any rooms are free to use one for an hour late afternoon to shower or if the fitness area has a shower which it does not (which is very odd for a 5 star hotel!) and they said I can use a room for an hour for a full nights fee.

We were in town for the Yankee game and he personally walked us to the easiest subway station while giving a little history tour along the way.  That was above and beyond standard concierge duties and so very much appreciated.\n\nThe location is absolutely perfect for seeing the sights in Manhattan. Times Square, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue, Theater District and Central Park are all an easy 5-10 minute walk.  Any kind of food or drink are a stones throw away.  Subway stations are very close and busy Columbus Circle is within a 5 minute walk.    \n\nI will comment on the daily residence fee. They are very transparent about the fee so we weren't at all surprised.  And even with the fee, the rate is not overpriced.  I'm just not sure why they don't add it to the nightly rate and save us the extra calculation.

The room descriptions looked very good, with up-market decor, a nice walk-in glass shower and \"Luxury King\" listed as the least costly room. The room pictured included a desk and chair, two windows, nightstands adjacent to the bed, a nice side chair with accompanying small table and is listed as \"approximately 295 square feet\". You might imagine my surprise after checking into my luxury king at 1 AM to find no desk, no nightstands, no side chair or accompanying small table, all luxuriously located on the smallest corridor I've ever seen in a hotel anywhere in the world. The corridor outside the room was literally just 3 feet wide! Breakfast was a required included feature, yet other than two kinds of batch-prepared eggs, was an only slightly upgraded version of what one can expect in a Hilton Garden Inn. To be fair, the staff was quite nice, yet when I asked why the room had no desk (I hate using a laptop whilst sitting on the bed - the sole seating device in the not-even-close to 295 square foot chamber), the individual manning the desk offered another room, but said I'd have to pack my things and move as if it was my fault I'd been given the wrong room. I've had far better service offers from big chain hotels like Hilton when a room proved unsatisfactory. Now it's possible that there are some \"luxury kings\" of the size described, but the room map appeared to contain the same very narrow and long room repeated throughout the floor, with the odd suite mixed in. To top it off, the hotel occupies floors 19 - 25 of the dilapidated old queen which now apparently forms three \"boutique\" hotels and is served by just two nicely decorated, but decidedly old elevators. I did very much like the generous bath, the well-appointed shower and the intimate lobby, all of which were finished beautifully. I've had far more functional rooms in hotels which are decidedly three-star by comparison.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The icing on this cake is the hotels' hosted complimentary breakfast and late afternoon light meals and beverages served in the top floor suite with outdoor balcony to take in the NY skyline. All for very reasonable rates. This is the type of hotel that people usually keep a secret. In fact it's so fantastic my only concern is that they'll be booked the next time I want to stay with them! Enjoy a real, exceptional hotel experience - stay at the West House.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

My dad had booked a hotel (Westhouse) for me from India. He said that he will take care of the hotel bill. In short, he didn\u2019t want me to spend money on the hotel as this was his treat. \n\nI was going to see a friend in New York. So, we called the hotel to ask if they charge extra fees for the guest. They said that she can stay with me and they won\u2019t charge anything. They had added a breakfast in my hotel bill which was a compulsion and we both had to pay $40 per day.\n\nNow, when she reached there they took her card for the hold which is understandable. She confirmed with them twice if they are gonna charge anything from her card. They assured her that they won\u2019t. I arrived late at around 11 pm. I went straight to the reception to confirm with them about the card they had kept for the hold. The receptionist said that they will not charge anything from that card. Everything has been paid already.\nThen we stayed there for two days. Rooms were good. View was good too. Breakfast for which they charge $40 was nothing like $40. It was something that I would get in Vagabond inn. \n\nAfter we checked out, my friend informed me that she was charged $120!! The hotel staff said that this was mandatory fees and they already had done a favor by not charging her the guest fees. I am okay with paying the resort fees. But it shouldn\u2019t come with a lie. I would have happily given them my credit card if they were going to charge anything from her card. I felt so stupid. Even after paying a huge amount my friend was charged with $120 which I don\u2019t think is a small amount. This was not what I had expected from the hotel with this standard. I really felt stupid in front of my friend.\n\nDear Westhouse New York,\n\nIf you want to charge your guests, just let them know. Don\u2019t lie to them or give them surprises\/shocks after they leave your hotel. We would have happily let you charge the resort fees but you lied which I think is kind of a verbal fraud!","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

My husband was asked to fill in a registration form but it was so dark we could hardly see. We were told there was no room service and no restaurant but a compulsory fee would be charged for the terrace level on floor 22 where they served a breakfast buffet and a 2 hour evening slot when they served a buffet of  light snacks and drinks.The breakfast, juice,  coffee and pastries were fine but the scrambled eggs were pure rubber and inedible. The 2 hour slot in the evening was just not worth attending. The hot food was of poor quality, the setting  resembles a  cafeteria.\nOur room 2120 was so small and so dark that I did not know how I could stay here.It had one narrow window which looked out onto a brick wall. The lighting in the bedroom consisted of 2 bedside wall lights each had 2 switches, one could choose 1 candle light or 2 candle lights. one of the light switches was broken so we stumbled  around in the dark, unable to read or see to unpack.\nThe bathroom was so small that it was a closet. The shower measured 48 X 48 inches\nthe washbasin was just a washbasin 32 inches wide, with no place to lay out toiletries.\nMultiple trips from the bathroom to my suitcase to collect the various toiletries required to start and finish the day.\nBy Saturday night I was in despair and wishing I could develop sonar navigation to get around in this hellhole. All the doors had been so badly fitted with new hinges that none of them closed properly. The carts containing supplies for room cleaning were left in the corridor permanently. they were never removed to a service area.\nThere was no toilet brush in the bathroom and no extractor fan.\nThere was one wastebasket in the bathroom but no wastebasket in the bedroom at the desk area.\nThe bar area adjacent to the lobby was completely empty for the duration of our stay. The lighting in this hotel is  so dark that a bat would have difficulty negotiating its way around, it was  soul less, lifeless, unfriendly staff,   depressing and deserted.

We decided to stay here due to the extras that the hotel provides and the proximity to Central Park, 7th Ave Subway and 5th Ave shopping all being very close by. \n\nIt is customary for many Hotels in NYC to charge a residency and city tax on top of your room rate and is done due to governing forces - however the Westhouse actually gives back to their guests by offering daily breakfast, an evening meal with wine, beer or bubbles and offers wifi, telephone calls and bottled water all as part of the enforced taxes. Many hotels do not offer any of these extras but still enforce the tax.\n\nWe also found the price for a suite was very impressive. Having searched through many websites looking for a good hotel, the Westhouse suite was by far the best offer we came across coming in at the same price as many standard queen rooms offered by other hotels.\n\nOur suite, on the 22nd floor consisted of a seperate lounge and dressing area, a full size wardrobe, 2 tv's, kingsize bedroom and a bathroom all well decorated and well appointed. The bed and pillows being extremely comfortable and the room very quiet. We were glad to be on the 22nd floor as we did not experience any traffic noise, just the distant ever present hum and car horns that one may expect in the city that never sleeps. \n\nConcierge was very helpful suppling us with maps, tips and hints about what NY has to offer the first timer.\n\nThe rooms are serviced daily and a turn down service is offered.\n\nAll the staff are friendly and welcoming and do their best to make sure that your stay is one to remember.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I read the towels were in bad state, it was not the case, I read you could hear everything happening outside the room wherever they changed you to, I didn\u2019t experience this.

They wrote that the breakfast buffet wasn\u2019t good enough because it didn\u2019t have many options, well I think it has what most people have and it\u2019s just fine. People also complained about the personnel for not being kind enough but Vanessa at the reception was really nice, cleaning personnel, people at the restaurant, concierge, everyone helpful and caring. The only thing I\u2019d put an asterisk on is that once you are there, they will tell you about an extra of 50 per day per person for the breakfast and drinks at the hotel terrace, this is not optional so have it in mind when booking because it\u2019s on the small letters (still worth it).

There is an extra charge per adult each night for the breakfast and evening food service which might be overlooked when booking so pay attention. It was just under $50 USD each, per night, when we went in August. The quality of food is good but the selection is limited and breakfast had no rotation, so if you stay more then a couple days you\u2019ll be sick of the food. There\u2019s free alcohol in the evening but staff expect a tip which is a bit irritating considering how much you pay, and it\u2019s only available for a couple hours.

Within the first few days of my \u201cinaugural\u201d visit, I had already concluded that this hotel will do extremely well primarily because it so apparently succeeds in attaining everything it tries to represent, which is an architecturally designed, decorative boutique hotel where sophisticated elegant interiors are infused with atmospheric elements of clarity, serenity and tranquillity. The final result from this juxtaposition of a myriad of specific design aspects is a cohesive artistic style that collectively offers an undeniably placid environment for all its guests to absorb from arrival up through departure. I can personally attest to this since it was the moment I first entered this hotel\u2019s breathtaking stunning Deco\u201d styled lobby and viewed the overall impressive geometric room layout, which is as close to jaw dropping perfection  as it can possibly get. What makes up the hotel lobby are rows of aligned vintage lamps with respective lampshades that hang from the sectional ceiling over grey colored modern couches with tangerine  colored pillows coupled with several interesting wood furniture pieces, a nice small fireplace and a terrific bar with a marble top and multiple glass shelves that are lit from underneath. Also, this hotel has one of the best \u201cin house \u201c hard working staffs that I have ever had the incredible pleasure of getting acquainted with and special thanks to Ethan, Mo, Tarik and Nick for being so welcoming to me through my entire stay. The hotel room I was assigned to coincidentally is very closely to my own personal aesthetic and included: a very large decorative framed mirror, which was hung at the inside entrance, a  phenomenally designed \u201cdark color lacquered painted low dresser with three \u201cred\u201d color lacquered painted roll out drawers, and an additional attached cabinet with an under the counter refrigerator topped off with a creamy white colored marble top; a black painted desk with a clear glass top and office style chair; a series of four early to mid 20th century photographs mounted in gold decorative frames; a king sized very comfortable sleeping bed painted glossy black and dressed with a half dozen goose down filled pillows, wrapped in eggshell white Egyptian cotton fabrics that perfectly matched the bed linens as well as several symmetrically shaped decorative pillows made with luxurious red and\/or grey velvet type fabrics that overall tied the \u201cfour shades\u201d of red, grey, white and black \u201cbed look\u201d, nicely together. Hung over the bedroom window are floor to ceiling grey color lovely blackout drapes, which is ideal for granting any guest an excellent night\u2019s sleep. The hotel bedroom\u2019s large bathroom is elegantly designed with a marble floor, marble walls and a marble ceiling and has a good sized glass enclosed shower with an inside matching white marble shelf and silver plated shower head that delivers forceful amounts of water, which ultimately leaves you feeling refreshingly clean! \u201cWestHouse\u201d offers a \u201cno charge\u201d daily delicious buffet breakfast from 7 am to 10 am, weekdays and  7 am to 11 am weekends and a \u201cno charge\u201d light fare\u201d meal served daily in late afternoon from 5  pm to 7 pm. Served at the breakfast buffet included: freshly made scrambled eggs, buttermilk pancakes, sausage meats, perfectly cooked bacon, roasted yellow potatoes, assorted pastries, variety of bagels and freshly squeezed juices. They also have an excellent espresso maker that is extremely easy as well as fun to use and that inspired me to want to immediately purchase the exact model had I by now secured a lease on a new Manhattan apartment! At the late afternoon \u201clighter fare\u201d, there were several good dishes for example, Fettuccine Alfredo, served, which also included a variety of wines to select from and eliminated the need for me to spend money on going out to a dinner at a nearby restaurant. In summation: The WestHouse Hotel is an extraordinary boutique hotel to stay at especially for all the style and beauty it apparently has a plethora off. \u201cThe entire hotel look creates a most wonderful elegant feeling on the inside while keeping all the noise and hustle bustle of the City strictly on the outside. It essentially is a hotel sanctuary for anyone who appreciates serene accommodations as well as styled and very tasteful interiors. I immensely enjoyed my stay and must admit that I never heard of this hotel prior to my arrival? However, I most certainly plan on being a \u201cregular guest because I now realize how crucially important it is to try to remember to do something very special for yourself and as often as need be.

It was more crowded this time than it was during our last stay, but the level of service was the same. Our two rooms were not ready when we arrived at 2:45pm, so we left a contact number and our luggage to go for a walk. We returned around 4, and the lobby was more crowded. I went to the desk and found that one room was ready, so I handed the key to my parents. My room wasn't ready, and I could tell from the back and forth on the phone that it was going to take longer. When Vanessa got off the phone, she said she was authorized to offer me a one-bedroom suite at no extra charge and that it was ready now. Wow! Obviously, I took her up on the offer :) Thanks so much, Vanessa - you are the best!\n\nThe suite was large, well-appointed, and had a pull-out bed so my nieces could stay with me when they arrived. It even had a bathtub! As usual, all of the housekeeping staff greeted us warmly as we rolled our luggage down the halls. \n\nThe 23rd floor lounge was very crowded, with many guests who appeared unaware that there were others who were also trying to get food and maneuver around the tight space. I could see that the attendants were a bit frazzled as they tried to maintain their politeness when trying to move through knots of guests while holding stacks of plates. However, they never lost their professionalism, and maintained a high level of service.\n\nin my opinion, the WestHouse is the standard for a boutique hotel. You get a lot of value for your money, an excellent location, a warm & friendly staff, and a beautifully appointed hotel that has everything you need.

It was reminiscent of a french bakery serving croissants, quiche, eggs, bacon, sausage and assorted juices.  In the evening, the champagne reception was pasta's, greens, breads and cheeses. On the side was a fridge filled with water and tiny little glassed bottle cokes and sprites. If you prefer, many guest forfeited soda for beer, wine or sangria.  \nAnd in the world where service still means something, The Westhouse concierge team fits the bill.\nMy daughter had a request even before arriving at the hotel and the concierge, Sean made sure that it was filled.

Amazingly, the Westhouse exceeded my already high expectations. Upon being dropped off at the main entrance, my wife and I were promptly greeted by a team of doormen. What I immediately noticed, and then what I discovered to be a theme throughout our stay, was how genuinely friendly the staff is. Not the \"I'm friendly because it's my job\" friendly, but the \"genuinely happy to see you\" friendly. Doormen, front desk, housekeeping, terrace staff: every single person we encountered was super friendly and accommodating. The hotel manager, Petr, checked in with us throughout . After learning our tastes and preferences, Petr made spot-on restaurant recommendations. Not the touristy ones the everyone already knows about, but the small hidden gem restaurants that could otherwise go unnoticed except for a dedicated local following. Clearly, Petr genuinely listened to us. One of the many amenities that comes with staying at the Westhouse is the morning breakfast and the late afternoon \"hours of indulgence\". Going in, I thought wrongly - oh so very wrongly- that this would be a generic continental breakfast and a little meat and cheese spread in the afternoon. The breakfast always had freshly made eggs, meat and lots of other goodies. The coup de grace was the afternoon hours of indulgence. In addition to a wide selection of cheese, Italian meats and very delicious wines was a daily, freshly made hot item worthy of New York's best restaurants. Once, manicotti was offered, and on another day, the best seafood paella that I ever had the privilege to savor. I have been to NYC dozens of times in my life. I have stayed at quite a few very fine hotels. Without a doubt, my most enjoyable and most memorable visit was our stay at the Westhouse.

Staff could not have been nicer.  Room was pretty nice - felt a bit narrow - hard to walk around the bed but the location was quiet and the bed was super comfortable.  Lounge was very crowded on a Sunday night.  Breakfast just ok.  All of that said, I would return.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
{"helpfulVotes":7,"locationId":4945551,"title":"Good hotel but hidden fees","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-08-13","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"I recently stayed at the WestHouse hotel. It's a nice boutique hotel with a great location. The staff is also very nice. \n\nHowever, when I arrived, I was informed that in addition to the room and tax fees, I prepaid for, there would be an additional \"residence fee\" of $47. At first, I thought this was a small amount, so I signed the acknowledgement form (even though I did not see anywhere on my booking site that this would be an additional charge).  At the end of my stay, I discovered that the fee was $47\/person\/night. As a result, my weekend stay costs essentially doubled. I travel a lot and never experienced such a high \"additional fee.\" Ultimately, I left the weekend feeling disappointed in my choice and feeling, quite frankly, deceived. For future travelers, be aware of this charge before you book and take it into account when you budget.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

She was able to help resolve the issue with agoda.com without incurring any penalties.  At the same time I had booked another hotel (The Knickerbocker which we had previously stayed at and is great) to ensure we had something reserved.  However, because Tahmina was so helpful I wanted to give the WestHouse my business and she was great in helping to book the right room for my family while waiving some fees due the hassle we went through.  She is the only reason I have rated it a 3 - Average.  Otherwise it would have been lower.\n\nAll that said, we were not entirely impressed with the hotel itself.  Although the location was great for us, I agree with some comments in some of the other reviews.  An example I have seen repeatedly was a mold-type odor in the room - which we also had.  Another is rust on the light fixture in the bathroom (Room 1929)\n\nAlthough the Residence Fee ($200+) was waived for us (thanks again to Tahmina) The Terrace offerings, included in the fees, do not really make up for not having room service or other typical amenities you would find in a \"luxury\" hotel.  Closing at 8PM limits the options for families to \"relax\" outside of the Lounge which was dark and totally empty when we were there.  We actually went to a different hotel for this.  Also, the doors were locked to the outside patio when we wanted to have breakfast and there were limited plant-based food options for breakfast other than bananas and dry bagels.\n\nA little disappointing having brought the family in for our first Broadway show and my anniversary with my wife.\n\nFor the deal we received it was acceptable but will not stay in the future.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}
