My husband, 5 year old daughter, best friend, and I traveled to NYC for four nights for our daughter's 5th birthday. The room was a really good size, especially from what we'd seen of rooms in NYC, and it was very clean. Our room was on the 19th floor, right on 42nd and was very quiet, even with the window ajar. We'd hear ambulances, and on Sunday morning, the cheers of those watching the marathon, but overall, it was quiet. \n\nALL of the staff was absolutely amazing. They all knew us as we came and went, opened doors, helped us get up the stairs with the stroller, and treated us each with kindness and respect. It had a family vibe for us that we loved, and I imagine if you'd like more of the upscale, dote on me vibe, they'd provide that as well. They are very perseptive and professional.\n\nOn the evening of our daughter's birthday, her and I were waiting in the lobby for my husband to get back from the store, and four of the staff that were there at the front desk SANG HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my daughter and the manager then brought out a box of fancy little sweets as a gift. \n\nThere's a full bar downstairs, a little area where you can purchase snacks, and a dining area with a bunch of tables where you can bring food, read a book, do some work, or just hang out and relax after miles of walking. Never had to wait on elevators.  \n\nUpon departure, 42nd and 2nd were both shut down due to the marathon, but Freddie got our luggage (4 large bags, a few small others, some shopping bags) to 41st and 2nd where our Uber picked us up. He helped load it all up, took a picture with our daughter, and said he loved us (which as a family, warmed out hearts immensely)!

It's right on 42nd street at second avenue. I thought it would be a very busy area. Instead, it was just perfect. Centrally located to tons of fine places to eat, to shopping, to transportation, to walking. If you like \"looking up,\" the building structures were dynamic and beautiful. Duck in for a hot chocolate at Zuckers. Have breakfast or lunch at one of the two closest diners (Townhouse and Gemini; we hit both). Head a block north or five or six blocks south to a meal or a hangout. You can get everywhere, so easily. Even back to LaGuardia, whether by Uber or taxi we did both).\n\nThe hotel is beautiful. The staff goes out of their way to accommodate. There's a wonderful seating area to meet friends and hang out, across from a \"marketplace\" and bar where you can have a cocktail or heat up one of the food options in the microwave. \n\nThe room was perfect. Totally updated. Oodles of storage... drawers, closet with cubbies and hanging space. The nightstand had a refrigerator! (We didn't discove that until we were ready to depart.) Bathroom was totally updated and easy. Lush, thick towels and plenty of them. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body lotion were upscale and plentiful. The dresser and desk were quite handsome with leather-look fronts drawers and vintage metal feet on the mid-century modern low chest. Plenty of charging stations for phones iPads, and hands-frees. Bed comfort was heavenly, like sleeping on a cloud. Our reservation let the hotel pick our room. When we checked in, we were told they had a king room available if we'd like (and we did).\nThe staff went to great lengths to please. We'd intended to take Uber to the airport, and it was suggested we might wish to take a taxi. Chafik said he would be happy to get us a cab and a reputable ride. We went with that and it was perfect. Even a little cheaper than Uber would've been.\n\nMy companion lost one of her favorite gloves and thought it might've been left in our room, or dropped in the lobby somewhere. We'd already checked out and checked our luggage to go to lunch. When we got back to hotel, Chafik said he'd gone up to our room to check for the glove (not there). Just going the extra mile was very special. (The companion then thought it might've been dropped\/left at the bagel place up the street. That was correct and I retrieved.)\n\nEach time we entered or exited the hotel, the doorman opened the side door for us, or started the revolving door if we were headed that way. Staff was just wonderful. The room was comfortable, the bed was a great respite for hard-walking days. The hotel is centrally located, near Grand Central, and near the UN. In the middle of so many restaurants, stores. Second Avenue, First Avenue are a delight to walk along on the fashionable East side of manhattan in the East 30s and 40s. I'd love to stay at the Westgate ... again and again.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

This meant a great deal to me as I am a photographer with a long-standing fondness for the Tudor City neighborhood, ever since earliest visits in my teens. and I do a festive birthday week in NYC every year.\nBeyond this, when I remarked to Kevin on Front Desk staff, while checking out, how much I had enjoyed the terrace and its view and that I planned to make this \"my\" hotel for future birthday week and other visits, he volunteered that next time I would have an even better terrace room, and he actually made notation of that assurance on my customer account. Hard to imagine a better view from a terrace than that which I enjoyed with my 16th floor accommodations, but I'm certainly looking forward to whatever upgrade Kevin had in mind for my next stay. \nAesthetically, Westgate's extensive renovation of this historic hotel is immediately obvious in the inviting lobby with its Art Deco touches and bronze adorned elevators, and rooms themselves, a very nice touch being the double-glazed casement windows, which allowed me to enjoy fresh air when desired and views that augment the major ones from the terrace. Also nice for a photographer, not having to deal with glass reflections. Attractive wall lighting fixtures flanked the bed, with the added feature of high-intensity reading lights on flexible arm - very thoughtful design. The climate system was responsive and commendably quiet in its air-moving.\nIf all the foregoing positives were not enough, I should add that both room and bath were spotless and comfortable, especially the bedding, and the full-size bathtub proved therapeutic with all the exercise scampering about NYC with full compliment of camera gear. Housekeeping, Front Desk staff, and other representatives of the Hotel were unfailingly friendly and helpful, and made this first time visitor feel like a valued long-term guest of Westgate.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"SOLO"}

Got mixed feelings about it to be honest. Rooms are comfortable if a little small, our bed was a pull out sofa bed although it was quite comfortable but not quite what we expected. The location is good with Grand Central nearby and Times Square about 15 min walk away but there was little choice nearby in the way of bars and restaurants to stagger back from although we recommend Peter Dillon\u2019s about a 10 minute walk away. \n\nOur biggest issue with the hotel was the \u2018Resort Fee\u2019. An absolute rip off having to pay for water, coffee, safe, WiFi and the hotel gym. All this stuff is normally included in the rate for a hotel of this standard so it\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow having to pay $200 for six bottles of water over 5 days. \n\nBig shout out to to Mike and Tony and the rest of the concierge team who went out of their way to help us.

Given room on 6th floor facing back of the property - terrible view with terrible noise as a platform was going up n down with workers drilling into walls it was extremely loud. Last thing you want after long haul flight. The back facing room was very dark like a dungeon with limited lighting only small lamps no cetral ceiling light. Also the bed was facing 3 lifts on the back of the wall which at night felt like you sleeping next to a train track. The room is ok, not 4star in my view. Would expect a robe, slippers and daily water. There is a small coffee maker of questionable coffee quality, fridge is a plus, there was a hairdryer, iron and a safe and free wifi which are all a plus. Shower gel not topped up ended up using a bar soap. They also lost my teddy bear while changing bed. Seems trivial to some but had a huge emotional meaning to me. Also last day the staff persuaded me to use taxi they called to the airport. Should have gone with my gut and use Uber. Was told taxi will be around $105 which definitely wasn't, was a metered yellow taxi that was charging tolls on top of the fare and also there was no tip option which would be appropriate for the near hit experience on the highway. Ended up paying $140. So just book Lyft or Uber. They go different routes where tolls are not charged and you know the cost upfront.

That was nice!!!  Seriously, the staff here is super nice, like \"Disney-resort nice\". \n    I checked in around 10:30 pm since my flight was heavily delayed.  The only downfall, this hotel is located on the East side, which is more upscale, but unfortunately that means your surrounded more by big corporate buildings and banks which didn't leave any late night places open for food. My dinner that night was trail mix I just happened to have on me.\n   My room was lovely! It was very spacious and more outlets than any other hotel I've ever seen.  I LOVE that there was a mini fridge, and I LOVE that there were many mirrors, and gray lighting in the room.  The room seems freshly renovated, which also meant they were working on more rooms which meant construction noise from 9-4.  Ah, well.\n   I go to NYC for Broadway shows, so it is a brisk walk to everything, but the hotel was so nice, I didn't mind the distance.  Plus I love to walk.\n   The hotel has a great fitness center on the 2nd floor, which was well equipped. I wish I had time to use it more than once.\n   The elevators are usually quick and not key card operated, which I like but other people may differ.  The staff always honored my privacy since I kept my sign on my door.

I asked for glasses to drink water out off in the room and cups for the coffee machine to be told they give plastic cups since Covid; mind you they serve beer in the bar in glasses. Go figure.\nBar area is a little sad. This is not a hotel one wants to hang out in after a long day being a tourist. \nThis is NOT a four star hotel, it is a 3 at best and just about.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":93339,"title":"Great location, awful management","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-11-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"There appears to be absolutely zero coordination between the Westgate New York Grand Central hotel and Westgate\u2019s headquarters in Florida. I booked a reservation at the New York Grand Central (previously Tudor Hotel) at which point I was required to provide a credit card for holding the reservation. My parents were going to pay for my fianc\u00e9 and my stay at the hotel, so we used their credit card to hold the reservation. However, the website states that you apparently need to have the card with you in-person upon checking-in for your stay. I called what appeared to be the number for the hotel lobby and it appeared to be for one of the Florida offices. I was able to finally get connected to someone at the lobby (I think) when they asked me for my reservation number. I had received a confirmation email with a couple different numbers, but NONE of them were apparently the reservation number. I even created an account on their website and logged in to try to find the reservation number, but you need the reservation number to add your reservation! The front-desk lady was able to find my reservation number which I then wrote down on some paper and was finally able to enter that into the website successfully to see my reservation. After this I got bounced around to multiple people until I was finally connected with someone who was able to answer my questions. The man I was connected with, who was a manager I believe, said that we couldn\u2019t pay in advance but that we could use their card as long as I had my parents submit a credit card authorization form to them including a scan of their driver\u2019s license but explicitly NOT of the credit card. My mom filled out their form and submitted it along with the front-and-back scan of her driver\u2019s license. Upon doing this she confirmed with them that they had everything they needed, and they assured her that they did and that we were good to go and wouldn\u2019t need to have the credit card with us when checking in.\n\nWith all the back-and-forth, I had a really bad feeling that something was going to happen and cause us issues, but we had done everything that we had been told to do so there was nothing to be done but get there and hope for the best. Well, after a full day of flying across the country on empty-stomachs and a two-hour drive with an insane Lyft driver in the middle of peak rush-hour traffic, we FINALLY arrived at the hotel in one piece. The bellhop put our things on a card and my fianc\u00e9 sat in the lobby while I checked in at the front desk. I gave them my name and they proceeded to tell me that they did not, in fact, have what they needed from us in order to charge my parent\u2019s credit card and allow us to check in to our room. I explained how we filled out the form as directed and provided everything we were told to provide and I showed them the email messages too. I ended up having to have my mom get on the phone to hash everything out with them. I was very polite, though very matter of fact, the entire time even though I was exhausted and very frustrated because I knew it wasn\u2019t the fault of the front-desk person, Kevin Law. Kevin, me, and my mom worked back and forth for probably an hour or two at least before finally we were able to get things sorted including having to have my mom send a back-and-front scan of her credit card against her wishes. Due to the frustration and issues, Kevin graciously upgraded our room from a queen suite to a king suite and give us a bit of a discount as well as a bottle of wine. Kevin was very professional the entire time as was all of the staff at the actual hotel, but the sheer insanity and lack of coordination between the headquarters and the actual hotels is mind-boggling.\n\nAfter the fever-dream of the day and the nightmare of checking in, our stay was actually quite pleasant. The room was really nice (especially with the upgrade) and the staff were very pleasant also. The balcony was especially nice and had an amazing view! The room was still on the smaller side, without even a microwave and only a very small mini-fridge and desk, but for mid-town Manhattan it was pretty big and nice for the price.\n\nThe ATM by the elevators ate my card the first time I tried to use it, so I had to go talk to the front desk and they said it had been having issues but it would eventually spit my card back out. We seriously waited for like 5 minutes before it finally gave me back my card after I had hit cancel. They ended up taping an \u201cout of order\u201d paper on it for a couple of days until I noticed it was no longer there. At that point though we were usually in a rush and I didn\u2019t want to risk having my card eaten again\u2026\n\nAfter the first day or so, the shower started backing up very badly and would take forever to finally drain, leaving a really gross residue in the shower. We called up the front-desk to have someone check it out and the repair guy was kind of aggressive and started blaming the cleaning people. He tried clearing out the drain and it looked like it would work, but again it still backed up really badly, at which point we just dealt with it.\n\nI get it that it\u2019s New York City, but the room doesn\u2019t have that great of sound-proofing. At night you can still hear the sounds of the city like sirens fairly loudly, and throughout the day on the days we stayed in our room, you could hear this one construction worker across the street shouting as if he was being stabbed every couple of minutes.\n\nOn a much less important but still worth mentioning note, the Tudor City Tavern and Tudor City Marketplace are not nearly as impressive as they are made to look. The marketplace has a couple things, but I\u2019ve seen more selection at a Hotel 8 in the middle of nowhere in Texas. We didn\u2019t really get a chance to try the tavern, but it is only a couple seats and one guy working it. Both also have semi-limited schedules and the microwaves are in the marketplace area so when they close it down you aren\u2019t able to microwave anything since there aren\u2019t microwaves in the room. There is luckily a 24-hour CVS just a block or two away, but it would still be nice to have a bit more options in the hotel and also to have the microwaves either in the room or outside of the locked-off area for late-night eaters.\n\nEpilogue\nThe reservation and backend-management side of things is utterly f@$#ed and the hotel is lacking some of the more basic oft\u2019 taken-for-granted amenities, but the hotel staff was really nice (besides the repair guy) and the hotel was pretty decent for the cost and the great location. It would be nice to have some better amenities for the price, though.\n\nP.S. The telephone in the hotel suite has some button presets including one for the front-desk which would be nice except that, once again, it sends you to someone in Florida!!! Why? Just why?!","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

A few negatives,  our bed was comfy enough once you were in it and very big but it was a fold out and because of the arms on the the sofa bed, you had to get it in it lower down and climb up the bed, also couldn't reach a lamp or plug from my side of the bed, due to the frame.

We didn't get washcloths despite my asking several times. We were given a new set of towels when I requested washcloths that didn't include washcloths, only two new towels. The towels in the room were all tattered and coming apart and had holes in them.\n\nMy brother's room had a view of a brick wall. We had a slightly better view of a different brick wall.\n\nWe weren't given coffee one morning, and when I requested more from the front desk we never received it.\n\nThen our A\/C went out and maintenance was in our ceiling at 11:00 pm trying to fix it. They couldn't and said we'd have to change rooms AGAIN. This time they tried to move us to an entirely different tower, even though we told them we wanted to stay close to the family we were travelling with. \n\nUpon seeing how far away this was, we decided to stay put as we were only there for 2 more nights. It was scorching that week in NYC - temps in the 30 degrees celsius range - we really needed that AC!\n\nFinally, our bathtub was clogged and every time you took a shower it backed up and filled halfway with water. \n\nThe staff was nice, even though we had so many challenges with this property. I have left 3 follow-ups on the various surveys I was asked to fill out after my stay asking for at minimum my resort fee of $30+ USD a day to be refunded (what did I get for the resort fee? Just wi-fi, no AC, no coffee, no amenities?) and have yet to receive a response. I sent an email with this request as well and have not received a response.\n\nWe've travelled all over the world and this hotel was easily one of our most frustrating experiences because of the multitude of small frustrating details that were easily fixed.\n\nI am not satisfied with my stay at this property and if it's your first trip to NYC I recommend you stay somewhere else!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Nothing was ever too much trouble and he always went out it of his way to go that extra mile. He really is amazing and a true ambassador for the hotel and the Westgate brand.

Complaints were made to the front desk who offered another room after our second night.  The room was located one floor below and more spacious, however, the noises persisted.  After further inquiry, one of the front desk personnel admitted that there had been issues with the air conditioning system for the past several weeks!  It was surmised, but not fully known, that the A\/C system was the source of the noises. We were also told that the building is 95 years old which was perceived as an excuse for some of the building noises.

We have already tried to speak to people at reception and they seem disinterested and their stories of what the fees cover never match up. Does anyone actually know or is this just a bogus charge for foreigners? We seemed to be the only ones who were charged this fee upon check in at that time and waited in a substantial queue.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

My fiance and I left after just one awful night despite that we were booked for several days. Everything from checking in to the room itself was a disaster. We had several malfunctions in the rooms despite that the rooms were renovated. The hotel itself was in awful shape. The staff did not even know what was inside the rooms\/how to fix the many technical malfunctions of the lights\/doors etc. We called them several times because the malfunctions of the lights were too drastic for anyone to sleep. The windows were facing the street and not blocked by any other buildings, yet somehow from the inside of the room it looked like it was raining even though it was bright, warm, and sunny on the outside. My fiance is not religious, and even he could tell the energy of the hotel was malignant and not welcoming, on both an aesthetic level and spiritual level. We had a terrifying experience that kept us up all night and woke us up twice where a motion sensor in the room was going off in the middle of the night despite nothing moving, not once, but twice in a row with a bright flashing light and a bell chime. We got so scared I literally began praying to God, because with every other horrific aspect of this hotel, this was just the icing on the ghostly cake. We quite literally left ASAP after we managed to book another hotel in the city. I cannot possibly imagine ever setting foot in such a bizarre, dark, ghostly space ever again.

This is a pity, because it has a great location and spacious rooms, but it fails on one of the most important factors travelers depend upon with lodgings: Respecting promises.\nThis was my chief complaint with the Westgate Grand Central. The incident in question was the matter of a minor amount of money, but the way the Westgate handled it was the reason to feel disappointed in the property.\nLike many (but not all) NYC hotels, the Westgate tacks on a \"Resort Fee.\" Before my stay I received an email confirming my reservation and describing the amenities covered by the $30 fee. Among these was a $20 Food & Beverage credit. I still have the email in question but did not bring it with me as I was relying on the hotel to be aware of what was promised.\nI think you can guess what happened: When I inquired about the food\/beverage credit upon check-in I was told it didn't exist. So much for that promised-in-writing benefit.\nIn addition to this, although our room was large and the bed comfortable, there were a number of failings:\nThe room safe was broken. (We reported this.)\nThe door of one bedside table would not close. It had to be propped open or the guest sleeping on that side of the bed ran the risk of smacking their legs into it. (Also reported.)\nThe bathroom amenities were stingy: One small shampoo, one body lotion, NO conditioner.\nThe towels were thin and very rough.\nOther NYC hotels charging comparable prices manage to provide complimentary bottled water. Not the Westgate, but at least they never promised that.\nThe Westgate Grand Central's website uses the terms \"ELEGANT\" and \"LUXURIOUS.\" (I suppose offering guests a wee travel-sized bottle of hair conditioner, etc. isn't necessary for elegance and luxury.)\nI wish they'd included, and lived up to, one more term: RELIABLE.\nThey saved $20. They lost us, and that's a shame because this hotel could have become one of our regular places to stay on our frequent visits to NYC.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

I stayed here for a few days and here are some pros and cons. \n\nPros: location is great, it's near Grand Central and in a non-touristy more quiet area of midtown east, the hotel has a beautiful lobby and the staff are friendly and hospitable, the room (while small but typical for midtown room sizes) had tons of storage space, a good bed, beautiful new wood floors, and a lovely bathroom. Also, the windows are all double paned so I barely heard any outside noise at all. It was also extremely clean and there is a kiosk in the lobby that sells food and Starbucks in the morning which is nice.\n\nCons: It's a very, very old beautiful hotel (I believe this used to be the Hotel Tudor) and every room has a doorbell which is quaint and cute however my room's bell had a malfunction and it would ring at random times at night and in the morning which was disconcerting (thought it was a weird other guest until it rang incessantly and I pulled the door open while it was ringing to see no one there, so either it's the weirdest ghost encounter I experienced or there was a technical malfunction, you decide). Additionally, the air conditioning while great had an issue with the compressor where it would cycle off and literally make a loud slamming noise. Between the slamming and the doorbell issue, it was comically bad for a few nights but this could have been an isolated room issue.\n\nAll in all, it's a lovely hotel and the overhaul is gorgeous and the location is great for people wanting to avoid the insanity of the Times Square hotel area.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Location was also great, under 5 min walk from grand central with a 24hr shop 1 block away, and about 20 min walk from Times Square. Check in and check out both very speedy - there was a $50 refundable damage deposit I wasnt aware of but this wasnt too much of an issue. Special mention to Kevin on check out, very accommodating and helpful. Breakfast was also great, although quite pricey ($35) for what was on offer. The only things that make this hotel lose a star was that the room I was in (1302) seemed to have absolutely no soundproofing from the room next door. I was woken up both nights at about 2am, as even though the people next door were talking in normal voices (not shouting), it felt like they were in the same room...! Also worth bearing in mind that at the moment (Feb 2020) they have building works on downstairs, on the 13th floor this didnt affect me much but nod may be more of an issue if on lower floors.

However, we had a great stay. \nAll the staff we encountered were fab, room was lovely with a massive and comfy bed. Bathroom was very clean and huge- could have done with slight updating but was still fine. No view from window but wasn\u2019t needed as we only went to the room to sleep or get changed. \n\nHad a problem with the shower late at night and rung reception and they sent someone up within minutes who showed us properly how to work it and he then went over the heating\/AC with us in case we weren\u2019t sure. \nLocation was fab too, you can see the Chrysler building as soon as you step out of the hotel, Grand Central is about 5 minute walk and local supermarkets and lots of coffee houses. Times Square is about 15 minutes and Bryant Park about 10 minutes. Lots of subway stations around. \nWe weren\u2019t charged any sort of resort fees and the $100 deposit never even got taken out of our bank. \n\nOnly slight problem could be the food\/drink. We found out the cost of breakfast was $35 each and someone told us on our last day how they\u2019d had it and regretted it as it wasn\u2019t the best. We ended up buying 2 croissants from the cafe on ground floor one morning and they were $5 each and both were hard and a felt\/tasted a few days old. So we resorted to breakfast in Grand Central everyday which was roughly $10-$12 for two pastries, a hot drink and bottle of water- much better and lovely atmosphere (highly recommend that). \nFree wifi worked the whole time we were there and didn\u2019t have any problems with it. \nThe AC in the room banged quite a bit during the night on two nights which was a bit annoying but not enough to have woken us up. \n\nAlso when we were checking out and waiting for the shuttle to the airport the 3 places in the hotel to get food and drink were all closed from 12-4 so we sat in the lobby\/bar area with nothing to eat and drink- would think that would be key time to open but we just walked 5 minutes up the road to Sandwicherie for lunch- lovely place for breakfast!\n\nWhilst waiting for our shuttle, the concierge were very helpful to us as we were worried we would have to make our own way there as it hadn\u2019t showed up. The concierge spoke to a taxi outside and held him for us if we needed him. Luckily our shuttle then turned up so it wasn\u2019t needed, but was really helpful and he also recommended a different shuttle service for next time. \n\nCannot wait to come back to New York (hopefully this December) and will definitely be staying back at Westgate and just hope we have the same experience we got last month!

Check in all was fine until we discovered there was only one bed in each of our 2 rooms that was meant to sleep 3 in each. So when we highlighted it we were told that there wasnt any more rooms available as it was marathon weekend and that because we had booked a lower rate room we were given what was available at check in. We had booked through a reputable travel agent in january so obviously rooms would be cheaper then.they couldnt do anything for us. We were frustrated as one could imagine travelling 13 hours to get to this hotel and to be told this. The manager on duty was so rude to us about it. Alexendra was her name spoke so agressive and abrupt to us that we couldnt even explain our booking to her. She wanted us to ring our travel agent there and then to get it sorted and as you can imagine with the time difference this was impossible. I showed her the email from our booking and then she tried to help us. It had said on our booking 2 beds in each room. But still she wasnt accepting that it was an error on their side and kept blaming our travel agent.there were people waiting for rooms and alexandra went and told them there wasnt rooms because of us because the people were giving us dirty looks.when she returned to reception she spoke in a foreign language to her staff this made us feel very uncomfortable as we felt she was talking about us. We were in reception for a full hour and a half we were offered a glass of water by the concierge for our inconvienience. We had people stop and look at us talking with the manager on duty over how we were being spoken too and when i told her of how embarrassed by this she told me \"its new york people look all the time\". How unprofessional. As a manager myself i couldnt believe this response. We got an extra room eventually and were told they went way above and beyond to accommodate  us. Rooms were dark and small not designed for 2 people. Might aswell had no windows as they were facing a grey wall. We got over this as we were going to be out as much as we could. One of the rooms had no sockets working. Their coffee machine wasnt working. They asked for someone to come and look at it and by the time of check out it still wadnt working. Wifi wad based on your name and room number. My room wifi wasnt working and i asked at reception. I got shouted at by a male that it does work. They had spelt my surname different to me so therefore mine wouldnt work. And yet again told me that i spelt my name wrong that thats how they spell it in america. Baffled by that statement as i thought a surname is a surname spelt the way its meant to be. 100 dollars was taking from 2 of our accounts for the room security which is fine but one had 200 dollars taken when we asked  the reason why we were told we had an   outstanding balance as we had to get another room. I spoke with the manager on the day and after a discussion this was scrapped.i felt she was just smirking at me just to please me she listened. Locks were broken on the door of one our rooms.There was cracks in the sink of  our room. There was no safe in the room. I heard one of the male receptionists treat customers badly every day shouting at them. Its not a right way to carry on. While we were there we met more people that had issues with this hotel so it wasnt just us. I witnessed a lady shout at the manager over a problem they had. I have informed my travel agent about our stay and told them to avoid this hotel going forward as they will have more complaints. They need to get their system right so that people like us will not have to face the ordeal and embarrassment like we did and get no satisfaction. Also they need to change some of their ftont desk team as they dont have a manner to deal with people and slso maybe get new polite management that dont treat people rudely.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

It is in a very old building and the rooms are in need of a major overhaul, especially the bathrooms where most of the caulking is either missing or infested with mold and mildew that makes the entire room smell musty. The cleaning was ok but I was given a room that clearly was not vacuumed as there was hairs and the plastic parts of clothing tags visible on the dark blue carpet.  Other reviews I see mention cleaning as an issue here and I would agree the day to day cleaning is sub-par. The bed was decent and comfortable but very dated along with the other room furnishings. Bed skirt was falling off and just made everything look kind of sloppy and low quality for a 4 star rating. There is a $30 per day \u201cresort\u201d fee and this is supposed to include amenities and a $20 daily credit at the hotel shop\/bar but the posted hours for that are not honored. Both nights it was closed by the time I got back to the hotel (10:25 and 10:40pm) even though I was told at check in and it says on all the signs it is open until 11:00pm.

It is an old historic building with lots of character.  The beds were comfortable, super quiet rooms and plenty of hot water.  \n\nSupposedly the hotel started a renovation in Oct 2018 but no signs of it were seen anywhere.  Some of the staff were friendly and helpful (bellmen) while others were distant and unfriendly.\n\nThere is a bar\/breakfast room\/coffee shop in the lobby that has very, very limited hours.  Basically it is open for breakfast and evening drinks only.  All three days the lobby and attached sitting area were full of people waiting on their rooms to be prepared and shop was closed.  They could have bought drinks and coffees has the hotel thought to add one staff during the day to keep the shop open.  Bizarre.\n\nFinally, we paid extra for a corner \u201csuite\u201d with a balcony.  The balcony view was nice and good for two people.  This was a treat compared to any big-box standard hotel up the street.\n\nOverall, it was an ok stay at an ok hotel.  It could be spectacular hotel with some slight improvements especially in the attitude of the staff, provision of drinks\/snacks during the day and some dressing up of the lobby areas.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

As we walked in the entrance, yellow liquid was dripping from the ceiling and it went all over me. When I told the manager about the leak, she was very defensive and made me feel as if it was my fault for coming through the entrance in the first place. After a very unpleasant check in, she reluctantly agreed to give us $11 free WiFi for the inconvenience (which we already thought was included but ok.) \nWhen we got to the room, there was a very strong smell of urine, my partner suggested it might be from the vents and when we looked, the vents were absolutely coated with black mould. I have NEVER experienced this in a hotel before, we headed back down stairs and the manager was so rude and defensive about the mould it made me question who employed her in the first place. She said \u201cyou can get another room or you get out\u201d in an extremely aggressive tone. She had an issue with me bringing up the yellow liquid\/ mould and she very clearly didn\u2019t want manage the hotel, she made us feel so uncomfortable that we really couldn\u2019t stay there. We went up to the room to get our bags, find another hotel and leave. We were up there for about 15 minutes while trying to find another place (which was very difficult under late notice.) two security guards came up and I heard one of them in the hallway with my partner (he was outside on the phone trying to sort out the refund while I found a hotel.) one of the security guards was ordering us out of the hotel and whilst we were getting our bags and already cooperating, there was no need for him to try and take our bags or threaten to call the police when we were already trying our best to go. I had a panic attack in the room as this was happening, he could have been calm and asked us to leave but it was too much to threaten us and try and take the bags as we were going, on top of everything else that happened (The other man was ok with us though and did come to check that I was ok) I\u2019m really upset with this chain and I wouldn\u2019t recommend that anybody goes here. I can\u2019t believe how we were treated, we were able to get a refund for the 4 days that we were supposed to be there and booked into somewhere else immediately.

It was perfect for what we wanted and needed. After all, it being the holidays and being in Manhattan we expected to pay for the location and convenience. We were arriving at Grand Central by train so the hotel was a very easy 3 block walk on the east side. It was centrally located and an easy walk to 5th ave, St PAt's Radio City, Rockefeller Center, etc. We arrived around noon and Mike, at the luggage area, happily took our bags and was quiet personable asking us if we needed anything. All was said with a smile as well.\n\nThe only issue we had was that when we went to check in about 2:45pm we were told the room wasn't ready and we could be given a different room. That was fine. Took the keys and went to the room only to find out they didn't work. Back down to the front desk who apologized and recoded the room key. The keys worked but we were shocked that there was already someone else's luggage in the room! We quickly went back to the front desk and this time were given a room on the 17th floor and everything worked fine.\n\nThe room was quite large and extremely clean and well laid out.

We are not by picky by any means, and it takes a lot for me to complain or write a bad review, however, when we came back to the room I noticed that next to the bed there was a pair of dirty men's underwear that didn't belong to my husband. I thought this was pretty disgusting. I brought them to the front desk in a plastic bag and they simply said \"okay, thank you\". I asked if our room had been cleaned after the last guest because if it had, how did a pair of underwear end up staying in the room? They said, \"if you want us to call housekeeping and have them re-clean your room, we can, but it was definitely cleaned, your bed was made wasn't it?\" I thought this was all pretty bizarre. I expected a very different reaction, at least an apology. I booked the room through hotwire and wonder if maybe that's why we were treated this way.

We booked our flights and hotel as a package via British Airways.  We booked and paid to stay at The Hilton in New York but discovered about two months later that they had sold the hotel to the Westgate Group.  I contacted BA to change hotels but they would not authorise this.  This hotel is busy because of its location and previous trading name.  The hotel looks grand enough at street level and indeed, in the Reception Area.  Once you venture upstairs via the lifts to the rooms, you become aware of how dated this hotel has become.  We had a room on the 4th floor with 2 double beds.  The beds were very comfortable, however, the heating did not work well and when it did it was extremely noisy.  You could not sleep through this noise.  The bathroom, which has no heating at all, was absolutely freezing with a single mouldy pane of glass to the outside.  There was a filthy broken air heater under the wash hand basins that has probably not worked in the past 20 years.  THE HOT WATER SUPPLY IS A BIG ISSUE.  We had to call maintenance up to our room every night so help sort it out.  The first night, we ran the hot tap for 20 minutes and still there was no hot water.  The second night, we were told we hadn't turned the tap as far as it would go and the third night we were actually told off for calling him again when we still couldn't get hot water.  The bathroom was also not clean.  \n\nWe also spent a lot of money on taxis getting back to the hotel at the end of each day, so I am not sure it was in the best location for our particular needs but the weather was also not in our favour and we would probably have walked more if we had stayed in the spring or summer.  \n\nWe found the reception & concierge staff to be helpful and polite.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel was just inside the police security perimeter so no vehicles were allowed on that section of E42nd Street, however my hotel booking allowed me through the pedestrian barrier. The hotel seemed to be full and the room price I paid reflected that! A definite call out to Michael who helped out with my luggage and also sorted out a car to take me to Newark at the end of my stay.\n\nThe second stay the roads were back to normal and the UN had finished. The hotel room price was more reasonable this visit.\n\nBoth visits the rooms were clean, and the bed comfortable - I slept well. Breakfast in the \"Tudor Marketplace\" restaurant in the hotel was okay, but I did not feel it was worth $34. The scrambled eggs were solid and dried out all 4 mornings, and the orange juice appeared (and tasted) to be from a supermarket low price range; the coffee was okay.\n\nOne gripe is the hotel wifi.

They've marketed themselves as being near Grand Central Station - it's relatively close, but I wouldn't tag it as a Grand Central hotel.  \n\nStill, it's an easy walk to some great restaurants.  Bryant Park and the Library are close.  Times Square is a very easy walk.
