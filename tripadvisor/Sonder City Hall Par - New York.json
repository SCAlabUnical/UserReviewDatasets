Beiden niet gebruikt. Dus geen ervaring mee. De kamer heeft een zithoek. Ik raad dit hotel (deze keten: Sonder) zeker aan. Er zijn meerdere plekken in de stad om uit te kiezen.

It feels like a nightmare that started from the moment we arrived. Firstly, the front desk staff\u2014Matt, Jashawn, Benton, and Amaya\u2014were utterly terrible. Their lack of professionalism and rudeness set the tone for the entire stay.\n\nBut the real kicker was arriving to a dirty room and then having the NYPD called on us. Can you imagine? FOUR officers showing up, demanding we leave at 9:30 pm on a Sunday, mere moments after checking in! It's beyond belief.\n\nAmaya initially welcomed us, and we even used the luggage storage service before heading out for dinner. However, upon our return, Matt and Brenton dropped the bombshell that we were supposedly banned from Sonder City Hall Park. No reasons provided, no proof given. When we questioned this absurdity, Matt had the audacity to threaten us with police intervention, as if we were criminals.\n\nIt wasn't until we escalated the issue to higher-ups, including CGS, that we finally got some clarity. Turns out, we had paid for our stay, and there was no record of any ban against us. The disrespect, harassment, and aggressive threats we faced during our first night were completely uncalled for.\n\nRest assured, I will be taking further action to address this appalling treatment. Nobody should have to endure such mistreatment, especially from a hospitality establishment. Sonder City Hall Park needs to be held accountable for their actions. I can honestly say we'd never return or reccomend Sonder City Hall Park to ANYONE!!!  I'll spare Sonder from further embarrassment and refrain from sharing pictures and videos of the dirty unit and interactions with staff.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":23300953,"title":"Tutto perfetto","lang":"it","publishedDate":"2023-09-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Nella maggior parte dei casi, la formula Sonder prevede di affittare una stanza o un appartamento in una sorta di residence\/palazzo privo di reception e di contatto diretto con qualsiasi tipologia di personale (non vedi receptionist, donne delle pulizie, portinai). Una volta pagata la prenotazione si riceve il codice d'accesso all'edificio e alla propria abitazione. Si entra in autonomia e si spera vada tutto bene. Se si ha bisogno di qualcosa si deve scrivere via chat sull'app a cui rispondono immediatamente, ma la risoluzione delle vostre necessit\u00e0, non essendoci nessuno sul posto, potrebbe richiedere parecchio tempo.\nIl Sonder City Hall Park fa per\u00f2 eccezione perch\u00e9 qui c'\u00e8 la reception a cui potete chiedere aiuto e un portiere notturno. Inoltre \u00e8 sempre presente qualche tecnico quindi credo, anche se noi per fortuna non ne abbiamo avuto bisogno, che in caso di necessit\u00e0 la risoluzione sia pi\u00f9 immediata. Poi, certo,  non \u00e8 la classica reception per turisti tipica degli hotel (per esempio non hanno a disposizione una mappa della citt\u00e0).\nNoi abbiamo soggiornato in un appartamento di categoria alta e ci siamo trovati molto bene: spazi ampi, letto comodissimo. Cucina con lavastoviglie e microonde perfettamente funzionanti.  Buona quantit\u00e0 di posate, piatti e bicchieri, carente un po' nelle pentole. Erano presenti sono due padelle e nemmeno un pentolino per far bollire l'acqua. Sono presenti invece carta assorbente da cucina, the e filtri per il caff\u00e8, zucchero, sale, pepe, sapone piatti e pastiglie per lavastoviglie. \nLa pulizia era ottima per gli standard americani e, seppur non \u00e8 prevista la pulizia giornaliera, \u00e8 sempre possibile (via app) chiedere degli asciugamani puliti, che vi verranno lasciati in una borsa di carta davanti alla porta. \nAl 15\u00b0 piano c'\u00e8 un piacevole rooftop aperto ai clienti e ben tenuto. Al 7\u00b0 piano ci sono: una lavanderia gratuita, un armadio contenente tutto quello che di solito cambia in camera la cameriera e che si pu\u00f2 prendere in autonomia (carta igienica, sapone, fazzoletti, ma anche the e filtri per il caff\u00e8, zucchero, carta assorbente da cucina e sacchetti per la spazzatura, sapone piatti e pastiglie per lavastoviglie), una zona relax (ottima dopo il check out per fermarsi in attesa della partenza) con un wc e degli armadietti per il deposito bagagli. Questi purtroppo per\u00f2 sono un po' piccoli e in quantit\u00e0 insufficiente per la mole di visitatori: noi infatti li abbiamo trovati tutti occupati, ma abbiamo potuto lasciare i bagagli alla reception. \nAd ogni piano c'\u00e8 lo spazio per buttare la spazzatura. Quando lasciate la stanza non dovete portarla via, ne \u00e8 necessario lavare le stoviglie: \u00e8 compreso nel servizio di pulizia finale. \nSu Jhon St, in direzione opposta al World Trade Center, a pochi passi a piedi, si trova un negozio di casalinghi a basso costo e con ampia scelta. Proprio di fianco c'\u00e8 il ben fornito supermercato Jubilee Market. Poco pi\u00f9 distante \u00e8 presente anche un Whole food market e, vicino al World Trade Center, c'\u00e8 anche Eataly. A due passi dall'edificio diverse sono le possibilit\u00e0 per la colazione e per una fetta di pizza. \nPraticamente sotto l'edificio c'\u00e8 la fermata della metro di Fulton St e, giusto dall'altra parte della strada, la fermata di Cortlandt St: quindi i collegamenti via metro consentono di raggiungere praticamente ogni parte della citt\u00e0,\nA piedi si raggiungono comodamente World Trade Center, Wall Street, Seaport e, con appena qualche passo in pi\u00f9, anche Battery Park.\nLa zona dunque \u00e8 centralissima, ma senza la ressa e il caos di Midtown. La sera \u00e8 tranquillo e sicuro. \nPer noi questa soluzione \u00e8 stata ideale, ci torneremo di sicuro se avremo ancora la possibilit\u00e0 di visitare NYC e lo consigliamo vivamente a tutti!","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"NONE"}

We loved our stay and would highly recommend this location especially if you plan to stay for more than a couple of nights and need extra room. \n\nPros:\n- The building was very quiet. We never heard one sound from a neighboring unit and the elevators (which ran very quickly) were mostly deserted.\n- Fantastic location one block from the 9\/11 Memorial, two blocks from Brookfield Place, a few blocks from the Seaport and on the same block as the Fulton train station. We were able to walk or take the subway everywhere throughout the city.\n- Space was key for us and we loved the layout of the 1BR apartment. The large bedroom contained a very comfortable King bed and a massive closet. The living room had a big banquette, a round table perfect for dining and hanging out, a small kitchenette and a desk area with two rolling chairs which doubled as our makeup \/ vanity area. As the bathroom is a bit dark highly recommend bringing a small freestanding mirror to use in the desk area.\n- No issue at all with requesting fresh towels \/ getting rid of old ones.\n- The rooftop garden is gorgeous and we spend much time up there both during the day and in the evenings.\n- Great shower water pressure.\n- The convenience and accessibility of the Sonder app is fantastic. You use the app to access your room, request towels, ask questions, report issues, check out, etc.\n- We were able to easily extend our checkout by 2 hours very easily via the app.\n\nCons: \n- Our AC wasn't working for the first 3 days of our trip which required constantly contacting the front desk. The issue was resolved pretty quickly each time.\n- The laundry and common area wasn't particularly appealing - overflowing garbage cans in the bathroom and a lack of AC in the middle of Summer kept us from using this space.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Despite our complaints, the front desk informed us that there were no suitable rooms available. When we requested to meet the manager, the front desk showed no cooperation. Our stay lasted for a total of 9 nights.\nYour advertised slogan, \"Sonder | A better way to stay,\" does not hold true.\nPoor Maintenance:\nThe room entrance door cannot be locked from the inside. The water faucet in the bathroom sink is loose. The air-conditioner continues to run even when in \"Off\" mode. One of the bed lamps flickers intermittently, and another small lamp does not work at all. Although the issue was resolved, the TV remote control was initially without batteries. The power outlet near the coffee machine does not work and cannot be reset. The shower corner lacks a safety holding bar.\nThe hotel didn\u2019t send any response to our review in the hotel internet site.\nIt would have been preferable if the reservation center informed guests in advance, during the reservation process, about the only available room facing John Street, which is subject to noise disturbances caused by garbage trucks from 11pm to 2am. I should have had the choice to decide whether or not to proceed with the reservation. This is not a situation where one should gamble on receiving a suitable room.\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Note there was no oven, but microwave, 2 burner, small fridge and small dishwasher\n- the communal laundry was great but can get busy, whilst there was always extra coffee, tea, shampoo, towels, toilet paper etc to just to grab as you needed.\n\nBe wary of negative reviews if they call out check in issues, no problems for me, the key being to have the app set up for you and any guests.

Family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers we had initially booked the radisson on William St but after reading the bad reviews we cancelled and went on the hunt for new accommodation which is when we stumbled across Sonder at City Hall. We had a one bedroom apartment with huge double bed and a pullout sofa for the teens. Apartment had a fully equipped kitchen with every utensil you could think of. Even had a built in dishwasher !!. Building itself is great really modern with 3 lifts which never seemed busy so no unnecessary waiting around. Fully stocked amenities cupboard on the 7th floor in the laundry area that had all the essentials for your apartment. Tea,coffee,sugar,cleaning products etc. Sonder sends you an email couple of days beforehand with your check in details. You get a keycode to the front door which also opens your room. Check in isnt until 4pm so when we arrived at 3pm we asked about going up to the luggage storage are on the 7th floor to store our bags but to our delight we where told our room was ready and we could go straight up. Cant say enough good things about this place and having been to NYC a total of 8 times over the years and staying in various hotels throughout the city definitely next time we will be staying in Sonder. Very convenient location in the financial district so super quiet at night time and 1 minute walk to Fulton Center for the subway.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We had a corner suite room that was around 64 sq. m that had a kitchen, living room and dining room areas with a counter bar island, as well as a Peloton exercise bicycle inside the room for workouts.  The hotel also had free common laundry machines and dryers to use, and they supplied the detergent for free!  This was great for our family as we are on a 2 week Thanksgiving vacation trip.  While the hotel does not have parking, we were able to get street parking for free for 3 days in front of the hotel during our stay!  Check-in was via our mobile phone app and the front door and room had electronic password for entry which was great for us as we did not have to carry around a key or keycard.  While there was no daily room cleaning (perfect for us during these times) service, one could be ordered via the Sonder app for a fee (this is how they keep the hotel room rates low).  Front desk manager and doorman were both great, friendly and able to make recommendations for us.  At first we were not sure about Sonder as had not heard of this name before, we will stay here again for sure, and will now start to look for the Sonder hotel brand when we travel to other cities.

And the apartment is also equipped for a cozy night in with a comfy bed, large TV screen and big enough kitchen to prepare a meal.

We appreciated that it was close to major subway hub, Fulton St, and that there were many food options around (however nothing much after 10pm).  Lobby staff were so helpful and amazing! The Sonder App gets a big + from me.  Very user friendly and had everything i needed to answer major questions during and before my stay.   \n\nReason not a 5 star is because there was not a gym on the property (but did have the option to walk a few blocks to one that partnered with), the stove was a bit small and it did not have an oven, and no washer and dryer.  Not a big deal and we made do without these extras but would have been nice for my long stay.    \n\nWould definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

I will definitely stay at this exact Sonder when I return to NYC and I will discover other Sonder properties around the world. The convenience of using the phone to book the stay, to chat with a concierge for ANYTHING, the beautiful, clean apartment, the amazing location, everything was extremely convenient. Even the use of the iPhone as a key was a great touch. As a World traveler, I highly recommend it!  BTW, I stayed in apartment 159, top floor with my 2 boys (10 & 12).

Rooms are very clean. I like the fact that you don\u2019t have to have your room clean every day. If you need more towels you go through the app. You use the app to launch a mobile key that will get you into the Sonder and into your room. If you happen to have an issue like we did, where the air conditioner just stopped working,  you use the app to report an issue.
