A few setbacks like non working bathrooms on the lobby level which makes it a nuisance if you\u2019re eating at the restaurant or having cocktail because should you need the restroom you need to go to the 4th floor which kind of kills the vibe. Which leads me to the non working escalators which would make it extremely convenient because it takes you directly to the 4th floor and is located right by the bar\/restaurant. Another issue, the doors. Those doors slam hard. Very hard. At all hours of the night. It makes it hard to sleep if you\u2019re a light sleeper. It sometimes feels like it\u2019s the door to your room that\u2019s being opened or broken into. Aside from that, the stay was great. It is close to everything and anything. It\u2019s seriously my favorite location to stay at because of the location alone. The prices are very reasonable also. I do want to give a shout out to Evelyn at the front desk. I had so many issues with my rooms and the correct names registered. No fault of the Crown Plaza because we booked with a 3rd party. Although complicated, Evelyn was extremely patient and worked though the issues and made everything right. Thank you!! All in all this is a great place. The bartenders were also so nice. They remembered us and our drinks and when they saw us coming they began preparing them before we even sat. You guys were amazing.

This was my first return since Covid and I was very taken aback by how far standards have slipped, so  much so that I have needed to remove it from being the recommended Manhattan hotel to my clients. The hotel has lost direction in virtually every way possible and only just attains the standard of a 3* hotel. Gone are the days when it comfortably provided 4* standards and service.\n\nThe rooms are timeworn and haven't been upgraded for years. Whilst my room was generally clean, I was shocked to find that the extractor vent in the bathroom had caked on dirt (see photo). There were no bath robes in the bathroom and it was unbelievable that the drinking cups in the bathroom were made of cheap plastic. The bed was comfortable and the room temperature could be controlled with ease. \n\nI was shocked beyond measure to find that the hotel no longer provides a breakfast service and I find this to be totally unacceptable. This was not mentioned on the website. It is a disgrace that guests need to leave the hotel to eat breakfast. The hotel also used to have an onsite gym that was part of a local New York chain.  That has now closed down but, again, there was no mention of this on the website.\n\nThe only staff members who showed any interest in guests were the receptionists.  They were clearly embarassed at the degraded service and suggested quite openly that the management cared only about income streams.\n\nAbout 100 hotels in New York now charge a ridiculous Resort Fee,  Crowne Plaza, Times Square is one of them.  IHG needs to recognise that this hote is not a resort and their claim that it covers internet and phone calls is insulting. IHG 1 status  boasts that members receive free internet connection.  Is this not a contradictory statement since IHG 1 guests are not exempt from the Resort Fee? In this day and age who makes phone calls from their hotel room when everyone carries a mobile phone and has internet connection for video chat?  The concept of Resort Fees is nothing short of  a money spinner for the hotels, and one that does not serve breakfast at that.  I am aghast that this fee is also levied on IHG 1 guests who are using reward nights.  Have the number of points needed for a night's accommodation been decreased as a consequence?  They have not.  They have in fact increased.\n\nI must recognise the service provided by Evelyn M on reception. She was animated and very friendly and she was the one highlight of my stay.\n\nIHG and Crowne Plaza Times Square is on very shaky ground at present and I would not even consider setting foot on the premises again when there is a new Kimpton hotel (part of the IHG group) just around the corner.

I gave her the confirmation number and she found it. Then told me I would have to check out in the morning and check back in for the second night. That is not acceptable and 20 minutes later, this was cleared up by a manger. Went to the room, thermostat was broken. Maintenance came up and confirmed it was broken and then told me even with a good thermostat, I could not have heat. It was turned off in the entire hotel. It was 47 degrees out. They brought me a space heater. Went down for dinner. the restaurant is closed. only the bar is open. Ask for a dinner menu. the only thing they serve, in the entire hotel for dinner, is bar food like chicken wings. Not even a hamburger.

When I am going to the theatre or Lincoln Center, I appreciate the convenience the Crowne Plaza Hotel affords me, literally a short walk to most theatres. In the past, I have experienced some of the issues with room temperature and hot water that some reviewers have mentioned. However, during my last few stays, those problems seem to have been addressed, by and large.\n\nMy last stay was very pleasant, primarily due to Victoria, the woman who checked me in at the front desk. Of the dozens of stays I have had in New York, nobody comes up to the standard set by her. There have been times in this same hotel when my check in ranged from professional, friendly, and efficient, to bored and going through the motions. Victoria made me feel that she was happy to welcome me and went out of her way to treat me with the friendly professionalism that should be the norm in any hotel. \n\nSo much of a guest\u2019s experience depends on his or her initial intake experience. In this post Covid era, one would think every hotel would try to up their game. This should especially be the case in this hotel, since they lack an on-site sit down eating option due to their restaurant never reopening after the pandemic. While that is a decided disadvantage, a pleasant welcome would go a long way towards soothing guests\u2019 disappointment.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

Upon entering the hotel late at night (around 10ish), we appreciated the security measure of being asked to show our room card, providing a sense of safety.

The beds were pretty comfortable, and the abundance of charger ports throughout the room was convenient. The elevators were fast and there was hardly ever a wait.\n\nCons: The small entrance made the hotel somewhat challenging to spot. Unexpected additional taxes and fees were a downside. Unfortunately, our room was not up to par upon arrival. Although offered a new room due to used towels in the bathroom, I assumed it was a simple oversight by housekeeping. However, my optimism faded when I discovered a hair in the bathtub later on. The following day, we noticed a hole in the wall behind the door and stains on the chair. Then, we couldn't get the temperature in our room to go below 74 degrees. When we reached out to maintenance, we were informed that there was no air conditioning in March (considered winter), and the suggested solution was to open a window. Eventually, a fan was provided. Additionally, it's worth noting that, while my oversight, the room lacked a refrigerator and microwave, leading to a lot of wasted food. Oh, and my daughters later found a long hair that did not belong to any of us. Plus, we found a towel folded on the nightstand that I had assumed my daughter put there.

Called desk as was advised to do, was told security would be there to reprogram lock. Waited 30 minutes in hall, no one came. Went back downstairs (third time) and was told they would be there. Returned to room, waited another few minutes and security came. They were very apologetic, and said they were never told to come. At 10:30 went to shower, no hot water. Tried to call desk from phone in room, phone did not work. Called number from website on cell, could not get through. Finally reached someone. Snarky maintenance man came, said we needed to let water run for a few minutes. I explained we let it run 1\/2 hour! Not even warm. Bedside lamp would not turn off, had to unplug it.

Supposedly a 4 star hotel but have received better amenities, accommodations and guest\/customer service at a budget hotel. Room was absolutely abysmal and the IHG name should not be on this hotel.

Graffiti on walls, rust stains on counters, what looked like vomit stains next to the bed, electrical box hanging out of the wall with wires exposed, furniture and safe broken, heat unable to be turned down so the room was boiling hot the entire time, just to name a FEW. I have many pictures to prove it. Tried to get my experience amended by hotel manager and move rooms. She informed me the hotel was sold out for the stay and the best she said she could do was refund the measly service fee. At this point we didn\u2019t have much of an option so we accepted the service fee refund and decided to handle the experience once we got home. I tried to initiate a refund directly through guest relations and the same hotel manager responded by saying they would not refund since we declined a room change. She completely lied and is trying to pass off her accountability in this onto a guest. I would have been more than happy to move rooms if that was actually an option offered to us. As I stated before, that was the FIRST THING I ASKED. I have now disputed the charge through my credit card company. I have never had to do such a thing before.

Lucky I did, despite the request being  on my details the receptionist had allocated us a room by the lifts!!\nThe room was ok to look at but was actually quite dirty - bits on carpet, dirty sink that could clearly be seen in the mirror and then on last night when I went to use the hairdryer I discovered underneath the sink was filthy - see photo. I took some new slippers with me and the bottoms were dirty after our stay so if I hadn\u2019t my feet would have been on the dirty floor! The cleaning staff also conducted very loud conversations in the corridors on a morning - not conducive to a quiet start if you wanted one!\nThe only things you got in the room were shampoo, conditioner, lotion and shower gel and on three out of our four day stay, we did not have our shower gel replaced. Coffee and polystyrene cups were provided but once again not always replenished and it wasn\u2019t till last day when had to ask yet again for cups that we realised there were actually stirrers!\nThe towels were small and quite thin and very poor quality.\nThe staff were not interested and despite asking to see the manager I am still waiting, presume too busy with all the many complaints? \nHaving gone on here it is clear that the hotel know what these problems are and are doing nothing about it.

One lady was nicer than the rest but didn\u2019t get her name. We used the restaurant on our 2nd night, it was ok, again I don\u2019t get any warmth from the staff and felt a bit awkward. We will return due to the location, large room and comfy bed. ","travelDate":"2023-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I recently stayed at this hotel Nov 29-Dec 1 2023, and was very disappointed. I had NO HOT WATER for 2 days the ac\/heat did not work properly. The worst part of my stay was the loud noises from the vents. It sounded like the vents were breaking or gargling for 2 days... we weren't able to get any sleep. Just all around very uncomfortable. I paid $450 dollars per night for such a terrible experience. Not to mention the amenities are none existent. Not even a robe or microwave unless you want to pay $30 extra. I brought my son so he could experience the Rockefeller tree lighting hoping to have a pleasant and peaceful stay. That did not happen. Rockefeller was great but the Crowne Plaza hotel was a huge disappointment.

I did say that I wasn\u2019t happy to be told that there was nothing they could do apart from maybe waive the nightly facility fee which I had already paid in full for our stay through Booking.com. We took the downgraded room as we had no option and when we arrived, the room was filthy, it had a dirty, old wash cloth over the shower head, blood on the bed sheets (I have photos which I also sent to the manager), the lamps did not work and neither did the hairdryer. The USB charger on the alarm clock also wasn\u2019t working. The room felt like it hadn\u2019t been used, cleaned or maintained in a very long time. I went to reception and told them I wasn\u2019t happy and it wasn\u2019t good enough. The manager asked me to send her the photos which I did and she gave us another (downgraded) room. She didn\u2019t really seem to be that bothered or care about the issues we were having. We got the key card for the new room and went up in the elevator to the 38th floor for the key not work on the door and the lock just kept flashing red. I went back down to reception again to be told that the key should work but they will send security to the room to check if the battery needed to be changed in the key card lock itself. They sent security and sure enough, the battery was dead in the lock. The guy that came gave it a quick charge so we could enter. He said that he would send an engineer up asap to change out the battery and not to worry, that we didn\u2019t need to stay in the room and that it would all be fixed by the time we got back. As it was our first night in New York, we went out for dinner. We arrived back a good few hours later and of course, the key card wouldn\u2019t work again and nobody had bothered to come to fix it. We then had to wait AGAIN for someone from security to come up at 0330am to give the lock a quick charge just so we could enter the room.

The same bus also goes to the big outlet mall next to Newark airport.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We stayed in a King Room with Times Square View. The rooms we can't fault - nicely sized, comfortable, clean and not forgetting the amazing views! The check-in\/front desk staff\/porters were absolutely amazing and super helpful and friendly! Absolutely nothing to fault! However, the one bad experience we had at this hotel absolutely ruined our stay for us and has left a bitter taste in our mouths. My husband and I went to go get coffee and cake from Starbucks one evening, upon our return - we decided to sit at the bar to finish off our coffee and cake; then the waiter came up to us to advise the bar is closed. We advised her it's okay - we don't want to order anything and just wanted to finish off our coffee and chat with our family and friends on wifi as that area was the only area we could access wifi at the hotel (the hotel wifi wasnt working in the rooms, in the 2 days we had been there already), we will leave when the guests start leaving as there were still over 10 guests at the bar finishing off their drinks. She then called a lady who is apparently the manager named Shahana, whom I find  hard to believe is a manager - not with the way she handled the situation. Shahana then arrived and demanded us to leave the bar, otherwise she will call security if we refuse to leave. Like we are some sort of criminals, forgetting that we are paying hotel guests (our rooms cost a fortune!). And eventually, she did call security who escorted us out. This situation really could've been managed better. Especially after the inconvenience of not having wifi for 2 days, the least they could do was allow us to sit at the bar with comfortable seating to access it and finish off our coffee. We were not bothering anyone. Not just chase us away when there are still other guests there. I myself am in the conferencing & events industry, managing outbound conferences worldwide, but not once have I experienced such treatment from hotel staff. Crowne Plaza is a world famous brand and to have your management treat guests like that is really worrying. Based on insider information, I know you've recently opened after being closed for the longest time due to Covid and were made to reopen, and with this re-opening it came with new staff members. Whom I think are not fit for a customer service role - or need to be trained when it comes to conflict resolution with guests.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

So the shower has clear instructions on how to turn it anti clockwise fully to get the hot water. Once you\u2019ve done this you can then dial back the temp.

I also noticed we chose to stay during St. Patrick's Day weekend, so we wanted to arrive before the parade. We emailed the hotel about this and they said it shouldn't be a problem to do early check-in, but it may take a few hours. We arrived at 9am and thought we should be able to get a room by noon. We checked in when we arrived and our rooms were not yet ready and we were also told that it shouldn't be a problem to get a conjoined room. They said check back with them at noon. We had them check our bags and we went off to walk around. When we got back, we checked on our rooms and they said that they were still not ready and said they should be able to get the rooms ready after 3pm - we had been waiting since 9am at that point and were exhausted. Finally, we checked in again at 3pm and our rooms were ready, but they didn't get us our requested conjoined rooms that they said shouldn't be a problem. \n\nWe finally get into our rooms, but discovered right away that there was no toilet paper and no towels - were they really prepping the rooms?

My flight was canceled for the first day, American Airlines fixed everything, but it was painful trying to get the Crowne to help me out, considering that the airlines caused my flight cancellation. However, they got it resolved and I thought good, thank you for the understanding even though it took you some time, this will be a good trip. However, I got to my room, it definitely does not have a great time square view even though I paid extra for it for my kids, and the cleaning service kept taking our towels without replacing them. By the second night, getting back late at 11:30, I had to call them at 11:45pm for towel for the morning. after 50 minutes, at 12:38am had to call again to get the towels. I stayed up till 1:15 waiting for these towels (e didn\u2019t even have a hand towel!). We also have never had consistent hot water, showers are so painful, we have to get in and out within five minutes, or wait. 15 minutes for the water to get hot. We\u2019ve had maintenance come up a couple of times, but it has not resolved the issue. Don\u2019t even think about having two people take back to back showers. Imagine a group of 3?!.

I wanted to love this hotel There were so many choices around and, in hindsight, I wish after the first night I would have moved to another hotel. First, upon check-in, where we were told we were getting a \"complimentary upgrade\" to a corner room, we were given a dirty room. Pillows and linens were all over, debris on the floor, the bathroom had not been touched. I called downstairs and it took almost 30 minutes for someone to come get us and bring us to a different room. Of course, this one was a standard room but at least it had been cleaned. It was also super hot. At 10 pm in the middle of January, with temps outside in the 20s-30s, I thought all I would need to do was turn down the thermostat. Wrong. It was already set to 65, but the temp in the room was 78. I called downstairs for the second time in the first hour since arriving. Maintenance came up and told me there was no way to turn off the heat, no way to switch to cool air, and the only way to cool the room down would be to open the window. I was shocked that the window would even open. It sure did. No screen, tons of grossness around the entire inside of the window frame, and now we could hear every single noise coming from Times Square, not to mention the damp air from the ongoing rain which made us both feel awful in the morning. Opening the window only cooled the room down a couple of degrees. It was still way too hot the entire time. I tried to ask again about a different room and was told they are all the same way. At 9 am the first morning, while we were still sleeping, someone was banging on the door like the building was on fire, By the time I was almost at the door to open it, housekeeping was opening the door on their own. Thankfully I had the safety bar engaged so they couldn't open it all the way. I opened it and the housekeeper just stared at me. I told her that we would not be out of the room for a couple of hours and she just huffed away. I ended up putting out our Do Not Disturb sign for our whole three-night stay because at that point I was not interested in having someone in my room while we were out. On Day 3 I called down to ask for clean towels and for someone to come grab our trash. Neither happened. I called again and added a request for more coffee in our room. Again, nothing. The staff was all super rude the entire time we were there and no one seemed to care about the issues we were having. Blank stares and short answers were about all we got. Once we were home, I contacted IHG to complain about the hotel. They said they would contact the hotel directly to have someone call me. I got one email from the hotel asking me to call them. I called numerous times and was never able to ever speak with management there. They obviously do not want to hear any feedback.

It was our favorite hotel while visiting New York City a few times a year. This is our first visit back since they re-opened in November. It was VERY DISAPPOINTING! Our room 1610 was very small and dark and dingy. The website advertised that the rooms were renovated so upon check-in I asked the girl if we were getting a renovated room? She promptly let me know that none of the rooms have been renovated since 2010. I explained that on the website they are advertised as such. She said that was not the case. Going up to our room the first thing I noticed is how dark it was in the room\u2026,,when I opened the curtains they were hard to open because one of the plastic liners that keeps the light out was ripped. When I finally got it open, I realized how filthy the curtains were. UGH The room was clean, but very old. The bedding was new, thank goodness, and the towels looked all fresh with a new fresh shower curtain. It was cold in New York City this past weekend going down to 33\u00b0. We went and grabbed a bite to eat and when we got back the room was 65\u00b0, we had put the heat on before we left but it never moved. Our vent was blowing cold air. We called down and engineering came up. The gentleman was very sweet and he told us that in an hour we would have heat, that the whole system kicks on at a certain time, and it was really out of his control. THREE hours later we still had no heat it was still 65\u00b0 in the room and we were freezing. We called engineering again. They came back and this time the gentleman told us that he was going to get us a heater for the room that we could plug-in so we would have heat. He said the heat was adjusted according to the central office, and it only flips on when the outside temperature gets very cold. I guess crown plaza doesn\u2019t realize that 33\u00b0 outside IS very cold. He brought the heater back and thankfully that got us through the Weekend! The room  heat did kick on around 1 AM but never warm enough to shut the portable heater off. The price of this hotel is very expensive and I did not expect subpar accommodations. The housekeeping department was very sweet and consisted of a very nice lady. We were staying two nights so after the first night, I told her she didn\u2019t have to do the room we would make the bed but I needed fresh towels. the poor lady felt bad telling me that she had no hand towels and no washcloths. By the way, this was 10 AM in the morning it was not late in the day, so why she didn\u2019t have any I have no idea. She said she would bring them back later, but she never did. From start to finish. also, the restaurant is still not opened. They definitely need to open the restaurant it was pouring raining and we really didn\u2019t feel like going out, but we had no choice because there was nothing to eat at the hotel. The bar opens at 5:30 which they should open this earlier in the day if the restaurant is closed. also put back the chairs in the waiting area. People need to be able to sit down while their family is checking in. Everything else in New York is open why the delay in all the amenities at this hotel??This was a very disappointing stay at the Crowne plaza.

The views are panoramic and was even able to get the room temperature down to 76 degrees at one point! I almost had to use a blanket.\n\nWant to wash your face after a long trip in? Forget it.

It looks like it woke up after a rough night of partying in 1996 and needs a shower.

Nowhere on my original reservation was this impending fee notated and the front desk made no mention of it at check in. I use reward night stays at dozens of hotels every year. This just NEVER happens. I'm not sure what you get for this service fee but hospitality and wash cloths aren't one of them.\n\nI've reached out to the General Manager for an explanation of this service fee charge. It's been over a week and no response.\n\nOn the bright side, the location is still great for going to see Broadway shows.

Rooms are good sized if we consider this is right at the center of everything. Try to get Times Square facing rooms on higher floors.

They did accordingly reduce the room tariff at the time of check-in but this is still not a good situation to be in. If they were not sure of serving breakfasts, they should have made it clear at the time of booking. I (and maybe many like me) might have possibly not booked a stay in that case, as when one is on a holidays the best thing is to be sure of a convenient sumptuous breakfast to begin the day with. In this case it was a daily challenge to go out and have breakfast somewhere else. I consider it an unethical business practice to allow bookings with a breakfast included plan (to attract customers) and then not serve breakfast. It\u2019s some sort of a cheating I must say as when we land up at the hotel, at the lapse moment we don\u2019t have a choice but to check-in.\nAnd this is the only reason I have given this hotel a rating of 3, else this would be a 5","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We arrived after a long journey. My booking was for my husband, myself and our teenage children. We had a booking for four rooms and we arrived at 8pm.\n\nWhen we arrived at check in, they asked us to pay $375 per room. I\u2019m not sure about you, but I don\u2019t have that kind of money spare. When I said I couldn\u2019t pay this, they said they would cancel my booking, even though I had paid upfront. We were not made aware of this and after checking the website again, it\u2019s not mentioned anywhere on there. Also at 8pm at night one of our rooms were not ready. The first gentleman was very unhelpful, but thankfully Evelyn took over. She said if we couldn\u2019t pay, they would cancel. Again I explained that we couldn\u2019t afford to pay this. Seriously, who could!!! I explained that it was all my children and did we have to pay this for every room. Again, yes. She then said she would speak to her manager to see if she could reduce it to just the resort fee of $40 per night. Might not sound a lot now, but would still amount to $800 for my family. I am disgusted that they think this is ok. I dread to think of young people turning up here without a back up! Our options now were to pay the $800 or look for a new hotel at 8pm at night with our children in tow, pay for another room and then wait for a refund. So our only option really was to pay this. I just want to make everyone aware of this as we were now down a large chunk of our spending money for nothing! As our room wasn\u2019t ready, we got one room upgraded. This was room 45\/09. It has a nice view of Times Sq. \n\nI am unsure what the resort fee was for as nothing was open.\n\nI tried to speak to a manger again a couple of days later as had been trying to see if it was mentioned on website. It\u2019s not and I asked her why. She just shrugged her shoulders. She was so unhelpful and very rude. Suppose that\u2019s why she got the managers job. She told me to go check the paperwork, unfortunately I must have binned this in our room at some point. \n\nSuch a shame as our room was lovely. Good view, amazingly comfortable bed, clean room. Room cleaned daily and fresh towels daily. Lifts were always only a few seconds away. \n\nCheck in seems to take forever.  There is always a queue and always very slow moving. This is also why I waited a few days to try to speak to someone again. Always too busy! \n\nI heard many people moaning about this fee of $375, so not just me.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t stay here again because of this fee. Shame as good location.

The room was in 38th floor and you were always able to get a lift without queuing. The room was clean and tidy and kept in good order. The bed was really comfortable. The maid service was daily and I cannot say there was things missed it always looked cleaned upon or return. We like others had issues with the loo but it was fixed immediately. I really can\u2019t complain.

The second time this happend was increadibly alarming, as they did not ask for any proof that it was our room, they just gave us keys. I shudder to think that anyone could have asked for a key to any room.\n\nHouse-keeping was also very off-putting, as litter was left lying in the room, but very special care was taken to re-arrange our underwear.\n\nThe cherry on top has to be that once these issues were raised, they agreed to waive the hidden fees and \"service charges\" for everyone's stay. Despite this promise, and not charging anyone else in the group, a full 8 days after checking out they took the money from the card they kept on file.

I've been to NYC many times, and my daughter had been a couple of times prior to this trip; however, I've never chosen a hotel in Times Square before.  Since our trip was focused on seeing a few Broadway shows, I decided to try this Crowne Plaza and used my points to pay for it.  I received an email about a week or two before the stay that asked if I'd like to request an upgrade for an additional charge, and I quickly sent that in.  I knew it wasn't guaranteed, and I wouldn't be charged if I didn't get the upgrade.\n\nWe took a taxi from LGA to the hotel and arrived right around the stated check in time, and the line was LONG. It went pretty quickly until the group right in front of my daughter and me got to the desk.  It was a group of 5 friends who were very upset that the hotel had lost their reservations. The front desk staff called a manager out to try and sort it, and it was discovered that they were at the wrong IHG property.  Honestly, how does someone (let alone a group) take a taxi to the wrong hotel? I was very impressed with the front desk staff as they handled this very difficult group.  Not once did they lose their smiles or tempers, and I didn't even see them roll their eyes once (as I was doing behind them). \n\nAfter that group was sent on their way to their correct NYC hotel, my daughter and I were able to check into our room.  I was immediately thanked for being a Platinum, being so patient waiting, and told that I did receive my upgrade.  The wonderful check in employee (I wish I remembered his name) told me that he was putting me in his favorite room that was eligible for the upgrade.  He also gave me vouchers for free breakfasts each day for my daughter and me and A LOT of drink vouchers to make up for the inconvenience of standing behind that group. Our check in was quick, and I was very impressed with the entire staff that I encountered.  They were very welcoming and a great asset to the Crowne Plaza.\n\nMy daughter and I went up to our room, and we couldn't believe the view! We had a corner room with huge windows that overlooked Times Square, and my daughter's reaction was worth every dime I had spent on the upgrade (which was, I think, around $50 per night).  She immediately claimed the bed that was closer to the windows and kept talking about how lucky we were to get this room.  When we went downstairs to start walking around the city a bit, we stopped by the front desk to thank the gentleman who checked us in.  He was thrilled that we loved the room, and I'm sure he'll never know that for my daughter, it made her birthday trip even more magical (she still mentions our room 2 years later).\n\nWe did have breakfast in the hotel every morning, and the buffet was wonderful. Also (since I had so many drink coupons), my daughter and I visited the bar area a few times (she ordered her Sprite, and I ordered my lager), and all of those employees were great and engaging. \n\nThe beds were very comfortable, and the room (aside from the fantastic view) was wonderful. If you're in NYC once Broadway opens again and this hotel does, too, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here. I do hope, however, that IHG investigates exactly what has gone wrong with refunding so many guests' deposits. At the end of the day, it impacts how travelers view the IHG brand.","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"NONE"}

Staff were on hand all the time should you need anything.\nEasy walk to the Christmas tree, Macy's and all the other stores as well as Broadway theatres so no complaints on location either.\nThe only sour note was the imposition of a very heavy \"resort tax\" levied by most NYC hotel.

This didn\u2019t happen even though the hotel didn\u2019t seem full but never mind, it was just one of those things.\n\nThe room we did get allocated was extremely small for four of us but again, just one of those things.\n\nOn our first night, we hardly got any sleep as the connecting door in our room to the room next door was constantly rattling.  It sounded like there must have been a draft that was making it shake.  However, we managed to resolve this ourselves by sticking two pieces of cardboard in it (as shown on the picture).\n\nThe next day, we found that we didn\u2019t have any hot water coming from the bath or shower.  After trying for quite a while to get it hot by letting it run, we had no joy so informed reception on our way out.\nWhen we returned late that afternoon, it still wasn\u2019t working and wasn\u2019t even sure if anyone had even attended our room to attempt to fix it.\n\nAfter this it was reported another three times and there was only one time we were in the room when an engineer arrived, which was on the last evening.  The engineer explained that to get the shower running hot you had to run the sink tap for 5 minutes and then run the bath tap for 5 minutes and then put the shower on and it will be warm.   How ridiculous is that??  He seemed to think it was common knowledge of that is what you need to do??  \n\nOnce the water in the shower was finally running warm, the pressure was terrible which meant the two of us who have very long thick hair were unable to wash our hair as the pressure was just not good enough.\nTo not have hot water for 3 nights and 4 days of being in a hotel is totally unacceptable. \n\nThe staff on reception were very polite each time we reported it but the service of actually getting it fixed was non-existent, until the engineer attended on the last evening to give us the instructions of how to get it warm.\nThere were no drinks vouchers, or nothing waived from the resort fee, so it wasn\u2019t great having to pay another \u00a3100 on check out for the hotel when we hadn\u2019t even had hot water, which you would think is a basic requirement.\n\nOn our previous visit 4 years earlier, we had no problems at all which was why we returned to the same hotel.\n\nUnfortunately, we won\u2019t be staying at the Crowne Plaza when we next visit New York.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Coffee and Tea facilities in room which was great, and the food in the restaurant and bars was perfectly acceptable. The Cuban sandwich and chicken wings were awesome from the Broadway Bar... \n\nWe only had breakfast once and it was fine but expensive and with a million options in the area we wanted to try other places everyday. \n\nThe bar and restaurant are quite expensive but probably average for the area $10 for a pint of IPA for example so a couple of drinks for the 3 of us after a busy day and we were looking at around $60+ every night. \n\nThe shower was awful, no pressure and the controls were either ice cold or lava so was difficult to get a decent flow going. But that was our only complaint.\n\nBig shout out to Tony in the Broadway bar! What a absolute gent he was.

Let\u2019s start this out on a very strong positive: the staff. Specifically, Grant, John and Krisch. I hope IHG knows what assets they are to these men as they are exactly the type of people they should strive to employ. I was pleasantly surprised by their extreme professionalism when assisting me. I didn\u2019t expect a text to reach out to me checking in, seeing if there was anything they could do to make my stay better. Sure, being and IHG Gold Elite member ensures a little extra recognition but these are just great guys who know how to make you feel like you\u2019re at a 5 star hotel even when you\u2019re not. Speaking of not, the rooms really lack here. Unfortunately, the HVAC didn\u2019t work and the room was mid 70\u2019s as opposed to mid 60\u2019s where we like it. We had several other troubles with the room, too. We would\u2019ve traded rooms but my son was too tired to deal. The phone line to call Valet went right to voicemail and a full voicemail at that. For the extreme prices they charge to park, that\u2019s frustrating. There is no real lobby as far as lots of seating for people watching, relaxing. Just the bar area. The adjacent restaurant has the advantage of having a front seat view of Times Square yet it\u2019s a plain white room and empty..and closed often. So odd. The location of the hotel is certainly a plus. Near everything! The no-frills coffee grab-n-go area is well stocked with some delicious Italian coffee and very fresh croissants. No place to sit and eat which is a\nshame but really well made stuff and not awful price points, especially compared to the very high prices at the Broadway Bar. I really felt welcome here. It makes me want to come back. Until they update and repair the rooms, bathrooms specifically, I am thinking I may try another IHG run location for now but I am hopeful to return here at some point. Thanks again to the people who made sure I\u2019ll never forget the Crowne Plaza to be a worthy option. ","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were on the 35th floor and the views were amazing. The room was so clean, modern and big. The rooms have black out curtains, are warm and the rooms are made up with clean bedding every day. Big TVs with hairdryers too.  The beds are so big like super king size so we had a fantastic sleep all week. Fresh towels are put out in the bathroom each day and such a nice touch the  complimentary small toiletries in the bathroom. The showers are so large and hot water so quickly. \n\nOne day was so magical as it was snowing all day so the views from our room was amazing looking down from so high up. The hotel was lovely decorated all for Christmas and we ate in the hotel  restaurant once and the food was nice. The bar area was extra special as some lovely views so sit near the front to look over Times  Square. Lovely touch near the lifts was a food\/drink area where you can buy wine, coffee and other refreshments, fresh danishes for breakfast, lunches like sandwiches and baguettes and salads, lots of yummy cakes. We took a couple of cheese board boxes to our room one day which was lovely and the hotel are very flexible if you take food back to your room which is nice from outside places. \n\nThe concierge was extremely helpful and helped us book some sight saver passes which saved quite a bit of money and they helped out with us getting to and from places and provided maps too. \n\nWhen we checked out the receptionist asked when we were leaving and gave us some more free drink vouchers for the bar to get a drink each until our transfer picked us up directly outside the hotel for the airport which was very kind. \n\nSo all in all the Crown Plaza we can\u2019t thank you all enough you made this 50th birthday for me extra extra special and anyone wanting a fantastic stay in the heart of Times Square, New York we recommend here as the staff are lovely and friendly and the hotel is so modern you\u2019d struggle to find somewhere as good.

There are positives and negatives to being in Times Square though! Everything is at your fingertips but it\u2019s more expensive, including every meal you\u2019ll eat, and there\u2019s lots of noise and crowds.  I was here for work, and needed to be near the 1 train and the E train (to get to and from JFK\u2019s AirTrain) so this fit the bill. \nWas the hotel clean and comfortable? Yes. Did I sleep well? Yes. They had free WiFi and a gym.  But it was just average for me.  It didn\u2019t have some of the basic things I expect when I travel (I should say I usually stay at Marriotts). It didn\u2019t have a mini-fridge, which would have been nice and seems to be almost a given.  For the large size of the lobby, I was really surprised and disappointed that they only had a handful of chairs for guests to sit in. The hotel is 30+ stories, not sure how many guests it holds, but the only place to sit other than your room is in their bar\/restaurant seating. To me that\u2019s very inconvenient, especially if you are in town with a large group and you are waiting for people to assemble in the lobby. There were always just groups of people standing around, and I don\u2019t know about you, but when I go to NYC I put on 15-20,000 steps a day, so I like to sit when I can \ud83d\ude03. \nAnother thing I thought was strange was that the shower water took a very long time to get warm. I called maintenance and the guy who came up told me I just had to run it for a long, long time and it might get warmer (doesn\u2019t this go against their \u201csustainability goals\u201d?) If not call back tomorrow and they would change the cartridge.... um why would I have to call back tomorrow? Put in a work order, that\u2019s your responsibility not mine. I also requested that the ice maker on my floor get fixed, and he showed me that it was making ice but not spitting it out. He let me take as much as I wanted but I was told it wouldn\u2019t get fixed, there were other things to do. Previously, the front desk people were apologetic about the ice and told me I could go up or downstairs... of course I can, and that\u2019s why they are getting an average rating.

After great experience with Crown Plaza hotels around the world we werde expecting a prefect stay, as usual. Unfortunately it wasn't. The hotel has an ugly, dark lobby. Check-in was distant and it seemed we were disturbing. The we got the first room, which should have Times Square view. Well, the view was on the Times Square - if you press your face on the window. From the 40th level you don't really see anything but the windows  of the opposite buildings. The other thing was the room itself: wallpaper came of the walls, bathroom was dirty, all furniture were damaged. The windows was not closing completely. The room was tiny and so was the bathroom. After complaining we have got a similar room on the 36th level with better view on Times Square. The furniture were not as much damaged as in the other room. The bathroom was cleaner, but the wallpaper dissolved of the walls.\nOK, there is one more good thing we can say about the hotel: the breakfast was good.\nThe price-performance ratio was unacceptable.

I would have expected king size beds but it was fine. A very small wardrobe, ok for a couple of nights but we struggled for space for 3 of us over 5 nights, we had to hang 3 or 4 things on each hanger.\nA good size bathroom and great shower.\nThe room had fabulous views overlooking times square, we were on 44th floor out of 45!

This trip was a sun-wed. I have always found the location convenient, the hotel clean and maintained, and the service good. \n\nHowever, this trip was a series of disappointments. There were 3 issues\n\nFirst, on arrival at my room, I found myself disappointed in the cleanliness of the room. Crumbs and food debris on the desk, the floor had not been vacuumed, and there were water stains on the sink vanity. The worst feeling was when I opened the dresser drawers and found items and paper waste from the prior occupant. But the linens and towels were fresh and having had good experiences in the past, I thought I would wave it off and it would be cleaned the next day. I carry sanitizing wipes with me when I travel so I cleaned a bit myself. \n\nUnfortunately, it was not. For the entire trip housekeeping was way below par. While the bed was made, towels replaced, and the toiletries replenished, the floor continued to be an ongoing problem and surfaces were generally left uncleaned. \n\nSecond, maintenance has been allowed to fall behind. The lamps had shorts and blinked if the table was bumped. Wallpaper was stained, paint chipped, etc. \n\nBut the final straw was when a loud customer moved into the room next to me, others in his party in other rooms on the hallway.  It went on with arguments, doors slamming, loud music, screaming, TVs blaring, etc. from 10:30 pm to 4:30 AM.\n\nI called the front desk, the line had been turned off for the night. I tried concierge, bell stand, housekeeping, lost and found, even room service. Every line either went to an answering machine or busy signal. I tried calling from my cell to the local phone number-busy signal. I called the 800 number for the chain, they put me on hold then hung up on me. This went on for hours. I finally called another IHG hotel on Times Square and asked for security and explained the scenario. To their credit they contacted the hotel and someone came up and told them to quiet down. Not fifteen minutes later they started back up with the noise. I tried all of the phones again- same problem - answering machines and busy signals. I finally went to the people\u2019s doors and threatened each one with calling the police. They then settled down for the night. \n\nNeedless to say, they have lost my business.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

More disappointing is the staff attitude, which is awful. Went to the bar to order a drink, only to be told to find a table from where I could order from and then wait over 30 minutes to actually place an order. This continued throughout my stay, again awful attitude, given the wrong bill. If you stay here, avoid restaurant and bar at all costs.\n\nSaying that the check in and check out process wasn\u2019t much better, with staff attitude very disappointing.\n\nThere is also the issue of the blatant con of charging over $35 a day for a gym you will probably never use, phone calls when you use your mobile and a one off free drink in the worst hotel bar I\u2019ve ever been in.\n\nMy advice is avoid. There are other hotels in within close vicinity and would recommend trying these before going to the Crowne Plaza.  \n\n","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The Crowne Plaza Time Square certainly fills that bill but unfortunately  there were things that added up and distracted from what other wise was a wonderful trip.\n+On the positive side, the Crowne Plaza is perfectly situated on Broadway and 48th in the heart of mid-town. The property is impressive with a great bar that overlooks Times Square. The rooms fine and the sports center is terrific.\nHowever, the service lacked on several counts.\n1) Before arriving ,  we had trouble getting through to the front desk. I attempted to call the hotel directly  to find out where to check in with a car. (including while on route) and finally was told to just pull in on Broadway.  However , when we arrived we discovered that construction blocked entrence and it took 25 minutes driving around the block several times to find the unmarked entrance. The lack of information by the staff handling the phones, given the hectic Manhattan pace, was upsetting.\n2) The concierge desk was a joke. Either no one was there, or there was a long line or when you left a message which they promised to return they did not (three times) (Thank God for the internet.) Finally when I actually spoke with a concierge person, she was not helpful at all.\n3) In trying to get a cab to Brooklyn, after asking the doorman, we waited twenty minutes before being told that cabs didn't go there.  Irked , I resorted to Uber and thank God, for they saved our reservation.        \n\nManhattan at Christmas time is magical and the hotel over all wasn't bad, it's just that even given the stress of the fully booked conditions, the communication with its guests  about basic information should have been better.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

My  husband and I with our two grown up kids checked into the hotel and stayed for 5 nights.  We booked two rooms through a third party operator and found out when we arrived that one of the rooms was cancelled.  The first front desk officer who served us was not helpful.  He said he could not do anything for us as the hotel was fully booked and asked us to talk to the third party operator. We tried to contact the third party operator but they also could not explain why one of our rooms was cancelled.  We went back to the front desk and this time, another front desk staff, Donald served us.  We repeated our predicament and explained that the third party operator could not help us.  He showed empathy and helped us to check his records again and spoke to his manager (I think it was John) to see if they could reconfirm the guests list and see if there was anyway to free up a room for us.  and promised to get back to us within an hour.  We were informed within an hour that they have found another room for us but it was on a different floor.  We took the room anyway, as we desperately need another room for the family.  Without us asking, Donald offered to check if he could arrange for us to have rooms on the same floor the next day and even arranged for our luggage to be moved to the new rooms as we would be out the next day.  \n\nAs we had initially requested for a double bed room for our kids, they could only find a room with King sized bed.  Donald offered to move in a roll in bed at no extra charge.  That, I thought, was good service recovery.\n\nUnfortunately, when we checked out, we did not check the bill carefully as we were rushing to catch an early morning flight and found out later that we were charged for the roll in bed for all five nights after all. We did not mind paying for the rollin bed but I thought it was a good initiative at first but poorly executed.  \n\nFor one of the rooms, we also had problem with the bath room.  The water took a very long time to get heated and it was very difficult to adjust the water temperature.  \n\nWe were glad to have met Donald and his manager who were really helpful.

I just can\u2019t imagine how anybody could give it a good review. It wasn\u2019t terrible but definitely not good. \nWe just had one thing wrong after another. I came with my husband and 2 teenage daughters. \nDay 1 - We arrived early evening and decided to just eat in the hotel. The service was average and the food lukewarm. We ate it anyway as we were hungry. Not good enough for over $100 for a few burgers.\nThe room was average (a little tired with beds that were too soft and had roll together). \nDay 2 - We got up really early as we only had 2 full days here and had 9am tickets to an attraction. We couldn\u2019t shower as the water wouldn\u2019t warm up. We called reception. It took 30 mins for somebody to come. \nThe manager agreed to move our room and gave us some breakfast vouchers for the next day, a bottle of cava and some fruit. \nDay 3 - Again, up and out early after a very good breakfast (they got this bit right). After 8 hours walking, we got back to our room. It hadn\u2019t been serviced. So we had a bathroom full of wet towels. We had to call and ask for fresh ones. The hotel did waive the service charge but we hadn\u2019t been serviced anyway. \n\nSo all in all, for our \u20ac470 per night we had:\nA room change\nNo hot water in first room (in the end, after running for 10 minutes, it did warm up. Who waits 10 mins in a hotel to run the water before showering!)\nNo room being serviced and coming back to make our own bed with damp towels.\n\nIn a nutshell, the hotel is understaffed for how busy it is. There were 2 staff on reception. It took over 30 mins to check in and 30 to check out. The manager was nice to us and tried his best to make things right but he seemed resigned and used to the complaints. \n\nI will definitely visit NYC again as I love it.

I typically give around 120 nights business a year to IHG, as typically, their hotels are reasonable. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels in dozens of countries, so I have a good idea of the standard of such properties. From a Crowne Plaza virtually anywhere outside USA, you can expect good service and look nice, well appointed rooms. \n\nThe staff I experienced in CP Times Square are, in general, rude and more so than the famous reputation that precedes this city. Check in was inefficient. The girl that checked me in was rude, with a zero \u2018can do\u2019 or helpful attitude. She told me I had my Spire benefits. Maybe that was her way of greeting me as a loyal guest. It certainly isn\u2019t the way she was trained to greet her loyal guests, but then, like everything about this hotel, a half hearted effort is apparently enough. I was then handed a few vouchers for drinks and breakfasts, which didn\u2019t even have my correct status printed on them. But ok, I can live with that. \n\nWhen I asked later in the stay if I could extend my check out, I was asked to pay a $75 fee. Then conveniently it \u2018wasn\u2019t on the system\u2019 that I had status. \n\nI was charged a 15% tip on a rubbish $40 breakfast, because a rude and quite frankly lazy waiter poured a coffee and brought me the check. Don\u2019t buy breakfast here, it\u2019s pathetic, and for that money you can eat like a king across the road at Juniors. They sell it on the view, and in case you hadn\u2019t noticed already, any building in Times Square with windows has a view of Times Square, even Starbucks, where an equivalent breakfast to the one I had cost $9, with better coffee and better food. Just a note - my voucher brought the rip off cost of a terrible breakfast to $16, but I was still charged a service fee on $40, which meant that breakfast for one person was still more than $21. Again, you can find good food on TS for Less or equal, but also service with a smile. \n\nRooms are tired, dirty, poorly appointed, poorly maintained, noisy and old. I understand it is a high throughput hotel - so are many of their hotels where at least they make an effort to keep them looking good. A tip for you, fellow travellers, don\u2019t look too closely at anything in the bathroom ;-) \n\nThen there was the water issue. Alex (Social Media Manager) - before you harp on that it was \u2018out with your control\u2019, don\u2019t talk such nonsense. I bet you have a generator for when there is a power outage. I live in a country where all hot water is supplied to hotels cold. As it is in most of the rest of our world. There are solutions, and just because your overcharged property doesn\u2019t invest in them, that isn\u2019t \u2018out with your control\u2019. That\u2019s \u2018lack of planning and investment\u2019 and \u2018pure profiteering at the expense of your guests\u2019.\n\nThe one positive from this experience - there are many taxis around that will happily take you away from this dump. \n\n","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

You can literally put a hand in the gap. so you hear all the outside noise, as well as the breeze and the wind sound that comes in\n6- no ventilation in the room (I guess because there has been no need to put one with the faulty windows)\n7- the table lamp on the night stand has a primitive button and the light blinks and you don\u2019t know that it\u2019s on until it turns on automatically in the middle of the night! So you can\u2019t basically use it\n8- the only thing you get at the room is a cheap no-name coffee machine with 2 paper cups (which if you use them they usually don\u2019t put new ones back) and a pair of no-name coffee and tea bags to put in the machine. I\u2019ve been to a holiday inn express once for a business trip and they had Keurig coffee machine with real pods! \n9- the hotel has been out of hot water for 2 consecutive days so far, and I have contacted them at least 5 times so far. They\u2019re not responsive. I\u2019m still waiting for the hotel manager to contact me, as they offered, and I have not received a single phone call from even a concierge in the hotel! \nThey say there\u2019s a water breakdown in the NYC area that has caused the issue. This is unacceptable for me. Such huge hotel is expected to have a backup plan for any similar issue. What if you don\u2019t have electricity? How can you live without hot water for 2 days??? You should have your own boiler, or hot water tanks or whatever it takes not to cause such problems for your guests! The weird thing is that they even don\u2019t offer any type of compensation! \nThey just sent a letter last night promising to fix the issue, and then another one in the middle of the night that the hot water will be back this morning not later than 6:45am, and as of now, 8:05am, there\u2019s still no hot water.\nWe\u2019re here to stay for 9 nights for a family trip and both my husband and I have arranged for a couple of business meetings as well. We both went to our meetings unshowered yesterday and we don\u2019t know how to appear in our meetings today!!! \n\nBriefly, we tried to be cool and don\u2019t take the first 8 big negatives seriously as we wanted to have fun, but the last one and their irresponsibility, is not tolerated any longer. \nThis hotel is not worth even a one night try and a penny per night.

That was good. We arrived on Sunday, November 10, 2019. We walked into our room and it was hot and stuffy. The temp was set at 60 degrees and it was 75 in the room. My husband, daughter and I were quite disappointed as we had a 5 day stay planned. Our room was clean, beds comfy but the heat was unbearable for sleeping and the window only opened a crack...zero ventilation, so disappointing. I could not sleep...got up to get a drink of water around midnight and I spotted a cockroach on the bathroom counter...might have come through the drain. I got him. Anyway, early morning, we went to the front desk to see if we could improve our room. The girl, Michelle I believe was very kind. She explained that the heat had to be turned on and the A\/C was off. She knew we were very set on improving our situation, but she said there was little she could do. We told her that we would go to another hotel and let her know if we found one. She understood and graciously agreed to waive the early departure fee of $100. We were able to get a room for our remaining 4 days a few blocks away at the Marriott Marquis. We went back to get our things and check out at the Crowne Plaza. Lots of renovations there, when we went back to get our things, the jackhammer had started so I hope they get things nicer there.

I choose this hotel as the price and location was attractive. In addition, I am a spire elite level member at IHG.\nCheck in was relatively quick, but I can imagine with a large hotel and just three agents, I could see a long line.  I mentioned to the check in agent, there is a special sign for elite IHG members, but no one manning the location.  That\u2019s a shame, and hopefully against corporate policy.  The check in agent was a pleasure.\n\nThe negatives \n\nI noticed the bed sheets were stained.  I know, ugh. Few things are more troubling.  I spoke to Heather who apologized and was sending a house keeping supervisor immediately.  After waiting 20 minutes, I had to go to a meeting.  I called again and spoke to Patrick who apologized and said a MOD would call that evening, and we set a specific time.  NO CALL.\n\nThat evening, we used our free drink coupons for wine and snacks.  When we asked where the snack was, which was described on the coupon as nuts..., the waiter said we could go to the front desk for a package of pretzel.  Yes, we were in the lounge with waiter service but we should get up to get a package of pretzel.  Kind of shows you what service to expect at this hotel.\n\nWhile problems may occur, it\u2019s how a property responds to these issues.  This hotel just doesn\u2019t seem to care.  So far, two managers failed to respond.  It gets worse.  This hotel texts you if you are elite.  I texted FIA to let her know no one ever responded and she said a manager would get back to me.  AGAIN, three hours later, no response.\n\nI call AGAIN at 11am and John Acosta says the hotel failed, and he can offer a free breakfast.

That\u2019s the level of service to expect.\n\nPlease see the photo attached.  While this hotel seems to be recently renovated, you can expect stains on the bathroom vanity.\n\nIf only this hotel seem to care about their guests especially elite members, you could hope your problems could be addressed.

Public transportation is readily accessible, since Times Square\/42nd Street has the most subway lines running through it in the entire city.\n\nThe IHG Crowne Plaza brand offers fairly similar accommodations across the brand. But, being in New York City, this means that something like a refrigerator costs extra. In this case, $30\/visit. I wasn't happy about that, especially since my wife is a Platinum Elite Member. Also, where other Crowne Plazas have Keurig coffee makers with good coffees, this one had one of those basic coffee makers with basic coffees.\n\nI am guessing that all of this is to channel you downstairs to their coffee bar, which is very good. We were given coupons to use at the coffee bar, which did help, and was appreciated. But, you do have to watch the hours, which are pretty short on the weekend.\n\nThe room is good, and is similar to what you get at other Crowne Plazas. We requested and got a room further away from the elevator, which was a good idea, and kept things quiet. We paid and got the view onto Times Square.

I called ahead to make sure we get a roll away and that you could have one in a room with double beds.\n\nI was checked in by an unfriendly front desk employee who informed that I could only get a roll away in a room with a one bed.  I explained to her that a person from the hotel told me otherwise.

Typically, I would\u2019ve chosen to eat out but we were exhausted.  The quality was poor.\n\nLastly, we valet parked our car for which they charge a premium - I expected the charge and have no complaint for the charge they quoted me.  That was fine.  Parking is for 24 hours.  (However, in my past experience hotels will let you stay a little over the exact 24 hour period- The  Marquis for example.  They charge less and they allow for some wiggle room about departure.)\n\nWhen we were finished with our sight seeing, I called the number on the card for our car.  They instructed me to call when I was ready for the car.  The number was out of service.  I called repeatedly from my own phone and from my son\u2019s.

However, when you partner with another business you have the responsibility of ensuring that they provide good service on your behalf. \n\nOverall, I was unhappy with my stay and feel this hotel nickels and dimes you.  \n\nDid I mention that the shampoo and conditioner was the smallest bottles that I\u2019ve ever seen?\n\nCrowne Plaza, do better.\n ","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I called several times to see what my options were and the staff was rude and said I could give up my room of 4 nights or pay for the night I wasn\u2019t actually there. Ok fine. I\u2019ll pay for 4 full nights. When I arrived I was given a room that had mold growing on the ceiling above the bed. I requested another room. I was given a temporary room and told that my room with two double beds would be reassigned to me the next day. I went down at 10am and made sure that it\u2019s was known what my room situation was and that I would be back in the afternoon to be given keys to my new room. Came back at 4:30pm and was told that no room was approved for me because I booked through booking.com. I had to have a long conversation with the Assistant Manager who told me I booked an ADA room and I couldn\u2019t just ask for a two double bed room because I messed up. I told her I didn\u2019t that I was given an ADA room because of mold on the ceiling in the room assigned to me when I arrived. I had to show my booking reservations to show I was not lying about my reservation. I finally got a room and was told they would waive the $35 daily service fee that covers Wifi, etc. Well good thing we could never even get on the WiFi because it was so bad. The new room I was assigned to had mold all over the bathroom. See pictures below. After so much trouble and poor service previously in sucked it up and didn\u2019t complain. When you stay at a hotel such as the Crown Plaza it is known for its prestige and cleanliness. I\u2019m paying $1800 for 4 nights for a dirty room with mold. I will never stay at this hotel again. I\u2019ve stayed at LaQuintas that we\u2019re nicer than this and more than half the cost. Don\u2019t pay for a room with a view because the hotel really doesn\u2019t have a direct view of Times Square. You have to lean over and look way down the street to actually see Times Square.

When I did that the room price skyrocketed to $750 for the night!! So I canceled and started looking at other hotels. I remembered I had always wanted to stay at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square so I checked there first and became and IHG member, for free, to get the best rates and some extra perks. Their price for the night $245 senior discount rate! So I booked it right away without looking at the TA reviews because you could cancel the room up to 24 hours in advance so I figured if the reviews were bad I would just cancel. \nThe reviews were pretty decent except for a couple of them talking about the front of the hotel having construction. So I called ahead to make sure it wasn\u2019t going to interfere with our stay. I spoke to Sandra who assured me it wouldn\u2019t and she would put us on the higher floor to alleviate any concerns I had about noise. I also told her we were celebrating a BD. \nWhen we got to the hotel we had to enter through the side of the building, which is not a big deal at all. Our check in was quick and easy. Special thanks to Victoria who knew her job, was professional, kind and enthusiastic that we were there! Our room was not ready because we had arrived early but they texted us when it was ready and that was great! I texted back if they could make sure the AC in the room was on blast because it was a hot day and we were walking around a lot and they replied: \u201c Yes of course! Is there anything else we can do to make your  stay comfortable?\u201d Yippee! \n We got so many freebies! We each received one hotel voucher for buffet breakfast worth  $35 each, a $20 voucher that we could spend anywhere in the hotel including bar and restaurant, and four drink vouchers valued at $15!!! We were so happy!!!!! \nWhen we got to the room we were pleasantly surprised that they had upgraded us to a corner suite!! The room was icy cold as just like we requested!  The room was very nice, bathroom a little small, but big enough to move around and feel comfortable. The bathroom does not have a separate door from the shower area, it\u2019s all together. We had forgotten our toothbrushes and they came to the room immediately with complementary brushes and tooth paste. \nAll hotel staff was pleasant and able to answer any questions we had. The hospitality and the feel of being in a smaller hotel for being such a big hotel was incredible! Our normal stomping ground is usually  the Marriott Marque in Times Square but the service we received here outweighs their service! So next time I book at the Crowne Plaza!","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Perfect check in, excellent customer service! \nWe didn\u2019t eat at the hotel but the bar staff were really efficient and pleasant too.  We regularly had drinks and occasionally had dessert there. \nLIFTS were in full working order and fast.  \n\nROOM: I\u2019d booked & paid extra for a Times Square view room & got a corner double double (Room 3601) with a fabulous view of Times Square, including the Empire State Building. Really pleased. \n\u2022 Beds (& pillows, 4 per bed supplied) were very comfortable but are a small double.  \n\u2022 Hairdryer provided in a bag on the bathroom shelf, it\u2019s a proper fairly powerful one not one of those wall hose things! \n\u2022 Bathroom, well lit & clean. Fixed shower head over a bath tub. Clean heavy shower curtain. \n\u2022 No issues with the air con, worked perfectly throughout. \n\u2022 Lots of power points provided. All the lamp stand bases on the desk, the TV dresser & the bedside drawers (which also included a couple of USB ports too) had the facility to plug in. \n\u2022 Two luggage stands included. \n\u2022 Small closet space with around 10 wooden hangers provided (we used one of the clip ones to hold the curtains together were they met in the corner to prevent that light gap!) \n\u2022 Usual laundry Bag provided (we didn\u2019t use the service) \n\u2022 Corner arm chair, small coffee table & a desk plus chair provided. \n\u2022 No kettle but a drip machine that you could use the provided tea or coffee bags in (or your own teabags if you\u2019re British!) Cups are disposable, wrapped in plastic.  White sugar sachet, sweetener, packet creamer (no milk), plastic stirrer & a paper serviette come packaged up (in more plastic...!) feels wasteful, should be provided separately.  \n- No water bottles provided.  \n- No fridge included but available on request.  \n- No Iron, available on request I think (I pack in a way where I don\u2019t need to iron when I arrive!) \n\nCLEANLINESS: excellent, well maintained room, not tired or dated.  \n\u2022 The usual toiletries, tea\/coffee & towels replaced without fail, housekeeping were great and done by lunchtime or earlier (we were always out during the day to be fair). \n\nLOCATION: fantastic on the doorstep of Times Square TKTS red steps (which is the section our room view was of) with the Subway on 50th just a couple of minutes walk away. \nScaffolding is still up so entrance is to the side, under the tunnel. \n\nSUMMARY: Some of the reviews had worried me but I honestly couldn\u2019t fault it.  It\u2019s not the highest end luxury & my expectations for city hotels, given the numbers that go through them are low but this was certainly not a shoddy hotel in my experience & did live up to the Crowne Plaza brand.  We had a jam packed itinerary for the week, you really just need a place to lay your head in NYC but even the kids started calling the room \u2018home\u2019... lovely to return back to each evening with our tourist sore feet and buzzing heads.  \nThank you to the CP team, you excelled!","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I claimed to the customer service of the hotel as I never asked for this, had no drinks at the bar, and internet was included in my paid room rate.

We were a party of 10 requiring 4 rooms and were told that the rooms would be ready by 3pm, which was fine.

Several hours later a room was offered, but had 1 king sized bed when it was supposed to be a twin room, so we were left waiting again for the final room, which obviously wasn't ideal. The rooms were fine when we were in, our view was of the river which was lovely. The rooms were quiet and clean, with plenty of room and a large bathroom (with a great shower). The lighting was good which is always a bonus, with plenty of mirrors. The location was the reason that we booked this hotel, as it's literally in the middle of everything. There are plenty of bars and restaurants a stones throw away with plenty of choice. The hotel is in Times Square so you are surrounded by the hustle and bustle of New York which is great. Taxi's were easily available, and the hotel will request one if not. The staff were very helpful with recommendations on what to see, when to go and we managed to get discount tickets within the hotel which was good. I would recommend staying here, I think we just got a little unlucky with the room situation because there was a convention on so the hotel was more than likely to be fully booked.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

I called the hotel two days prior to arrival to arrange an amenity to be left in the room for his birthday. I was sent a credit card authorization form and a guest amenity form. I filled those out and faxed them to the number I was given. I called to make sure it was received which the fax never was so I emailed them to the person I spoke to on the phone and she forwarded to the food and beverage manager. The next day we\u2019re driving to the airport and my husband receives a phone call from the hotel asking to speak with me. He already knows something is up now because I had to try and explain what I wanted the surprise to be over the phone. They told me they never got the form and I was transferred to someone in food and beverage. They also told me the my never got the fax or email and I told them the number on the amenity form I wanted which was a six pack of beer and chips and dip. Well apparently the form they had was different than mine because the choices for that number was different. I kept telling her what I wanted and she kept asking if I wanted a birthday cake. I was getting so frustrated I was ready to cancel everything and that\u2019s when they told me they\u2019d handle it. The next day we\u2019re checking in and we go to dinner and realize our door doesn\u2019t lock behind us. We go downstairs tell the front desk they apologize and call security to fix it right then. We leave for dinner and come back 2 hours later to find it had not been fixed. We\u2019re infuriated now because our things had been unlocked for 2 hours. We get a hold of the manager who apologized and said she can transfer us to another room. So I pack everything up and during this time security comes and fixes the door in less than a minute. Why wasn\u2019t this done two hours prior? By that time the manager shows up and asks if we want to stay in the room since it\u2019s fixed now. Um NO I\u2019ve already packed everything up. So we take the elevator to the different room only to find that room ALREADY HAD PEOPLE IN IT. By this time I\u2019m just thinking all of it is a joke so manager comes back up there and sends us to another room with a \u201cbetter view\u201d we now go to the third room which doesn\u2019t have a better view but whatever we were tired of moving. While we were in our first room we went to get ice and the machine didn\u2019t work. I called the front desk and asked if they could bring some up and I was told to go down to another floor to get ice. Really?! I shouldn\u2019t have to do that.

The room was booked to have a view to Times Square, and yes if you leant on the window and looked right you did see it, was that worth the extra money? No.\n\nWoke up early next morning and no warm water in the shower, so it was a cold start for us all. Made the reception staff aware of this and it was fixed by morning 2, however not much of a compensation was offered for this inconvenience.... the bathroom and bedroom could do with a refresh, especially the bathroom where railings where hanging off the wall.\n\nBreakfast both days was superb, and it I would highlight any staff groups it would be the breakfast staff. Great cold and warm choice selections of all you could want to eat and drink for breakfast.\n\nWe used the bar downstairs one late evening and it was pleasant enough.

But with that said you charge a certain amount your clientele expect their monies worth. Nowhere was I told this building was under construction made it hard for an out of towner to find the building. Once inside things where much better. Cleaner and more up to date, other than all of the lobby area windows covered in construction tarp. Check in took a bit as they were busy and there wasn't a large waiting line area so we all felt cramped. The check in process itself went fairly quickly but it the rep had to call someone to switch a room fro us(?) they did was give us two drink coupons for the small bar they have in the check in area. The room itself was clean and has an amazing view for times square.(which we had purchased). But the toilet paper holder was falling out of the wall. The shower on\/off handle would spin and didn't seem to be bolted in?!?! We had reserved the room for 3 days and we were a family of four, they always seem to give only enough towels for three. So we called down and had some more delivered and they did promptly deliver them. But each day they cleaned our room they gave us less and less of everything. Started with 4 coffee pods and the final day we were there they left only one. Started with three sets of towels final days was left 2 sets. Just seemed very odd. Again the location was great being only steps away Times Square and a multitude of attractions and shops. But not worth the price we paid. Not only was the hotel expensive but we ended up paying more than $240 just to have our car valet parked through the hotel for three days.

Maybe the mold on the shower ceiling, but nothing else. \n\nWhen we checked out, we learned of all the taxes. Many of them.  Not the hotel's fault; that's New York for you. Nickle and diming the tourist. \n\nYou have to park in the parking garage which is a part of the hotel. I'll say it again because this is important. The parking garage is part of the hotel. \n\nWe checked in on Sunday and out on Tuesday. $140 for that time. We hadn't gotten the car at any point so it just sat there. This is not advertised anywhere and it would appear the cost is part of your hotel stay. It is not. \n\nIn checking out, we paid almost $200 more than we expected to after already dealing with high prices for everything over 2 days. The deal clerk said it's a different company completely and they have no control over it. EVEN THOUGH IT IS A PART OF THE HOTEL! \n\nI get it.

Our room was on the 36 th floor it was adequate although slightly cramped for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. We slept well and the beds are comfortable. We wrongly choose to eat breakfast the following morning  in the hotel restaurant thinking of convenience to start the day of sightseeing. The food was of good quality with all the usual fare, the coffee however was bitter and unpleasant. The cost of all this amounted to $173.43 including service charges and the mandatory tip. This was the most expensive meal we had throughout our stay in New York and for a 4* mid range hotel we though it was extortionate. Needless to say this was our one and only meal experience at our hotel and it left us feeling underwhelmed about this place. For this reason I will not be recommending the Crowne Plaza Times Square yes it's location is the best thing about it but there are so many others to choose from and we just felt ripped off.

We went to get something to eat and then returned to the front desk to request a small refrigerator in our room, whenever it should become available. However, this time we had the good fortune to speak with Sandra at the IHG Platinum Elite desk.\n\nWhen I asked about the refrigerator, her immediate response was \u201cLet\u2019s get you in a room first, so your husband can get some rest\u201d. Within less than one minute, she had handed us a set of room keys and called to have a refrigerator delivered to the room at no charge. Sandra then thanked us for being Platinum members and sent us off to our room. Within five minutes of entering the room, Sandra personally called to ensure that everything was to our liking. As soon as I hung up the phone, there was a knock on the door, which turned out to be the refrigerator with two complimentary bottles of water.\n\nSandra is professional, thoughtful, and empowered. Rather than telling us what she couldn\u2019t do for us (as her coworkers had), she utilized her resources to show us what she could do.

If you are looking for the best location on Times Square while being close to the theatres, Rockefeller Center, Central Park and 5th avenue and a good value, this is your choice! You are close to the subway stations can walk to many of the local sites.  There's no need to stay at any of the more expensive hotels on Times Square as the crowds are far worse the closer you get to 45th-42nd.  This one still has all the views with a little breathing room while you walk!   Those on the side streets, while convenient, don't have a view at all since they are shorter building facing side streets. \n\nWhile the hotel does have a little wear, it's really trivial.  Unless you are used to and expect extremely high end experiences only, you will find this one clean, well kept and perfect for your stay.  They are doing a bit of construction on the front entry which means you enter on the sides, but that seriously doesn't matter.   \n\nWe had a bit of a snafu with our Booking.com reservation, but Crown Plaza took care of everything. Big shout out to Val who contacted me while I was en route and reassured me all was still booked and we'd be taken care of and to Donald at the front desk who was super friendly, helpful and really a great representative of their hotel!  In the end, they honored our rate and gave us some complimentary food vouchers which was a huge help and got us to eat at their hotel each day.  Their restaurant, Brassiere 49, has a great view, good food and is the perfect place to sit and take a break during the day or a the end of the day.\n\nIf I had anything I would suggest they work on it would be 1)  The older gentlemen staff at Grind was NOT friendly, bordering rude and made me dread getting my morning coffee.  2)  When booking large kids groups, keep them in their own part of the hotel.  We had a room next to a kids group where clearly there were no chaperones as the kids were running around wild for hours in the evening and super obnoxious.  I had to call the front desk one of the nights and they sent security up...who handled it quickly.  But still, young teens should not be left to roam these hotels so freely and obnoxiously.  This could have happened anywhere, I just think the hotel should book them away from their other guests.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Before we even travelled I had a bad expereince; as my wife is diabetic and needs a small fridge in a hotel room to store insulin, I e-mailed the hotel to ask if rooms already contained a fridge; they couldn't even be bothered to reply. On arrival at the hotel we had to wait an age for our room to be ready, when it finally was I phoned down requesting a small fridge; they promised to bring one \"\"in a few minutes\"; it actually took nearly 3 hours!  Then I discovered that the safe in the room didn't work; I followed the instructions faithfully but nothing doing; on phoning down for \"service\" I was told in a very condescending way that I must have swiped my card the wrong way round; when after yet another long wait - an hour and a half - someone came to our room to look at it, he spotted straight away that it was broken and sent me down to the reception to ask for a safe deposit box at that level - hugely inconvenient. On the second day they removed all the large towels from the bathroom, even though we had not placed them on the floor and were perfectly happy to re-use them; this took well over 2 hours to sort out. The restaurant - an absolute embarrassment given the charges. The evening menu is seriously limited, they showed no understanding or concern when I pointed out that my wife as a diabetic had to be extremely careful with food; some of the waiters were absolutely incompetent. Ask for a milky coffee and they fill the cup with coffee to the brim, leaving no space for milk; when I asked them to bring me a piece of cake together with my coffee so that I could enjoy them together, that proved to be too difficult. I despair. I am used to 4-star Swiss hotels, so I expect high standards, but given how expensive the Crowne Plaza is this should not be a problem.

Considering the size of the hotel and the location and of course the amount of guests that this hotel would have I never thought that they would run out of hot water. Sadly I dismissed talking to anyone that night and since we were in a hurry I left it alone until the next evening when it was time to have a shower. This time there was absolutely no hot water and we were running out to another  previously planned engagement. I called the front desk and told them how disappointed I was and that I would like the situation dealt with ASAP for the amount of money I paid for this hotel I expected some service. When we returned to our hotel room later that night, the message to maintenance was lost and nobody showed up to fix the problem, I  immediately went down to the front desk and the lovely ladies there called the appropriate maintenance staff and sent him to the room. I went to talk to the front office manager John Acosta and he dismissed my complaint because he was busy doing other things. After the maintenance staff fixed the problem and was rude to my children I took the two drink certificates we received at check-in and decided to take my two daughters to the lounge for a non-alcoholic Shirley temple. When Micheal in the lounge was rude to us once again I decided to warn others about my experience. It surprised me how super friendly some of the staff were and how super disrespectful and rude the other half were.

We reserved a King bed city view in mid-June 2019 and was given a corner room at the top floor (46th floor - Northeast corner). This corner room gives you nearly a wraparound view of the city. In other words, the windows wrap from the north side continuing to the east side of the room. This was pretty nice for staring out into the city from up high. Noise was about what you'd expect in the middle of Times Square.  Even from the 46th floor you can hear sirens and car horns. If you're a light sleeper, might I suggest not staying in Times Square, maybe consider not even staying in Manhattan. It didn't bother us much at all, what was annoying was the bright blue Barclays building sign at night. Luckily the room has curtains to block out most of the outside lights.  \n\nOther than that, for the most part everything was in order. The bathroom is a bit on the smaller side than I'm used to and the closet basically shares that space as well.  Plenty of room for 2 people. For the price you pay a simple continental breakfast would've been nice.  We did not get to try their restaurant\/bar. (Why bother when you're in Times Square?)  \n\nElevators were pretty quick most of the time. Not much waiting or stops except for the mornings.  Subways are 1-2 blocks away depending on the station.  \n\nOne small gripe, if any staff from the hotel reads this, might I suggest reversing the toilet paper holder.  It's mounted in such a way that when you pull the toilet paper out the whole roll starts to come off the holder.  If the holder were installed in reverse, that would solve the problem.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}
{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":93454,"title":"Great location. Overnight Front Desk Staff needs Help","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-06-29","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"This is a great hotel because of location and room quality is great for the price. There are a few things that very much annoyed me enough to write about it. So here is my story. I reserved my room on the 27th of this month and due to issues with my flight I got to this hotel around 2 or 3am the next morning. When I made it to the front desk to checkin I realized I forgot my wallet in the shuttle that dropped me off and ontop of that my phone was dead. The front desk agent was very nice and told me where I could charge my phone to call the shuttle service to get my wallet back. She saw that I was an IHG member and knew I had a reservation but I still needed my credit card and my ID. While waiting for the shuttle service to come back i wanted to let her know that i would have my wallet in 30 to 40 minutes and to thank her for her help. Unfortunately she was not there but her supervisor was. I decided to let him know about my situation since the woman u was speaking with earlier was gone. I was also going to see if a picture of my ID and credit card would be enough to get me in my room until the shuttle driver arrived with. Y wallet. While e playing my situtation to the Supervisor he got a very nasty attitude with me and very rudely cut me off while I was talking and told me to wait down stairs next to the bellman. Then he just ignored me and went about his business. I wanted to get his name but he had his name tag covered by a jacket. At that point I decided not to make a big deal out of his attitude and continued to wait for the shuttle driver. I had gotten. My wallet about 30 minutes later and went to checkin. The same Supervisor's attitude was very short and impolite. I felt like he thought I was below him or I did not deserve to stay at this resort. After he gave me my room key I proceeded to my assigned room and the keys did not work. I had to go back to the front desk which was over 30 floors down and get new keys. The same Supervisor was there and seemed shocked that the keys didn't work. So for some reason he told security to check the room and he also called the room to see if anyone was in there. That seemed strange to me because any other hotel or resort I have stayed in would just give me a new key. That is how i knew that he already knew something was wrong and was trying to hide it. After he called the room he said someone picked up and had to assign me a new room. He did not even apologize to me for the mistake. After I got the key to the new room I proceeded to it and when I got in there was cloths and bags all over the place (picture is attached to this post). I went back to the front desk which now was over 20 floors down. The same Supervisor was there again and i told him and showed him the picture I took and now he was shocked. He called out the person assigning the rooms to take care if it and offered me a free breakfast voucher. The person assigning the rooms came out and was very nice. He apologized to me and told me that the day was a little hectic and that he would take care of thg e problem. The Front Desk Supervisor seemed to catch an atti5with him as well eventhough he was doing his best to fix the problem. While the room assignment person was off making sure a room he found was clean and empty, the Front Desk Supervisor handed me 3 more breakfast vouchers and finally apologized to me. The room assignment person came back and told me every5was good now but the room type I had reserved was not available. I overlooked that and told him it was ok since I saw how hard he looked for a room for me. He then offered me dinner for the inconvenience and I accepted. AS I WAS WALKING AWAY THE FRONT DESK SUPERVISOR TOLD THE ROOM ASSIGNMENT PERON HE JUST GAVE ME BREAKFAST VOUCHERS AND WHY DID HE GIVE ME A COMPED DINNER? Very nasty and rudely to the room assignment person. I could also tell he had made a few more comments but could not hear everything because I was walking away. Bottomline, the Front Desk Supervisor working overnight from June 27th to the 28th had a very nasty attitude and made me feel uncomfortable about staying there. The room assignment person was awesome and had a fantastic attitude when under pressure and dealing with the negative attitude of the Front Desk Supervisor. The rest if the hotel staff was great.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"SOLO"}

There were plenty of sockets and USB ports for us to plug in our devices, and WiFi was pretty good. Our rooms were cleaned daily and toiletries were regularly restocked. However, the room did not have a minibar or even a refrigerator, which is odd for a hotel at this price range. \n\nThe hotel's facade along Broadway was being renovated, so there was a bit of a confusion locating the hotel entrance when we first arrived. Although there was a sign directing people where to go, it was too small to easily notice. Also, given the hotel's location and popularity among large groups (like student tour groups and large families), the elevators can get a bit busy at times.\n\nOverall, this is a very good hotel and highly recommended!","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Location is incredibly convenient for tourists - which we are not, but we still find it best because we go off in all sorts of directions using this as the center. Rooms are very generously sized (for NYC where they're typically teeny) and the windows isolate sound well. \nThe bar is very handy to meet or for a quick something but the service is pretty lacking. We had to ask several times for something because our server wouldn't come back, so I asked the bartender who said \"I'll tell your server\" rather than just getting the water herself. Then the server never came -- she wasn't slammed, it was just lackluster service. Prices are typical for NYC.\nCheck in was surprisingly slow (not the line, the actual check in) but the desk agent was really nice and helpful. Have never eaten in the main restaurant and with all the choices nearby, I can't imagine choosing to do that.

Everything in the area is open til late so if you need last minute shopping or just convenience store supplies this is the area to be in. \n\nThe hotel does tend to get busy on weekends so lines for breakfast could get long but then the service fairly fast enough that you get a table fast enough. Breakfast is a buffet and they do change it up every few days.\nSandra at the front desk was very helpful especially since we checked in at about 2 am. Rooms are large and comfortable, some furniture is a bit worn down but clean. I liked that the TV is new and they have enough charging ports for devices.  Bathrooms are modern enough and clean.

The bedding is very comfortable but the windows are not soundproof so you do get some street noise (I was on the 16th floor). Just FYI the king rooms only have showers (no tub) so if that is important be sure to reserve a room with two doubles. The lobby area is small in comparison to other large resort hotels in the area. It is mostly made up of a bar area. There is a nice coffee\/snack counter on the same level, with amazing pastries and lunch items. The real selling point to this hotel is it's smack in the the middle of time square location. Fantastic if you plan on taking in some broadway shows.

I don't think you'll need to worry too much about noise keeping you awake (unless you're a REALLY light sleeper) as I didn't struggle at all - the alarm woke me every morning!\n\nThe room was as expected of a Crowne Plaza; decent size, large king size bed, clean bathroom, TV, in-room safe, coffee maker, hangers in the wardrobe, iron with ironing board and bathroom amenities.  There wasn't anything wrong with the room however I wasn't wowed either.  I think this is because it's older decor; warmer browns\/creams in colour rather than the fashionable silver\/greys.  I would say that the hotel could benefit from some TLC throughout as rooms and public areas are beginning to show signs of wear and tear.\n\nThe location is what sells this hotel - literally step outside the hotel and you're in the centre of Times Square, overlooking the M & M's store. The front entrance is currently undergoing refurbishment so all access is via the rear doors where the cars\/taxis drop off customers.\n\nWhen we checked out the bill showed the resort fee as $5 more than we were expecting.  I pointed this out to the reception staff who rectified the bill.  Our friends were also incorrectly charged and hadn't noticed the difference until we mentioned it.\n\nThe only source of disappointment was the amount of time it took for the funds to be released back to my card - almost 2 weeks.

Les points positifs pour commencer : l'emplacement hyper central en plein Times Square (avec l'inconv\u00e9nient d'\u00eatre dans une zone ultra touristique avec des prix prohibitifs. Exemple tout b\u00eate : on passe de 4 dollars \u00e0 1 dollar le hot dog en s'\u00e9loignant du quartier). Autre point positif : les chambres sont correctes et propres, sans plus. Attention, les double beds sont petits. Nous avions r\u00e9serv\u00e9 une chambre pour 4 avec 2 lits, on s'est senti un peu \u00e0 l'\u00e9troit. Evidemment ne pas se mettre en t\u00eate les photos des chambres avec grande baie vitr\u00e9e et vue imprenable sur NY. Ce sont les chambres les plus ch\u00e8res. Pour nous, au 15\u00e8me \u00e9tage, c'\u00e9tait une vue bof sur une rue lat\u00e9rale avec une toute petite fen\u00eatre.\nPour le reste, l'h\u00f4tel est vieillot et m\u00e9riterait un bon coup de jeune, \u00e0 commencer par la moquette. Mais je reconnais que c'est propre et fonctionnel. \nOn a beau \u00eatre pr\u00e9venu, le principe du service fee (30 dollars par jour et par chambre \u00e0 payer en plus, sans compter les taxes) semble compl\u00e8tement abusif. Ce prix est cens\u00e9 comprendre l'utilisation illimit\u00e9e du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone depuis la chambre. Nous n'en avions pas vraiment besoin mais nous avons tent\u00e9 de passer des appels. Sans succ\u00e8s, cela ne marchait pas (nous avions pourtant bien fait le 9 pour sortir, comme indiqu\u00e9 sur la notice). Le prix est cens\u00e9 \u00e9galement couvrir les boissons offertes au bar de l'h\u00f4tel. Mais nous \u00e9tions 7 au total pour 2 boissons offertes par chambre. Je vous laisse faire le calcul... Les autres doivent donc payer leur boisson et on parle d'un h\u00f4tel o\u00f9 la petite bouteille d'eau co\u00fbte 5 dollars. On n'a donc pas utilis\u00e9 les tickets. On repart avec l'impression d'avoir pay\u00e9 320 dollars suppl\u00e9mentaires de service fees (2 chambres pour 4 jours) pour aucun service au final.\nMais le pire c'est l'accueil r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par le personnel. Absence de sourire, grimaces qui expriment l'exasp\u00e9ration si vous demandez qu'une phrase soit r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e plus lentement (le charme de l'accent fran\u00e7ais ne semble pas faire effet ici...). Bref, impression permanente de d\u00e9ranger. Nous avons tous \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris pour un h\u00f4tel de cette cat\u00e9gorie.\nJe garde le pire pour la fin : d\u00e8s le check-in, lorsque nous avons d\u00fb payer le service fee, la personne qui nous a re\u00e7us a fait une erreur de 20 dollars en nous rendant la monnaie. Celle-ci ne me croyait pas alors que j'avais compt\u00e9 la somme que je lui remettais devant toute ma famille. Elle a recompt\u00e9 sa caisse une premi\u00e8re fois en affirmant ne pas avoir commis d'erreur. J'ai demand\u00e9 l'intervention de son manager qui est rest\u00e9 mutique face \u00e0 mes explications. La personne a de nouveau compt\u00e9 sa caisse devant le manager avant de retrouver les 20 dollars manquants et reconna\u00eetre son erreur. L'affaire a dur\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de 30 minutes (quand vous arrivez tout juste de l'a\u00e9roport apr\u00e8s une nuit dans l'avion...) Ce qui est choquant ce n'est pas cette dame qui a commis une erreur et avait l'air franchement \u00e9puis\u00e9, mais c'est l'attitude du manager qui a \u00e0 peine prononc\u00e9 un mot d'excuse.\nBref, je m'attends d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 lire un message du community manager disant qu'il regrette que j'aie pass\u00e9 une mauvaise exp\u00e9rience... que l'h\u00f4tel fait son maximum... qu'il esp\u00e8re nous revoir bient\u00f4t...

After one awful night and almost on the verge of tears, I jumped on booking.com to see if Crowne Plaza had any rooms available and thank goodness it did! \n\nWe were greeted by a lady at the front desk named Rhoda who made everything better instantly.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93454,"title":"They came to my rescue!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-05-06","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I travel a lot. My average flight number per year is ~140-200 flights per year across the continental U.S., Europe, Asia, and sometimes South America. Needless to say, I am seasoned when it comes to living on the road.\n\nThis past weekend I was traveling not for work, but for pleasure. Once a year, I visit a large city with some old colleagues of mine to relax and enjoy local activities. NYC for us is a mainstay because of the great food, and most of all, Broadway.\n\nAs such, the Times Square Crowne Plaza is usually my top choice given the location and amenities the facility offers. Though some Crowne Plaza locations have a reputation for being a little aged, this location is definitely well kept and a great option for a weekend trip in the city.\n\nThis weekend was special for us as I decided to bring my parents along, as my father had never been to New York, or seen a Broadway show.\n\nWe arrived Friday morning at LGA and took a NYC Yellow Taxi to the Crowne Plaza. The Taxi Driver was named, \"Freddie\" and he and I had some great discussion while he was driving us to the hotel. He was discussing how long he had been in NYC, and that he came over from Ecuador with his wife and mother. The conversation was very pleasant, and Freddie was a very nice guy. This will be important later.\n\nFor the first time in my career (5+ years of 100% travel), I left my laptop in the NYC Yellow Taxi. It's my fault. I was sidetracked ensuring that my family had their bags while assisting with the payment method. Needless to say, I left the laptop in the front seat. This is a work laptop, and I needed it to complete some tasks before stopping for the weekend. Once I realized (in line at check-in) that my laptop was missing, I ran back outside to find that the driver had already left.I have several remote lectures to give next week, and I cannot host the meeting without this laptop, as the data is encrypted. I'm completely stuck, now.\nThis, is a complete nightmare. \n\nI called NY Taxi, but was advised that they do not accept calls on lost property. I was directed to their website. I submitted a claim on their website, and the contact my work IT team to discuss options.\n\nAfter discussion, it was decided to plan as though the laptop is gone forever. As such, I was required to submit a police report before the company can consider the loss covered and allow me new laptop hardware.\n\nAfter much fumbling on the web with my cell phone, I approached the front desk of Crowne Plaza and spoke to Michelle. Michelle was kind and provided me with the address and telephone number to NYPD 18th Precinct 3C. I called NYPD who advised that I must make the report in person only. Fine.\n\nI walked to the NYPD precinct office and made my report in person. With this, I had the case number to provide to work IT, and to get my new laptop hardware. Hopefully, this would only disrupt one day of my lectures next week. Outlook = grim.\n\nBy this time, it was early afternoon and I was ready to be finished with the day. I had done everything in my power to correct the situation, and mistakes do happen, I was pretty bummed; what a stupid mistake!\n\nThe rest of the evening was uneventful, with dinner and our first Broadway show of the weekend (Come from away). We spent the rest of the evening walking around and trying whiskey bars. \n\nSaturday morning: I receive a call at 7:46AM. This was an officer from NYPD precinct 18. Freddie, the taxi driver, was there with my missing laptop and wanted to give it to me personally. \n\nWOW.\n\nI dress and uber straight to the Police office. I'm met with some laughter and the NYPD officers saying, \"wow, you are SO lucky!\". I look and behind me is standing Freddie with my laptop, and the guy is all smiles! \n\nFreddie then tells me, when his shift ended he cleaned his car and found the laptop. It was in the front against his middle console. He knew that the computer was mine, and he himself was distraught.He remembered our conversation during the ride.\n\nFreddie, on his own time, went back to Crowne plaza at 6:00 AM, and spoke to the front staff. This was when Michelle (whom helped me yesterday) remembered speaking to me. Michelle advised that she remembered me, but that she was remiss in taking my information down (and I was remiss in giving it to her). Both Freddie and Michelle know I'm there, but they have no way to know my name or how to reach me.\nMichelle DID remember, however, that I went to the 18th precinct office of NYPD. Michelle advised Freddie to go to NYPD, which he did.\n\nAfterwards, Freddie drove me back to the hotel and was SO GLAD to have found me.\n\nNeedless to say, I was very touched and showed my gratitude to Freddie and team.\n\nWere it not for the kindness of Freddie, my work would have been disrupted. I work in the medical field, which means this disruption could have caused delays in patient care (indirectly). Were it not for Michelle's kind attention and keen memory, Freddie would have been unable to take the laptop somewhere I could be reached. The staff at NYPD also were extremely helpful as well.\n\nIf these stars had not all lined up, my week at work would have been pretty rough.\nThe stars, though, aren't really stars that line up, they are people.\n\nFreddie, Michelle, and the folks at NYPD are the stars here. Your hard work and kind attention, and overall good nature lead to this excellent outcome for me, and salvaged the rest of my visit to NYC. By taking the extra time, you eased my mind for the rest of my trip with my family, AND you ensured that my work was not disrupted this week.\n\nI wanted to share this excellent story, and thank Freddie and Michelle for their kindness. I will absolutely recommend this location to my friends and colleagues, when I tell this story.\n\nThank you SO much!","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We could see way into New Jersey. \nThe service in the hotel was spotty. The bar \/restaurant was noisy and the service was slow and sometimes our orders were wrong. Fortunately there are a lot of other places to eat.  The entrance and lobby were frequently very congested with people.  \nThe concierge desk told us a Harlem tour we booked was in a mini van and it was in a huge tour bus.  Not sure why he said that but we were very disappointed. (Don\u2019t book the Harlem gospel tour, it was not much about Harlem!  Very disappointing with a horrid guide.) \nAll in all our stay was pleasant. ","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The first week a drain in an adjacent mechanical room plugged up and my room took on a lot of water, soaking the carpet in the entry way.  The hotel sent up an engineer and a housekeeper who got the drain unplugged and put plastic and towels over the carpet, so that got handled.  \n\nWhen I was at the hotel the next week the air conditioner in my room did not function, the room safe was broken and the room had no coffee or water.  When I asked for help the only thing I got was water.  The safe was not fixed and the air conditioner for some reason that was not resolvable could not be fixed.  When I arrived back in my room the message light on my phone was blinking and when I touched the message button it only rang a busy signal.

They left a machine to cool the room down but of course the sound was terrible and I could not sleep with this machine. Then I was changed to another room after pretty much BEGGING the front desk to change me. In this new room the A\/C did work. I left in the afternoon to visit NYC and when I came back to my room I found a piece of underwear which was not mine on the couch.  I repeat, a piece of UNDERWEAR WHICH WAS NOT MINE on the couch.  After reporting this to the front desk they mentioned that they could not show me the cameras and after talking to a nice colombian manager they said that they had not found any trace that could lead to the underwear arriving in my room. So basically I was now a liar and I had made all this up. Incredible lack of empathy, poor customer service and resolution of guest problems in this hotel.  The cherry on top was when I went to the Hotel Bar with a bag of crackers i had bought downstairs by the parking garage, i was approached by one of the waitresses (red haired waitress) and she said that I could not sit there because I was not consuming anything.

But this is a high volume area. \n\nWe had to wait 5 to 10 minutes to get hot water in our room, and the breakfast area there is huge in service probably about 200 people has a very small buffet area which ran out of food. On the last day which was a Tuesday they ran out of croissants at 10 AM?\n\nThe location was great and the in-house restaurant and bar was pretty good but was always kept it very cold.\n\nWe had some burgers and salads and those were pretty good.\n\n","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There's multiple access points for the subway to get you where you need to go and being in the middle of Manhattan, your never more then a 20 minute subway run from all the sights you want to see. Definitely recommend it for the first time visitor, ideal location!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This time I brought my family for school vacation week. Like many other visits I chose to add breakfast to my stay as they have a great buffet better then most hotels! \n\nOne of things I like as a regular guest is that they are always friendly and seem to remember me from my last visits. \n\nThis time Ali our server came over to say hello and greeted me with a smile and asked if I was here this time on vacation and was very happy to meet my family. When my wife mentioned it was my Birthday he wished me a happy birthday. Later that night we had a knock on the door and room service showed up with a huge piece of Chocolate cake and a bottle of red wine with a card from Ali wishing me a happy Birthday! I was shocked at the gesture as it was totally unexpected and very thoughtful. He has waited on me many times and always friendly as I\u2019m usually eating alone before starting my day if client appointments.\n\nSo I was truly taken back by his thoughtfulness. We stayed several more days and never got to thank him, but he added something special to my birthday and my wife, kids and I all enjoyed the cake together! The wine was just for the two of us and made for an even more special night.\n\nOverall this hotel is comfortable, great showers, comfortable beds, good food options and as an IHG member they often give you extra vouchers for the cafe.\n\nOverall we had an amazing visit to NYC made extra comfortable by Ali, and the front desk staff, and other waiter Tofael who also provided friendly service.\n\nThis is the way all hotels should treat their guests and why I always return!\n\nKudos to management for creating such a positive environment for the staff to rest guests so well!","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":3,"locationId":93454,"title":"Great hotel - Shame about the service fees ","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-04-17","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"Having just returned from a 4 night stay we were pleased with the accommodation itself. We were on the 44th floor at the rear of the hotel and were generally pleased with the room itself - good size, clean, amazing beds (temporally eased my lower back pain!), other reviews have mentioned it was either too hot or cold, we found the temp to be just fine, so much so it didn\u2019t even cross our mind. Windows offered a relatively good view out to the river, no doubt it would have been better with the Times Square view but that\u2019s an extra cost. Could have done with a fridge in the room and the shower would have benefitted from more water pressure.\n\nThe one sticking point is the service fees. Although we were aware of them at the time of booking I still find it hard to justify the hotel actually charging them to guests. Several booking sites state that the WiFi is free (as you may expect) but apparently this is part of the service fee and at $35 a day seems excessive. Yes it includes other \u2018benefits\u2019 but I would expect and have received these at other hotels at no extra cost. I would have happily paid $10-15 for the WiFi each day but the rest is surplus to demand and I expect many guests don\u2019t make use of these extras. Either include it in the price of the room or break it down into optional extras that you pick and choose to pay as you use them. The member of staff who checked us in \u2018conveniently\u2019 forgot to mention the service fees and gave the impression that the WiFi was indeed free.\n\nI would happily stay again if the service fees were reconsidered and more transparent to guests.\n\n","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}
