I was staying at the ACE in their biggest suite and came here from a recommendation from a friend. The hotel was well kept, lots of smell of marijuana out side (real potpourri)  but better then the pee every where else in NYC. The valet gentlemen greeted me and showed me where to go, went to the front desk where I was greeted by Klewson? I think that was his name, was a little different and was kind, First he offered me water, asked me a cpl questions and then offered me my room. He was very polite and knowledgeable of the area when I pressed him for recommendations. \n\nThe room itself was comfortable, but a little smaller (but my other room was 1,500 square feet so of course found it small.

My wife and I saved up to celebrate my retirement by visiting NYC, which is actually my original hometown. After much research into which hotel we would stay at, we decided on the Soho Grand Hotel, based on the many positive online reviews and close proximity to several of the neighborhoods that we enjoy.\n\nUpon our arrival, we were greeted by hotel doormen Danny and Jose, who welcomed us and took care of our luggage. These same two gentlemen would continue to look after us during our stay, by offering us a smile and warm greetings as well restaurant recommendations (check out Soho pizza on the corner) and local directions.\n\nAfter checking-in at registration and receiving our room keys, we made it up to our room, which was located in the 11th floor and afforded us some views of the world below. Our luggage soon arrived as well as a welcome gift of a bottle of wine from Manager Marcus Morales. Thank you Marcus! The room itself was spacious and nicely appointed. The bathroom too was really nice  and very roomy. The room\u2019s\nlighting controls were a bit \u201cquirky\u201d, but we eventually got the hang of it. The shower controls were a bit \u201ctouchy\u201d and it was somewhat challenging to adjust the water temperature at times.  All in all, one of the nicer hotel rooms that I\u2019ve stayed in. Also, the hotel elevators were extremely fast and almost always available.\n\nOur trip was budgeted for 10 nights and that was a stretch for us, as the hotel is a bit pricey for\nus. Unfortunately both my wife and I contracted COVID while in NYC, requiring a self-imposed 5 day quarantine as well as needing to add 3 additional nights to our stay, until we were well enough to travel back home to California.\n\nWe notified the hotel staff of our illness, as we did not want to expose housekeeping or other hotel staff (or anyone else) to possibly getting sick.\n\nWhile we were on \u201clockdown\u201d, the front desk manager called and checked on us daily, to see if we had any needs. She offered us tea and fresh towels\/sheets from housekeeping, since we could neither leave our room or let housekeeping in. This was very kind of her and much appreciated. Speaking of Housekeeping, we met a very sweet woman named Muriel, who also checked in on us frequently and offered to meet any needs that we might have. Muriel is a keeper, for sure.\n\nAll in all, we had a great time at the Soho Grand Hotel. Even though we were only able to explore NYC for about 5 full days out of our 13 day trip, we made the best of it. The staff at this hotel turned a crappy situation into a tolerable situation and we were grateful for this.\n\nIf we can afford to, my wife and I hope to return to NYC sometime in the next few months, to see and experience some things that we missed during this trip. Although we may have found our new \u201chome away from home\u201d at the Soho Grand Hotel, we may have to stay elsewhere next time, as our finances took a bit of an unexpected hit this time and we look for something a little bit more inexpensive. That being said, the rates at Soho Grand Hotel are quite attractive in January\/February, so maybe again next year or the year after?\n\nI recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a hip, stylish yet very\nfriendly place to stay. The neighborhood is also great and very walkable.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel location is ideal for shopping, dining and close to many tourist attractions. The neighborhood is extremely quiet which makes for a perfect nights sleep. \nSoho Grand Hotel offers many wonderful amenities: If you don't feel like dining out, the hotel has a lovely restaurant called the Soho Diner which has inside seating & an outside garden area, the menu has a nice variety of food selections &  great ambience. Incredibly designed . The Salon also offers a wonderful array of food choices with a hip vibe. \nTip: Inquire if a room is available facing the Soho Grand Dog park, its such a treat to observe the dogs frolicking in lovely garden setting. In addition one can also see the Empire State Building & the Chrysler Building.","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"SOLO"}

This visit fell a bit short sadly.  First the positives: my room was exactly as expected- clean and well appointed and ready upon arrival even tho I was 3 hours before check in; the common areas clean, gym great.  Sadly- there were some negatives this trip: 1) people staying with pets not being informed their pet MUST be leashes - some dog covered my trousers with pet hair in the elevator; 2) the hotel bar where I met my client for a drink- had one waiter for 15-20 tables- he was CLEARLY in the weeds - couldn\u2019t get his attention for drinks or the check (the hostess had to take care of the drinks and after 15 minutes I just told the hostess to put the drinks on my room)- I was surprised to see a 20% service charge for the drinks when the service was truly sub-par.  3) i mentioned a mistake on Expedia\u2019s website regarding \u201cfree parking\u201d which I knew to be an error; when I mentioned it to the front desk person on checkout he was almost condescending in the way he told me \u201cyou must have been looking at a different hotel\u201d- lol.  Not my problem pal- just being a nice person so u could mention it to someone in authority to correct the problem.

Here are the details:\n\n1) I asked three times to get my shower unclogged and it was never fixed. I was there for four nights and every day in the morning I would ask for someone to come up to my room and fix the shower. It was very unpleasant to take showers and have the tub get filled with dirty water as the drains were not working correctly.\n\n2) The waiter in the restaurant was extremely rude to my wife and I. We had issues with him for all four days. On the last day I had a big argument with him because he kept on asking me for a breakfast voucher and I did not have one. I do not understand why he could not simply charge what I ordered to my room or have me pay with a credit card. He was loud and very unwelcoming.\n\nI did not catch his name, but he was a short man with a heavy accent and about 220lb.\n\n3) The bell person that was at the entrance of the hotel on Wednesday April 12 at around 2 PM was extremely rude. He kept asking me how much I was paying for the ride to JFK and was trying to look at my phone. He then tells me that he has been working there for 27 years and that I should not get upset with him. How could I not get upset if he is trying to sell me some bogus JJK ride and trying to look at my phone uninvited?  \n\nHe then proceeded to take my luggage and threw it unordered in the back of the vehicle that I had reserved. It was a very intimidating situation.\n\nYou should really watch the kind of people you have serving there. There are many hotels in NY and with the service you are giving people, one would not come back. ","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"NONE"}

The staff were helpful - especially the friendly doormen - and they were happy to help with complementary essential toiletries when the airline lost our luggage which was really appreciated.\n\nWe were on a budget and so didn't eat and drink much at the hotel itself.  We had a drink at the hotel bar on Saturday night which was fantastic although expensive.  There are food and coffee places round the corner which we used a few times to keep costs down.  We like to run and it's easy to get down to the riverside by West Street for scenic runs towards or away from World Trade Center and Battery Park.\n\nWe did note that - especially in the corrodors - if the lights had been bright they would have exposed corridors that need some love from the decoarion perspective, but the room itself was nice so it didn't really matter to us.  If you're looking for a perfect finish or  modern decor this may not be your place, but if you are looking for character and a great location you'll probably like it.

I particularly appreciated that even though the hotel is relatively new, it had so many classic touches such as high ceilings, plenty of light, impressive attention to detail and, best of all, an overwhelmingly upbeat and attentive staff. \n\nThough mine was a short visit, I am confident that for even longer stays, the Soho Grand will be the perfect NYC hotel for me, my colleagues and my clients.\n\nOne last thing: Ollie did not join me on this visit...but he would have been totally welcome as the Soho Grand is dog friendly and provides an adjacent dog park...which is not easy to find in that part of NYC!","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The location in particular is superb - easy walking distance to lots of places like Ground Zero, Brooklyn Bridge, and all of the cool neighbourhoods like Little Italy, Chinatown etc. Right next door to Canal St subway to take you uptown. The rooms were a good size and the beds really comfortable. Bathrooms were very nice and spacious - although the shower did seem to take an age to get hot.  If you get a room on the north side of the hotel there are great views too. \nWe were a party of 6 - my husband and I (and our two children and their partners (all in their mid 20s), we chose the hotel because of the DJ and cool bar\/lounge of a weekend. We thought it would be great for them ( and us) to hang out after we'd been out in the evening. HOWEVER - of the four nights we were there we only managed to secure a table at the bar once. It is clearly a very popular night out for local New Yorkers and there were queues to get into the hotel on Friday and Saturday nights. When we tried to get into the Lounge area to sit down we were basically told there was no chance, and we would have to stand at the bar only. On the Saturday night we waited for 40 mins at the bar to get served and eventually gave up and went to bed. There was no priority given to hotel residents which was very disappointing. The Club Room seems to be closed in January which means there simply isn't enough room for residents and outside guests. We all loved the ambience - loud, lively, buzzing - but it just felt a little too chaotic and badly managed. And we did wonder where hotel guests who prefer a quieter drink were meant to go?\nIn summary - this is a good hotel, with a great location. But you need to think about the kind of nighttime experience you are looking for - it's loud, lively and very cool in the Bar and Lounge, but that might not be what everyone is looking for.","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Housekeeping was excellent, really nice people. Due to Covid, the hotel's restaurant hours are not daily and there is no concierge or bell person to assist, so you're on your own there. Gilligan's restaurant on the ground floor was really wonderful but a bit intimidating having a set amount of time to order and eat. They didn't adhere to it, and we did have a hefty bill going.

Weiter ging es damit das wir um eine Kreditkarte zur Sicherheit gefragt wurden. Das diese Karte mit 1000,- $ Vorreserviert wird, haben wir nur durch einen Mitteilung der Bank App erfahren.  Unsere Information an das Personal, das unsere Koffer leider nicht mitgekommen sind und von der Airline ins Hotel nachgeliefert werden und wir daher gerne Tipps f\u00fcr den Einkauf von Unterw\u00e4sche und T-Shirt wurde geflissentlich ignoriert. K\u00f6nnte auch sein, dass aufgrund der lauten Musik unsere Frage nicht geh\u00f6rt wurde. Nebenbei wurde uns noch nonchalant mitgeteilt, dass unsere  Reservierung f\u00fcr den Abend zum Essen wegen einer Privatveranstaltung nicht m\u00f6glich sei, aber wir k\u00f6nnten ja f\u00fcr morgen reservieren. Wir hatten aber jetzt Hunger nach einem stundenlagen Flug nach New York. \nNachdem wir \u00fcber die Koffer Tracking-App informiert wurden, dass unsere Koffer im Hotel abgegeben wurden, gingen wir an den Hotelempfang, um sie dort abzuholen. Dort wurde uns mitgeteilt die Koffer seien nicht da und es g\u00e4be auch kleine Mitteilung in der EDV dazu. Auf unsere Bitte beim Doorman telefonisch nachzufragen, wurde uns geantwortet, wenn die Koffer nicht im System sind, sie auch nicht da seien. Wir gingen dann selbst in das EG und konnten dort im Lager unsere Koffer entdecken und mitnehmen. Einen Kofferservice der behilflich ist das Gep\u00e4ck auf das Zimmer zu bringen gibt es in diesem Hotel nicht. Der Roomservice kam nur wenn wir das Schild zum Reinigen des Zimmers an die T\u00fcrklinke anbrachten,  Haken f\u00fcr die Winterm\u00e4ntel gab es keine im Zimmer und der Schrank war so klein, dass in diesen keinesfalls Kleidung f\u00fcr zwei Personen unterzubringen waren. Unsere Bitte nach mehr als drei Kleiderb\u00fcgel kam man dann nach dreimaliger Aufforderung auch nach.\nIm Hotel-Restaurant haben wir uns das Club- Sandwich mit H\u00e4hnchen bestellt, dass so scharf war das es nicht zu essen war. Unseren Hinweis an den Keller dies vielleicht auf der Karte zuk\u00fcnftig auch zu vermerken, wurde mit Emp\u00f6rung entgegen genommen. \nDer sehr unfreundliche Service wurde noch einmal getoppt an unserem letzten Tag. Unser Flug ging erst um 22.30 Uhr und wir wollten daher vom sp\u00e4ten Nachmittag bis 18.30 Uhr in der Lobby auf unsere Abholung warten. Nach dem uns aber aufgrund von zahlreichen Reservierungen nur einen Platz von einer Stunde angeboten wurde, platze mir der Kragen. Ich dachte immer eine Hotellobby geh\u00f6rt in erster Linie den Hotelg\u00e4sten. Das scheint in diesem Hotel nicht der Fall zu sein.\n\u00dcberhaupt hatte man immer den Eindruck das der Coolness-Faktor wichtiger war als das Wohl der Hotelg\u00e4ste. Einmal freundlich willkommen zu werden oder ein L\u00e4cheln beim Personal schien nicht m\u00f6glich, vor allem nicht von den Mitarbeitern an der Rezeption. Ich kann mich nicht erinnern wann ich das letzte Mal im Hotel mit den Worten \u201enext\u201c aufgefordert wurde mein Anliegen zu \u00e4u\u00dfern.

The staff has completely changed and the room we always had exists no more. The second year we stayed (2013), the back room manager Michael (he is no longer there) would send a personal note with two chocolates up to welcome us. He always gave us the same deluxe corner room on the 15th floor. We did get a deluxe corner room (1009) this time and its as nice as before, but the room rate has increased 22%, with less amenities. One of the things we enjoyed before was a coffee room down the hall where we can get coffee (decaf or caf), capucchino, latte, tea, etc. No more. We now have two pods, two sugars, and two creamers. Some days we get refills, some days we don't. There was no decaf option or any fancy concoction. The room was booked for two, but they had one robe and set up for one. There was no clock. Fortunately, we had our iphones for alarms.  We had to run the hot water faucet for at least 3 minutes to get the hot water up to our floor. In California, where we live, we would be fined for wasting water! We always had a connecting door, but our neighbors were always considerate and quiet. Not this time, as the woman next door had a pajama party beginning at 1 a.m. the first night. After security was called, she continued, and I was tired of complaining, so I didn't. She was so loud, as were her two girl friends, that we heard everything they said and did. They finally went to sleep at 3.30 a.m. By then, we were too irritated to go to sleep.  I was assured by the front desk that she was checking out that day. She didn't. The next night. she came back to her room alone and spoke loudly on the phone until 1 a.m. I have read on Trip Advisor that some hotels in the area provide sound machines. I suggest Soho Grand do the same for noisy neighbors. As for the restaurant, the Grand Salon exceeded expectations. We hosted a Thanksgiving meal there in 2017 and it was a disaster. This time, we hosted a luncheon and everyone agreed that the food deserved a 5 out of 5 rating, with compliments to the waiter Alex. At least that was a bright spot for this year.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"NONE"}

The rooms themselves were fine.  The hotel staff are not warm and friendly, it almost feels as though they have done you a favour to allow you to pay to stay.  Strong smell of cannabis in the room.  Very poor internet connection especially in the communal areas.   They removed large sums of money form my bank account on check in ($1400) which they said was for future incidentals.  On the morning we were due to check out they took further sums of money from my bank account instead of using the $1400 they had taken on check in.  Almost two weeks after checking out I am still waiting for the return of the full sum meaning we've been overcharged hundreds of dollars.   Communication with the hotel is poor - they seem reluctant to engage to deal with the matter.  \nWe stayed over the weekend - they appear to prioritise their Saturday night locals over residents for a seat at the bar or the restaurant.  We were told that they couldn't't tell us if a table would take 30 minutes or three hours and we should eat in our room.  \nAll in all not what you expect from any hotel especially one in a country which prides itself on customer service.

Great location and property but overall mixed feelings. I booked the largest room category ( Grand Corner King) and the room is very large, with good views and relatively quiet, as on top floors. I arrived at 9 and they gave me the room straight away (official check in is 4pm) which I consider top notch service. The room charge now also has an amenity fee which includes stuff that was available to guests (gym, neighborhood guide etc) that has always been available, so I guess it is just a hidden post pandemic price increase. It also includes complimentary water, which puzzled me as the room only featured overpriced designer minibar water. Upon asking I was given a 236ml\/8ou bottle (this is not a joke), which made me laugh. You don\u2019t get this in the room but you need to ask at reception and if you challenge the size of the bottle they throw a few into a plastic bag for you to carry up into the room. Housekeeping is impeccable and super friendly if you happen to meet them. The biggest challenge is the staff. Some are extremely friendly and some - especially in the lounge\/ bar - are so arrogant that it is ridiculous. Upon checking out the receptionist did not ask whether wanted to see the bill (I did, thankfully so, as it was incorrect) and whether my stay was pleasant. The housekeeper - who probably makes a lot less money - did ask though. The bellhops are very helpful and friendly. I generally like the Soho Grand but I feel they need to reconsider their price approach (amenity fee!) and consistency of service.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

This time, my partner and I checked in for a long weekend getaway in NY on Aug. 25th. We reserved an upgraded corner room and while it's been a while since COVID that I had been there, at first everything was fine. \n     The morning after we checked in, the room felt warm.  NY was in the 90s that weekend, so somewhat understandable.  We went out for the day and when we came back the room was 80 degrees.  Although it sounded like the AC was on, there was no cold air circulating.  We called the front desk and they sent up an engineer, who tried to get the AC to work, but told us it was unfixable and they'd need to move us to another room.  He told us that he'd get in touch with the front desk and they'd arrange to move us. \n      After about an hour, we hadn't heard anything and needed to leave to catch a show and dinner.  I called down to the front desk, and explained the situation.  The response \"I don't know anything about this\"...ok, thanks. I re-explained the engineer said he was going to reach out.  \"Well nobody told me, and i don't know anything about moving rooms.\" thanks again for the helpful attitude.  The tone was as if I was making this up.  I told him that we were going out for the night and when we got back, I'd expect that they'd straighten this out, and have another room for us.\n     We got back to the hotel around midnight on Friday night and went up to the room.  82 degrees and no AC. Back down to the desk--and when you go to the desk on Friday night, the adjacent bar has turned into a thumping nightclub and the front desk attendants stay in the office behind the desk.  After waiting for a couple of minutes, someone finally came out.  Re-explained the situation (and you have to yell over the music for them to hear you) and was greeted with \"I don't know what to tell you, we're sold out\".  I had to ask to speak to a manager, who came up to the room and immediately said, \"wow, it's hot in here\".  No kidding.  The best they could do was give us a fan, guarantee a new room at 3PM the next day and a refund of our $40 a night amenity fee.  I explained that they could have handled the situation so much better at 5PM than they were at now almost 1AM.  They couldn't even call the Roxy to see if they had rooms available-it's their sister hotel....\n     We ended up checking out immediately and walking over to 11 Howard to check in in the middle of the night  (the folks at 11 Howard were great, BTW).  We were charged for a  Friday night stay we didn't even use and were treated rudely thru out the experience.  I understand things break, but to have two service people be so unhelpful really speaks to how much this hotel doesn't live up to the Grand in the title.  Now that travel is ramping back up, it's unfortunate that this hotel is off my list for NY stays...","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Schlepping ones own bags up to the tiny 2nd floor lobby is inconvenient and makes a poor first impression. One doesn\u2019t feel coddled here.\n\nThe terrace suite was indeed grand.  Very spacious and the terrace itself was superb with plenty of plants, comfy seating, an awning and a table for eating.  Nicely furnished rooms (I particularly liked the coffee table whose legs were stacks of the NYTimes), very comfortable bed and good quality linens.  The bathroom was enormous, the wallpaper witty and towels fluffy.   And yet there is only one hook from which to hang a towel or a bathrobe.

The doormen are security guards and on top of everything, your room key needs to be scanned in the elevator to get to the upper floors where the rooms are located and you can\u2019t piggyback off another guests card, each person has to scan to get to their floor. We had a few hours before our train home so we spent that time back in the Salon and enjoyed the beautiful room and conversation with our adult kids before heading out. I was such a pleasurable experience. We usually stay at another hotel as I\u2019m very picky about cleanliness, service & security, well, this is our new go to hotel, it was better than we could have imagined, we absolutely enjoyed our time. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND giving it a try!!!!","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Diner breakfast was pricey but very tasty. Service in the Diner was impeccable. Location near several major subway lines is a major plus. \nThree small issues: The biggest challenge was noise in the hallway. The room door blocks no noise at all. I was awoken at 5am on the first night of my stay by someone talking in a normal voice in the hallway. The person was not shouting. After that, I used noise-canceling headphones to sleep. That should not be necessary for a hotel in this price category. Sound insulation matters. \nFor $12.95, premium internet should be much stronger. 20MBps was promised; I got 15-16MBps. Service at this level should be included.\nCharging $5 for each coffee pod in the room feels like an overcharge. If you put a coffee maker in the room, at least a couple of coffee pods should be complimentary.

I got a \u201cshades-of-yesteryear\u201d vibe. The hotel is located at the edge of SoHo, off Canal, near Tribeca. It\u2019s a bit gritty in this area. I used SpotHero and parked at the garage directly across the street for my two-night stay. I came in with my two dogs to visit my daughter at NYU. It\u2019s  a 15-minute walk to Washington Square Park. It\u2019s a quick walk to many great shops, cafes, and restaurants in SoHo, Nolita, Little Italy, and Tribeca. The very charming, hotel-owned dog park is about a 3 minute walk around the corner on Grand Street. It\u2019s open 7-7, but, as any dog owner knows, most pups need a quick walk before bed, and there\u2019s nowhere else close by for them to go to the bathroom. Not sure why the park can\u2019t be accessed up until 10 or 11 pm. \n\nThe friendly hotel doormen were only there sporadically, and there are two sets of heavy doors. With two dogs on leashes and bags, door service would have been appreciated, or at least a button to automatically activate both sets of doors. On the ground floor there\u2019s a concierge desk. You must go up one flight to the dark lobby. Check in was quick and friendly, however there was zero recognition of my dogs, and I was on a dog package. They were out of treats for the duration of my stay.  No offer of dog beds. They provided cat-size bowls for my large dogs. No offer of pet-friendly places in the area; luckily I know the area  well. \n\nI was in a king-bed room on the 6th floor. The room was a decent size, and the bathroom was large by NYC standards. (For two people with luggage, it\u2019d be a tight squeeze).  There was a good amount of storage in the armoire. Two drawers built into the window unit area were a good size. The bed was comfortable; the huge SMART tv and high-quality stereo were nice touches. I appreciated the Nespresso machine and fridge. Solid construction meant no noise from surrounding rooms; however, ask for a room not facing West Broadway, as it was very noisy all night. The room was too hot. I put on the ac and cracked the window and it was still too warm. The hot water lasted for about 30 seconds. I called the front  desk and was told to let it run to get warm. Nothing like a freezing cold shower in February. The room was very clean. I appreciated the light dimming features. Be aware there\u2019s no blackout shade. \n\nIt was dark everywhere in this hotel. I kept thinking I had on my sunglasses.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t told upon check in that I had to use my room key to operate the elevator. I flagged down an employee who tried to help me \u201cfix\u201d the elevator. He didn\u2019t realize I wasn\u2019t told about the key access and he spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong. The three elevators were always quick and readily available. \n\nTo me it seemed like people who don\u2019t know NYC chose to stay here because they thought it would be hip. Maybe I\u2019m too old to appreciate contemporary hip factor. \n\nI\u2019d stay again if traveling with my dogs- the dog park was tres chic-  and for a discounted rate. If with my family, I\u2019d stay in the many nicer-in-my-opinion properties nearby.","travelDate":"2022-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

Location - everywhere is close, subway line is good, walking is good\n2. Service - friendly, warm welcome, upgrade\n3. Room - as far as NY goes, spacious, nicely designed, amazing view from 14th floor\n4. Sleep - this is a quiet hotel, no room from surrounding rooms\n5. Hotel bar - great vibes\n\nWhat could be better?\n1. The Diner food is pretty decent but the concept doesn't really come off and was mostly empty. They also messed up our room service order.\n2. The shower drainage was slow, some maintenance around that is due\n3. Getting hot water to the shower could take 5 mins (granted we were high and the weather was cold)\n4. The sink drain plug mechanism was broken (had to adjust from under the bathroom sink)\n5. The noise from the air con was constant, even when turned off (although it did provide some white noise air cover for the street noise)\n6. Pillows too firm, kinked neck\n7. Charging for decent wifi is a bit old school (basic was free)\n8. No tea supplies in the room\n\nWill we return? Probably. Like most NY hotels, pricing will range 190-500 depending on season and capacity. This hotel is probably worth something in the middle.","travelDate":"2022-01","tripType":"NONE"}

Seems like a mix of business meetings during the day and a fun crowd of all ages at night. The rooms were clean,  comfortable and nicely decorated . The location is fanatic, as there are so many great restaurants in the area. Finally the service was impeccable. Everyone was warm, welcoming, and efficient. HUGE shout out to Marcus. He checked us in and was wonderful. Marcus made a great first impression and we immediately knew we were in good hands. He gave us fantastic recommendations of places to check out in the local area and was so warm and welcoming. I highly recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Just another typical hotel stay in the city; might as well save half by staying somewhere that does not pretend to be better.   The location was great and the room was nice, but from the start I was a little dismayed at the service \/ amenities.  We arrived in the rain and there was no valet parking.  After asking a guy in uniform on the sidewalk, we were told we had to self park in the garage across the street, which required backing up.  $82 self park that you have to walk you luggage back up the entry\/exit ramp and across the street in the rain.  Ok for 2 or 3 star hotel, but not here.  Of course when leaving early in the morning, it was dumping again and there was noody up front.  We crossed the street in the downpour.  Check in was fine.  Hotel is dark in halls and elevator areas (not sure if good or bad).  The room was very nice; it had just about everything you'd expect.  Typical size for the city.  \nOur comically bad service at the bar: We met friends (also guests at the hotel) at the mostly empty hotel bar for a drink and after talking and waiting 10+ minutes at a table next to bar, decided to ask the tender directly what draft beer there was, so we could get a drink, like most people like to do in a bar.  All the taps are not working.  According to the bartender, they had one pale ale and one pilsner in bottles.  I asked him for 2 pilsners and one pale ale.  He heard me, as did the two other guys in uniform nearby standing around doing nothing.  He directed me to them and told me they'd take my order at the table.  Dude then came over and asked what we would like as if he had never seen us before.  I even had to repeat the order with my buddy clarifying that it was 2 pilsners and not 2 pale ales. Then, and this is the funniest part, he calls out to the bartender \"two pilsners and one pale ale\".  I thought I was in a sketch comedy.  The pilsners were $14 each and the pale ale was $10.  A 3 star hotel at best.  Not worth the extra $ to stay here.   Not even close.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The location of the hotel is perfect for walking to so many spots - we easily walked to Tribeca, the West Village, the Highline, WTC, and other areas from here.  One of the staff that I do want to highlight is Marcus at the front desk.  He was incredibly helpful, professional and friendly.
