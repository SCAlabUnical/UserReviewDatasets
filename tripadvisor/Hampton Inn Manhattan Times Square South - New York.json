Proximity to everything is excellent. Train station, bus\/subway access, plenty of delis and a 7\/11 all within one block of the hotel. The hotel breakfast was not particularly athlete-friendly but also not bad, which saved a lot of cash. Rooms very small but tidy, bathrooms could use fix-ups and a deeper clean. What stressed us the most was 1) finding out upon arrival that there is a 300 USD deposit on every single room rented, which unexpectedly showed up on one of our staff's credit cards two days after check-in, and 2) the two lifts are extremely slow, janky, and small. Waiting for the lift on the 30th floor took on average 10-15 minutes (no exaggeration) and even once we got in the elevator, we hit every single floor on the way down almost every time. Some of our team got stuck in the elevator for an hour at night and got to meet FDNY, which is maybe a unique tourist experience. ALL IN ALL: expensive, but some perks and the location is great. If you're just sleeping in the hotel and nothing more, it's probably perfect. Plan for extra time and extra cost.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We went out and that evening we came back to the room and it was cold in our room. So we turned the heater up to about 72 degrees, and called the front desk and asked for extra blankets, we were told that they were in the drawer. Obviously they expected problems in this room. We were very cold that night because the heater was not working properly, even after we turned it up to 80 degrees. The next morning before we went out we asked for extra blankets and informed them that the heater was not working, they stated that they would send maintenance up to repair the heater. We returned that afternoon and at this time the heater was working, it was set to 85 degrees, but extremely hot in the room so we turned it off. Before we went out to dinner, when we returned the room it was cold again, so we turned the heater back on to 80 degrees went to bed Around 9pm, we realized that the room was still very cold, so we turned the heater off, and used the extra blankets. \nAbout 10pm the heater came back on and started to blow cold air automatically all though it was switched off. Then we disconnected it from inside the heater unit, \nbut the heater still would not turn off. The outside temperature was between 18 - 24 degrees and it was snowing. Then my wife called the front desk and spoke to the front desk night manager Victoria, my wife tried to explain the situation and Victoria and she continued to speak over her, and would not listen. Victoria then said that she would send up a maintenance guy up at 10:15 pm. My wife attempted to tell her that it was after 10 pm and her husband was trying to sleep, due to an early morning flight. This would have been very inconvenient due to the fact that we were in bed. After all of the commotion my husband was woken up, Victoria the night desk manager then hung up on my wife. \nThen my husband called down to speak with her and Victoria did the same to him, speaking over him and not listening to what was going on with the heater. \nThe next morning we came down stairs to go to the airport, a very nice young man was very apologetic. We then left, after returning home my husband made several calls to the general manager Brianna, but he received no response. I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone, due to the VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, \nand as I stated I am in the hotel business. \nI then contacted the corporate office of Hampton with little luck due to this Hampton was a franchise.

And it was quite expensive.   I stayed here three nights.  Before coming, I picked my room as the Hampton Inn allows.  I chose Room 204.  However, they gave me a room several floors higher.  They told me that is not an actual guest room but a storage room.  He also said this is always a problem since guests select this room.  It seems like Room 204 should not be a choice then.  Had this not been a choice I could have chosen another second floor room. I usually choose a low floor due to some hotels having slow elevator service.  And the elevator service was terrible.  Also, the lights for many floors would not light up in the elevators.  The two elevators were slow and there is no space for guests to wait by the elevators.  The lobby and area by the elevators is quite tight.   I usually took the stairs but a staff member had to unlock the door to take the stairs up so that was not so easy.   The room was rather small, worn and dated.  There were used bars of soap in the shower.  The water from the faucet was warm so I brushed my teeth with warm water.  It was difficult to get warm water in the shower.  Perhaps I should have brushed my teeth in the shower where I got cold water.  The staff was polite and helpful.  Housekeeping stopped by when I was in the room two days though I did not need nor request anything.  The housekeeping staff I interacted with was good.  The breakfast was very good though that area is not spacious but it did not get crowded so I was happy with breakfast.  The lady running that area did a great job.

That's it.  And while I *technically* did experience these things (which is why this is not a one star review), the quality of each was so sub-par, I wound up shortening my trip and checking out out early.  My sliding shower door barely slid and required significant force (and I say that as someone who is 5'10\" and works out regularly).  The toilet handle was not attached to the tank, and was just hanging out the side.  The pillows were each so flat, I could ball one up and grip it in my hand.  Good luck with breakfast if you don't eat meat or are trying to limit carbs.  And the clincher--that is the worst wifi connection I have experienced in YEARS.  Oh, but wouldn't you know it, for $5, I could have a \"premium\" connection; I shouldn't have to pay extra to simply browse the internet and respond to emails.  I couldn't *function* in this room.\n\nI could look past the occasional cosmetic issues--inexplicable stains on the mirrors, chipped furniture, etc (I don't think anyone staying here is expecting luxury), but there were enough to notice that collectively, the room felt very worn and tired.  I found the staff cold (with the exception of one maintenance worker I kept bumping into), with zero acknowledgement that I was a Hilton Honors member (I should note that I personally don't need this acknowledged, but in the after-stay survey I was emailed, this was a detail about which they asked).  When I checked out early, the woman at the front desk was visibly confused, asked another employee for assistance, who curtly and without any eye contact or acknowledgement that something might be amiss to require the early departure, simply said, \"yeah, it's fine.\"  No goodbye, no thank you, nothing.

We went to the front desk several times between checking in and Sunday, asking for our shower to be cleaned so we could use it.  Housekeepers did not understand what we were saying even when we were using google translate to communicate with them. And front desk staff just kept saying they would pass it on to housekeeping. One housekeeper came and removed one of the 2 used bars of soap but did not have any cleaning supplies with them, just a garbage bag. On Sunday evening my kids made a fort with the comforter on the bed which we discovered was covered in someone elses blood on the underside. We went back to the desk and the supervisor, head of housekeeping and one other staff member came to our room so we could show them. Sunday evening our bedding was changed and the remaining used soap removed and body wash refilled but the shower was still not cleaned with cleaning supplies. I asked the desk for a print out of all our requests to have our shower cleaned but he just verbally read them to me. I am uterly disgusted with the lack of sanitation with this hotel, and the seriousness of blood soiled bedding being left for the next occupants. We have several photos of the bloody blanket, the used soaps, the mold in the shower which they did have someone remove as soon as they saw it. (The 3 staff noted they could smell it themself as they walked in the bathroom with us.) Hygene and sanitation are overlooked and guests are put at risk because of it. I am disiponted in the lack of action from management in dealing with this seriously hazardious situation.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Due to my job, I have stayed at multiple Hilton properties achieving Diamond Level in their Hilton Honors frequency program.  \nUpon arrival, there was some chaos and commotion throughout the lobby with guests and luggage throughout.  We arrived after check in but rooms were not available for guests to be checked in which included ours.  The desk agent greeted me to share that we had a king room with three guests and I shared that I actually had 4 guests and would need a room with two beds.  She mentioned that the hotel was sold out and I questioned how the reservation would have been handled even with 3 guests in a king room.  Eventually I was checked into a room and I asked specifically whether the room had two beds and was assured that it did.  \nUpon going up to the room, I was not surprised to find that the room did NOT have a second bed but did have a sofa which I found actually was a sofa sleeper.  When I pulled out the mattress, there was no linens on the mattress and noted that there were multiple issues (stains, marks, etc.) with the mattress but since two beds appeared to be an issue with the hotel, we would do what we needed to do to make it work.  I attempted to call down to the front desk to ask for linens but the phone did not work, no dial tone although it was connected to the jack in the wall outlet.  \nWe returned to the lobby to ask for linens, a shower curtain (there wasn\u2019t one) and some additional towels.  Upon our return to the room after a light snack, we had a shower curtain although it was about 18\u201d from the floor as we had a handicap accessible shower and the attendant arrived shortly after with linens for the sofa bed.  Since they provided additional sets of linens, we used them all wrapping the mattress with multiple layers to try and make it comfortable.  \nShortly after our return, we realized that the toilet took approximately 20 minutes to refill after flushing so we ended up using an ice bucket to fill from the sink and then placing into the toilet tank (it takes 5 ice buckets to fill).  Eventually we realized that the hand shower wand from the shower could also reach the toilet tank so we just used that to fill the toilet \u2013 was much quicker and since there were 4 of us in the room, we needed to be able to refill quite frequently.  \nSince our bathroom was handicap accessible, there was water everywhere after taking showers.  We attempted to create some level of a towel barrier to try and keep some of the water contained plus we limited the amount of water shower time for just the beginning and end of the shower experience.  We couldn\u2019t just leave the water run like you would when taking a normal shower.  \nThe building is 32 floors and they only have two elevators so it is chaotic getting up and down stopping on every floor.  Thankfully we were on the top floor so when the elevator reached our floor it was empty but it would stop at every floor going down and would be full by the 30th floor and you would have to stop at every single floor going down taking 15-20 minutes to reach the bottom lobby floor.  Taking the stairs down from that high up didn\u2019t appear to be a possibility.  \nAll in all, I would never stay at this property again.  I\u2019m surprised that it can continue to operate under the Hampton Inn name as the brand consistency was definitely not in play during our visit to this location.  \n","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I\u2019m not usually one to leave reviews but I feel I need to here. I would usually book direct with Hilton but it was cheaper through booking.com. The hotel is in major need of modernisation, nothing about this hotel screams Hilton apart from a few logs. I was put on the 4th floor next to the stairs door. There was a massive group of school children\/teens and the shouting and screaming until 2.30am was too much even for the city that doesn\u2019t sleep. The place was heaving the next morning as it looked like they were all checking out, but disrespectful doesn\u2019t come close to the behaviour on that first night.\nThis Hilton is more like a hostel than a hotel. The rooms are fitted with electric heaters so loud it would be impossible to sleep. I was moved to the 20th floor which was quieter but the room still pretty much the same, I could smell cleaning products so it must have been turned around that day. The place was cleanish, the bathrooms could have had more attention but the room was ok. The higher up you go, the longer it takes to feed hot water so expect to run your shower for a bit.\nBreakfast\u2026 well\u2026 if you are thinking this is going to be the typical feast that Hilton puts on, You are very wrong. Paper plates, paper cups, Plastic cutlery and cold food is what you will get. There is scrambled egg, sausage and mini potatoes from the \u201chot\u201d selection, that\u2019s it, then some bread to toast and cereal. Breakfast area is canteen like, find a seat if you can. \nIn the room; the towels and paper coffee cups were branded with Holiday Inn logos and you are given powered milk. Maid service is just changing bins, don\u2019t expect beds to be made or anything, it\u2019s just bins being emptied. \nHad this have been a hotel chain I wasn\u2019t use to I probably wouldn\u2019t have left a review, but you pay for the brand and you don\u2019t receive the brand, literally.. to have this hotel under the Hilton name is an embarrassment, worst Hilton I\u2019ve ever stayed in and I\u2019m a frequent guest.

She was texting on her mobile phone when I entered the hotel. She stared at me and begrudgingly got up from where she was sitting and pointed to the station she wanted me to go to. She then continued to text while I was standing there. No smile. No polite interaction. No mention of Diamond status\u2026.literally nothing. Now I was not about to say anything because it appeared she was allowing me to check-in early, which I am very thankful for. But, wow. She was so perfunctory and rude. Definitely not someone who should be working at the front desk of a hotel.\n\nRoom - \n\nMy room was very large (for NYC standards) and super clean. The king size bed was very comfortable. The AC \/ heating unit was quiet and worked great. Room had an armoire, iron, ironing board, hair dryer, mini-refrigerator, and safe. Complimentary wi-fi was awful. Not reliable and sometimes slow. Plenty of conveniently placed electrical outlets.\n\nThe bathroom was what I expected\u2026.pretty small. The walk-in shower with glass sliding door (very difficult to slide) was very small, but the water pressure was excellent and the water stayed hot which I love. Not much counter space, but a huge medicine cabinet with mirror was above the sink. This worked out great! Every time you flushed the toilet it sounded like a freight train was barreling towards you\u2026.literally. I have never experienced this at a hotel before. \n\nHotel Information -\n\nThe hotel has 184 rooms and 32 floors. According to my records I have stayed here in the past, but I do not remember when or what my experience was like. \n\nDecent size lobby. Two elevators to access 32 floors. One was inoperable on my second day. Yes, you can imagine what a nightmare that is. Be prepared for long waits. Also, there is a slot for your key card in the elevator, but it does not work. So, not a very safe hotel. The hotel has a fitness center and business center. I never eat the free buffet breakfast at Hampton Inn\u2019s because I find them to be gross, so I can\u2019t comment on the breakfast.\n\nLocation - \n\nLocated in the heart of the Garment District, a short walk to the Theater District, Hudson Yards, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, and Chelsea. It is right around the corner from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It is about a 15 minute \/ 0.7 mile walk to the center of Times Square. Hudson Yards is the same distance in the opposite direction. Bryant Park is about a 12 minute \/ 0.5 mile walk. \n\nWhile there were many positives of this hotel, the customer service I experienced was just inexcusable and shocking. This is the main reason for the average score. ","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

Only two fairly small elevators for a 32 floor hotel, and I think one of those was broken.  10 to 15 minute waits minimum, made worse by the fact that because of the waits, the call button in the halls had been pressed on nearly every single floor.

I went to the desk to have the security deposit retuned to my credit card for the two rooms I had booked. That seemed to be quite straightforward but the receptionist said I owed the hotel 8 cents.  I asked how this was even possible as the booking had been with Booking.com and had been paid some weeks ago.   Did not buy anything at the hotel.   Tried to pay the 8 cents in cash but this was not possible.  Receptionist told me it has to be on my card.   As we were going for our flight I reluctantly agreed to let her have the payment.  However, I had only stepped away from reception when my credit card fraud department texted to ask if I had made a payment of \u00a31460.23p as this hotel had taken that amount from my card.  I replied saying  NO I hadn\u2019t.   I spoke to the hotel Manager who couldn\u2019t give any explanation as to why this had happened.

We inquired and were told crews were working overnight to fix it. Went out for a bite and returned to welcome friends who were standing in a long line at counter (one person working and credit card machine broken, so all rooms stayed on reserved card). While they waited to check in, I waited for the elevator. I chose to walk up and down the 17 flights to put our leftovers in fridge. We then waited about an hour for them to check in, get elevator to 19th floor and come back down. The safe in our room was broken, I asked for service but no one ever came to repair\/replace it. The bathroom outlet in one room was unaccessible, it was behind the medicine cabinetThe wifi was unreliable, the treadmill in gym was broken. Each person we spoke to about the issues were honestly concerned and empathetic but seemed like their hands were tied. The straw that broke the camels back was on our second day we were up to freshen up and start our day and we had No HOT WATER, not cold water waiting to get hot but no water only air through our sink or shower. Once again I spoke with a gentleman who said he would send someone up. We waited 1.5 hours and noone ever came. The 2nd elevator remained broken. The lobby was filled with people complaining about wifi, elevator and no hot water. Everyone we came in contact with on property was a pleasure and well aware of the shortcomings.

We were on the 26th floor so not easy to just use stairs.\nI totalled a time of 3 hours and 52mins waiting for the lift over our near week stay. This is unacceptable. We ended up staying away from room to avoid disruption.\n \n2.\nOn the Saturday night we encountered a loud noise which was coming from the pipework behind our room \u2013 the whole wall vibrated, and it seemed that the toilet was also vibrating. If you put your hand to the shower wall you could feel the vibration and hear the very loud buzzing \u2013 like air trapped or plumbing blockage. This occurred at 3.15am and at first it was so loud we thought it was a fire siren in the hotel. It lasted 20 minutes and woke both my partner and I.\nWe reported this Sunday am and was told an engineer would investigate it.\nWe were out all-day Sunday and due to lifts returned late Sunday Evening \u2013 we were again woken at 4.10am and 5.45am with the plumbing noise Monday morning.\nWe reported a second time on the Monday and were told it would be looked at and feedback given \u2013 upon our return Monday we asked if it had been looked at and were told they were unsure if it had been, but everything should be sorted and if not to come back and inform them.\nMonday night at 11pm we had the noise again and then on Tuesday at 7.32am.\nReported again Tuesday and assured it would be sorted. Played receptionist audio of noise.\nWednesday morning, we reported that it had again been keeping us awake and only at this time did we get offered an alternative room if they could not fix it \u2013 Wednesday night was our last night, and it seemed a little late to be offering solutions. Played further recordings of noise.\nWednesday night further instances at 2.10am, 3.00am and 6.20am all for durations of 5 minutes each.\nThursday, we reported to reception, and they asked us to email you regarding the issues and as they admitted there was an issue and we had raised it numerous times and they apologized for the inconvenience with one staff member commenting \u201cI do not know how you have slept these past 6 nights.\u201d\nTotal of over 8 instances where the noise woke us up.\nI attach a couple of the sound recordings made and played to staff.

He brushed us off and as soon as we reached the ground floor he rushed out and straight out the main doors. This was on route to breakfast. As we departed to go on trip that day, we noticed him hanging on street opposite hotel this is when we reported to a staff member just as precaution.\nWith the lift out of action we did not have to use key card to access guest floors  as it was maned by an engineer who asked what floor and that is all and the fire doors to the stairs and toilets were open at all times with no need for card access \u2013 surely this present a security risk to the staff and guests as there were no check on people entering hotels or accessing guest only areas.\n \n\nThe maintenance issues were obviously hampering staff in providing the level of service expected and they seemed out of depth and overrun by issues. On one day we waited in reception for 38 minutes for the lift to be in use as both were fully out of order and witnessed who we perceived to be a manager having a very vocal argument with engineers and reception staff about who was doing what to sort situation.\n \nAs a Hilton member I went with the brand seeking some quality assurance for our first trip to NY and the USA. We were sadly disappointed and would like a response to the issues so that other travellers do not experience the same issues.\n\nWe have emailed and used customer contact form and via expedia - no response from hotel. Expedia responded to say the hotel refund policy does not cover our issues and nothing can be done according to hotel.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Said we would have to pay cos we check in we didn\u2019t even stay in the room for 5 mins forget checked in.\nAnyways finally he said fine will refund us for our 5 nights and guess Wht till today no refund ( he stated he has put this through and can take 7\/12 working days to receive refund). 3 months later still nothing.\nCustomer service keeps saying they looking into it. \nSo meaning we lost \u00a32000 plus the extra we had to pay to find another hotel to stay in whilst we were there.\nIt\u2019s unbelievably shocking hotel. Nothing like the images.\nPlease don\u2019t waste your money or time!!","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I said there is an issue with the room.  He went to the neighboring hotel and got a manager.  He offered to clean the room and provide an ozone machine.  The carpets and furniture were filthy and the mirrors appeared to have coffee stains on them.  The shower doors didn't close easily and the shower floor was not as pristine as expected in a hotel.  The hallway had not been vacuumed or cleaned for a significant amount of time.  I noted it was finally vacuumed that last day we were there as there was the same debris all week.  When showering, I didn't have hot water the first night and it only became luke warm the following nights.  The next morning, I went to breakfast.  That was another disappointment.  There was a hair in my eggs, the milk machine didn't work and there was a milk container on the counter but was not iced down.  A portion of the juice machine didn't work either.  The bagel and muffin containers were empty and only a couple of slices of bread and no condiments.  At that point I went to the front desk and asked if it was possible to change hotels.  Was told, I needed to speak to a manager and there wouldn't be one on site for a few hours.  When I was back to the hotel later that afternoon, the manager was already gone for the day. After day three, I gave up on trying to reach a manager to switch hotels as I was only there for 5 nights.  All in all, I believe the staff was friendly and did what they could but the hotel itself was subpar and should not be part of the Hilton group.  I will not be staying at this Hampton Inn again.

I was looking forward to the stay since it was my first trip out since borders reopened after 2 years. \nThe entire stay this time was a complete disaster. \nI checked In on 21st June (Tue).\n\n1- we were assigned a room meant for elderly\/ disabled. Bathroom had no ledge to prevent water from spilling out so floors get wet. Ok so that\u2019s fine. Didn\u2019t complain or request to change room. Just accommodate.\n\n2- We were told the next day housekeeping is only on every 4 days. Meantime a \u201chouseman\u201d will come to clear soiled towels and replace fresh ones. I placed my request 3 times over the stay. NO ONE turned up.\n\n4- One morning I saw some housekeeping  staff outside at the corridor and asked them to help take out the wet towels. They asked me to \u201cask the boss\u201d and pointed to someone in the store room. So I went and asked. The \u201cboss\u201d. The lady was rude and repeated to me housekeeping is every 4 days and a houseman will come to clear. I told her I did but no one came. She said she is busy. I said any of the girls can just come and take the towels- won\u2019t take more than 5 minutes and there were 5 of them standing around waiting, and my room was just around the corner!  The \u201cboss\u201d argued that they are each assigned tasks already. I insisted. She had no choice and told one girl to come and clear the wet towels and trash. It took 2 minutes to complete the job.\n\n4- I asked about housekeeping on Friday (Day 4). Staff said they will put in request. Again, no one turned up.\n\n5- I had to go to front desk to get my own fresh towels. Used towels were piling up, primary to dry the wet floors and prevent slipping accidents. \n\n6- the Main sliding door was not working one of the evenings when we came back and failed to open. Some guests behind us and we were all waiting for the door to open. We knocked. No one. We knocked again, a little louder this time. Then front desk staff heard and opened it, and said we were \u201cnot supposed to do that\u201d and that \u201che will impose a $5000 fine\u201d if we do it again (??!!) what? Door malfunction at 5pm, staff not paying attention, we knocked because crowd was building up behind, and staff threatened to impose a fine? \n\n7- amenities given in the room had 2 miserable bars of soap that is smaller than my pinky finger. I had to ask front desk for the proper soap. \n\n8- when I checked out, there was a housekeeping cart parked right at the lift landing along the narrow corridor. I had to slowly squeeze the luggage through to get to the elevators. The staff came by, excused herself to squeeze through me, take her item and walked away. She did not even apologize for putting the cart in our way, or pushed the cart aside for me to get the luggage through!","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

The hotel is in a good location for exploring Times Square or the Herald Square area, getting to the subway stop at the Port Authority to get to other parts of the city, and giving quick access to the restaurants along 9th Ave. The staff was always available at the front desk and helpful when our large group needed some assistance - especially departure day when they turned the hotel's lobby into luggage storage while we waited for our ride to the airport well after checkout time.\n\nPeople traveling to NYC and staying in chain hotels like the Hampton are often shocked they are not the same as the hotels in the chain they'll find along the interstates. The rooms are notably smaller with a living space big enough to fit a couple beds, a desk, a dresser, and not much else. The bathroom is similar. Expect to bump into the wall and shower door as you take a shower.\n\nThe biggest problem this hotel has is the elevators. Two slow, small elevators serving 33 floors and probably around 180 rooms. During the hours of highest demand - morning for breakfast, check-in\/check-out times, and the like - expect a long wait for an elevator up or down. It's almost worth asking for a room on a lower floor if you can tolerate stairs. High demand hours also hit the hotel in other ways. Others in our group shared stories of showers not working in the morning. The latter hours of breakfast can be challenging as well as the staff works to keep up with demand. \n\nThose issues aside, our room was fine for what we needed it for - a place to sleep and get ready in the morning. I'm not one to give a hotel room the white glove treatment on arrival. Ours didn't have any immediately noticeable cleanliness issues and I didn't go looking for some. If you want something better than the essentials in midtown Manhattan, you'll want to upgrade to a bigger-name hotel. If you just need a place to sleep at night and shower, this place is adequate.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

I anticipated the room to be small b\/c it's NY, however, it was not comfortable for a family of 4. Beds were wall to wall and they were full size. No one slept comfortably. Very tight quarters, no where to place your luggage. \nThe room was extremely dirty. The sheets over the box springs were stained which left me nausious and uncomfortable. The  carpet in the room was disgusting. I spilled water on the rug, my daughter accidently stepped on the spill with her white socks. The bottom of her socks literally turned black. I immediately threw the socks out and we made sure not to walk on the carpet barefoot. We threw all our socks out. \nBreakfast was mediocre. Cold and not many options. Empty pans, waiting for them to be refilled. People touching the food with thier hands despite the signs. The poor girl working there was by herself working. I know its a nationwide problem trying to find workers but it defintely affected breakfast. Tables weren't being cleaned as guests left, so people, including ourselves, had to wipe down tables between uses. \nOne day, one of the elevatots didn't work, causing a  backup. We were waiting and waiting and waiting for the elevator. Our room was on the 25th floor. We were in a hurry, needing to be somewhere at a certain time, so we attempted to climb 25 flights. As we reached our room my husband and my 12 year old threw up from the tedious climb. Setting us back from our appointment quite a bit. .\nIf you are about cleanliness, this isn't the place to stay. FYI, they don't have maid service during your stay. They will bring you new towels and sheets upon request. One garbage can in the bathroom (no room for one in the room). So bring extra bags for back up if you stay here. \nThe only positive it it was centrally located to most tourist stops and port authority, but I likely won't stay again. You get what you pay for I guess. ","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Overall, I was happy with my stay as ultimately the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, there was breakfast, and it was in a very convenient location, close to several subway lines, Penn Station, the Port Authority and the Megabus stop. The price was fair. There were also loads of places to eat, including a Pret A Manger in the corner. Just do your research going in, and know that certain hotel chains offer quite specific levels of service (and that other hotel brands in their group might offer more\/less).\n\nStaff were polite and efficient, and explained things at check in such as room cleaning is initiated on the 4th day of any stay, but that you can also request items from the front desk (e..g fresh towels, toiletries). They did store my bag for me before check in. It\u2019s clear they don\u2019t have a specific location for this as when I went back to collect it, they asked me where it was stored. I didn\u2019t store a bag on check out and other reviews suggest this isn\u2019t possible.\n\nIn terms of amenities, the room had a large screen TV with some HD channels and a lot of USB charging points. The bathroom had a hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner and bar soap. There are no glasses. There is a fridge and a coffee maker, but no tea bags and paper cups. You can get ice and water on specific floors and I found some were out of order. You can also find one in the basement. There is also a safe and iron. The heating was a little loud at times, but this is not unusual in older properties. Overall the room in good condition and a decent size (I was in a King).\n\nThe breakfast was adequate to fill you up for the morning and it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not the highest quality compared with some other hotels but it does the job. There is coffee and tea (black tea, no herbal tea bags) and hot chocolate sachets. There was also water and juice. Food wise, there was fruit (bananas, apples, oranges), yoghurt, bread, plain bagels and muffins with condiments (jam, peanut butter, butter, cream cheese). There is also porridge with cinnamon sugar, flaked almonds and dried cranberries, as well as cereals with milk (whole and 2%). There is no syrup or waffles. Hot food wise, there were breakfast potatoes, the style of which was slightly different on some days (e.g. include bell peppers) and sausage (e.g. patties or standard links). There is also a microwave in the breakfast area which can be used all day by guests, it wasn\u2019t clean though. There is no room service nor coffee or tea at reception. \n\nThe hotel is right next to a Candlewood Suite and a Holiday Inn Express if you are considering those. There is basically no difference in terms of location if you are trading off your choices. There are only two elevators and this did mean that there could be long waits at certain times of the day. It would also sometimes stop at floors when there were no guests\/staff waiting and I suspect they either decided to use the stairs or that both elevators are not synced to know if the other has stopped on the floor. This is obviously not ideal, but realistically they aren\u2019t about to add another elevator (it\u2019s a narrow tall building), so it\u2019s just something you need to be prepared for.  There is also a building site right next door and they did start work quite early, so be prepared for some drilling. Overall I would consider staying again.","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

We ate in the Westway and also Hudson's Bar and Grill.  Would recommend both of these, especially Hudsons.  We also had take away from the Lincoln Deli on the corner and it was amazing.   Just disappointed we chose this on our last afternoon. \n\nThe breakfast is not extensive but is good enough to get you set up for the day.  I had bagels with Philadelphia or peanut butter and jam most days.  My husband opted for the eggs and sausages.  I was really disappointed that there was no bacon available the whole time we were there.  The coffee is really nice too and is available all day which is perfect for when you get back from a long day.  It is actually nicer than Starbucks!\n\nWe had issues with our room due to water coming into the bathroom from the room above.  Also on check in they asked us if we wanted our room cleaned every day or would we prefer a late checkout instead.   We opted for the late check out and just had to ask at Reception to get our bins emptied and towels changed.  We had to chase things up with Reception a few times and it looks like they either don't communicate with maintenance and housekeeping or maintenance and housekeeping don't listen.  \n\nThe room we had was absolutely fine and while it was small it was still ideal for what we needed.  A bath would have been a bonus after a long day out walking.  We had paid for a city view but the view we got was looking at the building across the road.  No city view at all.  I will take this up separately with hotel.com.  Also the noise from outside can be quite bad especially with fire engines and police cars.  I asked at reception for ear plugs and they were able to provide me with them.  Not the hotels fault at all, just the area it is in.\n\nAll in all if you are looking for a place to crash while you visit NY and don't want to spend a lot of money I would absolutely recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2020-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Paper plates which are not reusable, single use plastic knives and folks, single use coffee cups, is it too much to ask when I'm paying for breakfast to have a normal plate, knife and folk so I can cut my waffle? The breakfast itself was poor to say the least, but giving the cost of our stay I honestly cant complain, I simply grabbed a coffee and bagel and left. \n\nIf you're looking for a  cheap stay in NY, if you need somewhere simply to sleep as you will be out all day and night, and don't mind going elsewhere for breakfast, Hampton inn is your hotel.

I want to specially highlight \"Vina\" at the reception desk. She was extremly helpfull, always polite, smiling all the time and willing to help for every little detail. Fantastic!.\n3) The breakfast was very good (not great, but good enough). You can find anything you want (muffins, bagles, cream cheese, apple or orange juice, coffe or tea, eggs, waffles, etc... very good breakfast if you compate to the medium range price of the hotel\n\nNot good:\n1) The elevators are horrible. It\u00b4s a 32 stories building with just 2 elevators There is always a long long line to use them and sometimies you need to wait extremly long time to go down to the lobby when leaving your room\n2) Breakfast Room; Although the breakfast is good (the food) the Room to have it is extremly small for such a big building. Every morning you need to wait in line to get your coffe. Extremly small room for 32 stories and 5 rooms per floor\n3) Rooms: This is a classic in all New York, but still Rooms are extremly small.

Stayed here recently for 4 nights. Location is so convenient. On a block with other properties, in fact there are 3 together 1 after another. All 3 are currently under refurbishment with scaffolding in front covering so a little difficult at first to see the correct entrance. Lobby is small(ish) but has a couple sitting areas. Check in desk is split by a large column, so creates a break in line of sight in case. Initial check in was rough, not the warmest welcome and actually a little standoffish. Follow up with all other staff was better. Welcomed back each time upon entering, hello from everyone! Breakfast was traditional HI offerings. Staff worked extra hard to keep it all clean and stocked in this smaller breakfast area and did a good job. As others have stated, seating is at a premium in the breakfast area. King room was fine for 1 but would be tight for 2 people to stash belongs and maneuver around the room. Closet contained ironing board and iron as well as the safe. Bureau had a couple sliding drawers on as well as concealed the fridge. Desk was appreciated. Loads of outlets all over, included wifi was fast and appreciated. Bathroom is small. Small. If the stall shower wasn't narrow enough, there is a grab bar smack in the middle of the wall. There was no way to not touch it constantly when showering. There are 2 elevators for this building. Arrival day, 1 was down and there was an operator working the 2nd. To come down, you had to call the front desk and they would come fetch you as no buttons were working. This was corrected during my stay and both seemed to be working properly. That said, I requested and received a room on a low floor (4th) and took the stairs most of the time to avoid the waits. That worked well until I noticed the handle from the stairwell to the 4th floor was off and laying on the ground. I let them know at the front desk and was told an engineer would be sent to remedy. Returned late that evening after walking the entire city to climb the stairs...to find no handle at all. Trudged back down and got in line for an elevator. Property has an excellent location just need to pay attention to the workings. That said, there was constant sawing and hammering all day everyday (thankfully not at night).

The usual value and quality we expect from Hampton Inn were there. As far as the negative reviews are concerned, remember that this is located in the busiest spot in one of the world\u2019s largest cities. There is construction, prices will be higher, there are poor people, hotel rooms in mid-priced hotels are smaller, and you may have to walk half a block to hail a cab. If you\u2019re not a total rube, you\u2019ll be fine. The staff was very friendly and helpful and there were ample vending machines, ice, free coffee\/tea\/hot chocolate 24\/7.

The rooms are clean and have coffee makers, a safe, a closet, a huge tv, free Wifi, an iron and board, outlets near the bed, a desk and chair, a refrigerator and an ice bucket. The bathroom was well-stocked. The rooms are smaller than other Hampton rooms we\u2019ve stayed in, but keep in mind that we\u2019ve stayed at another boutique hotel where the door barely cleared the bed when opened! Again, space is precious in this metropolis. Breakfast is free, but the eating area is small and cramped and the food is standard meh. On a busy day you can just take your food back to your room to eat or visit one of the various diners within walking distance.

This was definitely not the case with this hotel. I arrived around noon on a Friday. I expected my room to not be ready as check in time was 3pm. As expected my room wasn\u2019t ready however I was met with the rudest employee I have ever dealt with at a hotel (and I travel a lot). Eye rolls, loud sighs when asking to store bags and more really didn\u2019t make me feel welcome. Upon arrival back at the hotel at 4pm my room was still not ready. I had pre-selected my room using the Hilton honours app so the staff switched me to another room within the same category. The room was on a lower floor and there really is no view to speak of so I didn\u2019t object. It did bother me that I was not recognized for my Hilton gold status and that the staff charged the wrong credit card even though I made it clear which card I wanted processed. The elevator waits at the hotel are horrendous. At check in times the line stretches nearly out the building as only two small elevators service 32 floors of rooms. The rooms are small as is expected with NYC but adequate however the room was far from clean upon arrival. Stains on the carpet and mirrors, a dirty bathroom and a filthy air conditioner\/heating unit makes one feel uncomfortable with staying in the room. The room has a small fridge and although I was assured it was stocked with water (another Hilton Honors perk) it was not. Upon checking out the room, I found all fixtures (towel racks, toilet paper dispenser etc) were loose and nearly falling off the walls, the TV did not work, nor did the ice machine on our floor. The location of the hotel and proximity to main tourist attractions such as Times Square is decent and is a short walk. I did not partake in the hotel breakfast mainly due to the extremely limited space in the dining area. The area holds about 12 - 15 guests comfortably and the hotel obviously holds far more even when at partial occupancy so it was just easier to walk to nearby offerings. All in all I was very disappointed in this Hilton experience. I spent a good deal of money and substantial honors points for a 2 night stay that did not live up to the Hilton brand. I will consider using another brand the next time I return to NYC. ","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I understand this is not a Hilton, but if you\u2019re going to charge Hilton prices then you don\u2019t expect student hostel facilities or service. \n\nI visited here as part of a group and don\u2019t remember any one of my travel companions having anything positive to say about this place. \n\nUpon arrival the check in process was long and unnecessarily difficult. How can it take 30 minutes to check into a room? \n\nWhat they call a twin room here most people would call it a large wardrobe. To say the rooms are small is doing them an injustice. A toddler would find the room claustrophobic. \n\nThe service staff were rude, but then I guess that was my fault for taking the only working elevator in the building to the 17th floor and interrupting there chat. That is when I could use it! Most of the time it seemed as if it was being used as a service elevator for god knows what. \nBut I guess I owe them thanks as I walked up and down the stairs from the 17th floor I now have the legs of a rugby player. \nJust to clarify the other elevator was constantly out of order during our stay. \n\nBreakfast was a joke! I walked in on the first morning and picked up what I thought was a plastic decoration. To my amazement I was told it was an egg. It didn\u2019t get any better when I was told the warm brown tasteless water was actually coffee. \n\nBut what they don\u2019t tell you about this hotel is when you stay here you will feel like an extra from Breaking Bad. The availability of drugs on the street just outside the door is unbelievable. In all honesty you\u2019ve more chance of getting meth just outside the lobby than you have of getting a smile or friendly word from staff of this venue. \n\nUpon reflection knowing what I do now, I would have booked a room in the Holiday Inn just around the corner.

At least there is a very nice sandwich shop next door that also had plentiful supplies of tablets in case you had the misfortune of eating a Hampton Inn sausage.\n\nWe were supplied with a double bed despite being too straight males, one of whom has severe IBS so not an ideal sharing partner in same bed. We had clearly stated that two single beds were required. Upon asking for this be resolved, we were threatened with expulsion from hotel if we didn\u2019t conform. Not being the agreeable type, my insistence was eventually rewarded with a room with two beds. If one was less resilient than I then they may have had to sleep on the large scaffolding outside.\nThe lift scenario is un real, I now know how a hungover sardine feels. Two lifts for 30 plus floors, which staff can manipulate at will if they for example needed to bring a bin to floor 29 from 5. This isn\u2019t a great situation. Thankfully my IBS prone room mate and I were moved to 7th floor so at least the stairs was an option,\n\nReceptionist was very pleasant although the whole credit card scenario above wasn\u2019t mentioned on arrival so gets a negative in my book for this!! \n\nPoor information regarding reduced beer\/food next door.\nThe rooms were poor but very expensive even though I know NYC is expensive . Small wardrobe, lived from case so enough said.\nThe outside of hotel was a scaffolding site. We were treated to burly builders holding large pillars in place whilst we walked under \n\nThe smell of cannabis and crack outside of hotel is overwhelming so if you like Breaking Bad then this hotel for you.\n\nI love NYC but HAMPTON INN should be ashamed of this place. \n\nVery helpful cleaning lady on 7th floor though","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I stay in hotels regularly for work and pleasure and this is the worst of them all. I had the misfortune to stay here for 5 days with a group of friends.\n32 floors and 2 lifts. These lifts are also used by the staff. You therefore have to wait long periods of time for a lift, assuming they are working at all. I regularly had to take the stairs to and from 24th floor as the lifts were broken. Prior to arrival I did consider the option of an upgrade, I am so glad I didn't as it would have been on a higher floor.\nHaving got to our room, it was incredibly small for two beds. No chance to unpack as nowhere to put anything. Within 10 minutes two other people walked in to our room. They had also been allocated our room. It also meant that our room keys had been deactivated. I went to speak to the manager David Ruas. I calmly explained what had happened and my concern about my safety and security if they keep giving out room keys. He was not interested. He told me he didn't like my tone, and that I could always leave and find another hotel. I would have left but I was part of a large group and this would have caused further issues. To be fair to David he did apologise to me the next day and admitted it hadn't been his best day. \nThe breakfast is a joke. Complete chaos for food which is very basic all in paper cups and plates and no space. I therefore had breakfast in nearby cafe. \nWhile in general the staff were pleasant there was a lack of information to guests as well as misinformation.  They didn't tell anyone that they were giving out vouchers for drinks in a nearby bar as compensation for the lift problems. It was only when you complained that a voucher was provided. As we were two guys sharing, I had secured the room on my credit card. The day before we left we spoke to reception about splitting the bill. She said that would be fine and even worked out how much we would each pay. However when we checked out the next day we were told it had already all  been charged on to my card. I again asked to speak to the manager and David spoke to me. Again no service recovery offered and a request from me for a reduction for all of these issues was firmly refused. He then however gave me his business card and assured me he would look after me next time I was in New York. I somehow dont expect I will be returning to this hotel.\nIn summary very poor quality, no customer service ethos and not a nice location even if it is close to Times Square. \nThere is nothing going for this hotel and it not even good value. There are plenty more hotels in New York and I would urge people to avoid this.\nThe manager did little to resolve customers genuine grievances, however to be fair to him and his team you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear.\nAs for Hilton, if this is a reflection of your standards I wont be staying in your hotels again.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The rooms were on the small side but it is a three star so not unexpected. There were issues with reception at both ends of our stay and what ought to have been simple issues proved difficult to resolve. I am unsure whether this a because of a general malaise in the management of the hotel or inexperience of the particular staff involved.\nThese were however minor irritants compared to the absolutely abysmal breakfast experience. Coffee from machines in paper cups, paper plates and plastic cutlery which I admittedly didn\u2019t have to use much due to the spectacularly unpalatable food. I have never experienced worse breakfast anywhere in the world!\nWe ended up one floor up in this multi story hotel despite having requested a high room and that having been acknowledged by the hotel in the booking receipts. In the event, when the room key was issued we walked into the room to find it already occupied. After a lot of heated negotiations with reception staff we eventually managed to secure a twin room as booked despite being repeatedly told they only had doubles left when we repeatedly explained the unsuitability of that for two straight male friends. The low floor transpired to be a blessing in disguise as there were continual lift problems during our stay resulting in some of our colleagues having to walk up and down over 20 floors.\nMy conclusion will probably mean little to Americans but Basil Fawlty running this hotel would be a vast improvement!","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

Anche l'affidabilit\u00e0 della catena di appartenenza ha avuto la sua importanza. Questo hotel \u00e8 una struttura che ci sentiamo assolutamente di consigliare, oltre che per la vicinanza al centro turistico di New York, anche per una caratteristica che abbiamo riscontrato fin dal primo momento: la piacevole accoglienza riservata ai clienti, estremamente cordiale fin dal benvenuto pur rimanendo sempre attenta e professionale. Merito di una crew prevalentemente latina o di una precisa scelta aziendale? Non lo sappiamo, ma da clienti il clima che abbiamo trovato \u00e8 stato sorprendentemente piacevole e ci ha fatto quasi sentire a casa. Il che in una citt\u00e0 come New York non \u00e8 qualcosa che trovi tutti i giorni. Questo ha reso migliore il nostro soggiorno in una struttura che non ha certo tra i suoi punti di forza la dimensione della camere e in generale degli spazi interni. La nostra al 29\u00b0 piano era piuttosto piccolina e certo non ha aiutato aver richiesto un letto aggiuntivo. Letti tra l'altro comodissimi nella migliore tradizione USA! Con un po' di adattamento abbiamo sopperito alla modestissima capienza dell'unica colonna armadio disponibile. Una stanza piccolina dunque, ma pulitissima che ci ha assicurato comunque riposo e confort durante la nostra non brevissima permanenza a New York. In due stanze al piano terra viene servita una buona colazione all'americana con piatti caldi con assortimento che cambia di giorno in giorno. Una delle stanze funge da piccola lounge dove, H24, sono disponibili caff\u00e8 e the caldo. A met\u00e0 pomeriggio la direzione offre poi biscotti caldi o qualche altra piccola leccornia. E' verso quell'ora, infatti, che quasi tutti fanno rientro in albergo dopo una giornata trascorsa a scoprire i mille angoli della Grande Mela. Un caff\u00e8 caldo prima di salire in camera \u00e8 una piccola \"coccola\" che fa veramente piacere trovare.

The check in time was 3:00 pm, Saturday, September 28. We had dinner reservations and were looking forward to using the facilities in the rooms, and changing prior to dinner. 3 p.m came and went...so did 4...at around 4:40 I received a text that the rooms were now ready. Unfortunately this would entail us rushing back to the hotel and even had we done so we would not have made a 5:30 reservation on time. I complained to the front desk. They did the right thing for our friends by refunding half the room rate. I paid in points. The front desk personnel assured me that they would be returning half the 70000 points, or 35000 to my Hilton Honors card. I asked for a receipt and they gave me one for the cash but said they could not give me anything for the points. 24 hours later I received an email from the hotel advising me that they would not be crediting the points to my account and the refund for our friend's room was all they would do. I complained to Hilton Honors and was told they would circumvent the hotel and credit the points back to the card themselves. I have another 24 hours to go to see if that was done. Well, let me tell you a few more things about Hampton Inn Times Square South: The breakfast was lame. The eggs were powdered, the fruit ran out and was never replenished, the only breakfast \"meat\" was a sausage gravy to go with the biscuits...no bacon, no sausage, nothing else.And there were not enough tables to accommodate the throngs of guests who showed up to eat. After a very dissatisfying breakfast, we went to our rooms, packed up, and stood in front of the elevator (one of only two) for at least 20 minutes, during which time the elevator stopped on our floor (19th) twice. The first time the cab was packed and there was no room. The 2nd time, it was just slightly less packed so we sent our wives down and my friend and I walked the 19 floors down to the lobby. I would suggest staying at any other Hilton property except Hampton Inn, Times Square South, 337 39th St. The area is a little seedy too, as it is located near the Port Authority Bus Terminal.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Location is convenient for walking to shows and the subway.  However, West 39th Street is a very congested narrow street, even by Midtown Manhattan standards.  DO NOT stay here if you have a car.  It was heck just getting there and when I did, the spot to pull over for the valet parking was taken.  No one was stationed outside.  I had to pull over, run in to the desk and then someone came out.  Note that the hotel - for $65 per night with no in\/out privileges - does NOT park the car.  Instead they use a third party contractor.  They told me that when I checked out to call for the car 45 minutes to an hour before needing it.  That's how long it takes to retrieve.  The hotel staff is pleasant.  The small room had a mini-fridge, a safe, and a small closet, all very convenient.  Lighting was good.  However, the room, and I have to be frank here, smelled like sweaty socks!  I would notice it each time I walked over a 3-day stay.  The included breakfast was a bit below par for a Hampton, and the small breakfast area was very tight and very crowded.  One of the 3 days I came down and they were temporarily out of coffee, out of half and half, out of fruit, and out of plastic forks.  However, the breakfast staff were all pleasant and helpful and replenished the items after I pointed out the need.  Another matter of concern were the very slow elevators.  There were always people waiting for the two small elevators serving the 30-story building.  On checking out, I waited 15 minutes with my suitcase just to get on an elevator.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

At just a 4-minute walk to the nearest subway station and a10-minute walk away from Times Square and the theater district, its location was excellent for tourists wanting to discover what the city has to offer by foot or subway.\n\nThe entire staff (front desk, housekeeping, maintenance, kitchen) was among the friendliest I've ever encountered at a major hotel chain. They allowed us to store our luggage securely and free of charge for several hours when we arrived at 11 AM that morning and often inquired if we were pleased with our stay.\n\nThe seating capacity of the breakfast room was very limited for the total number of guests at the hotel, but the breakfast crew works hard to keep the buffet replenished constantly so, while the queue to serve yourself can take a while, the items don't run out during breakfast hours.\n\nThe elevator can take a while to reach your floor in the morning when you're waiting to go downstairs for breakfast. It was often faster for us to take the stairs up and down, even though we were on the 19th floor. It was good exercise, if anything.\n\nI get the impression that the hotel has too many rooms and fits in too many guests for the capacity of its elevators, lobby, and breakfast room, so it feels like a very busy hotel at all hours, but even so, I would stay here again if I were in the area.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We were constantly walking into each other and there was no where to put our luggage. \n* The elevators were awful. There are two, and they are not sufficient to deal with the traffic at the hotel. We had waits of 30-40 minutes to use the elevators in the morning. This is unacceptable when you are trying to get somewhere on time. \n* The kids like the breakfasts. The adults found the coffee to be insipid and the food mediocre. \n* The area needs to be cleaned up. There were homeless with kids hanging out downstairs hassling our family every time we walked by. One day there were dirty pads all over the sidewalk. We crossed to the other side of the street to walk as it was much cleaner and felt safer just across the street. \n* They tried to charge us an upgrade fee for being on a high floor. We did not ask for a high floor. There is no view, and the elevator takes so long that we would have much preferred a low floor where we could have taken the stairs. Instead of charging an upgrade, they should have given us a discount to pay us for the time we wasted waiting for the elevator.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room was small but of a good standard.  The double bed was comfortable and very big, the flat screen TV was decent, the bathroom was a good standard.   There was air conditioning in the room.  A huge bonus was the fridge inside the room, which we used to store fruit, sparkling water and other drinks.  There was also an iron and an ironing board, which we used and a hair dryer. \n\nThe location of the hotel is good.  It is located on a back street, which meant there was little street noise.  So we were able to sleep well.  The hotel is also located near the metro (42nd Street Times Square), about a 5-10 minute walk away.  We were able to get from the JFK airport to the hotel easily, using the Air Train followed by the metro.\n\nThe hotel has about 30 floors, and only has two lifts for the whole hotel which is not enough.  This means you can be waiting some time for a lift to become available, especially if you are on the ground floor and the lifts are on the top floors.  Our room was on the 4th floor, so we were able to use the stairs no problem if a lift wasn\u2019t readily available.  But if our room was much higher than that, we obviously would not be able to do that.  TOP TIP: Ask for a room on as low a floor as possible.\n\nThe breakfast room is not very big, and it gets very crowded.  We stayed at the hotel for one week.  We had trouble finding seats on the Sunday, but had no problem on the other days.  The breakfast selection was ok, and included scrambled eggs or an omelette (there is one option each day), sausages or Canadian ham (one option each day), bagels, breads rolls, toast, sweet muffins, bananas, yoghurts, cereal, boiled eggs.  There is tea, coffee, hot chocolate, orange juice, apple juice.  There is also a waffle machine, where guests can easily make fresh waffles together with syrup, chocolate and cream.  What really shocked us, was that the breakfast only provides paper plates and plastic cutlery.  This is a Hilton hotel, so we couldn\u2019t believe it.  It wasn\u2019t a big problem, but we thought it was strange.\n\nGuests can help themselves to free hot drinks 24 hours a day.  This can be found next to the breakfast area on the same floor of the reception. \n\nWe had a few hours to use on our last day, so after checking out, the hotel kept our bags for us at the hotel which was appreciated. \n\nAnother tip is the Upside Pizza takeaway near the hotel, which served really excellent pizza.  When exiting the hotel, turn left and you will find it at the next crossroads.\n\nAll in all, a pleasant stay.  But be sure to ask for a room on as low a floor as possible because of the lift problem.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Once I retrieved them from my room I saw the manager in the broken elevator and asked if I could take it back down.  He said I could not, so I walked back down 32 flights of stairs.  However, at the bottom I see the manager had taken the elevator down.  \nThe breakfast staff was overwhelmed every morning and could not keep up with the customers coming in.  One morning all I could get was one scoop of eggs and a glass of water.  Twice we were not provided wash cloths, and once we had to go to the front desk to get hand and bath towels.\nThe staff was friendly and the AC worked very well, the bed was very comfortable.  \nOverall the experience was not what I have come to expect from a Hilton property.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Upon arrival we were greeted at reception and told our rooms weren\u2019t ready yet, so we were told to wait for 20\/25 minutes. Which we did. 55 minutes later we were still sat in reception waiting, upon approaching staff we were then informed that one room was ready and that we could go into that until the other was ready, which would be 17 floors apart. My parents were furious as me and my sister would be 17 floors away on a family trip after we requested to be close especially being in a new place for the first time. Somehow they then managed to get a room on the floor below somehow and we took them. We were on the 11th and 12th floor of the hotel. There were 2 lifts which were super slow and often resulted in us taking the stairs (all 12 flights of them). \n\nLater that night we discovered that our room was freezing cold even with the heating on, it was the middle of winter which was understandable but it was freezing to the point we were close to tears it was so uncomfortable. The bulky heater was blowing out cold air so we rang reception and they sent an engineer up. He said nothing was wrong with it and provided us with a tiny portable heater which was really noisy and just not the best. The next morning after a very uncomfortable sleep and just wanted to enjoy our holiday, we complained again and somehow it got fixed that day. The room was still cold but more bearable and we just got on with it as we were in New York and Just wanted to enjoy it!! \n\nThe room wasn\u2019t brilliant and in the pictures provided you can see that. It felt rather dirty and not well kept. The bed was comfortable and clean thankfully. Our toilet was also really noisy and meant we couldn\u2019t flush it during the night without waking each other up \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nBreakfast was good, and I couldn\u2019t get over how small the dining area was, and bins were constantly full and overflowing. For the size of the hotel there was always queues just to sit down. We often took our breakfast back to our rooms. It was a buffet style and there was loads on offer including cereal, hot food, a waffle machine, a toaster and selection of fruit. It was paper cups and paper plates so did feel a little like a school canteen lol. But overall the food was yummy and it was enough to set you up for the day. \n\nOverall I wouldn\u2019t stay here again, but the hotel is a short walk from the Empire State Building, madison square gardens and Times Square so it is very central. Also the daily fresh cookies was a lovely extra and they were yummy, and on Valentine\u2019s Day they gave out free chocolates. The reception staff were brilliant and always greeted you each day with a smile no matter how busy and hectic reception was. Which was nice :) just a shame some things let the place down.

The room was small but clean and bed was comfy. Shower pressure was good despite the high floor room.\n\nEach floor only has 6 rooms so noise from lifts and other guests was minimal. The issue however is the windows offer poor sound proofing and the noise of vehicle horns, trucks all night and construction going on until at least 2am was very intrusive. Ear plugs did help but not ideal for a $250 per night stay. A room on the opposite side of the hotel may be better than those on the street side. \n\nThe hotel only has 2 lifts servicing over 30 floors so at busy times you could be waiting a while or annoyingly stopping on what seems like every floor on the way up \/ down. Due the type of building there is not a lot can be done about this but worth bearing in mind. \n\nIt's location is ideal for central nyc with most places walkable, and the staff are pleasant and friendly.\n\nHappy to recommend this hotel.

Our initial choice (the Element Times Square West) was a complete and utter disaster, as on the night we arrived, we discovered that despite a confirmation e-mail from them a few days before arrival, they had no room for us (which they attributed to \"a computer glitch.\") The end result was us being sent to a hotel in Queens, which we didn't get into until almost 2 AM.\n\nWe had NO confidence whatsoever in that hotel following this incident & did not want to return there for the remaining nights we were in town.Thankfully, after checking my Hilton Honors app, I discovered this hotel was available at a good AAA rate for the rest of our visit to the city. So after telling Element we would not be returning, we made a reservation here--and I'm SO glad we did!  When we arrived the next morning between 11 and 12, we were greeted by GM David & his awesome staff, who, after sympathizing with us about our unfortunate events of the previous night said, \"We have a room ready for you; you can go on up and get settled.\"  Totally unexpected and most definitely appreciated!\n\nWe had a very nice, clean King room (1806) which was next to the elevator & offered a view of West 39th Street. Our bed was very comfortable! (I don't always sleep well when traveling, but definitely enjoyed some zzz's here.) Room size wasn't an issue for us & we didn't feel cramped in by it at all. \n\nWhile we missed having a microwave to warm up leftovers, it was great to have a mini-fridge for storing soft drinks, bottled water (and slices of Junior's cheesecake). Water pressure was good, although we did have to wait just a little bit for the warm\/hot water in the shower. No issues with the complimentary wi-fi, either. \n\nWe did experience some street noise due to construction on West 39th (Really?  Who thinks it's a bright idea to fire up a jackhammer at 8AM on a Saturday?), but if you bring some earplugs\/earbuds, you shouldn't have any problems. \n\nMost of all, it was wonderful to encounter such friendly staff members! Every time we went out and came back in, we received a genuinely warm & friendly greeting from those on duty. \n\nSo thank you, thank you, THANK YOU Hampton Inn Manhattan\/Times Square South for coming to our rescue! We look forward to visiting you again in the future.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Room 2306. 2 small double beds, a wardrobe, small desk and chair great, new clean bathroom, window curtain ill fitting and very draughty window which we didn't notice till bed time as air con was on when we arrived. The room was a good size for us, a couple and a 7 year old. Returned from dinner after travelling 12 hours we just wanted to sleep but that window was soooo noisy it was louder than being on the 747! I put ear plugs in, no better. I thought maybe this is the way it is as it's very busy outside so I just got on with it. By day 2 I was sleep deprived. The constant low hum was driving me crazy. I reported it at 6am, nothing. Again at 8am, then a nice maintenance guy arrived and said he'd fix it when we were out if that was OK. If he couldn't fix he'd request a move for the next 3 nights. Perfect. Come back later on and there is a ridiculous effort of some grey insulation tape around the window which did nothing! I rang down again, they will send someone up... Nothing. I got fed up in the end and blocked the bottom with towels. How ridiculous but I didnt want it to spoil our stay so I just got on with it. At check out they didn't even ask about our stay just took keys! Positives-Geraldine the breakfast ambassador is fantastic. Lovely, friendly, helpful with tips and looked after us-thank you! Breakfast was really good, fresh, varied, and well stocked. Around 8am it gets crazy but we were awake early so had lovely breakfasts. Took fruit out with us and also little lunch bags in foyer with water, snack etc in. Elevators were OK for us longest wait was 5 mins. The complimentary tea and coffee were fine and a nice touch. The bell boy was very helpful too. The lobby was often frequented by odd people not staying at the hotel, one lady was definitely homeless using the computers, she had all sorts of bandages on her really didn't give a good impression and then moved to the seats, getting all her belongings out of her bags and Irish receptionist did nothing to remove her... Not good enough really. Housekeeping was fine, clean towels, beds made, toiletries replaced each day. But I Would not stay again.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":1500405,"title":"Sehr gutes Stadthotel, das den Gast in der hektischen Stadt zur Ruhe kommen l\u00e4sst - n\u00e4chstes Mal wieder!","lang":"de","publishedDate":"2019-03-27","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Was zeichnet das Hampton Inn Manhattan - Times Square South aus?\n\nAls allererstes die Lage, wenn man denn direkt \"mittendrin\" sein m\u00f6chte. Das Hotel liegt in Midtown\/Hells Kitchen an der 39th St., zwischen 8th und 9th Ave. Port Authority (Busstation und Subway) und der Broadway sind 1 Block entfernt und der Times Square ca 5 Blocks. Generell kann man vieles fu\u00dfl\u00e4ufig erreichen, aber auch die Subway- und Busanbindung ist sehr gut. Die Umgebung bietet eine Vielzahl an Restaurants, Bars, Diners etc.. Es ist viel los auf den Stra\u00dfen und Gehwegen. D. h., man steht sofort im hektischen \"Gewusel\", sobald man das Hotel verl\u00e4sst. Andererseits bedeutet das auch, dass es auf den Stra\u00dfen sicher ist und man auch nachts, ohne Angst haben zu m\u00fcssen, zum Hotel laufen kann. In NY gilt im Allgemeinen, wo Menschen zu Fu\u00df unterwegs sind, ist es sicher. Verlassene Gegenden bzw. Gegenden mit leeren B\u00fcrgersteigen sollte man abends\/nachts meiden!\n\nDas Hampton Inn ist ein Hotel der Hilton-Kette und bietet bzgl. der Ausstattung einen guten und verl\u00e4sslichen Standard. Im Erdgeschoss befinden sich die Rezeption, ein Concierge, mehrere Sitzgelegenheiten, eine Ecke in der 24h kostenlos Kaffee zur Verf\u00fcgung steht und ein kleines Business-Center mit 2 PC, die Hotelg\u00e4ste nutzen k\u00f6nnen. Im Keller gibt es einen kleinen Fitnessraum. Auf jeder Etage befinden sich nur 6 Hotelzimmer, allerdings auf ca. 30 Etagen. Durch die geringe Anzahl an Zimmern ist es auf den Fluren sehr ruhig. Wir haben ein Standard-Zimmer mit einem King-Size-Bett gebucht. Das Zimmer (und auch das Bad) war ausreichend gro\u00df, sehr sauber und die Einrichtung war relativ neu und modern. S\u00e4mtliche Ausstattungsmerkmale, die auf der Homepage des Hotels aufgef\u00fchrt sind, waren vorhanden. Zus\u00e4tzlich fanden wir an beiden Nachttischen mehrere USB-Ports, um Handys etc. aufladen zu k\u00f6nnen. Mein Highlight aber war das gro\u00dfe, wahnsinnig gem\u00fctliche und bequeme Bett - ich habe selten in einem Hotel so gut geschlafen! Im Zimmerpreis enthalten ist ein (f\u00fcr amerikanische Verh\u00e4ltnisse) gro\u00dfartiges Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck. Von 6 - 10 Uhr findet man auf einem Buffet Bagels & Toast inkl. verschiedener Aufstriche, Muffins, R\u00fchrei, Bacon, Omelettes, Obstsalat, frisches Obst, CornFlakes, M\u00fcsli, S\u00e4fte und 2 Waffeleisen, um sich selber Waffeln zu machen.\n\nAls besonders positiv empfand ich die Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft s\u00e4mtlicher Mitarbeiter. Angefangen bei den Mitarbeitern der Rezeption beim ein- und auschecken, \u00fcber die Reinigungskr\u00e4fte  bis hin zum Concierge und den Technikern. Herausragend aber waren die MitarbeiterInnen beim Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck. Neben dem st\u00e4ndigen Auff\u00fcllen der Speisen und dem Wegr\u00e4umen des M\u00fclls der G\u00e4ste, hatten sie immer ein freundliches Wort und waren gut drauf.\n\nNur, um auch etwas Negatives zu sagen: Die ca. 30 Stockwerke des Hotels werden von 2 Aufz\u00fcgen bedient. Das ist eigentlich auch v\u00f6llig ausreichend, allerdings kann es zu bestimmten Zeiten mal zu Wartezeiten kommen (letzte halbe Stunde des Fr\u00fchst\u00fccks, An- und Abreise von gr\u00f6\u00dferen Gruppen). Direkt gegen\u00fcber des Hotels befindet sich eine gro\u00dfe Baustelle, deren L\u00e4rm bei ge\u00f6ffnetem Fenster nat\u00fcrlich zu h\u00f6ren ist. Allerdings wird in NY immer viel gebaut, das kann man nicht dem Hotel anlasten.\n\nFazit: Das Hampton Inn Manhattan - Times Square South ist ein perfektes Stadthotel, um sich erholt und ausgeruht am n\u00e4chsten Tag wieder in die aufregende Gro\u00dfstadt st\u00fcrzen zu k\u00f6nnen!","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Plus, they offer breakfast and that's hard to find hotels that offer breakfast these days. When we first arrived, we were unable to get into our room because it wasn't ready. We left our luggage and explored the city. It is just about 10 minutes walking from Times Square which was nice. After 5 pm, we came back and our room was ready. The room is small which is expected in New York. We took a nap and went back out. Returned to the hotel about 10 pm. The shower head was broke. Water was spraying everywhere. It took 3 phone calls and over 2 hours for someone to come and fix it. It's late, we were rained on and had traveled that day so just wanted a hot shower. That was annoying. Then the shower itself is super small. There was a huge handicap bar that you can hold onto in the middle of the shower on the wall so you couldn't move around good. The water pressure was almost non-existent. \n\nThe next day, we went to breakfast and the room was just so small. They need a bigger area for people to enjoy their meals.  We went out for the day, came back and asked concierge for some decent pizza places to order from. She was useless. A concierge should have a good idea of some decent take out. She had no clue. She just looked on her computer and did what I could have done, I would have done it better. So we ended up going out. Got back to the room and NO toilet paper! Sooooo, an hour later, we had toilet paper. Shouldn't housekeeping have checked that?\n\nOverall, the experience was fine. I was irritated because simple things like a shower working and having toilet paper shouldn't be an issue when staying at a hotel. Those are the main necessities.\n\nThe location was good. The front desk help was good. Concierge is worthless. If you want a cab, walk down to the main streets because you won't get one in front of the hotel and there is no one there to help get one for you. Overall, it's decent for a place to sleep.

It was barely a problem at all. Sure, there were only 2 elevators but it's not really a big hotel. The longest we ever waited was a few minutes, maybe 5 at the most and that didn't occur often. Sometimes we waited only seconds. Don't let this feature turn you off staying at this hotel. All of the staff were very friendly and accommodating. When we first checked in I could smell vomit on the carpet in our room near the aircon so the smell was being blown around the room. I mentioned it the next morning and that night we were moved into a new room and given a Macy's gift voucher for the trouble. We had free use of the laundry facilities in the hotel next door which was extremely handy. The rooms were a bit cramped but that's common in New York apparently and we got a good price as we booked 10 months in advance. The price of our room 1-2 months was almost double what we paid. The location was great, just a five minute walk to 42nd St subway and to Times Square. The staff would make fresh cookies each evening to grab on the way back through the lobby and they'd always say hello. The only disappointing thing I would say was the breakfast but I found this at a lot of the hotels we stayed at on our trip around America. It may have just been the budget we were sticking to also. There wasn't a lot of variety in the breakfast and it wasn't all that healthy. Maybe it's just the difference in cuisine. At least it was something to fill our bellies with before setting out each day. Depending on the time you went to breakfast, it could be busy but we never had nowhere to sit. There was 24 hr free coffee\/tea\/hot chocolate which was good at night. The rooms were clean too. I would definitely recommend this hotel. The breakfast is the only reason I've given it 4\/5. There was a bit of construction noise too that occurred at weird hours. The floor you stay on doesn't really matter as I think you could hear traffic and other noise so matter what floor you stay on.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I'd read mainly good reviews with the odd negative review. Yes, the rooms are a tad on the smaller side but if you're from the UK or Europe they are equivalent to a London, Paris or Rome hotel on a similar budget. I personally thought the rooms were very good. If you're in New York staying here then the room is a base. It's a really good base. The lifts can take a few minutes but just have some patience. I emailed prior with a couple of minor concerns and got prompt and very reassuring replies. We arrived at midnight local time and the staff are brilliant. The reception was busy but we felt like we were the only guests. I got up at 5am the next morning, got hot coffee from reception and wandered into Times Square at 530 on a Sunday Morning. Safer than walking in Central London at a similar time.  If you complain  about breakfast at this hotel then you aren't on the right budget. The food is fresh, loads of it, and the staff are really friendly. You may have to wait a few minutes for a table but so what. It's New York and won't take long. My wife emailed  ahead saying out visit was for my 50th. I want to say a belated thank you to all the team at Hampton Inn for your fantastic gift it meant a great deal. I'd you want a good hotel, friendly staff, great food, Times Square about 7 minutes walk, subway 4 minutes and have a budget then this hotel fits the bill.

The hotel is a few blocks from Times Square on a quiet side street close to the Cruise Port and about a 35 minute cab ride from LaGuardia in normal traffic. Make sure you have the exact address as there are several Hampton Inns in NY.  Staff are friendly and very helpful.  The lady at the Concierge was pretty useless and not nice.  Considering that as a traveler new to the area they would staff the Concierge with a better person. Rooms are small, typical for New York, a very compressed area, however comfortable.  The beds firm with lots of pillows.  Storage is in a small cabinet with little space.  This is a tall thin high rise building and unless you request a top floor room there is little to no view of the city.  The bathroom was adequate for our needs and the room very clean with plenty of towels.  Due to the size of the building the rooms are very close to the elevators and are noisy at times.  Elevators are a joke.  We were on a higher floor and sometimes it took 15 minutes to go up or down with the foyer space being a tight squeeze to wait.  Breakfast is included and offers a good selection of hot and cold foods.  Suggest getting there before peak times as seating is limited although tables turn over frequently.

It said one rate, but I was charged a higher rate. I called and they tried to tell me it was taxes and fees. It wasn't. I only added up room rates and came up over charged over $100 more. When I called again, I was told that they would look into it and i would receive a refund on my card. When that didn't happen within the expected 5 business days, I called again. They didn't even have the refund recorded.\nI will say I had an extremely pleasant stay here. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room, while expectedly small since it's NYC, had plenty of outlets and amenities. I even used their business center while there and was pleasantly impressed. The breakfast was varied enough that I didn't get bored with the food. The 24\/7 coffee bar had tea, hot cocoa, and a microwave, which I was able to use for my delicious Italian leftovers. The hotel itself does not have room service on site, but there is an outside room service available (be prepared for about an hour wait) which was convenient and reasonably priced.\nIf it wasn't for being overcharged and then being given the run around about refunding, it would have gotten 5 stars for me, but I feel as if I've been cheated.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It's not really even in Times Square, but it is only half a mile away, so that's not the main problem. The problem is that 39th street, between 8th Ave and this hotel, is really sketchy. 39th is your walking route to get to the subway or Times Square. Once you get to 8th, it's less sketchy, but you first have to walk past homeless people sleeping on the street at all hours of the day, others openly smoking pot, and various other R-rated situations. Not our first trip to NYC and we know what to expect, but this area was definitely worse than expected. The closest subway stop is 2\/10 mile away, the 42 St - Port Authority Bus Terminal and subway station. Unfortunately, this station only serves the A-C-E trains, which are not the main trains for tourists. We found ourselves mostly walking 1\/2 mile to the Times Sq - 42 St station, which services the N-Q-R-S-W-1-2-3-7 trains, which will take you virtually anywhere, and this station is actually linked underground by a VERY LONG passageway to the Port Authority station, which can be extremely HOT, but can be very convenient, especially if it is raining -- duck underground at the nearby Port Authority station and walk to this station. The subway is expansive and you can purchase a 7-day unlimited pass for $33, which is a bargain. Regarding the hotel ... there's only 6 rooms on each floor, but it is 30+ floors tall. Our 2-double bed room was extremely small, even by NYC standards, based on our experience. The staff were very nice and accommodating, especially the staff serving breakfast. Breakfast was nice each day. One day Housekeeping did not service our room at all and another day had not serviced it by 5 pm, but the front desk sent towels when requested. In retrospect, I wish we would have stayed elsewhere -- location of the Hampton Inn Times Square Central appears MUCH better and worth a few $ more.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

In my opinion this hotel does not meet Hilton Standards. I was a late check in on Friday evening, I called the hotel at 9pm to let them know I would be arriving late. Upon my arrival the front door was locked, and the front desk refused to let me in without a room key, so tell me, how was I supposed to check in? I had to actually CALL the front desk from the door to have her let me in. I utilized my E-Check in service from my application to speed up my check in time, NOPE. I spent 35 minutes standing in the lobby waiting for the person on the desk to HAND ME KEYS. That is all they needed to, my credit card had already been authorized, and I had already verified my information. The point of E-Check in is to expedite the check in process, and this certainly did not happen. The person on the front desk did NOT follow E-check in protocol at all. The hotel advertises itself as recently renovated, while this may be true for some the furniture, the carpet in my room was stained, and looked dirty, and the bathroom mirror was chipped and scratched. \n\nThe hotel is also crammed into a very tight building, elevators are hard to access, they are in a weird spot, and they move extremely slow, if I was not on the 23rd floor, I would've used the stairs. The neighborhood isn't very nice either, I have stayed all over Manhattan, and this was one of the few hotels I did not feel comfortable walking to late at night.\n\nAs a loyal Hilton Honors Gold member, I would not stay at this hotel again.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I wanted a nice, modern hotel at a reasonable price that was centrally located and included breakfast. I got the room at a price that was better than any of the 3rd party websites by going to Hilton.com and requesting the AAA rate. Also, Unlike many of the larger hotels in the area, there is NO Resort Fee, which would have been a dealbreaker!  \n\nThis place was just what we wanted and it was topped off by the most amazing staff!  \nWe were welcomed by Jim when we arrived.  Jim\u2019s humor and smiles were refreshing after our long trip.  Next morning at breakfast we were greeted by a pair of magicians, Junior and Amanda. I call them magicians because a swarm of guests would wipe out the food and in a few minutes the buffet would be restored !   The always smiling Leticia would help out at times while still supporting the front as well!  After things calmed down, supervisor Mabel stopped by our table as she helped the other staff to recover from the breakfast crowd. \n\nBecause this guests at this hotel were mostly tourists, most of us would sleep in a bit later than the business guests, there would always be a swarm of guests between 8 and 10 am that would overwhelm the elevators and breakfast area. The staff handled this amazingly well!  I would also like to thank the management for continued breakfast service after the 10 am posted closing time. So many other properties that I have visited will start dismantling the buffet 30 minutes before closing time so that everything is gone at closing. Not at the Hampton Inn!  And this is one of the many reasons that I will stay here the next time I visit NYC!  \n\nI almost forgot a few other things.  The hotel has a fairly small footprint with only 6 rooms on each of the 32 floors and the rooms are smaller than I have experienced at Hampton Inns elsewhere, but the rooms are great!  It had at least 9 USB charging ports and a dozen 110v outlets all within easy reach. There is storage behind the mirror in the bathroom AND the cabinet has a mirror on both sides of the door! \n\nIt\u2019s a great affordable hotel that is convenient and centrally located in Manhattan.

The carpets were dirty, a few pillows had stained or dirty pillow cases, and the bathroom repairs had been sloppily done with hot glue. No sooner had we climbed into bed, than we began smelling smoking. Someone on one side of our room was heavily smoking cigarettes (non-smoking hotel). We did report this in the morning. \nAdditionally, the hotel had only 1 elevator working and it was almost never available. We used the stairs, climbing 16 floors nearly every time we had to go up or down (though we tried to remain out so as to avoid the trouble). \n\nThe second night, as the AC came on, we noticed again the horrible musty\/moldy smell. We were more than happy to check out the next day and move to another Hilton property. ","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

I was told, by the person who checked me in, that after checking in, the rate could not be changed. I asked to speak to the manager, but was advised to email him.  I emailed him. Then I was told he was off for the week and to contact the front desk manager. I did and she said that she could not adjust the rate.  I then waited a week and resent the email to manager.

Nice welcome at check in and was given a room on the 26th floor. Room cost almost $2000 for total stay. A $50 a night charge was held on my credit card. The room itself was average size with 2 double beds squeezed in to it. There was only 1 single wardrobe which was ok for us 2 but if 4 people shared this room they would struggle to put their clothes away and there wasn't much floor space either, but as I understand it, it is common for New York hotels to be not so big. Room had a fridge, safe and a good air conditioning unit. View out of window was the back of another hotel. \n\nThe one thing that hankered our stay was there was a smell in the room that we couldn't fathom where it was coming from. The smell would hit you as you walked in the room but after blasting the air-con for 10 minutes it would go away. I can only describe the smell as being like smelly feet but we packed all our footwear away one day and the smell would still be there when we got back from being out. \n\nBreakfast was on the ground floor at the back of the hotel. It wasn't a very big breakfast area and was busiest between 9-10am. There was hot and cold options as well as a crepe and waffle maker. I was disappointed to see that there was paper plates and plastic knife, fork and spoons. I didn't expect that for a Hilton branded hotel. \n\nThe most annoying thing about our stay here was the lifts. There are only 2 lifts in this hotel for 32 floors which are also used by housekeeping. Some mornings when everyone is going down for breakfast we would wait in excess of 10 minutes for the lift to arrive on our floor.\n\nDespite our frustrations the hotel was in a good location just off 8th Avenue and a 10-15 minute walk from Times Square and Penn Station.\n\nHotel also provided tea and coffee at eh back 24\/7.\n\nIts difficult to judge whether this hotel is value for money as this was my first time in New York and don't know what else to compare it with but I would probably try another hotel if I ever return to New York.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We chose it for convenience, as it is midway between Penn Station and the Richard Rogers Theatre. It was about a seven block walk from Penn Station. Though this may seem like a trek to some, especially carrying a bag, it was probably faster to walk than taking a cab, Uber, or Lyft, given traffic. Likewise, it was faster to walk to the theatre.\nThe room itself was small, and the only available option for the rate we booked was a room with two beds, which made it seem a bit more cramped, but for a night it was fine. Compared to the Hampton\/Times Square North, where we have stayed previously, the South building is taller (39 floors versus 11 or so), but narrower (6 or 7 rooms per floor). Also, we were on the second floor, but had to wait for the elevator as the stairway does not have an exit on the first floor.\nThe breakfast area is nice, and the breakfast was up to Hampton standards.

This hotel is in a good location and the price is fairly good for the location.  It states the hotel was recently renovated which is true.  The rooms are comfortable and clean and up to the normal standard.  However, please be aware that the entire time we were there, only one elevator was working.  We were on the 30th floor and had to wait up to 10 minutes for an elevator.  It was also really frustrating when people staying on the 2nd floor would use the elevator.  Everyone else would give them dirty looks when they got on or off.  There were large groups of kids staying there and the line to get on the elevator went out the front door at one point!  As for the digital key, I used it once and then it stopped working so we had to wait 10 minutes to go back down, get a regular key, and then wait 10 minutes to go back up.  The front desk was very nice and asked if I was 3-5 feet away from the door when I tried to use the key.  Um yeah, there are only 5 rooms on each floor so as soon as you get off the elevator, you are 3-5 away.  Also, all the rooms will hear the elevator all night long.  It is LOUD!  We didn't hear anyone from any other rooms though.\nThe breakfast was actually pretty good for Hampton standards and the staff was attentive which is usually the case wherever we stay.

The weird, stained decorative blanket thing on my bed was purple. No, no, no.\n3. There were weird stains and marks on everything. I wouldn't exactly call it dirty, but it was worn and just felt ... not good.\n4. No mini fridge or beverages or room service. Not that I would have gotten room service at a place like this, but still. \n5. The front desk staff isn't rude, but they aren't exactly helpful. It's like...they'll put up with you if they have to.\n6. I got a call to my room late at night from someone claiming to be the front desk, saying that there was an error with my credit card and they needed a new number. I almost gave it to them since they called my room directly, and last I checked, you can't dial a hotel room direct (don't you have to go through the front desk)? At the last second I thought better of it, hung up, and called the front desk to tell them what happened. Their response was: \"Oh, yeah, that's been happening....\" then just kind of trailed off. What?!?! It seems like this must be some sort of scam among employees since the phones are supposedly closed-circuit. COME ON!\n\nUgh yuck no thanks. I don't care who is paying for this room in the future or how much other hotels are - I won't stay here.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It is also close to the less touristy restaurants on 9th ave and not far from Madison Square Garden and 34th street shopping.  The rooms have been renovated and look great with lots of outlets although I found the beds a bit too firm.  Walk in showers only.  Included breakfast was convenient and decent but a little stressful with so many people in such a small area.  Staff does a good job keeping up with it though.  Overall staff was excellant as was the general manager who clearly takes pride in leading such a friendly and helpful staff. Elevators were generally okay but we did have a 10+ minute wait for elevators one day and the location of the elevators on the first floor is terrible - lots of flow issues due to how the building had to be built in that space.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The staff at this hotel are so sweet and friendly.  They are working with what they\u2019ve got.  They are the only reason I\u2019m not giving it a lower rating because I don\u2019t want to bring them down.  Also, the breakfast was really great so that compensated a bit also for my disappointment in the room.  The staff at breakfast, Jessica and company, and the front desk, Clarence (who was always working, every shift it seemed!) really made this stay more enjoyable than it would otherwise have been.  Also on the plus side, there was a microwave and refrigerator in the room.  Instead of drawers, there are nice wire baskets.  Nice touch. The problem is That this building was not meant to hold this many rooms!  The rooms are the smallest I have ever stayed at in my life. Even smaller than some European cities.  You can\u2019t even move in the bathroom.  No counter. Your items go on a shelf over the toilet and you hope they don\u2019t fall in.  It was clean, though.  The beds are full, not queen.  Too small for a couple to share. As a Hilton gold member, I used many points (I think 70k) for this two night stay. I just don\u2019t think it was worth all those points since I saw online they were only charging something like $92 per night on travel websites. Also, as a gold member, I was pretty disappointed that we had a view of a wall.  I asked the woman when I checked in if it was at least a nice room and she said it would be.  I knew it would be small, I just didn\u2019t know how small. Location was good, but one last thing I wish I heeded...I read all the reviews about the elevator and for some reason I thought they were exaggerated. Well, they weren\u2019t.  You can wait up to 10 minutes, then when it comes it\u2019s full so you have to wait for the next one.  God forbid you forget something in your room like my son did....he ran back up 25 flights to get his convention tag because we waited 12min for the elevator.  If you get a good price and you just need somewhere to sleep and have breakfast, this is fine.  I know I spelled out a lot here, but the basic problem was the size of the room and slow elevator.

The hot water in the lobby was empty 2 nights in a row when I attempted to make hot chocolate. Really guys??? Thanks for the tease. I guess I'll just go up to my room. \n\nI was excited to see there was oatmeal at breakfast, but then I put it in my bowl and it was so runny and watery and gross! Threw the rest away.\n\nThere was also a night I asked the front desk for a comb. The lady said something like \"No I'll have to get that sent up to your room.\" My boyfriend and I watched hours go by in our room and I never got a comb. The next day I go to the front desk to once again ask for a comb. Jim pulls one out effortlessly. Thanks! I wish the girl did that for me. \n\nMy boyfriend asked housekeeping for another roll of toilet paper. We never got it. Ended up using napkins on our last day there. \n\nThe housekeepers do not service rooms until way later in the day. Basically by the time we wanted to go back to the room and relax from walking around all day. A good tip is to ask for earlier service while you're out of the room.\n\nThe housekeepers also have to share the elevator with the guests :) what a nightmare. You will be waiting for the elevator a very long time. Then get cramped inside with 10 other people and cleaning supplies. \n\nThe icing on the cake. On check out day I wanted to print my boarding passes in the business center. Everything's going fine until my passes print blank with no ink. Just another problem I wanted. I went up to my room for a minute to wait for the ink to be fixed, then came back down to see maintenance working at the door and they just said \"sorry out of business\". I was boiling at this point to say the least. Pretty unacceptable to put the business center out of business during check out time when I need my passes the most???? You could of at least gave me a warning???? I never got my passes there. Thank god I got them at the airport. At this point I could not wait to leave this place. My boyfriend had to talk me out of it and calm me down on our last day in NYC. It seemed like every small thing was a hassle. We finally checked out and I couldn't even understand the girl helping me because her voice was too soft and quiet. Boyfriend turned and said to me, \"What did she say?\" \"I don't know.\" The girls seemed clueless and unhappy. Super monotone with no personality. Seemed like they didn't want to be there. But you gotta fake it til you make it!!! Peter and Jim were way more helpful and friendly though even when I saw them in high stress situations. \n\nOn the upside! The bed was very comfy and I enjoyed the view! The 19th floor was very quiet and I loved it, despite being close to the elevator.","travelDate":"2018-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The front desk employees were very nice and professional throughout our stay. The hotel provides free breakfast and there is always coffee, tea, and hot chocolate available throughout the day. The bagels at breakfast were not the best NY type bagels, but tasted like Panera instead. The breakfast potatoes were amazing! Whole and skim milk with choices of cereal were available as well as yogurt. Juice was available - orange, cranberry, and apple. The hotel was clean and our room was kept clean daily by the maid service with towels replaced daily. Plenty of towels, comfortable bed and pillows! Loved having a refrigerator. Air and heat ran well in our room. Plenty of wall plugs to charge electronics as well as USB port charging areas. \n\nThe hotel is set in the Garmet District which isn't the nicest area. Lots of homeless and fake homeless around and a run down area, but it's close enough to the subway and central enough to be a good location for travel. It's next to Hell's Kitchen and near many restaurants and several good pizza places to get a slice or two. \n\nThings to improve on: \n\nThe walk way that runs in front of the elevators is much too narrow for the amount of traffic the area sees, especially during breakfast and check in and check out times. \n9\/10 times at least one of the elevators did not work. The wait for an elevator was always long as there were so many people using the 1 working elevator. (Don't tell me it has been fixed like previous replied to other reviews - it's not fixed and even your staff knows this.) When both elevators were working, they were always full and we had to wait several passes before there was room to get on. The maid service staff uses the same elevators as the guests which is unprofessional and uncomfortable. Dresser Drawers of some sort would benefit guests that stay longer than a weekend. The bathroom shower was quite narrow, the bathroom very small, and no counter space other than the counter that goes immediately around the sink. All of these things an be lived with and worked around. \n\nHowever, the concierge on Monday morning was frazzled and unprofessional. She didn't appear to know what she was doing at all. We were scheduled to take the shuttle to the airport and we had been told the night before to arrive 10 minutes early for the shuttle. We did. We saw no one else waiting for the shuttle, so we asked her what we should be doing. She said our shuttle was around the corner, but we needed to wait on others. We did not want to wait. We wanted to go on to the shuttle to wait there and to get settled. She rudely told us that we must wait for her and that we could not go to the shuttle and we must wait on others. As we walked outside anyway, she continued to insist that we stay inside the hotel and remain with her. We continued to go outside. Another concierge from the next door sister hotel was outside and asked us if he needed help and we told her we were just looking for our shuttle. We walked us down to the shuttle where we found that everyone was already on the shuttle and was ready to go!! Had we wanted for our concierge, we may have missed the shuttle. The shuttle should have picked us up in front of the hotel like the other shuttles were doing, but instead it was practically parked in traffic and we had to maneuver around on coming traffic to get on the shuttle. Other guests on the shuttle commented about the disorganization and unprofessional behavior at the hotel from this shuttle arrangement and the unprofessionalism of the concierge on Monday morning. She seemed stressed and maybe things were out of her control, but more organization for the morning shuttle routine would help. \n\nOther than these things, it was a wonderful few days in New York!","travelDate":"2017-12","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

However, a large group of people had checked out (9am) prior to my arrival which I found had the same room types as I. Anyone would assume that a room could have been cleaned prior to the 1pm timeframe which she gave me as being the earliest....ESPECIALLY since I had already told her of my travel issues and illness. I even offered to upgrade if needed. I asked the young lady at the desk to call me when my room was ready....NEVER HAPPENED! EXTREMELY disappointed!   We took showers upon check in after walking around town and traveling. The shower did not drain correctly and we stood in our own bathing water. I totally understand that this is not something that might have been known. However, we notified the staff of this issue prior to leaving for the evening and when we took showers the following morning....still the same. After the shower drained the first day, it left a nasty film and I just assumed they did not clean that up after fixing it....I was wrong. It was so disgusting by the time we were done showering that I took a picture.   I called the front desk after we arrived back to our room around 11pm about extra towels and the fact that our remote was not working. Maximo came with towels quickly and then maintenance followed shortly after with several remotes to ensure they could correct the problem which was great.   The breakfast staff was GREAT and friendly even with so many people in and out! I really appreciated this.  All the gentlemen that assisted with storing our bags were great!

Would definitely stay here again as we were able to walk to Times Square, Broadway even to Central Park (a bit of a walk, but good exercise). Could walk down to catch the ferry only about 10-15 minutes. A number of bars and restaurants nearby.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The room did have a small closet and the bathroom has a single sink, a toilet and a shower. There is a medicine cabinet so you can store toiletries there as well. There's only two elevators which are small so be prepared to wait during busy times such as breakfast or check out. We had a room on the 31st floor so noise wasn't an issue for us. Although the room was small, we knew that this is mostly the case in NYC, plus we were spending our time walking in the city so this was not a big issue for us.

Unfortunately, the room had a very bad smell -- something like wet carpet and\/or mold and\/or sweat. The room appeared clean -- except for something left behind in the safe -- but the smell was just not pleasant and did not go away, even with the window open. WiFi was okay, but not really fast enough for serious work -- complimentary WiFi only got up to about 3 mbps, and didn't work quite as well on the side of the room furthest from the door. The shower's water pressure was OK, but not great. Bed was comfortable and linens were very clean. TV worked fine. Room had tons of outlets and USB ports, which was nice.\n\nOne REALLY annoying thing was that I was awoken at 5:50 AM in the morning by the room's alarm. It should be on the housekeeping department's check list to turn off the alarm when a room is turned over, so other guests aren't \"treated\" to a former guest's early wake-up time. This was really annoying and I couldn't fall back asleep.\n\nAnother problem was that, when I arrived, I thought to take advantage of the free coffee\/tea service, but when I went to grab a cup off coffee, I saw that fruit flies were all over the coffee containers. I could have still drank the coffee, of course, but it was disgusting and I'm sure the health department wouldn't approve either. \n\nIn the morning, the hotel was fixing an elevator, so there was only one elevator for the 30-story hotel. The hotel put the elevator on manual operation, though, and staffed it with an assistant, so it wasn't actually that bad. \n\nBreakfast was a normal Hampton Inn breakfast -- eggs, pork sausage, bread, yogurt, etc.\n\nI specifically chose the hotel for the location close to the Port Authority, but I wouldn't encourage visitors to NYC to choose this location. Times Square is increasingly terrible with the sidewalks full of \"artists\" and the streets full of filth. Tourists would be better suited to choose a hotel in Chelsea or Union Square or the Lower East Side. Times Square is the worst of New York, unless, as in my case, I just needed a hotel between the Port Authority and Penn Station.  \n\nI suppose I wouldn't be upset about returning to this hotel, but if I did, I would hope that I would receive a pleasant smelling room.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"SOLO"}

A comfortable shower, clean, soft towels and a lovely large bed. I was very happy with the room and as it was on the 32nd floor even had a nice view, although nothing spectacular. \n\nBreakfast in the morning was basic however it was absolutely all I needed. Nice, cute little omelettes, potatoes with pepper and a bakery selection. I believe there were also waffles and pancakes. There were juices and hot drinks on offer also.
