I will note that the location is a little inconvenient if you have meetings in midtown - although Penn Station is a quick 10 minute walk.\n\nThe staff at this hotel were very attentive. I liked all the amenities. As you can imagine, the gym was great. I used both pools during my stay and had no complaints. \n\nWhat I really liked was the blackout shades and sound proof (?) room. The rooms are very smart with lighting under the bed so you can see if you get up in the middle of the night. And let's not forget the double duvets. At first I was skeptical about the need for two duvets but  I woke up very well rested. The mattress seemed to aborb motion from restless sleepers (another plus). The shower was massive with 3 different types of spouts. I also liked the  (local) hotel products - they smelled great and the sizes were large.

In a time where safety is certainly a concern for me when traveling, I wanted to find somewhere far enough away from times square but close enough that it was accessible without being a hassle. I came across the Equinox Hotel in Hudson Yards which is an area I had never stayed in and let me say it was EXACTLY what i was looking for. The area feels roomy, LOTS of shopping options and most of all, felt quite yet active. The best part is there is a subway stop practically at the doorsteps of the equinox with a 1 stop over to the heart of Times Square. Although this location is geared towards adult travelers, I do think its a great option for families looking for a Luxury stay away from the hecticness of Midtown. It has a Spa, A world class Gym (obviously being managed by Equinox Fitness), Room Service and a Pool (although only accessible to ages 18+). The hotel was spotless and everyone from the valet attendant, to the bell services to the front desk to the housekeeping was absolutely 5 star service all across the board. My biggest wish would be to hope that this location would strong consider 2 things.\n1 - hoping that could add some kids menu options to their in-room dining and Electric Lemon restaurant. Im sure there are plenty of guests who may be traveling with thier child or families who want to splurge on the amazing Equinox hotel experience and would truly appreciate at least a small amount of options for children. They already have one foot in the water with a Kids Menu on their breakfast menu but certainly we would of stayed and ordered more in-room or had dinner at Electric Lemon had they offered a Kids Menu. \n2 - My 2nd suggestion would be to offer the In-Room Dining at least till midnight. Currently it ends at 11pm. Heres my reasoning. If you go to an event (NBA game, Concert, Broadway Show) most likely you wont be returning until around 11pm which you just miss the cutoff for in-room dining. What we always love and favor about the Four Seasons hotels is their 24 hour in room dining option which is great for anyone who has a hectic day and sometimes only has that late night option, especially while staying at a hotel, as your probably out with a full schedule. I will say we had the Breakfast for our in-room dining every morning and everything we had was phenomenal! Hats off to your amazing chefs and the deliver was always beautifully presented. \n\nOne last note to travelers. At a hotel of this caliber, we always make a point to ensure we leave a tip for housekeeping as they truly work hard to ensure you come back to a clean and relaxing room. This has been one thing that I have come to truly make sure I never forget to always leave a note with a tip as the housekeeping truly does an amazing job to make sure every guests gets to experience the clean and comfortable luxury that Equinox hotels strive for! Thank you  and please know that you have a really amazing and hardworking housekeeping staff.\n\nOverall we cant wait to return and when we do we really hope to see the addition of Kids options on the menus. If your thinking about booking here don't hesitate and a tip to get some extra perks is to book with WHATAHOTEL, I always book with them for the great perks like breakfast credit and upgrades. Thank you so much to everyone at the Equinox! you all are AMAZING!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

No work desks in the rooms!!! \nThe minibar is like and Equinox store and it\u2019s a little bit confusing as are the light switches, etc. and the shower water pressure is just so-so. The faucets don\u2019t have a nice big stream and the sink is awkward and clunky, also with bad water pressure and the faucet doesn\u2019t come up enough over the sink so you have to be really careful not to make a mess. Definitely not easy, comfortable and user-friendly, none of it. \nThey tried too hard to be high-tech and trendy and it just doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not comfortable and it\u2019s not easy. \nNot to mention, heading down to the front door needing a taxi urgently to get to a dinner (that I was late for) and having the door-staff say I need to go over to an iPad and enter my phone number to get a taxi. Another high-tech, \u201ctrying too hard\u201d fail. and then, of course, the whole thing was glitching up and would not accept the information that I had entered.  \nThere\u2019s so many nice standard, five star hotels in NYC that aren\u2019t trying too hard to be something different or new and that\u2019s what I will stick with moving forward like the Ritz Carlton, Central Park South, The Langham 5th Avenue, the NY Edition, the Lotte Towers and the Loews Regency. \nHowever, I had to try this at least once and now that\u2019s done.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Very accessible to great restaurants and Broadway shows (we liked to walk before and after the shows so it was nice to be able to do that to\/from the hotel).  We loved that it was less busy at Hudson Yards and still close to everything. \n\nThe room itself was impeccable. We loved the lighting and the layout.  The shower and bathroom were big and well laid out.  We weren't fans of the double duvets however.  We also didn't like that our room temperature would not go lower than 66 degrees.  We're hot sleepers and this was problematic every night.  We finally got them to bring us a fan and that helped a little. \n\nThe staff at the Equinox were all amazing.  They treated us like royalty and always greeted us when we came by. Our room attendant who we never got the privilege of meeting was amazing.  We loved coming back to our room and finding all the little touches that were made to keep the room tidy. \n\nOverall we loved the hotel and enjoyed our stay.  We did not, however, enjoy the gym.  We booked our stay at the Equinox mainly for the gym option. What we didn't anticipate was that the gym is accessible to many many non-hotel guests.  We used the gym daily - at different times during the day - and not once was it not fully packed with people.  So crowded that getting a decent workout was impossible.  Moreover \/ using the amenities (plunge pools, steam barrels, etc.) was almost impossible unless you wanted to wait forever.  We also found the equipment in the gym to be old and in desperate need of an upgrade. Overall the gym does not do the luxury hotel justice.  We were very disappointed.  \n\nIn the end we loved the Equinox hotel but unfortunately our experience with the gym left us disappointed.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff! The decor! The service!  The comfort!  I feel like they want me back and that they care. It\u2019s a rustling, bustling hotel with a great healthy restaurant, lounge\/bar and cozy attentive front desk. No need was not met.

The smiles, the service and the knowledge of how to make a guest feel special was evident in this young man.  They all had this quality but he just stood out and needed to be acknowledged. \nThe beds were a little stiff and I asked for a topper which came up immediately. Our room had a beautiful large high tech bathroom with a large shower that had a glass window that with a push of a button, gave complete privacy or a view to the room and the view of the city.

The front desk staff are helpful, and they always follow through quickly with any request.  Love having access to the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Equinox gyms.  And, an excellent brunch and evening cocktails are only an elevator ride away to the Electric Lemon.\n\nLove the attention to the room details in ensuring a restful and zen-like stay. The housekeeping staff does a fantastic job!  Rooms are so clean!!  \n\nOn our initial visit to the Equinox Hotel earlier this year, we were immediately greeted by Andy when we drove up to the private driveway (a huge plus).  He is the perfect example of how one person can make a difference. He set the tone of our stay - we felt welcome and taken care of.  This positive experience is why we keeping coming back.

Here are the misses: you enter the hotel from a narrow entrance into a dark elevator bank (there isn't a lobby).  Check-in is on the 25th floor. After check in you take another smaller elevator up to your room.  Anytime you want to leave your room you are two elevator rides away.  The restaurant is nice, but it is one floor below the 25th, so again - not easy to slide in and have a drink like you would in a hotel with a lobby. The rooftop bar is a no go, as all the tables were reserved the whole time we were there, even though nobody was ever seated at the reserved tables (as a hotel guest, this was very annoying). After being told there were no tables for a drink there, we seated ourselves and carried our own drinks to the \"reserved table.\" Very strange.  On the plus side, the room was sleek and had a great view, and the shower was amazing with very high-end products.  I noticed a lot of athletes there - the gym obviously is a big focus of this hotel. While I thought the staff was great and the room was nice, this hotel just had a cold and sterile feel.  If you value your workouts though and don't mind a minimalist esthetic, this might fit your style. ","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The skyline view was fantastic and while it wasn't the Vessel view, I could still see the Vessel quite well. Also liked the rituals and meditation they had on the TV.\n\nWe stayed here mostly to try out the gym and it was excellent. Classes were fantastic and we joined about 6 classes in the 4 nights we were there. Does get extremely busy at times though. We joined the cycle beats class and it was the best workout I've ever had.\n\nIf I can nitpick, and at the price they're charging I definitely can, they advertise \"Dark. Quiet. Cool.\" Though, during the daytime, if you close the blinds, there is still a smidge of light coming from outside. I think the fitment of the blinds still allows some light in. Furthermore, I believe they should add more options to the in-room dining as we liked the healthy food options but had a difficult time figuring out what to order by the 2nd day.

A quick check in, confirmation of services, and you're taken back to the nicely appointed locker rooms to change. The locker rooms were also super super clean - staff were constantly moving through to make sure the locker room stayed spotless.\n\nMy massage was with Kaysla - a fantastic therapist, who listened carefully to my requests and pointed out a few areas of tightness that she worked out with ease. The hour went fast, and I really wished I had booked a longer session.\n\nAfter the massage we hung out in the relaxing lounge, which faces west with views of the Hudson.  I really liked the way the lounge was set up, with semi-private areas and privacy curtains. While we were hanging out in the lounge, the staff that checked us in came by regularly with offers of water\/drinks and food, and they were very accommodating of our dietary requests. In addition, the staff were super helpful in setting up other services that we hadn't booked in advance, but were available same day.\n\nI was very happy with our visit to the spa. As nice as the facilities are, the spa staff are really what made the place shine. Every single person we encountered was very professional, well trained, friendly, and helpful without being pushy in the least.

The servers were absolutely brilliant, but it felt like anyone above that station was just disinterested and less than helpful.

I was quoted a fee by the concierge of $210 for a pick up from the airport, I have it in writing, they ended up charging nearly double that and then did not refund me the entire fee that I overpaid, even though they admitted fault. I queued for ages to get into Electric Lemon while loads of servers were standing around chatting at the back, and was ignored in favour of the men who were standing behind me\u2026 I found the atmosphere pretty toxic to be honest.

On several occasions, I stay, play and recover at this hotel, even though I live full time in New York. It\u2019s the best STAYCATION destination in one of the busiest cities in the world. Immediately when you walk into the room it is calming and quiet, from the rich colour palette to the detailed design of the lighting. Layers begin to shed off immediately. One of the best features of the rooms is the sheer silence they offer. The epitome of quiet luxury. The COCOMAT bed with crisp white Egyptian Matouk sheets are in and of themselves exceptional; the blackout night time feature that orchestrates the cold sleeping temperature and virtual sound proofing; and incredible shower and room standard signature A.M. and P.M. product offerings stand out as highlights. For an additional splurge the room curated mini bar which goes well beyond a mini bar offering eye masks, tinctures, sports wear has you googling products to get more of these rare finds. \n\nThe team is very aware of guests needs and moods, leaving you be with the right amount of space and interacting and engaging when necessary. Kudos to Nathan for creating an environment with such a strong sense of respite. They get every detail right \u2014 they even asked about my ETA to ensure my special request to be able to work privately from my room was ready when I walked into the door \u2014 so I didn\u2019t miss a beat \u2014 or an email. \n\nThis is a wonderfully designed hotel with seamlessly executed operations for any type of trip, I highly recommend it for a 3-day STAYCATION in New York so you can fully immerse yourself and escape out of the urban jungle and into the urban oasis.

We stayed in a Premier King, which I can recommend as this room is very spacious and has (ours did) views of the Hudson river. This hotel makes a big deal about the soundproofing of their rooms, and the total blackout shades that help guests fall asleep and stay asleep. \nI will say this: two things I never knew I needed in New York and now I cannot imagine a stay without them! It makes a massive difference: this is the first stay away from home in decades where I actually felt \"well\". Dare I say it! But its true. My husband and I both slept like rocks, we ate like kings (we only ate at the in-house restaurant, Electric Lemon), and felt able to more quickly get over our jet lag than usual. \nThe rooms are soothing decor-wise, and the sofa in our room was comfy enough to literally sit there and work all day. Wifi is pretty good. As said, beds  very comfortable. The only niggle is that I usually really enjoy a neck supportive pillow, which did not seem to be on offer at Equinox. On day 3 we did get a firm non-feather pillow but this is not the same. In fact, it was unfortunately too firm, so I ended up putting a bath towel over the sofa pillow and sleeping like this. \nAlso, at this room level, there are no tubs in the bathing area - only a really good shower. I am a bath person so I did miss this but I found I still got a great cleaning experience, especially with all the fantastic Grown Alchemist products - heaven. \nBut back to the FoOd... its so good. Its so so so good. Its all clean eating too, so you never feel like even though you just got grilled chicken and veg, that it was cooked in so much butter and oil that you just feel bloated anyway. Some standouts are: avocado toast (yes its had its day but when done correctly is great), the beauty bowl - fantastic - the fresh pressed juices are actually pressed freshly, very good - the halibut, the sea bream, the chicken (but its a large piece, dont get this if you arent really hungry), and the standout was the cauliflower flatbread. \nI also took a private pilates lesson with Annie and it was a very very good lesson. the studio is excellent and has all equipment in it. I took a private next to another person and we ended up having a really nice chat afterward. \nI did not use the spa or the open gym but they were both very busy so I imagine it can't be terrible. \nThe people who are working for the guests' comfort are lovely - from first arrival to departure. I cannot fault anything - I hope they like working there as much as I liked staying there. \nIn fact, there is really only one negative for me - and it may not be a negative point for everyone. I actually think I am alone on this one judging by my observations. It is way way way too cold in this hotel. I got sick from eating in the restaurant because the air blows directly down on diners. Every time I walked out of our room I had to have on a sweater. To go from that to sweltering New York heat cannot possibly be healthy. \nThe reason I say I am alone is that every single other guest was wearing shorts or sleeveless tops etc., and did seem quite comfortable. I hardly saw anyone shivering, except me. So if you have a fast metabolism this is your place :)\nAll in all I am definitely coming back. This is a great hotel and I hope they do not change anything - except pillow question and 3 degrees higher on the airco. \nCan absolutely recommend! \n","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel is extremely nice, and the location is incredible, right in the middle of Hudson Yards. I was offered early check-in and a room upgrade which was absolutely fantastic.\n \nOn my last night there, I was looking for the remote control to turn the TV off on my way out of the room. I moved the comforter and noticed what was clearly a blood stain toward the foot of the bed. It is obviously gross and definitely not ok, but stuff happens \u2014 let\u2019s just get it replaced and move on. I was on a call so I didn\u2019t get to call downstairs, I just activated the \u201cmake up room\u201d button so housekeeping would clean the room (I left the stain visible). I got back to the room around 1 am and saw the room made up but the stain was still there \u2014 again, no problem, I realize I didn\u2019t call to explicitly request new sheets (though I thought they\u2019d be replaced) but let\u2019s get it fixed. \n\nI called downstairs and Christian apologized but said due to the time he could only deliver me sheets but nobody could put them on. My biggest question: what 5-star hotel asks me to replace my sheets that they left blood on rather than offer me a different room or frankly anything else as an apology? The gentlemen who brought them to the room was kind enough to put them on for me and took the dirty sheets. Christian gave me his email and told me to email him pictures and he\u2019d have management get back to me the next day. Upon checkout, they offered me no explanation (though they did as if I was sure it wasn\u2019t my blood) but said someone would get back to me that day. They did let me know that they don't replace sheets during your stay so I slept on that stain for 2 nights. It\u2019s now been 2 days and I haven\u2019t heard back though I\u2019ve followed up via email \u2014 in fact, I forwarded the initial email to the manager's email on their website, but this email address gets bounced back. \n\nAll of this to say, what truly differentiates a good hotel from a great one is how you treat your guests, and how you handle issues that arise.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed to even have to write this review because stuff happens, but the lack of follow-through, or even response, from management proves to me that while this may be a great hotel 90% of the time when things are going smoothly, it certainly can\u2019t be categorized as a 5-star hotel when an issue arises. If you\u2019re looking for a 5-star service experience, look elsewhere.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The service was impeccable, the rooms were comfortable, and the amenities were top-notch.\n\nWe arrived at the hotel just in time for check-in, and we were greeted immediately by a friendly doorman who helped us with our luggage and brought it up to the lobby. The check in process was quick and easy, and I was immediately impressed by the luxurious lobby. The hotel is located in the heart of Hudson Yards, so it\u2019s perfectly situated for exploring all that New York City has to offer. \n\nMy room was spacious and well-appointed, with a comfortable bed (double duvets!), a large bathroom, and a beautiful view of both the city and the river. Many of the electronics in the room can be activated with the in-room iPad. The amenities were also top-notch, including a Nespresso machine, a minibar, and a variety of wellness items such as a complementary yoga mat and skin care. \n\nIn the morning we ordered from the hotel's extensive in-room dining menu. The menu boasts a variety of options ranging from health conscious smoothies, eggs, pastries, and many vegan\/vegetarian options. The food arrived promptly - coffee was warm and the food was delicious. \n\nAfter breakfast we  headed to the hotel's gym, which is one of the most impressive I've ever seen. The facility is massive, and it has everything you could possibly need to get a great workout. We were able to book a cycling class at the concierge desk. It was a great way to start the morning. I also took advantage of the hotel's spa, which offers a wide variety of treatments. I had a customized facial, and it was one of the best I've ever had.\n\nWe had dinner at the hotel's restaurant, Electric Lemon, and the food was absolutely delicious. The service was also excellent, and I felt like I was truly being pampered.\n\nOverall, my stay at the Equinox Hotel New York was absolutely amazing.

The Electric Lemon restaurant is fantastic, the spa is a great place to visit (cryo-treatments, nutrient injections, IVs, thermal sauna, etc.), but recently had an incredibly negative experience with Nathan Loga, the hotel's VP of Guest Experience.\n\nWhile waiting in the lobby on my laptop for some colleagues for an Electric Lemon afternoon bite, an employee approached and said I need to move locations as they're \"concerned about damage to the couch\" I was sitting on. I was frankly quite confused, as I was sitting normally, had normal clothes on, and always sit here while waiting in the lobby. I dug in a bit and the employee told me \"nevermind\" and left. He came back about 10 minutes later, apologized, and said that Nathan Loga, their VP of Guest Relations, asked that I leave. Bare in mind many people are sitting in the area, a couple of which mentioned they were also just waiting to eat downstairs.\n\nThe employee said he's not sure what the real reason is, and that he feels bad. Even offered me a free drink at the bar. I asked to speak to the mysterious man behind the curtain (Nathan Loga) who was evicting me from the lobby, but he \"suddenly became tied up in a meeting and wouldn't be free for a couple of hours.\"\n\nAs a weekly patron of this hotel and a very quiet \/ clean person, the experience was disappointing and offensive. I won't be returning here for food, drinks, or spa treatments ever again, and I'm cancelling my Equinox gym membership to move elsewhere. Treatment like that of patrons is never acceptable and shouldn't be tolerated.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

A hotel can make or break your travel experience. Equinox Hotel has cracked the code regarding service, space, privacy, communication, and mental health resources. I\u2019ve stayed a handful of times now each stay has been almost two weeks. Not once has the hotel made me feel uncomfortable. The check-in process is seamless. They always remember my name. I enjoy the entrance to the hotel. It gives you the impression of privacy, and the lift only allows you to the 24th floor, which is the reception. The offerings in the room are incredible and thoughtful. There\u2019s also a refillable filtered water tap, a beautiful gesture to save on our blueprint. I love the spacing in the wardrobes, lots of compartments to put away your clothes, and cases, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, which I believe are essential facing a window or lit very well. Utterly obsessed with how room service is orchestrated with very sensible delivery. The packaging is meaningful and intentional. Keeps the food warm or hot. The dry cleaning service is speedy and packaged beautifully. Enjoy the showers. Spacing in the bathrooms is also decent. The list goes on and on and on.I must mention the location as I think it\u2019s perfect if you\u2019re not from New York and want to be in the heart of New York but don\u2019t like a lot of noise. You have easy access to everything but feel like you\u2019re not in all the Mayhem. The gym access is phenomenal. It\u2019s open from 530, although I wish it were five AM. I have just enough time to get a decent workout before I start my day. The hotel and GYM are immaculate, and the interior is modern, chic, and practical can not wait for my next trip.

There are no shortage of Pro's in this review section. You're paying possible $1K a night for the room so you deserve to know. \n\nEQUINOX HOTEL IS JUST SOME ROOMS ABOVE AN EQUINOX \"PUBLIC\" GYM\nAs other reviewers have complained, the Equinox Hotel is a hotel with a Equinox Gym that is OPEN to the general public of Equinox members. Although hotel people get their own private elevators, you're still with the general public and the gym gets busy. Many people in the review section thought that the Equinox Hotel had an exclusive gym and spa that was uniquely made for hotel guests. This was not the case. Unlike a lot of luxury hotels where the gym and pool go all the way to midnight, you're subject to the Equinox Gym hours. From Fridays to Saturdays, the gym\/pool\/cold plunge\/hot tubs close as early as 9:30pm to 9:00pm. This was inconvenient but going back to my main point, you would expect Equinox Hotel to create a special workout experience that normal Equinox members would not get to experience. You're paying $1K+ for a night here.\n\nEQUINOX SAUNA IS LOW QUALITY, COLD PLUNGE NOT COLD ENOUGH\nThe saunas are those makeshift ones you can get from the hardware store or Costco. It takes forever to heat it up and it's not infrared. The cold plunge is also not cold enough, it's like 5-7 degree water. I go to a legit Scandinavian one and those cold plunges are 0-1 degrees celsius and has ice floating in it. It cures the injuries up good. \n\nFRONT DESK IS TOO MINIMALISTIC\nIt's a door with a guy on the side with an iPad. That's the lobby.\n\nIT'S A HOTEL THAT MAKES YOU TAKE 2 ELEVATORS TO GET TO YOUR ROOM\nI personally don't like it. You take it from Ground (guy with iPad) to 25th floor which has the reception (above the restaurant which is on floor 24). Then you take elevators up to your room. \n\nNow there are a lot of Pro's. Rooms have filtered water station (no more asking for water bottles), black out auto shades, iPad controlled lights (dimmable) and shades, healthy menu (smoothies, acai bowls, bone broth etc), Equinox gym is always decent especially their classes, steam room in change room is great, great service from the staff, valet is awesome, location is prime (hudson yards is the new place to be, a lot of money went into it), a legit luxury mall across the courtyard (the shops - brand new), \"the edge\" around the corner, fast highway road beside the hotel to take you North or South. Ultimate the area is much more modern, clean and tranquil vs you staying in a hotel in the core. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Very clean, well designed, great amenities. Housekeeping staff was excellent. Blackout blinds  + double duvet = great nights sleep. Great location. We came in at Penn Station . Went to events at MSG. Hopped on the High Line  - all very walkable .\n\nThe Bad- The fitness center  and pools ( which we were looking forward to using )were very busy. My husband and I scoped it out before we went out and found ample towels and robes by outdoor pool. When we came back down , all the robes were gone and there were two towels. My husband went to the gym from desk to see where we could get more and he was told \u201cit\u2019s not my problem\u201d by the employee. Since we couldn\u2019t use the outdoor saunas( one was full and the other was occupied by a meditation class), we went to the indoor pool. I wanted to swim laps and waited patiently for a lane to open. I swam five or six laps and the lifeguard came and told me I needed to get out because I didn\u2019t have a cap on - another swimmer who wanted my lane complained. I don\u2019t think I wouldn\u2019t have been so upset  1) the lifeguard would have said something to me before I started swimming2) if the lady leaving behind  me hadn\u2019t said she has never seen someone \u201ckicked out\u201d for not wearing a swim cap - THEY ARE JUST GIVEN ONE!! A staff member saw us in the Elevator after the gym fiasco , we told him the story- he said he get someone to call us \u2026never heard from anyone. \n\nOther annoyances- the concierge told us the St Patrick\u2019s Day parade goes down 5th Ave- it doesn\u2019t. Made us walk several blocks out of our way.\n\nThey got rust stains on one of my bags in storage- I pointed it out at check out and when we asked them to store it after we checked out- they just looked at it.

The bathrooms are great with amazing showers and the products from Grown Alchemist smell delicious. The lighting in the rooms is also well designed and thoughtful. Perfect for taking a mirror selfie before a night out. Also loved the yoga equipment in room. \n\nRoom service was also fantastic. Great quality food delivered on time by friendly staff. \n\nThe staff were on the whole extremely helpful and friendly. \n\nNow the negatives. \n\nThe design of the hotel.\n\nYou enter at street level into a dark room with two elevators at the end. The reception for the hotel is on the 25th floor. You are greeted sometimes by the door staff and sometimes they just seemed to be hanging out chatting near the entrance. It didn\u2019t feel like we were entering a luxury hotel. \n\nThen the elevators from street level to reception would also stop at the gym on level 4 and spa on level 5 and also the restaurant on 24 so it felt like it took forever to get to reception. Then you would have to use another lift shaft to get to the rooms. Meaning that you would have to parade through reception every time you wanted to visit the gym or the spa. Also there are no umbrellas on street level so if you realise it\u2019s raining and need an umbrella you must make an infuriating trip all the way back up to reception to get an umbrella and then back down again. \n\nReception was a small mezzanine above the Electric Lemon restaurant. In most luxury hotels you are greeted with a gorgeous signature scent. In this hotel we were greeted by the smell of fish and grease from the restaurant. A really strange concept. \n\nOn check in we were upgraded according to our American Express platinum card but this was only a view upgrade and not a bigger room. This hotel only has rooms from floor 25 up to floor 40 or something like that so tbh all rooms seem to have a pretty decent view anyway. If you want a bigger room I suggest you choose one at time of booking rather than relying on an upgrade as we were told that there were fewer premium sized rooms so the hotel has trouble fulfilling upgrades. The hotel should be, at check in, much more transparent with this info and the check in experience would be much less disgruntling. \n\nWe booked this hotel in large part due to the pools and wellness facilities. We didn\u2019t, at the time of booking, realise that these pools actually are run and belong to the equinox fitness club. This is a beautiful and well appointed fitness club but also the busiest I have ever seen. Don\u2019t expect to be able to relax around the pools as on the many times we tried it was like an Olympic swimming meet going on.  We then tried to visit the outdoor pool only to find that the robes and slippers that are supposed to be placed there for guests to use were not there. We asked a member of staff and they looked perplexed and sent us off to our hotel room to get our own robes and slippers from the room. Another two infuriating lift journeys in my swimming trunks. I later was told by a senior member of staff at the hotel that there should be robes by the pool. There was a lack of communication between the hotel and fitness centre. There in I think lies the problem. We felt like intruders and not comfortable in this busiest of spaces. We are used to pool areas like the one at Park Hyatt which is used by hotel guest only, and is rarely busy and the perfect place to relax after a long day walking the streets of the city. Also the Equinox fitness centre would close at 11pm so no late night work outs which is something we would normally enjoy in other hotels. I understand some people might enjoy access to a busy fitness club but we were expecting something less hectic. \n\nRoom service ends at 11pm. Extremely inconvenient. Especially when you get back from a show and fancy a late night snack or dessert. \n\nThe reason I am being so detailed in my review is because this hotel was at a price point similar to the Park Hyatt, Baccarat and Four Seasons downtown and I am afraid it is a long way off in terms of service and facilities and customer experience. There, in my opinion, is nothing exclusive or special having access to an extremely busy Equinox fitness club. You can find these fitness clubs on nearly every corner in New York. Many people I\u2019m sure would enjoy it but important to know what you are in for.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I would say with Equinox it isn\u2019t a bad stay the gym is nice and people are generally pleasant but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a full 5 star service. Just more of a nice hotel to stay in. We were in town for my girlfriends birthday and nothing was done to make her feel special. I stayed at the Ritz this January and I was gifted a free bottle of Champagne and dessert in my room plus a free limo ride to our restaurant that evening. That\u2019s 5 star service - looking at the detail in order to get customers to continue to stay with your hotel in the long term. Upon checking out I left my business MasterCard to be charged for the room and although they assured me they\u2019d use it. They decided to still charge my American Express which has incurred \u00a3150 worth of fees because of the non-sterling transaction costs. Something I explained I didn\u2019t want to happen so left my MasterCard that didn\u2019t have any fees per transaction. They have to take a holding payment whenever you leave a card to make sure you have money on that card, which they did and held a payment and then still chose not to use it and go against my wishes. Just goes to show about the service average non-attentive. No real care in the consumer. The gym is cool and the city is incredible but the hotel is meh. \n\n Nothing was unique about this experience and we are looking forward to staying at the Pendry Manhattan West which is 2 minutes away from the Equinox Hotel next time (take a look!)

Here, nothing to do but applaud, as this hotel is attached to a massive Equinox gym, of course. Everything you need is there, from cardio to weights to swimming; it is heaven for the fitness enthusiast.  It is my main reason to return. However, I think they price themselves like a luxury property but do not hit the level.  \n\nThe hotel\u2019s brand is about health and well-being and they mostly hit the mark. The in-room yoga mat and related equipment, well-being tutorials on an iPad, the wide array of healthy snacks and other products for sale in the room - beyond a minibar.  However, food offerings were not as elevated or healthy as you might expect from a fitness oriented property \u2013 the breakfast options were basic and limited, like what you would get at any hotel these days (breakfast sandwich, omelette, pancakes . . . ). I would have loved to see protein smoothies, for example. \n\nI did enjoy the choice of a morning invigorating shower gel and an evening calming version in the bathroom, but the water pressure was annoyingly low. Towels \/ bath sheets not generous in size \u2013 they feel like gym towels, a little small and scratchy.  \n\nA real irritation was a design flaw of the building: there are only two elevators on the ground floor, which meant delays and crowds trying to get up to reception every time I had to go in and out.  (see photo)\n\nService was really average; most staff were not well trained and were unengaged; front door staff never offered to help with luggage or give guidance.  Housekeeping was minimal.

It\u2019s pretty absurd, hotel guest pay almost $1000 a night, can\u2019t even use\/enjoy the amenities, never had such experience with other luxury hotels.\n2. The food quality from the hotel room service and the restaurant are terrible. We ordered room service one morning for breakfast. The omelet looked super sad and texture was very rubbery, worst omelet ever. Electric Lemon, the food is GROSS, the salad we ordered had some spoiled pieces, absolutely disgusting. \n3.

Electric Lemon has a menu that is nearly perfect with outstanding culinary quality. The service is as well great, Daniel Gomez the Front Manager has his team on point.  And they have gone above and beyond even to arrange that I was looked after to make it to my flight in time by a transport to the airport by Blade helicopter (not expensive). \n\nI\u2019ve now stayed about 5X over the past 4 months in Equinox and it continues to deliver each time. The Hudson Yards area also is so much fun to be in NYC - safe, fun and always something going on.  The Equinox pool, gym and spa is Great too.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

And it certainly was. \n\nInitially, I was a bit apprehensive because it seems to be tailored to the younger crowd, not the ahem older demographics. Instagram is packed with sexy shots of influencers doing their thing. I almost cancelled but then decided to take a change. And so happy I did.\n\nIn Hudson Yards, it is an ideal location for accessing the High Line and Hudson River Path, and  Chelsea and the Village. \n\nThe staff here is gracious, welcoming, and go out of their way to ensure your stay is perfect. Our room, a junior suite was fantastic. Large, high tech, with views of the Hudson and City, it exceeded our expectations. I always have a hard time sleeping in hotels-not here-the mattress was firm but comfortable, the pillows perfectly plump, and the duvet light and airy. It was like  drifting off on a cloud. I told my husband that we needed to upgrade our ancient mattress with one of these gems. I have got a thing for toiletries and loved their offerings. \n\nWe had lunch at Electric Lemon as soon as we checked in and the food (burger and polenta fries) were delicious- and so were the two glasses of wine we both sipped on while contemplating our trip to see Serena play at the US Open. \n\nWe breakfasted there as well and had terrific meals. The coffee was hot and bold. The Eggs Benedict was cooked to perfection. All their items are healthy but you still felt you were splurging. \n\nSadly, I was unable to book a service at the spa-it was a last minute thought after walking 20 miles the day before and needing a bit of TLC, so I would recommend booking ahead or seeing the concierge. I had intended to visit the gym and (Soul Cycle) but decided at the last minute to forgo  it and left my gear at home. The first time I have ever done that. And the last. Lesson learned, when in doubt, toss it in. \n\nThough the crowd was young, there were plenty of age ranges, and when my eyes met another group of older people, I smiled. There were families and couples enjoying their stay. \n\nMy husband and I both agreed we could not have chosen a better place to stay.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

When I arrived up at reception at 5.30pm my room was not yet ready and I was instantly offered a credit to my account, which was appreciated.  The hotel and room itself are very smart and modern, with an incredible view of downtown NYC from the 36th floor.  The room was very comfortable, fantastic bed and pillows, great bathroom although the shower pressure was a little low.\n\nUnfortunately, I did suffer two nights with a noisy neighbour who's loud talking and singing at 3am could very clearly be heard (and loudly) through the walls.  The room was certainly not soundproof.  On both occasions I had to call reception, who even at that time of night answered quickly and all went quiet a few minutes later.  After the second occasion I did ask to move rooms, and this was done without fuss and I was moved to an improved and much quieter room.  A newly built hotel in this price range should really have soundproofed rooms though.\n\nHousekeeping were excellent, leaving additional amenities when asked for and then remembering to refresh them a couple of days later without asking.  The one time I had to call for an item via the in-room ipad, it was literally delivered within a few minutes.\n\nThe gym doesn't really need any comment - it's way, way above standard hotel gyms.\n\nI had breakfast three days in the restaurant.  Food quality is very good, service was a little rough around the edges at times (staff stood in a group talking or all of them  somewhere out the back of the restaurant).  A number of items available on room service weren't available on the restaurant menu which was disappointing.\n\nOverall though a very enjoyable stay, its just a shame that the noise impacted two nights otherwise it would have been a 5-star review.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Super quiet (thanks to the quality of the build), great finishes, functional, bright, comfortable. Very little carpeting (thus improving cleanliness). Silent air conditioning. Great lighting. Blackout blinds. Wonderful showers.\n\nService has always been consistently impeccable (in a city where consistency of service nowadays is rare to find).

The pool had a one-of-kind view of The Vessel on one side and the river on the other. It also had a cooler, more relaxed vibe than other rooftop pools in the city that turn into loud, dirty parties. The restaurant has a very unique terrace and tranquil vibe with ~chill~ music. The spa offered many health-centric add ons like vitamin drips and cryotherapy. My husband and I opted for a cyro session, followed by 30 minutes in the infrared sauna (both of which we were allowed to do together which was nice) and then cbd massages. We left feeling amazing and refreshed. The rooms were really what drove us to choose this hotel though. They\u2019re designed for the ultimate sleep experience: perfect sleep temp, black out curtains & quiet mode, and 2 separate duvets on the bed to not disturb your partner. It\u2019s an ideal room if you\u2019re not great sleepers like us. The room also comes equipped with complimentary yoga mat and resistant bands if you\u2019d like to get in a workout in your room- although you won\u2019t need to since the stay comes with access to the health club membership perks like unlimited fitness classes. Although we wanted to relax, we just had to take advantage of the access and do a Pilates class in the morning. Overall it was a great experience and a cool place to stay in New York.

It\u2019s our first time in NYC and we were so excited to land here and make use of the facilities. We had deliberately booked this hotel as we knew the weather would be good and we had hopes of spending some days lounging around the outdoor pool, one of the largest in NYC, as we slept off the jet lag and partying.\n\nThe hotel is gobsmackingly beautiful and we had a fabulous view from the 30th floor, taking in Hudson Yards, river and Freedom Tower glistening in the distance.\n\nWithin an hour of checking in we headed down to the pool and then discovered the biggest setback - the pool is shared by hotel guests, gym users and others and is incredibly over-subscribed. You have to put your name\/number on the waiting list if you arrive after around noon onwards for a bed with a stated wait time of around two hours at around midday so were squashed on a towel on the terrace with others who were presumably waiting like us. We never got a call all day as the \u2018waiting list\u2019 was clearly hundreds deep!\n\nWe headed down early a couple of days later to a cold and breezy empty terrace waiting for the sun to come around. Literally freezing cold, we lay there for an hour in the knowledge that when the sun came around, we\u2019d have prime space in the sun. Not so - within minutes of the sun coming around, everyone seemed to turn up and then the pool manager came over and told us that we had already had our beds for over 90 minutes and we had to leave them in ten minutes.\n\nThere\u2019s the rub - beds can only be kept for 90 minutes, presumably to allow as many of the gym users to use them as possible.\n\nSo basically forget lazy days, lunches and drinks around the pool here - they manage an oversubscribed pool deck incredibly tightly and the whole experience just became stressful as you never quite knew when you might be asked to vacate. We moved from the hotel after three nights to another property and there was not a lot else to enjoy - even the outdoor \u2018Lemon\u2019 terrace was closed for a private event, so we never really got to enjoy the \u00a31k\/night property as we had hoped.\n\nIf you\u2019re here for a holiday, book somewhere else as this hotel seemed to cater far more for the users of the vast gym (Equinox is famous for this).\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s a stunning property - just don\u2019t expect to relax here in \u2018holiday mode\u2019. The lift situation is also bewildering - you have to get the first lift to the communal areas (reception, bar, terrace), then walk around the floor for the second lift to the rooms - we never quite worked things out.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

The people at the front desk made us feel home right away. We got a room upgrade, and got what I believe is called a Skyline Room. The room was very elegant and spacious. The bed was great, and so was the bed linen. It felt new and crispy. We had enough room to stash away our luggage, and that always makes it feel less of a travel and more of home.\n\nWe tried out the their SPA. Both of us had the infra red sauna, and my wife tried a drip treatment. She was a little jet lagged, but it all went away after the drip treatment. I went for a swim in the outdoor, but heated lap pool. The pool was long enough to actually get some exercise out of it.\n\nWe ate at the restaurant, Electric Lemon, and the food was great. \n\nThe location of the hotel is perfect to check out the new Hudson Yards. We walked the High Line which is located right by the hotel, and which is a great thing to do in NYC. It took us right down to Chelsea Market.\n\nThe hotel staff looked out for our luggage the day we checked out, so that we could enjoy more of what the area has to offer.\n\nAll in all a great experience which is recomended.","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

Immediately greeted upon arrival, front desk walked us to the elevator upon check-in,  and 2 bottles of water waiting for us in the room. Our view was overlooking the Hudson River, and sunsets were stunning. We are used to staying at luxury hotels, but the Equinox experience was just different. The shower alone was worth the price of admission (water pressure, AM and PM body wash, the scents). My wife and I didn't want to leave the room and bathrobes! At night there is a button on the iPad to make the room cool, dark, and quiet....so cool, and an amazing night's rest. Also, any time we called the front desk, they were at our door in minutes. Having a full Equinox just downstairs was incredible and convenient. We were able to maintain our lifestyle away from home (me weight-training, my wife yoga classes). The restaurant was fantastic, and many healthy options. The hotel location is right next to the High-line, which made it super easy to explore and head down to different parts of NYC. Additionally, the Peak is right next door and a can't miss (360 degree views). The concierge set us up with an incredible table for cocktails before our meal at Electric Lemon. Overall, 10\/10.

It will always be Equinox Hotel when I come into the city moving forward. This was my 2nd time staying at the Equinox Hotel and I truly cannot say enough positive things about this establishment. From the rooms, to the lounges & bars, gym & spa, and service and concierges, everything is top notch. I am typically someone who stays in a Four Season or St. Regis, and I would rate Equinox Hotel above those and any other hotel I have ever stayed in. \n\nThe Rooms - The design of the rooms is spectacular. They are spacious and very well designed. The dark and moody vibes really set the tone for NYC. The decor is beautiful, the lighting is wonderful and has very modern technology for the lights, shades, drapes, AC system, and privacy. You can control everything from the iPad or the wall panel. The rooms are very clean, almost as if you are the first person to stay in that room. The bathroom is gorgeous and spacious and has great lighting and views of the city with floor to ceiling glass. The beds are SO COMFORTABLE, as are the pillows and down comforter. The bar is fully stocked with liquor, snacks, glasses, ice, fridge. The room is also stocked with a yoga mat, yoga block, and workout equipment. Plenty of closet space everywhere!\n\nThe Service\/Concierges  - Impeccable service! We booked this trip extremely last minute. The manager's name is Nathan, and him and his team are like no other. There were several restaurants we wanted to dine at but they were full booked on Resy and Open Table and we were not able to get a reservation. We sent our list of favorite restaurants to concierges and they were able to book us 2 dinner reservations at exclusive restaurant at a few after hours drink spots. The doormen and valet are extremely welcoming and polite. The hospitality is incredible and everyone is willing to make your stay more enjoyable.\n\nSpa\/Gym - Equinox is known for their upscale LA style gyms. They have a beautiful clean gym with everything you can imagine. The spa is gorgeous and provides a full list of any service you could need. Even Cryo which we did the first time we stayed and it was fantastic.\n\nDining - Electric Lemon is the perfect bar and lounge. It's dark atmosphere and beautiful bar make it perfect for a first date, or a date with you significant other. Comfortable seating with great service. The drinks are all very tasty and made well also! When it's not too cold, you can have drinks at the outdoor lounge near the pool. Perfect view of the NYC skyline and the Vessel. \n\nLocation & Convenience - Equinox's location is perfect, right in Hudson Yards. It's easy to get an Uber to Taxi. Right next to the hotel in short walking distance there is a Starbucks connected, The Vessel which is a perfect Instagram moment, and one of the most gorgeous malls with every store you can think off. There are food trucks right down the street and a quick walk to the Highline an many other restaurants. \n\nBottom Line - Look no further if you are looking for the perfect NYC getaway!","travelDate":"2021-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We ended us choosing the Deluxe River View Room.\n\nMy partner stopped at the hotel earlier in the day to drop his bag off prior to our check-in so that he didn't have to bring it to his office and the hotel had no problem with this.\n\nUpon check-in, we were both asked to provide our proof of vaccination (which made us both feel safer) and were given a run-down of the hotel amenities and offerings before heading up to our room.\nThe room was quite spacious and well designed in typical Equinox fashion. We were both happy with the blackout shade feature since we are sensitive sleepers.\n\nFor the two nights we ate at Electric Lemon after long days at the office. We found the food, drinks, and service to be top notch with our favorites being the Beef Tartare, Dry Aged Duck, and Pumpkin Cheesecake.\n\nWe did a combination of both room service and Electric Lemon for breakfast. We especially liked being able to order room service on the in-room iPad and select the time we liked to have it delivered.

Booking was easy and prior to booking was given a rundown of the benefits of Cryo and how it would help my injury. This is one of the sleekest Spa's I have ever seen, I was checked-in and brought to the locker room to change into my robe then into the chamber.

The iPad request center is the answer to request fulfillment in an efficient manner, the employees who fulfill requests are present, efficient and unobtrusive, it is how experiential service should be delivered in the 21st century.\nLinens on the bed and in the bath are exceptionally high quality with a beautiful finish, amenities are plentiful and presented in bulk, not those wasteful mini-bottles.  The shower stall is spacious, with three different spray heads, and the window into the guest room from the shower emits light when the switch is activated.\nThe lounge had a great vibe on a Friday evening, our drinks were well crafted, the service was efficient and discrete.\nSaturday brunch was delicious, well prepared and served.  Saturday evening in the restaurant, which had a good buzz we relaxed and enjoyed our meal and service.\nSunday breakfast was room service, ordered on line, delivered at the agreed time.  The server was skilled and set breakfast in the room from an insulated delivery pack which he carried into the room.  Coffee was hot and robust, the sunny side up eggs were liquid when cut in, the way they should have been.\nCheck out was as efficient as every other experience we encountered during the weekend and we are back at this hotel on December 16th, just the way its supposed to be.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

La habitaci\u00f3n del hotel es realmente grande, siendo la categor\u00eda m\u00e1s baja donde me aloj\u00e9, y cuenta con una hermosa vista. La ubicaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n es perfecta y muy limpia en comparaci\u00f3n a otras zonas, si bien no queda muy cerca de Central Park, Nueva York es una ciudad para caminarla entera, de manera que no ser\u00eda problema.

Y por \u00faltimo, las instalaciones del hotel como la pileta y el gimnasio son incre\u00edbles.\n\nAhora menciono lo negativo. D\u00edas antes de viajar, avise que uno de los motivos por los que me alojar\u00eda en este hotel (que no es nada barato) era para celebrar mi cumplea\u00f1os, me dijeron que lo iban a tener en cuenta, sin embargo llegado el d\u00eda no recib\u00ed ninguna \u201csorpresa\u201d y ni un saludo, y me refiero a algo tan simple como una nota al menos. Tuve la suerte de alojarme en otros hoteles, de la misma categor\u00eda, donde cada noche al regresar a la habitaci\u00f3n me esperaban con una nota y alg\u00fan snack agradeci\u00e9ndome por la estad\u00eda. Son simples detalles que un hotel, donde una persona quiz\u00e1s se esfuerce mucho para poder alojarse en ese hotel, que al menos el hotel deber\u00eda tener m\u00e1s contacto y atenci\u00f3n para con sus hu\u00e9spedes y hacerlos sentir algo especial.\nOtro punto negativo es la limitada carta de room service, donde para el almuerzo o cena solo contaban con cuatro o cinco platos (turkey s\u00e1ndwich, un salm\u00f3n, un filete, ensalada cesar , una hamburguesa y pollo).

I've been an Equinox member for about 7 years and was excited to finally stay at this hotel.\n\nHad the opportunity to visit in late October, taking advantage of their 3 nights for price of 2 offer. I booked through my credit card which gave me free breakfast for 2, late check out and a $100 credit to use at the hotel. \n\nLet's start with the good - the rooms\/view are great. Small yes, at 400 square feet for the entry level rooms, but the furniture\/layout makes it feel larger than it actually is. The views are amazing as well. Bathroom\/shower is super nice with Grown Alchemist products. The room also has a yoga mat and various other gym\/wellness products (most need to be purchased at an additional cost). \n\nThe Equinox Hudson Yards gym that guests have access to is amazing as well, though busy\/crowded most of the day. I do wish they gave hotel guests access after regular business hours. Hotel staff for the most part are very friendly as well. \n\nNow the not so great - these are issues that I'd expect from a 3-4 star hotel, but definitely not a 5 star hotel that charges around $1000 a night. \n\nBiggest issue that I had was that 2 days in a row after housekeeping had cleaned my room, both the comforters were SOAKING wet near the top. Not damp, but literally soaked. The first day it happened, I assumed it was an anomaly and it was just a one off. I did let guest services know and someone did come in and apologize, told me he would let his manager know and that it would not happen again. \n\nWell, next day the same exact thing happened again. This time I asked to speak with the manager who came to my room and examined the comforter and agreed it was soaked and not something that should happen. He apologized and assured me it wouldn't happen again (never did get to see if it happened again as I checked out the next day). The hotel manager did call me as well to apologize and gave me half off of one night, which was a nice gesture, but didn't change my mind from feeling that something like this should not be happening in a 5-star hotel. \n\nOther minor issues - the first day I ordered in room breakfast, I ordered some coffee. No mug or spoon was sent and I had to use the ones already in my room. \n\nAnother issue - on my checkout day, I was assured a late checkout at 4 PM due to my credit card benefits. The night before I confirmed this in person with the front desk and he told me I was all set to check out at 4PM the following day since they did have late checkouts available. Well, the next day around 2PM I try to get back to my room from the lobby and my key would not work in the elevator (you have to swipe to get the elevator to work and to your room level). I went to the front desk, the concierge looked up my account and told me that they had me scheduled to check out at 2PM and that's why my key was not working. After telling him I had confirmed the night prior that I was set for the 4PM checkout, he did apologize and reactivated my key. \n\nThere were water\/coaster stains on the table in my room, and some dried up stains\/wear on the couch\/sitting area in my room. \n\nAgain, I don't feel things like the above should happen at a hotel of this class. \n\nFinally, in terms of food - it was solid, nothing special, and way overpriced. Had breakfast not been included in my stay I would not be eating at the hotel. Price for avocado toast, 2 eggs, coffee, and a smoothie was close to $100 after tip+fees. Even for NYC that is crazy expensive pricing. \n\nOverall, I felt that the hotel was nice but still very rough around the edges and not the quality you'd expect from a hotel in it's class and the price you pay. Unfortunately I do not think I will be back, which is a shame because I do like Equinox as a brand\/gym, but don't feel their hotel is up to par. I would likely stick with the Four Seasons if visiting Manhattan again.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

The hotel is charging rates similar to Four Seasons and the Edition yet it provided smaller rooms whilst maintaining raving reviews, so I was curious. After my three night stay, I understood why.\n\nThe level of service is amongst the best in the USA. The staff were super friendly and took care of my deliveries which happened to arrive even before my check-in date. You can see there\u2019s a high level of care in every step of the service from assisting you with the luggage on the ground floor all the way to the breakfast service.\n\nThe room whilst it could be argued that it\u2019s a bit on the smaller size for similarly rated hotels, it was ample. I couldn\u2019t think of how extra space could enhance the experience any further. It was simple, yet high quality and high tech. The minibar items were probably one of the most exciting bit of my stay. I\u2019m not going to spoil you why but if you\u2019re into fitness and\/or wellness you will be in love. There\u2019s also a drawer with items dedicated for in-room stretching.\n\nNot much needed to be said about the fitness facilities. It\u2019s top-notch. The outdoor lap pool has one of the best view in the city overlooking the Vessel. My only comment with respect to the gym\/pool\/spa is that it feels relatively disconnected from the rest of the hotel as far as the experience is concerned. The gym here is part of the Equinox club\u2026 or to be more specific, the stay at the hotel grants you full access to the Equinox club. \n\nIt could be a little confusing for guests (like me) who had never been a member at an Equinox gym and I felt if there was a step that could get you acquainted with the club in a more organized way it could be a lot more helpful.\n\nThe lobby is also a little awkward. It doesn\u2019t make you feel \u201ccomfortable\u201d or \u201cwelcome\u201d as it feels more like I\u2019ve arrived in an office building. Definitely an area where they can improve for sure.\n\nLocation wise, it couldn\u2019t get any better. Within a walking distance you have a Wholefoods market, a Walgreen, Blue Bottle Coffee, and a lot of food stands after hours at night. The Highline is only 2 mins walk away. For those on foot, there\u2019s a metro station next door which directly takes you to the grand central station.\n\nI would definitely come back for my next stay in NYC.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

I would say that New York luxury hotels are a particularly weak crop compared to the other major world cities.  Not sure if it's just lack of labor, or just old facilities, or lack of tourists, but it is what it is.\n\nThe equinox is the newest of the bunch and I definitely value modern fixtures and fresh looks.  The rooms do not disappoint, automatic shades opening up as you first enter the room was a beautiful touch.  The accents in the bathroom and around the bedroom were clearly well decorated as well.\n\nFor a new hotel, I must say I was impressed with a handful of the staff who seemed to be seasoned veterans.  Norman and Andy in bell were so nice and on the ball, and helped keep good care of my new car for which I used their great parking service.  I must say the equinox is great if you have your own car since they have their own private drive and garage, an advantage over every other NYC hotel.  Allie was also very sweet at the front desk, and gave me good advice on my cell phone before I arrived on how to best approach the hotel and she was nice upon check out as well.  There was an issue with the AC in the room and an engineer was sent within minutes and fixed the problem also within minutes.\n\nSo a lot of positives for sure,  but there is still some room for improvement.  For one, it's great being an equinox hotel that there is a flagship equinox gym at your disposal but I can't help but think they could section off a more private area of the gym for hotel guests only, and if someone needs more machines or whatever, they can go to the public access one.  The public nature of it just doesn't really befit a 5* hotel and hardly allows one to decompress while working out.  \n\nSecond, there are a couple green staff around the building still.  I won't mention names but there was a lady with some serious attitude issues upon check out and a younger gentleman who needed rescuing from an older vet when I asked about the best way to get my car out upon checkout.  Also, for the first time in my experience at a hotel over 1k\/night, I was recommended to bring my own luggage down from the room even after I asked them to get for me and bring to my car.   \n\nI really debated between 4 and 5* for this review but 4 felt too low, but admittedly a perfect rating also feels too high, and would say it's more like a 4.5.  That said, I will definitely return as there is nothing that can really compare with the whole package that Equinox offers in the city.\n\nAlso, must say that the location is top notch, easy to get downtown, but also close enough to midtown and uptown.  And close enough to the west side highway to make a clean get away from the city all together.  Very convenient.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

He reached out personally to me to apologize and took care of me immediately.  \n\nJeff, THANK YOU.  I received my package and you truly did not have to do that.

We had a river view and it can be quite mesmerizing to watch all the activity on the Hudson.   The evening meditations and morning rituals which are part of the hotel's channel were very well done; the room includes a mat and yoga blocks to use.  I loved the scented bath products, super comfy bed and the overall room design.

We utilized the gym and took classes and  got a chance to enjoy some of the outdoor space which can be a rarity at a NY hotel.  We did not use the pool which was busy all day.

We have stayed at various places during our NYC visits including Mandarin, Plaza, Four Seasons, but decided to try this out as the appeal of a \"fitness & health\" inspired hotel plus wanted to be in the Hudson Yard area.  \nYou do have to take an elevator to 25th floor for checkin and switch to different set to access rooms, but really wasn't a big deal.  Hotel is located right across from Hudson Yards which boasts numerous retailers and dining (both casual and sit down).  The vessel is also right outside.\n\nElectric Lemon, the hotel's restaurant is a central spot for pictures and when we dined there, it seemed to be full of \"influencer\" types all vying for a picture in front of the massive head structure.  \n\nStaying at this hotel give you access to Equinox gym (which is accessible from the hotel elevator banks).  If you're not familiar with Equinox, it is one of NYC's chicest and largest gyms.  You can also take any of their many fitness classes by reserving a spot thru the concierge, which we did.\n\nWe also utilized the spa and took advantage of a last minute cancellation.  Otherwise, spa is only open limited hours so highly recommend making a reservation in advance.  My teen son and I also tried the \"cryotherapy\" which was cool but for most part, it's probably a gimmick and for the hefty $60+ for 3 minutes inside a freezer, it's a one and done experience for us.\n\nThe rooms are very sleek and as we had our teen son with us, we opted for a suite and requested a rollway bed (which is available for $100 per day).  Even with rollaway our suite was more than roomy and still had a separate sitting area with a sectional couch.  \n\nBreakfast is available by room service only (or perhaps this is b\/c of covid).  But pretty efficient in that you can use the tablet in room to preorder and set the time of delivery.  The food at this hotel, be it room service or Electric Lemon are all towards a healthy concept.\n\nMetro line is steps away, but location is such that if you don't mind walking its an easy walk to Times Square or Chelsea.  \n\nTip - if you're looking to check out \"the edge\" located in hudson yards, if you have a wells fargo account, go to their website for a significant discount for tickets.","travelDate":"2021-08","tripType":"NONE"}

Kind of odd  layout. Closets that make no sense . No iron but a steamer which we used a lamp to hold our garments . The room decor actually feels outdated already but it also has modern features in light and shade controls. A lot of equinox products to purchase. The biggest problem is the bed it's very hard and uncomfortable.  Did not get a $1500 a night sleep. Did not use the gym  facility or pool but they look fantastic.

I would rate it Very Good but not Excellent. I stayed here one night in a top level suite overlooking the Shard. \n\nThe suite was nice (certainly liked the cherry-chocolate cupcake on arrival) and decorated well, but there were definitely some things it could have used, such as a bar of soap, a plastic bottle of water to take to the gym or outside, and I woke up with nightmares from the thick duvets they use instead of sheets and blankets.\nTo use all the space in the bedroom for floor to ceiling windows, there is zero place anywhere in the bedroom to put any of one's belongings out of sight. So the closet is really in the living room. There is a closet opposite the bathroom but there are no shelves there. They could easily fix this by putting some shelves in that closet or to the side of the bedroom TV which is dead space and could use a door and some shelves. Even at the bedside there is no place to put anything in a drawer.\n\nI knew enough to book dinner at the Electric Lemon restaurant but I didn't think I'd need to make a breakfast reservation. At check-in I was told they would try to get me a table. Of course they did but a hotel guest, especially with breakfast included in the Amex FHR rate, doesn't want to know that the restaurant is fully committed for breakfast and will try to get me a table for one person. They need to arrange priority for hotel guests with their restaurant. I also felt the restaurant needed a non-meat protein item for breakfast such as smoked salmon.\n\nThe biggest problem here are the elevators. There are only 2 elevators for a hotel with 15 flights and over 200 rooms. Then there are 2 elevators that go from the street level to the lobby level but they pass the gym and spa, and almost always stop on those floors. It's very annoying, especially on the weekends or in the mornings at checkout time when the place becomes a zoo. Any place rated as Excellent would have a better elevator situation.\n\nIf you're a hotel guest, you have no priority at the pool to get a lounge. It's crowded there on weekends and I found it very non-relaxing to be there, although it's a great social scene for watching beautiful people if that's your thing. You obviously don't come here to swim in the somewhat smallish outdoor pool (the water was a bit cold too) because it's full of people standing around with their drinks in hand. The indoor pool is fine but you need to know to bring a swim cap or you'll get booted back to the hotel to get one from the concierge. The only quiet place here you can read a book is in your room. Even outside at the pool level on the sides away from the pool you have techno music babbling nonstop. \n\nThe health club is very large but in certain ways small; just one Smith machine for the whole place and no stretching machine. The spa had no wet sauna; a one hour massage came to over $300 with tax and tip. I thought that was pretty darn expensive and the spa itself is nothing except a small waiting room with some water in it (and a dry sauna in the locker room). The saving grace was that you are paying for a top level masseur and mine was worth the extra $100 for the session (Reuven).\nDinner at the restaurant was pretty good; you have to like the mix of hot and cold food and it comes off as spa food. Not really my thing, but what irked me was that both at breakfast and dinner the server didn't know anything about the food. The restaurant doesn't have their wait-staff try anything so they have no idea what food is actually on the plate and how it might taste. That's a really stupid thing for a restaurant to do, and it made it harder for me to figure out what to order and stuff came out that was not what the waiter described. Also they don't offer anything you can eat while you're waiting for your dinner to be prepared. At a fine hotel restaurant, you expect it to be a bit better than that, especially for what they are charging.\n\nYou are across the street from the Hudson Yards shopping mall and a convenient subway station but walk one block from here at night and you're in No-Man's Land. \nMaybe as a 55 year old person I'm not the target market here, but I certainly don't think I'd want to come here with wife and kids and I wouldn't come back (and that's something I rarely feel and say about a 5-star level hotel). In sum, the property is upscale and shishi but not particularly good value for money, a zoo on the weekends and a bit overrated. If this is the flagship for the brand and they are building more hotels, they should take this feedback and put it to good use on their next properties.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Your website brags of a terrace and multiple pools, but the terrace was closed during my stay, either due to weather, or being fully booked by outside patrons. I never got to see it, let alone experience its charms.\n\nDinner at the hotel? No ma'am. The restaurant was fully booked. Would you like to go out in the rainstorm and walk in the dark plaza looking for an alternate? No, I would not. How about room service, I ask. After all, it's 7 PM- dinnertime. \"Oh no, our room service only operates from 7 AM to 3 PM, but you can get takeout from our restaurant.\"  Are they serious? I have to go down to the restaurant, order from their super expensive menu and then take it up to my room to eat out of a bag at this five star hotel? No thank you!  Ok, can I at least get a bite at the bar in the restaurant? \"No, the bar is fully booked tonight, but if you go down and ask, they might be able to squeeze you in.\"\n\nBreakfast at the hotel? No, ma'am we do not serve breakfast or lunch, but you can order room service. OK. A bowl of oatmeal plus gratuity and a $10 delivery fee comes to a little over $30. Which I would pay to eat in a nice hotel restaurant for breakfast, but it offends me beyond belief to stay in a five star hotel that does not offer the option of breakfast at a table instead of in my room looking at an unmade bed.\n\nSpeaking of the room, it's more a showcase and store than a luxury accommodation. The cabinets are filled with overpriced offerings of equinox-branded merchandise. It's shamelessly promotional. There's almost no drawer space because the cabinetry is filled with merchandise.  The iPad in the room offers yet more shopping options. And for a deluxe room, I would have expected two sinks, better water pressure, and hot water. It was barely tepid.\n\nUpon checking in, I was informed that housekeeping would not be making regular visits and that I would have to request replenishment of towels. What's this- a luxury  hotel with no daily housekeeping? Need I make the bed and beg for fresh towels? I'd believe this policy might be Covid-related, but a good percentage of the hotel staff do not wear masks. I was told masks are optional for those vaccinated. So be prepared to make many rides in elevators with unmasked people. That aside, the lack of housekeeping is ridiculous.\n\nThe hotel is reached via elevator that leaves from a  small entry room on the main floor behind black glass.  When I arrived at this entrance with luggage in the rain, no bellman greeted me until I had already carried my bags in.  Then after arriving at the 25th floor, I  waited  in line to check in.  But don't look for a word of welcome or a place to sit. There is no lobby to speak of.  The reception area is  a narrow mezzanine that overlooks the elusive, fully booked restaurant below. You can smell the food and hear music and people laughing and having a good time, but guests at the hotel aren't welcome. It's offensive.\n\nOne last note about my stay. Upon returning from a meeting around 9:30 PM, I was eager to catch a late bite before retiring. The person at the reception tells me that the restaurant is closed, and there is nothing in the neighborhood open.  Zero. This is the Big Apple on a Thursday night.  She suggested I call Grub Hub.\n\nSo, for the hotel to claim it is five star and not offer a restaurant where you can eat breakfast, lunch or dinner, where there is no bar for guests, no terrace as advertised, no outdoor pool as shown on the website, no lobby for lounging or meeting others, where you need to take two elevators to get to your room which is not regularly serviced by housekeeping-- it's a complete sham. This is a health club and trendy restaurant in a cavernous, dark neighborhood that attracts gawking tourists by day and Ubers and limos of plan-ahead diners at night. And they have rooms for rent above it all  for suckers who pay for the brand and are treated like an afterthought.\n\nPS. Overnight parking cost $80","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We were there for a business trip and called the front desk after settling into our room to inquire about group classes and spa services available the next day and were told group classes and spa services weren't occurring because of COVID (understandable); however, upon going to the gym the next morning, it turns out group classes were happening.... This was such a shame because we had been up since 6 AM and we would have gone to yoga or spin but by that time we went, only one class was left that we had time to go to.  Rooftop pool was also closed although their indoor lap pool was open.  For a hotel that's priced at $650\/700\/night and is marketed for fitness, it would have been nice to know what services were actually available.  The fitness services miscommunication was frustrating.  We also had a somewhat funny encounter with the front desk asking where the nearest Starbucks was and no one seemed to know (not a big deal).\n\nOtherwise, seamless check-in, beautiful facilities, fast response when calling the front desk, and friendly staff.

We came here for a birthday, and the front desk reached out to me separately to coordinate a surprise for my girlfriend! The room is even more beautiful than I could imagine, with perfect lighting and shade control through the panel. The iPad in the room makes ordering anything from food to laundry service seamless. As an EQX member, I received free gym clothes laundering, which allowed me to pack lighter for the trip! It\u2019s also delivered within 2 hours of pickup, which is unheard of at a normal stay with laundry. The gym is big and had plenty of equipment. Exactly the layout you would expect from an Equinox, and it wasn\u2019t busy either weekend morning. My only complaint is I did not enjoy the pot of coffee, but that is more the fault of La Colombe roast than EQX hotel\u2019s. Lastly, the location is perfection.

For two local New Yorkers, Hudson Yards is not a neighborhood we frequent; it's very commercial and tourist-centric, not unlike the Financial District. The block surrounding the hotel was packed with tourists visiting the adjacent Vessel and mall. If you're looking for a crowd-free location with lots of transportation options, this is not the spot for you.\n\nThat said, the hotel itself was incredibly quiet and well-maintained. Service was excellent. The hotel called me a day in advance to book gym reservations, secure a check in\/checkout time, and arrange for contactless room cleaning. I also appreciated the hotel security. We were greeted at the door every time we entered the building and required to have our temperature taken.\n\nEverything during our stay went smoothly. I have never been to an Equinox gym so can't compare it, but the 4th floor gym was impeccably clean with multiple staff members on hand to assist guests and wipe down equipment. We loved our room, which was a lower cost \"city view\" but looked out onto the mall and had an angled view of the Vessel. We splurged on a massage at the spa, where we were treated like royalty and left feeling more refreshed than ever.\n\nIndoor dining has been closed in NYC, and we weren't in love with any food options in walking distance. Granted, this might be because we're foodies and know the NYC dining scene very well. We opted for restaurants a short cab ride away in Chelsea and the West Village. But if you're looking for top-quality eats, Hudson Yards is not a great neighborhood IMO. Electric Lemon, the hotel restaurant, was closed except for takeout, so we're excited to try it once it reopens in full.\n\nWe were disappointed to find out that the hotel terrace was closed for the season, so we didn't get any panoramic views of the city. Other than that, we had the PERFECT trip and literally sat speechless on the ride home. I'd do a staycation here again in a heartbeat.","travelDate":"2021-01","tripType":"NONE"}

They differentiate their image and brand values as \u201csubstance with style.\u201d They are going for premium -- through design, connectivity, technology, exclusivity. Staying there is a statement of performance \u2013 an intention of getting more out of your life. It is not about being \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201ccomfortable\u201d \u2013 it is a deliberate and rewarding choice. When considering the unique character and context of the hotel we must first understand that cities are increasingly compact, hectic and can even be argued as inhospitable. Urban dwellers are in desperate need to escape from their environments and enter a healthy, positive experience where their bodies and souls can thrive.  The \"urban-oasis\" is a place to rebalance, revitalise and regenerate \u2013 a place that encourages the betterment of the physical, mental, spiritual human condition. Subconsciously, everyday actions place a tremendous amount of stress on the body's natural rhythm. To return to a harmonious state of mind from a disconnected one it is imperative to create spaces that listen, understand and respond. Equinox Hotel is how. They have learnt from hospitality experience that due to the demanding nature of our society today is a requirement to innovate design to exceed the expectations of their clientele. In fulfilling their brand, they aspire to create a space and experience for people that is impactful, transformative and timeless by developing individual and group interactions through health-conscious reform in an appropriately cool, stimulating environment; but not for everyone. It is maybe not about the balance between fitness and hospitality, but rather guests train to be at top of our game: at work, like in life. We are urban, modern athletes participating in a luxurious boot-camp sharing with individuals from sympathetic backgrounds and aspirations. Equinox Hotel provides an experience with a space for time to extend the private moments of their lives. Well-designed luxury is synonymous with living well. The thoughtful design transforms the functional into the extraordinary through craftsmanship and innovation. The rooms go beyond the ambiance of a handcrafted environment with the attention to user experience in the form of nimbly designed moments to enhance recovery and restore the urban warrior. In addition, the personal interactions extended by Nathan and his team are tailored unique to each client. The space functions as a sustaining part of daily life. The design and programming of the hotel room and amenity experience afford the user the benefit of space and time properly designed.","travelDate":"2020-09","tripType":"NONE"}

I booked a room and the reservation call was quite helpful and noted all requests well. When i arrived i was welcomed by a happy team who was kind to give me a room facing the hudson river, The rooms are spacious, with mood lights and toilet amenities froom growth alchemist who has curated a special AM\/PM line for the chain, which I loved it peronally. 360 view of the city and so much to do within the hotel that you dont have to leave around much. I spent the evening enjoying the outdoor heated and indoor pools. Since the brand is a pioneer in fitness industry, it was much expected that there will be a a huge gym. I was wrong there a entire floor dedicated to the fitness, huge fancy gym, fitness classes and ofcourse fittest possible trainers. Not only that the pool is quite long which means i lovedit, I am a fan of long pool for laps and i can add this to my fav lap. The views from around the hotel is quite impreesive, in NYC its hard to look out and not see skyscrappers and the best part of this hotel is that it is based correctly away fron the hustle and bustle and across the road to get to the heart of nyc. You are 4 ave away but you dont even have to leave the courtyard if you dont want to as there is a HY mall across with all possible brands and high street brands, fine dinning or if you just want a shake shack, There is a mercado with multiple stalls for food and drinks with great ambience to after work, girls \/ guy sesh, family scene or a casual date. You get free access to The Vessel if you reside at the hotel with a simple check with concierge. Hotel has the dinning names electric lemon, a outside bar which was my fav and in room dinning, I dined one evening at the outside bar (always a fac with the nyc skyline view) and enjoyed my in bed in room dinning, One thing i enjoy the most isthe in the bed bfast when i travel cause thats a luxury you can only enjoy in hotels. All in all i loved this hotel away from the jungle but steps away, has everything that you need to unwind and has enough to get your heart rate up, great privacy for couples and yet enough to entertain the family and i absolute would visit again.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

The lobby , restaurant , spa and fitness gym have fantastic modern interiors that make you want to stay to see and be seen .  The gym though accepts outside membership and is frequently full.  All that sweaty people and noise around the gym makes it feel a little sweatshop-like which was not quite what you expect from a swanky 5star hotel at all .  Upon entry to the hotel room there is a long hallway with closets and the coffee maker and selection of tea and nespresso coffee . The chilled bar is heavily stocked .  There is a small living room that\u2019s dark and cozy with a dispenser for water.  Unfortunately , the water was smelly and tasted a little foul.   The furnishings inside the room are plush and comfortable and the view overlooking the yards was simply a sight to behold . The toilet had separate cubicles for the toilet and the shower and the lavatory was very user-friendly with the long counter and drawers . Toiletries come in eco-friendly set up with large pumps and an array of shampoo , body wash and conditioner in the shower .... just read carefully bec it\u2019s very easy to end up interchanging them as they all look alike .   The closet has a huge selection of gym items and some personal items for sale . It is very convenient but pricey as well so watch out , those items are not complimentary!  There is a lighted full body 3 sided mirror that made dressing up so much easier and fun ! \n\nIt is a disappointment though that with all the well thought out quality,  they missed out on some basic conveniences .... the vanity table and chair and\/or the working table for those who need to work from their room . As a result it was very frustrating to constantly try to figure where to put your personal items and work items . And doing so on the sofa is not the most conducive to finishing work and can hurt the back after long use . \n\nIt was fun to enjoy a couple of days in equinox and the nearby mall and the Vessel but I would not consider it as the best value for money .

We booked through Amex Platinum which is a little bit of a higher rate but comes with $100 Credit, Breakfast for two and a 4pm late check out.  Well worth it.  The rooms are very well laid out with great amenities.  Very comfortable with 2 double beds.  Others have talked about the rooms so I won't detail but they are great.  However I was a little disappointed and felt price gauged that with our upgrade option thru Amex all the hotel could accommodate was a Suite with 1 King Bed and we would be charged $95 for per roll away bed for our children.  This is ridiculous and should be re-evaluated.  We stay at Four Seasons Hotel all the time and they among all other high end hotels we stay at provide roll away beds for FREE.  Shame on the equinox for charging for this amenity that is standard in comparable hotels.\n\nOther positives are the use of the Equinox Club.  The hotel can book you into the group classes which I took an amazing Vinyasa Class with Melissa on Sunday at 10:15am.  The gym is fairly crowded and so is the indoor pool but it is still very nice.  Also, guest services was quick to provide anything we needed in our room.   Also, the concierge can provide you with daily Vessel tickets so that you don't need to get them in advance.  This is a nice convenience.  \n\nWe ate Sunday brunch at Electric Lemon and it was excellent!  Delicious and a nice vibe.  Being across the street from Hudson Yards Mall is great especially since the hotel does NOT provide complimentary coffee in the lobby unlike ALL other high end hotels do.  I realize the hotel is new but based on the pricing, the small amenities like complimentary coffee in the lobby is a minor thing to provide for hotel guests that make them feel special.  \nAlso the Valet costs $80 a night and you have to give them 45 minutes notice before leaving.  Fortunately, it did not take our car 45 minutes to arrive.  The Bellman are all friendly, helpful and welcoming. The hotel does feel a little cold and awkward with the elevator and lobby switch to come in and out of the hotel to the guest room and there isn't much a lobby but the room amenities, Equinox club and the people who work at the hotel make up for it.  Also, we considered bringing our dog but they wanted $250 a night which I also felt was excessive compared to other hotels that charge $100 a night.\nWe are local (suburb of the city), and this will definitely be our hotel for future 1-2 night stays in the city when we have events because the rooms and fitness club meet our needs and is an easy uber ride to many locations in NYC.  I hope the hotel will take into consideration lowering some of the price gauging items like the rollaway beds and dog fee stay.","travelDate":"2020-03","tripType":"NONE"}

The location you just couldn't beat right on the high line and walking distance to so many cool places.  I couldn't leave my review though without stressing one point which is so unusual in any city hotel, the rooms are so quiet at night and we both had 5 perfect uninterrupted nights sleep.

Fourth star is for the excellent service","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-01-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"This Equinox Hotel at Hudson Yards is a beautifully designed hotel with a staff that has received excellent training. Its proximity to high end shopping and other midtown attractions makes it an attractive place to stay. \n\nFrom the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the service was excellent. It was obvious that the staff was well trained and that is obviously a key component of what makes a hotel great.\n\nThe rooms make an excellent first impression. Some lights automatically go on when you enter the room and the rooms are a good size. But small flaws add up to detract from the stay. \n\nThere's a lot of technology built into the rooms and the entire hotel, and that's a fantastic thing . . . when the technology works. \n\nHere are the criticisms, some or all of them might be due to user error. But if they are, is the user the one at fault in a hotel room?\n\nWe had to move rooms because the heat was not working and they were unable to fix. This stuff happens and we were okay with all of this. The staff, from Front Desk folks to Engineering were very gracious and the Front Desk Manager gave us a $150.00 F&B credit which was very kind, she made it very clear that they wanted us to be pleased with the stay and that was very kind. Still, this entire exercise wasted about an hour.\n\nOur new room did not have the same view that we had initially paid for, but at that point it was more about just getting our stuff into a room and not messing around with these little points. We were still very happy with our stay and understood that any hotel, especially a new one is going to have its problems. \n\nAs our stay progressed, little pesky things added up to us being ambivalent about this beautifully designed place. From our perspective it seemed they put lots of thought and money into the design, but the function part hadn't been thought out completely.\n\nFirstly, the light switches are not backlit or illuminated so, going trying to work the lights by the bed or heading to the bathroom in the night resulted in opening the shades, turning up lights to full, etc. A little backlighting would solve these problems of course. There is an iPad that lets you control the lights as well, but that went dead after a few hours and failed to recharge in the charging station. I tried to trace the wire but it went into a hole in the wall so I just gave up. \n\nThe shower is really nice, with the possibility of using a rain shower head, a normal shower head, or a more directed spray, but you couldn't use any combination of these three things, it was an either or type of thing which seemed odd. And the biggest surprise was that the water pressure in the shower was sub par. Once again, not crucial, but another bunch of little things that added up to us being unimpressed. Towels were great.\n\nThen there was the TV. Turning on the TV gets you directly to an Apple TV. Great! And there is an Apple TV app to let you watch regular channels. Problem is, they froze and buffered constantly, making the TV viewing experience lackluster, so once again, slight disappointment delivering on a nice concept.\n\nThen we wanted to order room service, the TV has an app for hotel services but it kept on locking up when hitting the in-room dining section so we were unable to use this.  Once again, another minor disappointment and failure to deliver on a good concept. We did finally order in room dining and the food was up to par.\n\nSo, what we left with was a feeling that they tried really hard to make an amazing hotel but much of the technology and infrastructure was failing them. We discussed this as we left the hotel and as we were chatting about this our elevator doors opened and we saw 3 ladies trying to get into the spa with a key card and looking very bewildered. Once again, if the technology is fantastic but is not intuitive or fails to work, what's the upside?\n\nSo, great staff, beautiful spot, aesthetically great, food very good. If we try again, we'll definitely use the gym, spa and other services like that as these are major positive differentiators for this property. We just are unsure if we will try again. :)\n\nGreat training of a great staff of people!","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

So I've seen them all at this point. There is something special about this Equinox hotel. First off, is location cannot be understated. Its located in the brand new and beautiful Hudson Yards. When you exit any other hotel in NYC, you're greeted by a rush of taxis and pedestrians bumping into you. When you step outside the Equinox hotel into Hudson Yards, you can stand in the open spaces the have designed. Take in the views, go for a stroll, go shopping, get something to eat, all without crossing a street. this type of space is so rare for NYC, and appreciated by a New Yorker.\nthe Staff are all friendly, always with a warm welcome, looking to see what more they can do for you.\nthe rooms are outstanding. truly beautiful modern design.  the word I'm looking for is thoughtful. each little touch in the room has been designed by someone that stays in hotel, not just a fancy architect. When your toes hit the floor in the middle of the night, a very dim light goes on, guiding you to safety, or the bathroom. This is just one of the many beautiful details that have been thought of for you. Plus, a personalized note was left in my room, which i really appreciated.\nThe restaurant and bar are gorgeous and have stunning views of the city and Hudson Yards.\nI can't wait to go back!","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Wanted to see what all the buzz was about at Hudson Yards and the new Equinox. Reviews were amazing so I figured I'd see for myself. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the staff and management made us feel like they couldn't do enough for us. Dare I say that this might not be a Ritz Carlton, but there's a Ritz Carlton service philosophy that pervades this place. For that, the management team deserves enormous credit. Besides being new, immaculate and efficient, there was an aura about this place. The vibe was luxury\/hip without trying to be too hip which can cause service and design deficiencies. As our car pulled up, it was like they knew we were arriving. An impeccably dressed gentleman opened the car door and warmly welcomed us to the hotel. He immediately introduced himself, grabbed some bags and brought us into a warm and understated lobby where we were whisked by a dark blue leather lined elevator to a clean and simple registration desk where the smiling desk agent welcomed us by name (apparently the bellman radioed the desk). Black room card keys were in our hands in about 20 seconds and one of the staff escorted us to the 35th floor room overlooking the Hudson River. His brief monologue explaining Equinox philosophy about the design and intent of the room was mind-blowing! You'll have to hear it yourself as I can't do it justice. Let's just say, that when it's time to sleep, there's nothing they haven't thought of....right down to the scents and oils put into the \"nighttime shower soap.\" A simple but customized iPad controls everything in the room and when you push the \"sleep button\" on the iPad a quick series of things take place int he room to enhance the bedtime experience. If you suffer from insomnia, Equinox has the cure! I could go on and on about the food at Electric Lemon, the room amenities (very unique), the spa, the enormous fitness facility, the cleanliness, the Vessel, the incredible shopping and restaurants  at the Hudson Yards Shops, the proximity to a brand new subway station but I'd have to write a book. Here's all you have to know.... even if you can save $200 $300 or $400 by staying somewhere else, don't do it until you experience this place.

Maybe they could have told me that when I checked in.\n\nIf you are here for business there is not a suitable desk - there is a table and you have to sit on the couch and the only outlets are at the bed. So, not ideal if you are here for work.\n\nThe blackout shades are awesome.\n\nAte at the restaurant - also a disappointment. Waitress never asked how I wanted my meat cooked, burger was literally raw on the inside.  Sent it back to be cooked more and it took 20 minutes to get another burger. Also ordered a side of polenta fries (delicious) but she could have told me they *already came with the burger*?\n\nFor this price I will not be back.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Since I checked in at 5:45am (for the night before) I was able to experience this new and gorgeous hotel with no other guests around. It was definitely love at first site and every staff member along the way was kind and helpful.\n\nUnfortunately this potentially magical experience was marred by unnecessary administrative issues. Even though the client 100% paid for the room, I was told upon check-in that it was not, so I had to put down my card and pay for it. Thinking that I was going to breeze in, get my key and go to bed instead became a situation of confusion and misunderstanding - putting my relationship with the client in doubt.\n\nFast forward to the next day I have to contact someone about the hotel room and they have to contact the client and the client has to call the hotel and I have to check with my credit card and on and on and on. This over-prudence by a hotel is not unfamiliar. However, I have only experienced it in places like the Sheraton or Radisson or other hotels in a lesser category. These hotels would rather protect themselves and let the guest have to deal with the hassle of being reimbursed. \n\nThe problem with this model is that my memory of the experience could have been 3 perfect hours of heaven. Instead, I am dragged into admin hell writing emails back and forth because the hotel chose an easier path for themselves - foisting an avoidable problem onto me. It's a bigger risk than they realize since the travel agency for the ginormous law firm may think twice before booking them again.\n\nIncidentally - $658.00 is not an Authorization Hold.

The entrance and check in to the hotel are not on the same floor.  Guests need to take the first elevator to the 25th floor and then transfer to the main house hotel to your room. \n\nThe room:  Modern, clean, luxurious, and well-appointed. All the furniture is beautiful.  The washroom has a stand-up shower that is glass-enclosed.  the sink area has a large mirror and the toilet area is also glass-enclosed.  Toiletries are from Grown Alchemist, awesome brand that focuses on quality ingredients and natural wellbeing. \n\nAmenities: the restaurant and bar are great, a little on the expensive side, but high quality.\nThe gym is great, full Equinox equipment and staff.  BUT - hotel guests can only use the gym, indoor pool and terrace pool during club hours.  The Equinox club closes at 6 pm making it impossible for a business traveller, or leisure traveller wanting to get a workout, dip in the pool, or sunbathing after regular business hours.  Definitely something management needs to negotiate and work on.\n\nStaff:  super friendly.  The Equinox staff need to focus on service for hotel guests.  Many of the staff were rude, non-personable, and pretentious.\n\nOverall - great property.  Being a new hotel with 100% new staff they will need some time to work on their service standards and also how the gym can become a better feature for hotel guests.\n\nWould I stay again: for a low price, yes.  I image this hotel's room rate will go up as time goes by.  At the time of booking, the room night rate was comparable to neighbouring hotels.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

I\u2019d heard the claims about achieving an amazing night\u2019s sleep and I thought it may be marketing talk. But I slept for 10 hours straight which I rarely do anywhere in the world, let alone with jet lag. Staying there I felt a part of something. It\u2019s a new  concept and you can palpably feel that the people involved want to create something that goes beyond what is on offer elsewhere. The staff are excited to be part of something new and you feel that passion in the service and you taste it in the food.They have really thought about this. The restaurant,Electric Lemon is the best I have eaten in a New York Hotel and they do simple things well like being able to order a celery juice in the morning, great teas, good coffee - simple things but really well done and always pretty plates lots of colour and texture which is my measure of good food. I tried the infrared sauna and cryotherapy which were great. And the gym is amazing obviously being Equinox. It\u2019s ten times the size of any gym I\u2019ve ever seen in a hotel. I\u2019m not even into gyms but one day I went twice! It\u2019s the little touches like having two shower gels in the bathroom one for morning and once for evening, or having special dishes designed for winding down for sleep on the room service menu like the melatonin smoothie. Is it the finished article? No it still felt somewhat like it\u2019s finding it\u2019s feet as it has only been open a few weeks and I get the sense that there is more to come. But would I stay there again? Without a doubt it\u2019s where I will stay on my next trip to NYC. Oh and given that I\u2019ve written this and that it may be my one and only review I want to thank some of the characters that worked so hard to make me feel welcome. TJ, Andy and Eric at the entrance; Jackson and Peter at the bar; James, Kyle and Bowie in the restaurant team and the girl who made a great flat white at the first attempt despite never having heard of one; Sarah, Tara and Abad in the spa; Aaron and Ali on reception; and Chris, Philipp and Emily in management.

Walking into the lobby is disappointing; it's just an elevator bank which takes you up to a small lobby on a higher floor--not a lot of public space to relax, have a drink, do some work without being trapped in your room.  The staff were very helpful and kind but they were EVERYWHERE--like you're walking a gamut of staff people saying hi at all times.  Chill people!  \n\nThe big sell of this place is supposedly access to the gym--however, I asked for a class schedule and was given a run around--basically I'd have to go speak to the concierge and get the schedule, which is not made easily available.  There are iPads in each room and wouldn't it make sense if you could easily book yourself into a class from there? I got the distinct impression they are making it a bit hard to use the gym b\/c they don't want it overrun with hotel guests, since they have regular members as well.  In addition, the spa closed at 6--useless for a business traveler.  \n\nThe room had some cool lighting features but was average sized and not really remarkable considering the price--not a lot of character.  The room service charges were comical--hot water and lemon was $4, with a $10 delivery charge and tax and tip. Even on the company dime that is beyond the pale. \n\nI stay in nice hotels frequently for work and short story is for the price, there's nothing \"special\" here especially when the gym and spa weren't made easily available. I hope they realize that as it is convenient for all the people with new offices in Hudson Yards--for now, not worth it at all.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The pool atop the fourth floor roof was what we were most interested in, and on that, the hotel delivered.  While the pool is overcrowded with people that belong to the health club, as a hotel guest you do have access to a lovely area and since you are staying there, perhaps you have time to wait for a lounge chair.  When we arrived at peak time on a Friday afternoon there were 142 people ahead of us waiting for a text to tell them a chaise had opened up.  Unlikely to get two together, we found an arm chair and some space on a bench in the pool and still enjoyed it.  Indeed, the pool was the true highlight of an otherwise average stay.  Staff in their all white suits, or some in all black, were aloof and not terribly welcoming.  We had tried for an early arrival and were turned down - we arrived exactly at 3 for our 3 PM check in only to be told we couldn't check in because there was a photo shoot going on.  We were corralled into an area, then told to move against the wall as to not interfere with long shots from the photo shoot.    No apologies, and really staff seemed to think we should be excited to be delayed by others who were so much more important than mere guests.  This held over to being escorted to the room - the only time we saw the staff person animated was when she described the mirrors in the room were modeled on those at French fashion shows.  The hallway is plain and the room doors look like elevators.  Upon arrival a lackluster bowl of grocery store apples adorned the table at the elevator on our floor but not long afterward that had disappeared leaving the elevator and room doors to all look the same.  The room has typical amenities in a high end hotel - it was spacious, comfortable, modern - but not special.  The only way to watch the oversized television is to have a subscription to HBO, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime.  Once we realized there was no television service other than what you could log into on your phone, it was easy enough to use - but we spend some time trying to find the channels provided with the room first, before realizing there was none.  There are some yoga and exercise videos that can be accessed though, even if you don't have your own video service to log into.   The absolute lack of any art other than an odd photo in our room added to the lackluster appeal of the the hallway and room.  The elevator from the concierge to the the pool and street level operated normally but the elevators to\/from the room floors operated fairly slowly.  Decent toiletries are provided in the room and in generous, full size amounts.  Towels and robes are lovely.  The environmental controls - lights, temperature, shades - are easily controlled by the provided iPad.  There was an odd flashing green light from the ceiling that blinked all night - with the room darkening shades it was particularly noticeable.  Ultimately we put a pillow on top of the cabinet to reduce the impact.  From the 29th floor traffic was louder than similar floors in other hotels in NYC.  Being right near the West Side Highway and the helicopter launches created a fairly consistent noise.  The hotel restaurant was superb - some of the nicest staff we ran into (except one staffer - Jeff - who was the most welcoming, helpful and informative of all) as well as a very good menu of very good food, excellent service and a little bit of brightness in the decor.  Overall, for us, we went for the pool and it was worth it.  It's a terrific location too.  But if you just want a luxurious, nicely decorated accommodation around midtown, with excellent service and there are better options.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}
