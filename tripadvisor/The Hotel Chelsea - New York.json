And all I have to say is wow. They did a great job of honoring the soul of the old Chelsea Hotel while bringing it back to life in a more vibrant way, reviving a stretch of 23rd street and a neighborhood I\u2019ve taken for granted. The standard Chelsea room where I am staying is small but well considered: a generous and comfy king bed, beautiful  bathroom and period furnishings that give you a sense of the hotel\u2019s rock star pied a terre days. Hotel prices have become exorbitant and for the rate they charge they really didn\u2019t skim on any of the details, from turn down service to the little Marvis toothpaste in the bathroom amenity kit.  The dining is not terribly imaginative but assuredly delivers the classics, and perhaps more importantly brings back a buzz and people watching element that is so rare in the city these days.

At some point during the week, I must have touched the wrong subway pole because within two hours of my stay...I was down for the count. Lucky for me, the staff upgraded my room when I checked in, which worked out considering I didn't leave it for three days. The hotel staff got word that I was sick after a hilarious room service call I had with a gal named Mercedes. Soon after, there was a knock at my door...and when I answered I saw a tray of hot water with lemon and honey waiting for me. This continued throughout my stay.  I'll say one thing...if you're gonna be sick in New York City, be sick at The Hotel Chelsea.\n\nWhen I wasn't taking Benadryl-induced naps or soaking in my giant tub, I would walk out onto the balcony and watch the city work.

That being said, I'm looking forward to my next visit to the Chelsea, which I've already booked for early March 2024.

With the refurb finished, and despite some reservations about gentrification, I decided that we should go and stay over Christmas. It was expensive and towards the top of the budget so my expectations were high. But delighted to say I loved my time there and felt really at home. They were kind enough to offer us an upgrade to the Pied a Terre apartments, which really helped us have a great and relaxing stay.\n\nI really have no criticism of the apartments the beds were super comfortable and the apartment spacious and homely, but sone with style and taste. There where a few minor wrinkles that I only mention as to offer scope for making things even better: 1) There are some paint splatters on the grey\/white marble tiles, it just needs someone with a good eye to scrap them of. 2) Some of the bathroom fittings are a little poorly done (loose or away from the wall), and again a component maintenance man could fix these. 3) Brass is a nightmare as it needs polishing, in general I didn't might the patina but around the toilets and in the bathrooms it looked a little unclean. 4) The sealant around the bath in 3E is beyond amateurish, it just needs redoing. 5) The hallways could benefit from some coat storage to prevent clutter in the apartment, especially if the weather is poor you've nowhere to put wet things. 6) The lighting in the closets is a great idea, but the top shelf stops the light illuminating the clothes making it a little useless. None of this impinged on our stay and the uniqueness and history more than made up for those tiny details.\n\nNot sure how I can justify and return visit but I'm working on it. Loved it.Thanks to all the staff in the hotel and Cafe Chelsea for the warmth and hard work.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-11-24","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"To start, I HATE writing anything but stellar reviews, so please understand this is tough, but I want to be honest. \n\nThe people who work the hotel are amazing. Happy, upbeat, great service and willing to go that extra mile. Michael, one of the porters is exceptional as was Tom from the (future to open) spa. THEY, I suspect -along with all of the other great people-are what make the reviews of this hotel so great. \n\nBut for me and my wife it ends there,\n\nThe hotel is old. It has some charm and appeal, but know that it's loud, sound carries and the walls are not thick. You'll hear a lot from outside your room and for me, that really affected my sleep and experience, \n\nThe rooms are small, and while that's expected in NY, for what I paid, I can get much bigger in other parts of the city where I feel there is much more to do. It was me and my wife and there just wasn't enough room to put our clothes away. And nobody told us that the balcony we had on the room was a shared balcony with several rooms, so people could walk right by the room if they wanted.\n\nThe bathroom is big compared to the room, but REALLY wonky. Took forever to get the temp of the water right and even then, if we used the overhead shower, water ended up all over the floor. VERY odd. \n\nThe bar was nice, but the drink was awful and the server seemed like they couldn't care less about us. Not a smile, not any pleasantness. Maybe they were having an off day, but it definitely detracted from the experience. \n\nBut the real reason for writing this review isn't the paper thin walls or the wonky bathroom or even the small room. It was how dark everything was. Like REALLY dark. We turned all the lights up to their fullest and we still couldn't even see into our drawers in the closet. It was very dim and very depressing. So much so that we actually checked out and found another hotel. I've never done this before. The darkness was so depressing. I realized that I like light and airy and fun. Sadly, this hotel was none of those. \n\nSo, I am sure that for many out there reading this, the nostalgia of the old building or the great people or the antique pictures will be the allure. It simply wasn't;t for me and my wife and while I had a hard time writing this, I wanted to be honest for all those out there who may be like minded.","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There are original castings and architectural details from the 1800s. \nA highlight of the trip was having a private tour of the hotel from William, hopefully that will continue as it really enriched our experience of the hotel and solidified our decision to come back for another stay as soon as January. \nThe bed and pillows were very comfortable.

But our experience was rather disappointing. \nWe had one of the larger rooms on 10th floor which was a nice size  and I quite liked the furnishings though my husband was less enamoured. The big problem though was the lack of light. When it was dark outside the level of lighting in the room was far too low. Even worse there were no proper reading lights beside the bed so reading in bed was impossible. How was this overlooked in the refurbishment?\nBreakfast was ok but not brilliant. I thought the fruit was tainted on our first morning but my avocado toast was better another morning. \nMost of the staff were nice and friendly with a couple of exceptions. On our first morning the hostess continued talking to a colleague and left us standing at the door so in the end we seated ourselves. And finally when we left at 5am and the hotel was otherwise deserted, the two receptionists  left us to struggle with our luggage through the front door as we left rather than help us. \nOverall: a somewhat dreary experience.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

From the moment we stepped out of our cab we were greeted with incredible service. All the bus boys we met during our stay were so kind and helpful.

The renovations to the room were stunning -- the stained glass, the thoughtful fabrics on the bed frame, the gorgeous window panels. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom, the shower pressure, all fabulous. We had no idea a real draw here would be the downstairs lobby bar. We really appreciated that guests have priority (a rarity for NYC hotels!!) and while the prices were high they matched the level of service and, again, the gorgeous design and layout of the space. We had a night to remember getting dressed up and having cocktails and fries. The only potential draw back is that it does have a faint smell of cigarette smoke, but we found it charming and a reminder of all the amazing history this hotel has to tell.

Then, the same bartender from the previous visit was unable to make several different cocktails - such as a Brandy Alexander - because she either didn't know how or didn't have the ingredients.

I called the hotel twice before arriving - once to inquire about their fitness facility and the second the morning we were arriving to ask if it were possibly to have an early checkin. Both were helpful and pleasant. When we arrived, the gentleman at the front desk remembered my earlier call. We had our lunch in the bar (amazing burgers!) and our rooms were ready once we were finished and they had already arranged for our bags to be delivered upstairs. Additionally, they put our rooms down the same passage so we could be next door to each other and that small hall had a separate door to close off any noise from the main hall. \n\nLoved my room!! I booked a Chelsea room and it had a sitting room with a couch and coffee table, ample closet space, mini bar, safe, suitcase stand, extra towels and slippers. The bedroom had a king bed and beautiful fixtures including what appeared to be an old style radio. The alarm clock was also a phone charger. Incredibly comfortable mattress and bedding, perfect temperature with absolutely no street or hallway noise, it was two nights of some of the best sleep in a long time. The bathroom was spacious with robes and any toiletries one would need including toothpaste and the marble and brass was gorgeous. I had requested the Nespresso machine in room ahead of time and it was there upon arrival. \n\nThey\u2019ve done a beautiful job of upgrading the hotel while keeping a sense of its history. One of the long term residents lived across the hotel and we enjoyed a fantastic conversation with him when we were coming back Saturday afternoon. He gave us a tour of his apartment and talked of what it was like many years ago. Additionally, my friend was speaking to one of the staff members who gave him a walk of all the floors and the history of who stayed where. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to come back - I\u2019m planning to request the same room, I enjoyed it so much.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

Illogical light switch layout. Serious lack of clothes storage. No large drawers at all, so I lived out of my case for the duration. No stand for the case either. No beverage facilities in the room, which I always think is downright mean. \n\nIt is also very much work-in-progress. Some of the issues we experienced:\n\nThe hot water was a murky grey. Once run, the tub did not look very welcoming. Very hard, and no bath salts to soften it. I mentioned this on the first day. The guy said it shouldn't be like this and would send up an engineer, but this was never something that was going to sorted in a couple of days.

They comped the night and gave us $75 credit in the bar - which we appreciated.\n\nI returned to find my AC off with an error code. The control was unresponsive, so I had a stuffy night. It came on of its own accord the next morning.\n\nI had 2 very small cartons of water in my room, which were drunk and not replaced for the duration.\n\nWe all had problems with intermittent hot water in the showers, and why they had to put such a big step into the shower I know not. Could easily have been a walk-in.\n\nWe understand that it's on a semi soft opening, and that teething troubles are inevitable, but the question comes as to what one should expect from a $625 a night room. They may be \"preview\" rates, but they're hardly a bargain. Whilst they give nothing away in the rooms (and the smellies were pretty lo-rent - nothing like as nice as The Bowery), they do provide a basic Continental Breakfast in the main bar. It's more than usually provided, but there's something a bit begrudging about it. Croissants, scones, three types of berries and yoghurt. Self serve (weak) coffee, and bizzarely, a sole electric kettle that has to be asked to be filled, then boiled by customers wanting tea. No fruit juice and not even iced water (again, on request). The room is wonderful, but freezing cold and with zero atmosphere. Like eating in a library. Put some cool music on, please. \n\nThere's plenty to like. The art is great, as is the general taste of the refurb. Staff were mainly very helpful, with a special shout out to the ever cheerful Jake (who should be modelling, really) and William, who has great knowledge and passion for the building. I'm glad we stayed. It's a special place with a special vibe. I'm not likely to be returning, as the rates will go up and no doubt to more than I'm willing to pay. This place will need forever maintenance, as we say in the UK, like the Forth Bridge. Once finished, it will need starting again. Whether they can provide the experience than justifies even higher prices remains to be seen. It's certainly not \"average\" in itself, but I can't give it more than 3 stars.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The staff was great and the bar was mostly fun. The prices are attracting a not typical Chelsea clientele which is expected but these people looked like they were dressed for a golf tournament. Of course I miss a lot about old NY so I will skip a lot of gripes because they would apply to the city overall. \nBut Its weird to hang out in the lobby or bar when it feels like a library and everybody is afraid to talk very loud until they drink enough to not care. My rooms have been nice and have a timeless feel. I hope people who feel it is a meaningful and important place will be able to afford some of the room types. Rather than just the dbags and rich kidults that they are likely trying to cater to. Lobby William was an encyclopedia and very sincere in his love for the hotels history and tenants, even finding a positive slant on my take (gripe) on how lame NY's creative cla$$ currently is. His warmth and sincerity was appreciated by a few people I talked to. Cedrick was very helpful and kind. The bar staff also. \nI hope we can meet in the middle Chelsea Hotel.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It\u2019s very busy and just not great. It\u2019s a bit \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d\n- August 16 - they are still not finished. There are workmen around \/ and many floors are still under construction. I got a \u201cdiscounted\u201d rate but I would not pay more even if they were finished. \n- The hotel has a strange energy. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on it\u2026. I think it feels more like an apartment building than hotel - Reasons for saying this : staff were lovely but had a very unprofessional feel to them. Feel more like doorman? Also When eating breakfast in the morning the staff just stand around talking very informally. At one point they were discussing how they hope there won\u2019t be table service for breakfast as they didn\u2019t want to serve. Thought that was strange in front of a guest. \n- Corridors have other apartments on them \/ and their normal doors. They say very boldly \u201cTenant Occupied\u201d. I also smelt gross cooking smells \n\nIf it\u2019s your first time going to NYC I would not recommend this hotel. I would look elsewhere as much better options out there for the price. \n\nI would only recommend this spot if you need to be in this neighbourhood and no other options. Or if you have nostalgia about this hotel.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"SOLO"}
