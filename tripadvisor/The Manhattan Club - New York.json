We planned two nights in January to celebrate our son's 21st bday and I decided we should drive right in to NYC from PA door-to-door--not knowing what to expect. It was seamless! We zipped out of the Lincoln Tunnel and were there in a few minutes. \n\nWe arrived early at noon with the plan to store our luggage and walk the city before check in. We pulled right up, valet came out, and within a few short minutes we had our luggage stored, car taken stored, and checked in to wait for our room. The entire staff was super friendly and quick to service us. It was delightful! \n\nWe stayed in a 1 bedroom 2 bath suite and glad we did as the space was great--considering so many NYC hotel are like matchboxes. The main bed was comfy and we were very pleasantly surprised to see the pull out couch bed was memory foam and NOT some awful flat piece of cardboard. However, apparently the pull out sofa bed wasn't checked as there were crumbs in it and some toy cars. But within 3 minutes housekeeping was there, cleaned it up and made the bed. Then when we needed more blankets--they were there in a jiffy. The showers were hot and with good pressure. The floor was super quiet. We even brought an extra blow up single bed that fit in the suite too - for when my husband snored. LOL. We brought a small water pitcher and filled that up to keep cold in the mini fridge. Only thing is that the mini coffee maker only takes their pods. However, you're in NYC and there are cafes everywhere! I brought my tea and used the microwave for it.\n\nWe enjoyed heading to the 29th floor for the lounge each night for a drink and view. The bartender was jovial and quick to service (although not the best spot for a dirty martini--so stick with beer or wine). Our son enjoyed the fitness center.\n\nAnd even before our stay, I was nervous about driving into NYC with all the details and emailed several times with customer service from the hotel website. They responded each time within minutes answering my multitude of questions. We will TOTALLY come back to The Manhattan Club again for our stay. Highly recommend!

The first week we were unfortunately in a small unit.  There was a window, but you could barely open it, and the view was of massive pipes etc. so all we really had, was some light coming through the window (which was sandblasted I think).  I've stayed at TMC twice before, both times thinking it was lovely, but this was an eye opener.  It was not the same anymore.  I had quite a shock when I opened the kitchen cupboard, to only find a few plastic plates, cups, glasses, and the little throw away sets of knives and forks!!  What!!  I phoned and asked what was going on, and finally got some decent crockery and cutlery brought to the room.  Then heard that these rooms, I think it was second floor, were called 'Metropolitan Suites', and it was standard!  Getting wifi was impossible, so we were finally given a gadget to carry with us for wifi.  We found the staff not very helpful, and even battled with our own luggage on the day we left!  \nFor our second stay, we had a one bedroom unit with a lovely view on the 16th floor.  What a difference.  We were just back in NY from a cruise, and even though we were paying for a week, we only spent 2 days and 1 night there.  This time there was decent items in the cupboard.  We did have some help from the bell hop with luggage.  Front desk staff again not bursting with enthusiasm, and friendly and happy as with all the other places we stayed at during this overseas holiday.  \nI was really disappointed in TMC.  They have also had two hefty security deposits on hold on my credit card, and even though I've asked them to instruct their bank to remove the holds (after my bank said it was their responsibility to do do, even though they were telling me my bank should be doing it!), I still have one large hold.  They just don't seem to want to do anything themselves to remove these.\nI have always thought that this was a really lovely establishment, but this holiday has changed my mind.  The hotel is in an excellent area, has a good business centre, etc.  The one bedroomed unit was very good.  We often saw specials at the hotel, but always it was stated 'for owners', so we did not bother, seeing that we were not owners.  Is this because we had our reservations as exchanges through RCI??  \nBy the way, the 'kitchen' in the small room was impossible!  You had to bend under the cabinet to open the tap.  In both rooms, the so-called kitchen is really nothing more than a fridge, microwave, sink, few odds and ends.  \nGetting lifts can also be a daunting task, you can wait forever.  Make sure you get your luggage to the foyer very early on the day of departure, as you could stand waiting at the lift for a very long time!\nFinally, STAY AWAY FROM THE 'METROPOLITAN SUITES'!","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

At no time they, or the hotel notify us that our FULLY REFUNDABLE reservation was then going to become NON REFUNDABLE. A few days later, so over 45 days from our stay, we learned we had to travel to Seattle instead of going to NYC, so we cancelled this hotel. They refused to give us a dime of $2285.00 back.

From the moment we checked in, we were unhappy. Our car pulled up with several bags and large luggage\u2014although there is a bell hop outside, he stood there and watched as we unloaded our own bags and brought them inside ourselves; he didn\u2019t even so much as offer a luggage cart. There was no one in line at the front desk, yet we stood there and waited for someone to greet, or even acknowledge us as we looked at 5 staff members behind the front desk all talking to each other and messing with one single computer. I can understand if they were experiencing computer issues, but did it require all 5 staff members and not one of them could even look up to at least say, \u201cwe\u2019ll be with you in just a minute.\u201d \n\nFinally, Vana gestured us forward. My husband handed her his ID to check in and she claimed she couldn\u2019t find our reservation asking us, \u201cwell, when did you book the reservation?\u201d When did we book the reservation??? Months ago\u2014how do we know and how will that help you find out reservation more so than just typing in our name, email, or phone number? She finally found out reservation\u2014and handed us our keys without apologizing for the inconvenience. \n\nOur room was fine\u2014until we laid down to go to sleep. DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO PUT YOU IN ROOM 2223\u2013or any room that ends in \u201c23\u201d for that matter\u2014It is right next to the elevators and all night long we could hear the elevators going up and down. Literally, the elevator shaft is 3 feet from the headboard of your bed and you can hear everything from the mechanisms of the elevator to people talking and coming in and out with their luggage. We did not sleep at all. \n\nMy husband went down around noon today to request another room. They obliged, but then downgraded us to a room that was smaller and did not have an updated bathroom like our original room. We went back down and declined the Room explaining we were not going to pay for a nice room but be downsized and downgraded. The front desk gave my husband another room key\u2014before we moved all our belongings for a third time, he went and looked at the room\u2014again, it was smaller and did not have the upgrades that we had in our initial room near the elevators. \n\nThe last option they gave us was to completely check out, leave our bags with the bell desk, and wait 4 hours to see if they MIGHT have another room available tonight that was either better or of equal standard to room 2223. The hotel is sold out so we obviously aren\u2019t going to take the risk\u2014so now we are stuck in a room where all we can hear are the elevators and every guest checking in\u2014far louder and noisier than the streets of New York outside our window! \n\nWe will not return to this hotel and I absolutely would not recommend it to anyone.","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

There are the 2 main elevators to the hotel rooms. But there are also 2 elevators to the left of the checkin desk. There\u2019s a door to go through but also a sign to direct you. We found those to be a bit busy in the morning when housekeeping was arriving but otherwise empty. \n\nWe never went to the 26th floor for breakfast. Why?  There are so many places a 5-10 minute walk away. Broad Nosh bagels was a favourite. The Carnegie diner was also very good with HUGE portions. I didn\u2019t like the Illy coffee maker in our room but brought our travel kettle, filters and pour through funnel and just popped out to buy ground coffee. \n\nWe stayed in room 1509. Not at all outdated, very clean and comfortable and a great view. WIFI was great and we used it with no problem. This was my fourth visit to Manhattan and the other hotel rooms I stayed at were tiny in comparison. New York is an old city. So are the hotels. \n\nExpress checkout is offered. Dial 0 to reach the front desk. Tell them you\u2019re checking out and drop your keys in one of the labelled boxes. No need to line up at the front desk. Twice we got a bellman to hail a taxi for us. Easy peasy. \n\nWe loved our stay here and all the staff we encountered during our 5 night stay were friendly and professional.

We were assigned a room on 16th floor where there was renovation take place and our room with one window had a nice view of a brick wall.\n\nPro:\nGood location, you are near Central Park, Broadway, Time Square, and many Subway lines\n\nCons:\nAfter you paid $250 exchange fee, they charge you $54 a night for resort fee and it doesn\u2019t matter how many night you actually stay there.  We stay for 5 nights and they insist on charging us $381 for the week even for nights we were not there and didn\u2019t us any of their resources.  We reserved this hotel on Nov. 16, 2021 when there were NO resort fees listed in RCI so it not right that the contract was changed!  My sister stayed there a year ago and didn\u2019t have to this resort fee which includes basically nothing, they just make your room every day.\n\nIt is an old hotel and walking into our room was a time wrap back to the 1980s, all furnishings were from that era.  The hallways are dark and dingy with no windows.\n\nThe pillows stinks to the point that my wife couldn\u2019t sleep at night.  They reek of BO from many previous guests.\n\nIf you plan to leave between 9 to 11AM, you\u2019ll need to be patient.  We waited 15 minutes because every elevator was already full.  Eventually we got into elevator going up so we could reserve our place then went to the top 26th floor then come down to only stop at just about every floor because people were trying to come down.  So be prepare for that if you need to catch a flight.\n\nDishes and utensils were sparse and dirty.  We had to run a dish washing load first before using them.\n\nIf you want a pleasant visit do your research, there's probably better options.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"NONE"}

It was a nice size room for NYC that allowed us the space to store 2 bicycles.  The kitchenette was nice to have and came with popcorn and coffee!   I also had friends that stayed on the sleeper sofa for a nigh and said it was very comfortable.  \n\nThe bell men, security, and front desk team were always smiling and greeting you, and quick with any assistance.  The valet parking was convenient and $35 for 24 hours.  It you pass that 24 hour mark it goes right to the next $35 so make a mental note of it in advance.   A concierge was available in the lobby for any recommendation needs. \n\nAlthough I didn't get to use it, the fitness room was one of the nicest I have seen.  There is also a business center.  Both are on the 26th floor with the lounge, along with the ice and vending machines, and bathrooms.  \n\nThe property is across from Carnegie Hall and had eateries all over.  It's a quick few blocks to Central Park, Times Square, 5th Ave,  St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Rockefeller Center.  It was about 1\/2 hour walk to Madison Square Garden, if you don't get distracted, which is quite easy to do in NYC.  \n\nWe did have a miscommunication about the coffee service.  We were told it was free but apparently that was only at a certain time.   We went for 2 coffee's and had them separated because one was decaf.  The waiter in the room took the coffee's and mixed them up and said they were $15 to be charged to the room, and gave them back.  We dumped the coffee's because now we didn't know which was which.  Called the front desk and asked for the charge to be removed.  They would not remove it but offered 2 breakfast's.  We then had to miss other things we could have been doing to go take advantage of this breakfast which was regularly priced at $30 and consisted of coffee, bagels, fruit, and croissants.   It was not worth the time or the money had you been paying for it.   My room did not initially have decaf in it but I requested some after this incident and they did bring it.  The machine in the room is neither drip or Keurig and you have to watch a video to figure out how to work it.  I had already packed my own creamer. \n\nThey hit it out of the park otherwise, but steer clear of the lounge, unless you like $30 bagels.  ","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"SOLO"}

The description of the apartment states that there is a kitchenette equipped with a refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, coffee machine and kitchen utensils. It didn't occur to us that in the kitchen that has a dishwasher will have  no stove and therefore there is no way to cook anything except in the microwave. we find this is a bit misleading, we could not cook breakfast. It is not clear what a dishwasher is for when there is no pan or pot.\nThe hotel needs an update and adaptation to our times - no USB sockets, no sockets by the bed sides. And apart from side lamps  there is no central lighting. And turning off and on the side lamps requires getting out of bed because the switch is next to the bulb. The whole apartment is dark and not lit enough. even in the living room the light is very weak.\nWhen we got to the bed-room it turned out that the two side lamp bulbs   were burnt out, they were replaced and since then they have been blinking all the time.\nThe internet is extremely bad, it disconnects all the time and basically it is not possible to surf on Wi-Fi.\nThere are 2 smart TVs in the apartment that were not connected to the internet, after we asked, they connected them but after one day they did not reconnect .\nthere is a computer and a fax machine in the apartment - needless to say they were disconnected. \nAfter 7 nights we asked for the bed linen to be changed and then it turned out that the room did not have the card that the guest is supposed to put on the bed when he wants the sheets changed. If we hadn't asked, they probably wouldn't have changed on their own initiative at all. \nThere were evenings when they put chocolate on the bed, it was very nice but not consistent.\nThe 2 telephones in the room did not work, it became clear to us only on the last evening of our stay when we wanted to talk to the reception, we had to go downstairs.\nIn such a large hotel we would expect there to be a self-service laundry room - there is none.\nThe elevators are busy all the time, for our apartment that was on the 27th floor, we need to change the elevators on the 26th floor.\n\nThe evening before check-out after 10 nights stay, we asked if it would be possible to keep the room for an extra hour, we were told that it could not be guaranteed the night before and that we should ask in the morning of the check out. We asked, and we were told without checking and automatically - \"We don't do late checkouts\". They could have spared us the request the night before and said right away that this was their policy.\nThe receptionist at check-in was courteous and very nice.\nThe receptionist at check-out was not nice to say the least, without any pleasantries such as-\"I hope you had a good time with us\", I hope you will come again\". ...we received the invoice without an envelope.\nIn conclusion, the return did not justify the price.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We decided to order a couple of them. We called the extension on the card to order. No answer. Called later no answer but it went to a voicemail. Finally my husband called the front desk (again super nice)...but seems they were \"out of\" any of the ones we wanted..even our second choice they were \"out\".

The location is fantastic and you can walk to virtually anything you would need but its also very close to the Subway.  There are great restaurants within just a few blocks (and closer) and you will never run out of things to do.  We did have a car and we used their valet service which was fast and reasonable. The unit was very big however some of the furniture (in our case the sofa) could use some updating.  The sofa in our unit although clean and physically in good shape was not very comfortable.  Additionally we had a problem the the tub stopper in the master bath which although maintenance came up and looked at the issue was never fixed during our stay so we used the shower in the second bathroom which was nice.  The could also use some type of shelving or storage in the bathrooms as there is no place to put any of your bathroom items. Make sure you take advantage of the owners lounge on the 26th floor as it is really nice and the bartender makes great drinks although sometimes he would display a very New York attitude which although I enjoyed I think others may be put off by such an attitude.   Overall we had a great time and as long as you are not bothered by some minor issues and don't expect absolute top of the line facilities you will not be disappointed as The Manhattan Club offers good value.

Better quality, cleanliness, and value out there. I visited in September with my 19-year-old nephew. One Bedroom Suite with Two Bathrooms.

I requested a high floor and quiet room. I was allocated room 2404.\nThe window was stuck shut and they did not come and fix it. The Air Con is either On or Off and is very hard to get the settings right.  There is nowhere in the bathroom to unpack toiletries and make up and the light over the mirror is poor to. The wallpaper in the smaller bathroom is large python snakeskin wallpaper which a lot of people may not like. The d\u00e9cor and furniture are of an old style with lots of dents and scratches. \nThe rooms are a good base but not if you wish to sleep. The headboard of the sofa bed backs on to the bank of elevators and you could hear them up and down late at night and early morning. Not my idea of a quiet room ask requested. I visited reception first thing in the morning, and they could not change our room. The only option offered was to pack everything, leave it at reception, wait for a room to become free and then collect the bags and unpack. It was decided was not worth the hassle as we were only there for a short time. The manager offered a bar voucher (my nephew is underage) or a breakfast voucher (my nephew could not eat this as he is gluten free this, they were aware of due to previous communications.)\nI also mentioned that the room was not clean, and the Manager Anzhelika Masheyeva spoke to me and reassured me that housekeeping would come can clean the old dust on the furniture etc. this never happened. Not very good considering the resent pandemic we have been through.  I mentioned this to her on our last day also and she said she you get a uber voucher sent over this never arrived either.\nI requested for the sofa bed to be made up, but this was not done so I called reception, and this was rectified whilst we went out. \nThis was my nephews first trip to the USA as was hoping for better I tried to resolve the issues whilst there rather than being a key board warrior upon return but to no avail.

The small dining table only had 2 seats and again, this was a studio unit.  It served its purpose during our stay, which gave us a (GREAT) central location for our first time in NYC.    \n\nThe small kitchenette was nice to have with the 3\/4 refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot (with free Seattle Best coffee), and a small sink. We didn't need a stove as we didn't plan on cooking during our short stay in NY.   The bathroom did not have ANY counter space at all and that was an inconvenience to us as we like to spread out,  especially since there was only one bathroom.  It did have a bathtub, which I used and appreciated. The lighting in the bathroom (and throughout the whole room) was dimly lit and didn't provide enough lighting for me being that I'm visually impaired. \n\nDon't expect to walk out on a balcony here.  The glass screen door was screwed shut and wouldn't open.  Kind of a bummer but definitely understandable.  Our view from this unit was of another building across from us.. But we did have a side view of the city!! We did like the double adjustable blinds that had a room darkening effect.  \n\nThe one thing we noticed is we barely heard any outside noise.  It was so quiet considering where this hotel was located.  We didn't even hear anyone in the hallway or the elevator that was right across from us unless we were right next to the door.  \n\nI'm not sure if this room was one of the renovated rooms or not.  In my opinion, it looked tired and dated.  The room was fairly clean (don't look underneath the bed!!) but it could use some updating and it needs to be aired out!!  I did not like the snakeskin wallpaper in the bathroom or the glass dining table.  The dresser drawer was old where a small TV sat on.   \n\nWould we stay here again?  No.  We personally didn't like Mid-Manhattan but that's our own personal preference. This hotel IS within walking distance to Times Square, Central Park, many restaurants, gift shops, and so much more. So, if you're looking for a centrally located hotel, then this place would work out perfectly.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"NONE"}

There was water damage on the ceiling, the bathroom was old, and there was a door connecting to the next room that did not have a lock. I don't know how anyone could feel comfortable in this hotel. We checked in rather late, so first thing the next morning we checked out and asked to not be charged for the nights we would not be staying but they refused and charged us over $650 for the 9 hours we were in the hotel. \n\nDon't be fooled by the pictures and the price, this is not a luxury hotel, it would be more appropriate to call it a motel.","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

But Manhattan Club built in the 1920s, while West 57th built in 2009, and a far more luxurious hotel.    \n\nTwo elevators service floors 12-25.  Two other elevators in the adjacent Park Central Hotel service floors 3-11.  They need more elevator capacity, as each elevator can only hold 7 people max, without luggage.\n\nDuring rush hours, it is common for people to be left waiting because the elevator is full.  2 guests plus employee pushing the hotel luggage cart will take up 1 elevator, common at 4pm check in time.  \n\nThey do have a service elevator, but this was used to transport large hotel laundry carts, and likely dead bodies during the peak of the covid epidemic in late March 2020.  \n\nQueen bed suite, with bedroom, TV in bedroom, kitchenette-dining room, and living room, along with bathroom with new marble floor, and new marble tiled shower walls.\n\nOur 15th floor room 1509 comes with large windows in the living room and bedroom, with a French door for darkness in the bedroom, when living room in use\n\nApproximately 500 square feet, or 25' x 20' with 40\" flat screen TV on very used dresser facing living room with sofa and padded sitting chair with padded arms.  Closet next to front door has an electronic safe, which will fit a 15.7\" laptop.  \n\nKitchenette has CV1 coffee maker, 30\" refrigerator, microwave, dish washer, utensils, bowls, plates, glasses for 4.   No free breakfast provided.  Refrigerator unusually quiet for it's size -refrigerators are like dogs -the smaller the more noise they make!   Noisy dishwasher -run it only during daytime when you are out.\n\nNo stove, no toaster, no oven, no pots and pans.  With ready to eat hot food at nearby Morton Williams on 57th street, and Bread and Honey on 8th Ave.\n\nBed is very comfortable, four large pillows, two night stands with lamps, with nearly new mattresses that hasn't been pulverized by kids using it as a trampoline.  \n\nFrom the 15th floor you can just hear the dumpsters being serviced starting at 3am in the morning.  Otherwise very little street noise at night, as 56th street is a single lane street with parked cars on both sides, compared to 4 lane 57th street.  \n\nBathroom by the front door has shower and toilet and sink.  Bathroom by bedroom has bathtub, and toilet and sink.  Totally remodeled, with new white marble floor tile, and white marble wall tile on the sides of the shower.  Noisy plumbing -running the shower wakes up the neighbors directly upstairs and downstairs.  \n\nDaily housekeeping has returned after the pandemic to empty trash, vacuum the rugs, change the towels, and make the bed.  I brought 25 1dollar bills for tipping housekeeping $3 a day.\n\n26th floor has business center with 6 desktop PCs and printer, free to guests, with access using electronic room key, 6am-11pm.  \n\nDecent wifi, free to guests in rooms.  \n\nIce machines only available on the 2nd and 26th floors, a real pain.  Have to bring plastic bottles from home and keep them filled with water inside frig.  \n\n26th floor has exercise room, with multiple elipticals, stationary bike, treadmills, and TV, again with access using electronic room key.  Wife bought an exercise outfit at the thrift store to use the exercise room during the 3 days of rainstorms.\n\nStayed in the owners lounge on the top floor, with plush seating for at least 70 guests -great place to stay waiting for housekeeping to clean your room during the 3+days of windy, rainy, cold weather outside.  You need a room card key to access the bathroom.    \n\n$75 cab fare to JFK, cash strongly preferred.  Ride share somewhat cheaper, but they can't stop in taxi pick up zones.  \n\nExpect to pay $15 Lincoln tunnel surcharge, plus another $15 out of state drop off surcharge when going by taxi\/ride share to Newark airport.      \n.\n$21.50 for two people to take subway and light rail from JFK, but you better be prepared to carry your luggage and wife's luggage up and down  30+ stairs, as no escalator on final flight.    \n\nPhone next to toilet, so you can multitask even at the most inconvenient times!","travelDate":"2022-05","tripType":"NONE"}

The bed in the room was very comfortable and was a nice place to sleep every night, but the view was just a building next door with people working in it every day. The location to the subway lines was fantastic; it was a short 10-15 minute trip to just about anywhere we wanted to go in Manhattan. The room was not worth the cost of the points to trade in; we stayed in rooms in the single digits for trade points that offered more to do and better-looking rooms. The quality was terrible, and you could see the grout coming through in the bathrooms, the fans did not work, and it was always very humid in the rooms. The room size was great; we could fit our family of 4 in it without issues.

The hotel is perfectly placed to get a street hot dog from Central Park when a craving grabs you, take a short hike down 7th or Broadway to Times Square or to check out a show, or dash over to Rockefeller Center in the early morning to peek in on Hoda & Jenna (which by the way is not pronounced Yoda, people will look at you funny, then point and laugh and hurt your feelings) I think a return trip after restrictions are lifted would be in order so that we could get the full experience of the breakfast, lounge and other amenities that weren't fully available.

Still no reservation. I asked the nice concierge \"why don't you have our reservation?\" And he said it's because reservations are closed on Sundays. Seems odd for a hotel like The Manhattan Club. Anyway - it took way too long to get checked in. \n\n2. The room was OKAY. We were on the 2nd floor and it was pretty dark and dingy.  We had to call to request another roll of toilet paper b\/c they only had 1 in the room for our 3-night stay. \n\n3. The restaurant\/bar is still closed due to COVID. Most other places are open, just requesting proof of vaccination, so there's really no reason why this can't be open.\n\n4. No water in the rooms. C'mon. A 4-star hotel? At least put 1 or 2 bottles of water in each room. \n\n5. I requested more towels and it took housekeeping 2-3 hours to bring us 2 fresh towels. WHY?\n\n6. Icing on the cake: the fire alarm went off the morning of our last day (two days after 9\/11) when we were packing and getting ready to leave. It went off for ~30sec or so. Many residents on the 2nd floor were standing in the hall wondering if we needed to panic. Lol. When the alarm turned off, somebody eventually came over the intercom to inform us that it was just a drill. Why would you let us know AFTER the fact? It makes no sense! \n\nOverall, we won't be back. Too many other places to stay in NYC.","travelDate":"2021-09","tripType":"NONE"}

I expect a one time housekeeping fee which is more common with RCI exchanges now.","travelDate":"2020-10","tripType":"NONE"}

{"helpfulVotes":4,"locationId":99321,"title":"Fantastic Location","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-07-12","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"Due to a family emergency, my mom and I flew to NYC with very short notice. Because of COVID-19, not a lot of people were traveling here and we were able to book a two week stay at The Manhattan Club using timeshare RCI points.  I have family in NYC, therefore my family visits the city frequently. We stayed in a 1-bedroom suite (sleeps up to 4 with sofa bed) from June 20th to July 3rd. We advised we would be late checking-in (close to midnight).  Thankfully with the 24-hour front desk, we had a smooth check-in!\n\nPros: Location!, size of suite with kitchenette, Manny\u2019s car service to the airport (LGA), friendly doormen\/security team, mostly friendly housekeeping staff, 24-hour check-in. \n\nCons: service fee, not remodeled\/dated room\/floor, unavailable amenities (not the hotel\u2019s fault)\n\nThe location of this hotel is quite amazing and it\u2019s absolute best feature. It is within a 10-minute walk to many landmarks in central\/midtown Manhattan. Grocery stores are within walking distance. This was convenient for our long stay to pickup some basics (yogurt, milk, drinks, cereal, tea&coffee) especially since the hotel\u2019s food service was non-operational. The hotel is conveniently close to the subway trains (which at the time of this review were not crowded, sometimes we had an entire car to ourselves).  Trains were fairly frequent, the most we waited was 15 minutes.  Most stations let you know when the next train will be arriving.  Download the free NYC Subway app to assist you with schedules and best routes.  Most people wore masks. A few didn\u2019t. Take the subway to Brooklyn. Walk to Brooklyn Bridge Park for a beautiful view and then walk back over Brooklyn Bridge to see the spectacular bridge architecture and NYC skyline. If you\u2019re really adventurous take the subway to City Hall\/Brooklyn Bridge and walk over Brooklyn Bridge to Brooklyn then walk back over Manhattan Bridge to Chinatown. \n\nThis hotel is steps from Central Park.  I was only able to visit and stroll through the park only a few times during my stay, but it is a must see if you\u2019re staying at this hotel (and since the gym is closed!). Because of COVID, the park roads were closed to traffic so runners, walkers, and cyclists could spread out.  This made the park even more special by stepping out of the urban elements and into tranquility.  There are Citibike and bike rental shops nearby if you\u2019re short on time and\/or you want to see more of the park. \n\n\u201cService\u201d Fees \/ \u201cResort\u201d Fees \/ \u201cLuxury Tax\u201d of $54.51 per night is ridiculous, but somewhat typical for timeshares. We stayed 13 nights using more than a years worth of RCI points, paid a reservation fee, and then these service fees.  Totaling it all up, it is overpriced. We only decided to stay here to exhaust our RCI points, because we would lose them at the end of the year.  The lounge, business center, and gym are all closed.  The manager said the fees covered the internet and 24-hour security team.  There were not a lot of guests staying so we had no issues with waiting for the elevators. It seemed we were the only ones on our floor until the last few days of our stay. We were on the 14th floor which took us back in time to the 90\u2019s. It is definitely ready for a facelift. I would not refer to the rooms as luxurious or elegant as the website claims or as some of the photos show.  The whole suite could use an overhaul. The wallpaper was peeling\/lifting on most of the walls. Neither bathroom had exhaust fans. Both bathrooms\u2019 showers had drain issues. The maintenance team was able to fix one, but not the other for whatever reason. Which I advised again upon checkout. There was a tub\/shower in one bathroom and a stall shower in the other. My mom appreciated having the stall type shower since she is older and didn\u2019t feel safe stepping over the tub. All that being said, the suite was spacious for a NYC hotel, clean, and very comfortable for the little time we spent in the hotel. The size and two bathrooms are perfect for families. Having a kitchenette was very convenient. It had a good size refrigerator, small microwave, small sink, and dishwasher.  It also had plates, cups, glasses, silverware, small utensils, single-serve coffee maker, and an ice bucket.  The room had an iron and ironing board, a safe, hair dryer (inconspicuously placed in the living room dresser bottom drawer), two luggage racks, and alarm clock.  My mom and I are fairly neat and prefer not to have daily housekeeping. The lovely housekeeping staff would supply us with extra supplies as needed when we saw them in the hallway.  We had them come once in the middle of our stay to freshen the room and linens. \n\nWe had a north facing room with a scaffolding\/city view. It seems they are doing an exterior facelift as there is scaffolding up on at least two sides of the building. There was road construction on the corner of 56th and 7th Avenue. Only one morning we were awakened by jack hammering at 7am! If construction is still going on, you may want to ask for a room further away from this corner. \n\nSince my flight home wasn\u2019t until 3pm, I asked for a late checkout. They offered only a 1-hour extension and advised it would be an extra $25(?) an hour to stay any longer than that. AND because of COVID-19, we were not allowed to wait in the lobby.  But, they did allow guests to stand and wait directly outside the lobby doors.  I realize the rooms need cleaning, that they may have limited staff, and maybe some other unknown to me reasons, but with the exorbitantly high service fees, and all the limitations\/restrictions; at minimum the hotel could give some concessions back to their patrons for a better, \u201cluxurious\u201d experience (extended checkout, remodeled room, etc.). \n\nWe used the hotel\u2019s recommended car service to the airport (LGA). Manny was very nice, accommodating, and competitively priced. His 6-person black SUV was immaculate. I highly recommend him.  We had used Uber\u2019s car service on arrival. It was a terrible experience for nearly the same price. \n\nThings to work on:\nAdd USB outlets to lamps and\/or wall outlets. Being an internationally visited city, it is expected. \nAdd an electric kettle and a toaster. These two appliances would be very convenient for long stays and those with families. \nInstall exhaust fans in the bathrooms. \nRelax checkout times minimally during the pandemic and\/or as long as waiting in the lobby is not allowed.

We enjoyed our own wine & cheese happy hours b4 heading out for the night. Flat screens in L\/R and B\/R.  Bed was comfortable and there was a pullout sofa if we had children or guests.

It was less than thirty minutes from reservation to cancel request. \n\nThe Manhattan Club refused to cancel and return my money. Hot wire refused to return my money unless I agreed to accept the money in credit for another Hot Wire use in the future. \n\nThe insurance company Aliance (spelling) Global had conditions that I did not meet unless I agreed to lie about the reason for my cancellation. \n\nThe reason for my immediate calcellation is that the Manhattan Club is from previous experience, a toilet, with management that equals the toilet description. \n\nThe Hot Wire on-line ad was deceiving and the Aliance Global cancellation insurance was a total fraud.

Traveling with young children we often don't want to sit down in a restaurant for dinner, but instead return to the room to relax.  Within 2 blocks of the property is a full service supermarket (next to Carnegie Hall) with hot food bar and delicious deli\/bakery.  You can find everything you need.  The hotel provides in room coffee & tea daily w\/ cleaning.  We can wake and feed the kids before heading out for the day.  It's very quiet (have never heard neighboring guests).  For added convenience, there is a Wash n Fold 1 1\/2 blocks away and a brand new TJ Maxx store 2 blocks away (you never know what gets left at home).

Semplicemente accoglienti con una mega doccia  (tutto in marmo) e una vasca per rilassarsi. Abbiamo girato a piedi nella City vedendo tutto.

The hotel is very nice and we were on the 19th floor which helped defeat the din of the NYPD and NYFD sirens which howled all night.  \nCarmi Spiegel, the Chief Concierge, really helped us a ton as he gave us his \"NY Subway 101\" course and soon had us riding the subways like we had a clue what we were doing and where we were. He also pointed out to us the fact we could get \"Senior\" tickets by going to the attendant and buying them which made riding the subways very cheap indeed.

We never had to call for any problem, ever.  We had a small kitchen in the room with a table and chairs for eating our breakfast.  We also had a sofa and chair in the tv area.\n\nThe best part was the bed and bedding.  It was the most comfortable bed and pillow I have ever slept on.  I wish I knew the brand and model and I would order one for me as getting a sound sleep has always been a problem for me and wasn't while at the Manhatten Club.\n\nI can only say the price was very reasonable, the room was spotless, and service incredibly friendly.  The location is one block from the subway to almost anywhere.  Much of the city is walkable from here.  Times square is just blocks away but removed and a much quieter less hectic atmosphere surrounds the Manhatten Club.  \nThe only suggestion I would give is that they are quite lacking in shelving in the bathroom and our toiletry kits had to go on the floor.  A small shelf or table would be a big improvement.  Otherwise the towels were soft, the closet had beautiful robes for our use, water pressure was always good.

The Club is ideally located across the street from Carnegie Hall, a 15 minute walk to Time Square and Broadway, a 10 minute walk to Central Park, 40 minutes to the Guggenheim, 10 minutes to MoMa, and if you are up to it, a 45 minute walk to Chelsea Market and the Whitney.  The start of Restaurant Row is 5 minutes away.  Lincoln Centre (TKTS, for discounted Broadway tickets is 10 minutes, Whole Foods 10 minutes, etc. etc. etc.  In other words, walk everywhere, and take the subway (5 minutes away) only occasionally.  Remember that the Manhattan is a boutique hotel and not a \"resort.  The rooms are large for a hotel room, but have limited facilities - a microwave and a bar fridge make it really only suitable for breakfasts (the continental breakfast buffet on the 26th floor is $20.00).  But why eat in when there is so much food of every ethnic variety, only steps away ?  There is a nice lounge on the 26th floor with complimentary tea and coffee and cookies at a specific time in the afternoon.  The front desk was very accommodating in our request to change rooms.  The \"renovated\" ones were small and it was impossible to get into and out of the queen bed from one side.  The \"unrenovated\" room is larger and better laid out.  There really is no difference between the two rooms other than decor, but importantly in the layout.  Each room is slightly different in its layout, some larger than others.

Additionally, and this can't be fixed by the hotel, we were on the 14th floor and traffic noise was noisy.  Lots of horns and sirens but you would hear this as most of the hotels.

Let me start by saying I would certainly stay here again. The location is awesome-1 block off Broadway, steps to Carnegie Hall, 3 blocks from Central Park, multiple subway stops nearby, the list goes on. Our room had a partial kitchen (small dishwasher, dorm size fridge, & microwave), one bedroom & 2 bathrooms-crazy for NYC!! We seldom heard other guests & even then, it was just that they were in the hallway. I  cannot speak to the bar area as we never actually went there for an adult beverage. We did check out the \"grab & go\" breakfast & both wondered why anyone would pay that much money when there are many options nearby (including markets to purchase your own food\/meals to eat back in your room). Why, you wonder, am I only giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. First, even though our room (on the 16th floor) was well maintained & all furniture, etc was in excellent shape, it wasn't very comfortable. Most pull-out sofa\/sleepers are not comfy to sit on & this one was no exception. The bed was far too hard for either my spouse or my taste while the pillows offered no support after about 5 minutes. As this is an older building, electrical plug-ins are pretty rare. One way to work around this would be to have lamps that include a charging station\/plug-in on the base as I have seen at many hotels. I ended up having to charge my laptop in one of the bathrooms each evening. This resort is also listed as having a concierge on site. I can honestly say every time but one when we either walked by or intentionally went to the concierge desk, there was a sign saying nobody was on duty  regardless of the time of day. The one time my spouse actually found someone there, he asked about taking a bus tour. He was directed to the rack of brochures & told to have fun. Seriously, would have been nice to have been informed about the difference in the companies, where they picked up, etc. Aren't those the very reasons to have a concierge? Good thing we had planned much our trip prior to our arrival or we would have been SOL to have any help. The final reason for a removed star is the foolish daily fee. Now, we knew when we booked this location that the fee was part of the deal. They also reminded us at check in about the fee. What we got for that fee ($54-ish PER DAY) I couldn't tell you. We did get daily housekeeping service that was not needed and was inconsistent from day to day. Still a great stay for us.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

On a less crowded day, you could walk there in 5 minutes. However, if you're looking for proximity to Time Square, you may want to look elsewhere. It was worthy of a cab ride for us but I guess that really depends on how much you are willing to walk.\nPrice-wise, I would say the price of the room per night is very reasonable. Like I said it's a great room, with a great staff, and even a great accidental view! There is one downside in my opinion. The cost of breakfast or even coffee was particularly high considering it looked like nothing more than what you would get for free at a Hilton.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend staying here again.

The hotel had an old feel to it, but it was not bad. Our room was spacious with a comfortable master bed and sofa bed. Kitchenette was small but had basic stuff.  Wifi service was good throughout. The room service staff was friendly, but we were always short of toilet paper rolls and extra towels despite several reminders. The bathroom was way too small, most of the stuff had to be kept on a small table outside the bathroom. \nWe had trouble with a bathroom door lock that had to be fixed and took the staff 4 days to finally sort the issue. The front desk staff were mostly nice except one lady who was really not there to help us and had a damn unfriendly tone and demeanour.

The elevators are quite bad, 50 years behind the times. They remind me of elevators in old European hotels. They are too small and the wait can be considerable especially in heavy traffic hours.

Firstly, the hotel is in a GREAT location (two blocks down from Central park and across the road from the Carnegie Hall and the W57th Street Subway station is less than two minutes from the front door). However, there are some sticking points. Number one is that, although we had a junior executive suite, it was really not that big. It would have been find for two of us, but having to put up the sleeper sofa each night took up a lot of room. Number two, the bathroom (and especially the bath) was way smaller that expected, the \"full marble bath\" depicted in their photo gallery is somewhat misleading and ended up with us being a little \"grumpy\" with them on arrival (after a long trip from the UK). Having spoken with other guests, it seems like even the One Bedroom suite had the much smaller than expected baths! Another small annoyance was that one of the towel rails kept falling off and the bathroom sink was cracked.\n\nThat said, the room was clean, and the temperature was easy to adjust, we were overlooking a courtyard\/light-well so it was quiet too. The Kitchenette was handy too and the Concierge was really helpful.\n\nAll in all, it was OK to very good but not outstanding.","travelDate":"2018-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Check in was quick and efficient, and the reception staff very friendly.\n\nWe booked through British Airways holidays, and our room was a one bedroom suite. We were very impressed with the size of the suite. It had separate bedroom with its own bathroom, 2 wardrobes and TV. The lounge area included a double sized sofa bed, which was great for our 14 yr old. There was also a separate shower\/WC bathroom off the entrance hall, which he used for himself. The lounge adjoined the dining area which has a kitchenette with dishwasher, sink and coffee maker. The kitchen also had complementary coffee pods and a pack of microwave popcorn.\n\nThere were also two bottles of Voss water available, however these were charged at $8 per bottle, and the same bottles of Voss could be bought at local stores for \u00a33.49 a bottle.\n\nThe room was serviced every day, with beds made up, and bedding\/towels changed if needed, and the coffee \/ popcorn replenished each day.\n\nOur room was on the 18th floor, and close to two lifts. We had no issues with the lifts, however on a couple of occasions, one of them was out of service.\n\nThe Hotel featured an 'owners' bar on the 26th floor, but we didn't use it. They provided continental breakfast options, but we felt these were a little pricey ($19.95 to sit down or \u00a312.95 to grab and go), and we had breakfast outside the restaurant. Also, having the kitchenette means you can have breakfast and\/or snacks in room.\n\nOnly gripe about our room, the windows could do with upgrading, as they appear to be single glazed and despite being on the 18th floor, we still heard a lot of street noise (both sirens\/car horns, and people shouting). There were also road works on 7th avenue outside the hotel, which whilst being beyond the control of the hotel, could also be heard through the closed windows. They started at about 5 or 6am.\n\nAll that said, once we got to sleep, we did have a decent nights sleep in the large, comfortable bed.\n\nCheck out at 11am was as quick and efficient as the check-in, and the bellhop kept our luggage in a secure room until we returned later to head to the airport for our evening flight.\n\nOverall, we had a very good stay at The Manhattan Club, and would certainly stay again. It is in an excellent location on 56th Street just off 7th avenue - very close to the southern end of Central Park, and within a 10 minute walk of Times Square. The closest subway station was 57 7th avenue which was only 2 minutes walk, and this was on the main lines to downtown and brooklyn, and Coney Island.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The location is fabulous as it is close to many sites and to stations on most of the Subway lines.\n\nThe daily charge is quite a sting on top of the costs already borne in maintenance at our own resort and swap fees, but you can save money by having breakfast and some evening meals in the room using the kitchenette.  Also it was nice to have daily maid visits, so the bed was made, towels changed, the place was cleaned and bins emptied.\n\nWe had a studio which wasn\u2019t overly spacious but not cramped for the two of us either.  It did have a sofa bed and it would have been very cosy for four people.\n\nThe biggest criticism we had was that the air conditioning just pumped cold air into the room and did not dry the air in the room.  As the humidity was high this meant that the water condensed out of the then cold air and everything in the room felt quite wet after a couple of days.  We decided it was better to turn the air-con off and open the window, apart from when it was actually raining.\n\nStaff were all nice enough and helpful.

The property has been renovated since our first visit, and it is an attractive refurbishment. Our first visit was a one-bedroom with two complete baths; this visit was a studio, which was ample (and I actually preferred the layout--the bed is in a separate alcove, not a room). Exchange guests have access to the owners' lounge (Hilton does not grant lounge access to exchange guests). Reception staff were courteous, professional, engaging, efficient, that is, perfect in every way. DRAWBACK--A resort fee of US$50 per night is steep, but daily housekeeping is a nice amenity.

Situated in the Broadway district and close walking distance to both Central Park and Time Square. You can easily board buses, cabs, subway to get around Manhattan. There is so much to do and see and eat. Since it was our first trip to NYC we took several Hop on Hop Off Greyline bus tours, including downtown uptown night Brooklyn and boat tours. You can hop off anytime and explore then get back on another bus. We were able to get a pretty good idea of how to get around after one day on the bus. Do some research of the various plans available and have an idea of what you want to accomplish or visit. Not all plans are the same. I\u2019d say 3 attractions per day is about max. I\u2019d also recommend the One World Observatory if you only plan on one observation deck. It\u2019s the tallest newest and views are amazing!

They do have vending machines which was great. We are planning on returning to New York next year and will book with this hotel if the price is right. The only negatives I would say is 11am check out is very early and 4pm check in is very late. I understand this is to keep high standard of cleanliness but housekeeping were knocking on our door from 10am trying to get in. We had multiple people open our door in the morning to get in. I had to call reception to let them know we were still in the room and put a do not disturb sign on the door. It is good that offer express check out which means they slip the receipt under your door so you don't have the wait in line at the reception but they need to figure a way to identify checked out rooms easier other than keep opening the door.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The only pros of this hotel are location and the size of the room. Other than that, we stayed on the 16th floor which was unrenovated and it was disgusting. The room smelled terrible- musty, moldy, and stale. The window coverings did not work which left our room dark and dingy. There were stains all over the mattress in the pull out couch. The toilet clogged repeatedly. The shower curtain was moldy. Every morning when we left the very nice housekeeping staff would hover outside our room and kept asking what we needed- which was nice but also too much. I had our do not disturb on for a couple of the days of our trip and I have a feeling they still entered our room despite our saying we don't need service. Both times we did that we returned to a different sign hanging on our door that had wording to the effect that hotel had a right to enter rooms and had to knock before entering. That really put me off. \n\nI used the fitness center and it was nicer than my room. You are also close to Central Park which I really enjoyed. It is a good location. \n\nI have to believe all these great reviews are from people who stayed on a renovated floor or who were just happy being in the center of everything.

Ive stayed in midtown on almost every visit to New York City over the last 30+ years. \nWe are RCI members, (RCI is a portal available to vacation propertyowners that offers worldwide resorts)  which means due to our ownership  in other vacation rentals we can take advantage of this resort while in NYC. You have to book months or more in advance since this is one of the few venues like this available in NYC.\nThe location is TERRIFIC! Close to the center of Manhattan, Central Park, museums, shopping on Fifth Ave  and is easy to access by taxi or subway many other NYC neighborhoods. Many very good restaurants nearby.  \nOur stay was 7 days, six nights. The advantage of this hotel is the suites. We are a family of four and we need room and the small kitchenette area it provides.\nOur specific unit was on the fifteenth floor, and was spacious, with two bathrooms all done in marble.  Two TV's and sitting area with a couch that is a roll out bed.The bed was comfortable and had down pillows. It has a  small table and chairs, small fridge  and a sink and provides glassware, dishes and cutlery. It allows us to buy some groceries and eat some meals in our suite. NYC is expensive so to be able to eat a bowl of cereal with fruit is great. \nThey provide daily linen and towel service and clean each day.\nThe service is very good by all staff. Concierge on site so that's  helpful.\nWe had zero issues, and the rooms are fine for the price.\nIm glad we had the opportunity to stay in this hotel while in NYC.

The room was on the 2nd floor with a window that opened to the roof with pipes and heating\/plumbing equipment as the view. I could reach out and touch them. The weather was too warm to have the heat on, and there is no A\/C available in the winter. Opening the window to let in cool air meant lots of equipment noise. Impossible to keep windows open at night and sleep through the racket. For $2000 for a weeks stay I expected much better.

The price for location and configuration was better than comparing with any other options in that location. These were the main reason for our decision and worked out. As many pointed out the hotel is outdated and everything is working but old technology at least in the suite we stayed because by some of Tripadvisor pictures it looks to me they may have some renovated. We wanted to have AC and they do not have an independent system per room while the hotel is in heater nobody has AC (that is what we were told). The TVs service was really poor.

Close to Times Square, Rockefeller, Central Park, etc. We walked to most of these locations and the subway was close as well. Our room was also perfect. No noise could be heard and housekeeping was exceptional with checking every morning if we needed our room to be cleaned and not rushing us if we were still in the room. The junior suite was the perfect size for our family of 3. The kitchenette was also lovely to have with a child to store things in the fridge and having utensils and plates! The popcorn was a big hit for my daughter that they give in the room with the coffee and tea. No problems at all with the room or elevators. We did visit the 26 floor which was nice and also had a vending machine, which was a hit for my daughter as well. Bell staff always greeted us and opened the doors if we had a lot in our hands. It seemed the guests are mostly older, but it was no problem to have my six year old here. Christmas decorations were also lovely. \n\nWe did have one problem when checking in. They charged my cards twice for the security deposit as they took one payment out the day before. When I noticed I contacted the front desk immediately and it seemed as if the front desk manager did not believe me or was not understanding. I notified him that the staff should put notes or read notes so this does not happen because it was such an inconvenience. Good thing I noticed right away and the front desk manager voided it and gave me a letter to send to my bank right away which was nice but still a hassle and did not need to happen if the staff checked their notes or whatever they put on reservations. I was expecting a sorry for the inconvenience apology, but did not receive that as well. Maybe its just how New Yorkers are? I don't know.  \n\nWe used the car service they have at the hotel to go back to the airport which was said to be a flat rate of $75. But when we got to the airport and were told that if we used card the price would be $85. Not sure if it was his tip or what not but we should  just took a taxi or uber.

Staff was very friendly. Great location near Central Park, Columbus Circle and several train stations. The kitchenette in the room was helpful to have. Also there is a nice lounge area on the 26th floor which was a nice place to relax when we had a few people over. In terms of the negatives: we had booked a Metropolitan Suite which according to the hotel's website are all located on the 2nd floor. We ended up getting a room on the 21st floor (2111) which was not one of the Metropolitan Suites. Rather than the 'warm tones' of the advertised metropolitan suite this room had lots of grays and blacks. Combined with the fluorescent white lights throughout, the room felt very sterile and uninviting. We didn't mind enough to complain, but would have been nice for them to acknowledge at check-in that we were not going to get the room we booked. Because it was on a higher floor that expected, we also had to depend more on the elevators which were very slow. The room itself was a decent size but a very awkward shape, with lots of random twists and turns. To navigate around the bed I had to squeeze through a very tight corner for example. Not an ideal layout. The room was also quite musty\/humid. Thinking back, I would say the poor ventilation was the biggest issue for us. It smelled very damp even with the air conditioning on. Other minor issues were the windows which were quite dirty, and the furniture, which seemed to be a mix from different sets that didn't match. Would not stay here again largely due to very musty room\/poor air quality.","travelDate":"2017-10","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I booked through Hotwire and with how Hotwire works, it was a completely blind decision. I wasn't sure about the hotel at first. To my surprise, not only was it a comfortable and well situated hotel within mid town, I had one of the biggest rooms that can be found in the city. It was a suite with ample space for a small family with children. I traveled alone and was grateful for the level of security and friendliness of the staff. I previously lived in Manhattan and come back from time to time. When I am there I am running around all over and it was comforting to have a place like the Manhattan Club to just kick up my feet after all of it. It is a bit dated and my suite had not been renovated like you see the rooms on the Trip Advisor but linens are new and the towels are plush. My suite had a bathroom that at first I was not very happy about because their was a bad stain in the floor around the toilet. The management should replace the flooring. But, there was a second bathroom to my surprise and so I just used that one and avoided the other. To be fair, the stain did not mean dirty. It is just a hard water stain or something of the like. It really is only unpleasant to look at. The bed was comfortable but not the newest mattress. A bit too springy. Overall though, I couldn't want or expect more for the money spent. Definitely recommend the Manhattan Club if looking for value and comfort. ","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"SOLO"}

Recently they have expanded to offer hotel rooms to the general public.  If you are considering booking this as a hotel room, here's what you need to know. Remember the first rule of real estate: Location,Location, Location.   1) \"Location\"This is New York City - average reasonable rooms here cost $300-400 a night. Great rooms are probably out of your price range.  The rooms are clean, up to date, and reasonably roomy for New York.  You get a little kitchenette (we had fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, dishwasher with service for 4 in dishes and glasses.). 2)\"Location\" You will not expect a \"view\" from your room in NYC.  If you look out the window you will see another building - not just here but most any hotel you stay in.  If you face the street you will get more street noise and smells, so if you face the back and a brick wall this is not all bad.  3)Location - The purpose of a hotel room in NYC is to have a homebase to see the city, which means a comfortable place to sleep and somewhere you can eat snacks or refrigerate restaurant leftovers while you rest up to go back out into New York.  So much of what you want to see is walking distance from here - and walking is the primary way to see New York !  You can walk to : Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, all the major theaters.  Carnagie Hall is just across the street (only important during their season approx. October to May). There is a subway station in this block - it's right under the hotel!  Using the subway opens up the wider New York world to you at minimum expense.  (Remember to notice that subway service changes somewhat on the weekend.) \nMany of the staff have been here for years, over time they don't quite get to know you, but kind of.  This trip I managed to leave my briefcase in the lobby in the rush to get to the airport.  When we realized it my daughter called the hotel...the sercuity guy recognized her by name and said \" Yes, we have your bag - I was just about to call you.\"  They FEDEXed it to me at my office the next week.  \nThere is a breakfast bar on the 26th floor in the morning.  The price sounds high if you are from out of town...but any kind of regular meal in New York will run you $25 to $35 a person, so it's reasonable. \nThe guests are allowed to use the service elevators to get more elevator access, look for the glass door with the sign just to the left of the desk when you check in. The regular elevators are at a premium during check-in and check-out time.","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I have wanted to come to NY for as long as I can remember and as It was my first time in NY having saved for years to come to my dream holiday I wanted everything to be perfect, it was also my birthday the day we arrived and my moms whilst we were there. I had requested a renovated room as per the tips from the reviews. \n\nCheck in Isn't until 4pm and we arrived just after 2pm. Our room wasn't quiet ready so we left our luggage at the hotel and walked the couple of blocks to Central Park. We returned just after 4pm and our room was ready. We were on the 16th floor and I was very disappointed that it wasn't a renovated room. However, it actually wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. We booked a one bedroom suite and it was massive. One huge bedroom with king size bed and still masses of room, the front room area with sofa (pull out bed) and chair, small kitchenette with fridge, microwave and dish washer and the best bit 2 bathrooms. Never stayed any where with 2 bathrooms before. I loved the space that was there. We travelled with 3 generations of our family. It meant that we had space and if needed a get away from each other for a few minutes we could. \n\nWhen we arrived in the room, there was no bed sheets for the sofa bed, called to reception and it was arranged but didn't seem to happy as they kept saying they were in the wardrobe. All that was there was a pillow and blanket but no sheets to cover the mattress of the bed or a top sheet under the blanket. We did ask for a duvet too but was told they didn't provide duvets for the sofa bed but never understood why. However we were eventually supplied with two sheets and we were happy with that. \n\nEven though we were on the 16th floor we could still here the traffic noise. But this wasn't a problem. We are in New York City and think you would be Hard pressed to find a hotel that doesn't have traffic noise. Again our view over the Main Street was restricted by other skyscrapers, but could see Carnegie Hall. But I didn't expect any different due to the location and it was fine.\n\nThe staff we did come in to contact with were very friendly and always greeted with a smile. On the last day concierge staff called to reconfirm our taxi for us. \n\nThe location was great too. The hotel is a couple of blocks to Central Park and 5th Avenue and a couple more to Times Square. There is also three subways close by too so can reach other parts of the city. Took 25mins by subway to battery park to visit Statue of Liberty and was very cheap. If you go to the station at 57th street there was a ticket booth so if you are unsure about tickets and routes they will advise you. \n\nOverall, despite my initial worries I was very pleased with the hotel.  For us it worked out very well by upgrading our suite and for a first time visit it was the perfect location. I would have no qualms about staying again. \n\nThank you Manhattan Club for a wonderful stay. It made my first time in NY perfect. ","travelDate":"2017-09","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":99321,"title":"Breathtaking Hotel!","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-08-18","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"My family and I just checked in and I must say the room is more than we could have ever expected. I literally spent 3 days searching for hotels online, you name a hotel web site or search site . I am pretty sure I was on it more than once. \n\nThe first hotel I decided on was Park Lane. They have some amazing rooms that overlook central park, but after reading reviews the rooms I was looking at which stated \"partial park view\" were hit or miss. The customer service rep I spoke with told me to ensure I obtained a room with the view I wanted I would have to upgrade to a \"park view\" room, which at the time I was looking was $125 more dollars a night. Way out of my budget.\n\nThe next hotel I decided on was Hotel 48LEX. From the comments and reviews this hotel is amazing. I contacted their front desk and asked about a room and described the view my family really wanted for our first time in NYC. The gentleman I spoke with was super nice and told me, that he recommended for that breath taking view that I should upgrade rooms just one more step and he would take care of making our trip special. I was so blown away from his personality that I found his manager on here and sent a long email about my experience and that I would be booking the hotel the next day, as I still had not told my wife about the surprise vacation and needed to ensure she could get off work. Well long story short the price jumped $70 dollars overnight and I just couldn't justify paying the extra money. Especially since I was already spending more than I wanted to before it jumped. \n\nThe third day of searching i was starting to feel defeated. Like I was never going to get a room I liked. That is when I stumbled across Hotwire. I had never heard of Hotwire, but they have what they call \"Hot Deals\". They offer quality hotel rooms for a cheaper price. The only catch, you do not know what hotel it is until after you pay, and there are no refunds. \n\nThat brings us to today. The room is a suite, and very spacious. There is a tv in both the bedroom and living room. The decor is nice, not what I would have picked, but still looks good. The bathroom has a huge shower, and the toilet is separated by its own wall and door. Oh and the mirror has a tv built into it! As far as location it is extremely close to Central Park and Time Square. All and all my wife and I are extremely happy. The only down side is we did not get the view we were hoping for. (Which is understandable as we got the room cheap through Hotwire) Being on the second floor is also a bummer because you can hear the traffic on the street. Not to happy with that. \n\nIf hotel management reads this, please feel free to contact me, I am in room 204, and I will gladly pay a reasonable price to upgrade to a room with a better view.  If I do not answer the room phone you have my cell phone number on file. Last name is Finch. ","travelDate":"2017-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

This is a nice older hotel that has a lot of good points but has room for improvement. Arrival and check in went great. Bellman and staff were helpful and called cab for us. The room we stayed in was nice, 2 bathrooms with wonderful strong hot shower heads. While our room accommodated 4 people, 2  could sleep in the bed and 2 on sofa bed, sofa bed was not that comfortable with a very thin mattress. There were extra blankets and pillows available in the room. Our kitchen area was clean and had basic neseccities. Refigerator was very cold which was nice. Our room was very warm the first night, it took the air conditioning in the room a day to catch up to make it comfortable to my liking. Overall enjoyable stay. One thing that needs improvement is the slow and small elevators. We waited over 10 min several times and then due to smallness had to wait again to because we couldn't fit due to other people being on them. We always made sure we left our room 20 min early to get to anywhere. I would stay here again. It is very close to everything and we were able to get everywhere we needed to go within 20 min.

It was a good fit for my husband, 18 year old niece, and myself. We picked the Manhattan Club because we were able to get a good deal on the one bedroom suite which was ideal since it provided my niece with her own bathroom, and the couch pulled out into a full sized bed for her to sleep on.\nThe bell staff was outstanding and very friendly and helpful. We looked forward to seeing them each day.\nThe location is close to Times Square and Central Park with subway stations close by. We walked to Times Square often and also had an easy walk to the theatre as well.\nI will say that the website is a little confusing as one area shows the one bedroom suite has 2 bathrooms, and another area shows 1.5 bathrooms. Our room had 2 bathrooms. The master bath had a tub and shower, while the other bathroom had a shower only, however we consider that a full bathroom. Just a clarification for anyone wondering.\nMy only complaint is that, while the room was clean it was dated and had a musty odor upon arrival. We were told the scent would dissipate after the air was on for a little while and we opened the windows slightly for a few minutes. The odor did mellow but the room felt stale sometimes. The place could use a little decor update and our view was not great (no city view from our 14th floor room), but for as much time as we spent in the room I don't really consider it a huge issue.","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We asked for a quiet room on a high floor, and were allocated a suite with no view on the 12th floor. It was somewhat dark at all times, but very quiet. Unfortunately, despite the room being a suite, the only other bed was a rollout, and that was in pretty poor condition. Everything else was in good order, two bathrooms, lots of towels, blankets, kitchenette, huge safe etc We found it more suitable to reposition the rollout bed, it soon became obvious that this room had not been spring-cleaned in a very long time as there was piles of mess under the couch\/bed, not at all good for allergies. But other than that, all good, Wi-Fi worked well, staff were accommodating, and the position of the hotel cant be beaten!    \nAt checkout, we became aware that the daily service tariff had been increased substantially, but once we produced our reservation form, reception obligingly reduced the rate to the lower one stated there. \nWe did not make use of the breakfast or other leisure facilities.\nThese rooms are booked out by the week, so just some suggestions:\n - cant a proper (extra) single bed be provided instead of a rollout?\n - and a kettle should be included in the kitchen?\nWould definitely recommend the hotel and the exchange option if one can get it .......!\nAll in all a great weeks stay.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Beds are extremely comfortable with top notch linens  Towels are \"thirsty\" and there are plenty of them.  Years ago the elevators were painfully slow.

My one wish is that the hooks on the bathroom doors are more useful to people 6 feet tall or taller; I couldn't reach them, which made hanging the towel for re-use difficult.

With ready to eat hot food at nearby Morton Williams on 57th street, and Bread and Honey on 8th Ave, no need to cook!\n\nBed is very comfortable, four large pillows, two night stands with lamps, with nearly new mattresses that hasn't been pulverized by kids using it as a trampoline.  \n\nTight squeeze between the bed and the closet sticking out of the wall with 3 windows.  Easy to stub a toe, which is why the wife gave me the far side of the bed!\n\nWindows overlook a pebble filled brick balcony, which would have to have been demolished and rebuilt to meet current building code.  View of the 50+ story skyscraper office building across 56th street, with some occupied units at night.   \n\nVery little street noise at night, as 56th street is a single lane street with parked cars on both sides, a midget compared to the 4 lane 57th street.  Most of the street noise from nearby 7th Ave, around the corner.\n\nBathroom totally remodeled, with new white marble floor tile, and white marble wall tile on the sides of the shower.  Pedestal sink, with little or no counter space.  Noisy plumbing -running the shower wakes up the neighbors directly upstairs and downstairs.  Phone next to toilet, so you can multitask even at the most inconvenient times!\n\nDaily housekeeping to empty trash, vacuum the rugs, change the towels, and make the bed.\n\n26th floor has business center with 6 desktop PCs and printer, free to guests, with access using electronic room key.  \n\nStrong continuous wifi, free to guests in rooms.  Don't need to bring a laptop here, as business center open 6am-11pm.\n\n26th floor has exercise room, with multiple elipticals, stationary bike, treadmills, and TV, again with access using electronic room key.\n\nTea, coffee and cookies served noon to 4pm in 26th floor lounge with bar and sports TV. \n\nConcierge on ground floor can make tour arrangements, discount tickets to Broadway plays.  \n\n3 minute walk to Carnegie Hall, 5 minute walk to Morton Williams market on 57th St., 7 minute walk to Central Park, 15 minute walk to Times Square, 35 minute walk to the southern most section of the Theater district, 10 minute walk to Lincoln Center, 40 minute walk to Intrepid Museum.  \n\nStayed in the owners lounge on the top floor, with plush seating for at least 70 guests -great place to stay waiting  after we checked out at 10:45am until we left for the airport 3 hours later.  \n. \n$48.50 including tip, Uber drive to\/from Newark Liberty Airport 18 miles away, slightly less to JFK airport, 17 miles away.  $75 cab fare to\/from JFK airport -$60 fixed fare, plus $8 bridge toll, plus tip.  \n\nNo washer, no dryer, no sauna, no hot tub and no swimming pool!

Sometimes it is the little things that can add up to a bad taste, and you find yourself just looking at everything.  \n\nThis hotel is not elegance, it's just old.  It starts with the old, ineffective HVAC system that reminds one of a Motel 8.  Then it goes to the old plumbing fixtures, then to the miniature golf-thin, worn room \u201ccarpet.\u201d It doesn\u2019t stop there.  There is an old and worn, fold out couch that we luckily did not have to fold out.  The sheets on the marginally \u201cqueen size bed\u201d are literally so rough that they caused the psoriasis on my wife\u2019s legs to bleed.  The thread count is too low to count.  There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom.\n\nOne day we had to go without wash cloths.  Said they ran out.  Ran out for 24 hours!  Something else we had to go without - There was one cable channel that was blacked out for 4 of the 5 nights.  It is back on our last night.  Curious that it was only one channel, Fox News Channel.  We called the front desk each day; even tried to talk to a manager, but he\/she refused the call.  We were told that they don\u2019t have any control over it.  Their provider is RCN, and their calls to them have not produced results\n\nNow, I am just one residential customer with Spectrum at home, and any tech problem is handled in 24 hours on just my call; yet a huge hotel has no pull?  Not buying it.  We even walked to FNC to inform them yesterday that their channel was being blacked out at an entire hotel.  Interestingly enough, it was back on tonight.\n\nLast, we come to the joke of a \u201cbreakfast\u201d offered for sale at the hotel.  A continental breakfast for $20 and you can eat it there, or select 4 items for $13, that I painfully learned, that you \u201cmust\u201d leave the area to consume.  Take it back to your small, European size room that has no table or chair to sit and eat!  Folks, we are talking about the small, packaged style cereal, some pastries,  juice and coffee.  Yeah, I know, this is NYC, but I also know that our friends stayed at a hotel up the street that provided a free breakfast that included all that plus eggs and all the meats.  The way in which I was told that if I chose the pick 4, I must leave, was just unacceptable.  I had my Kindle and I just wanted to read and take my 4 little morsels to a table.\n\nSo, yes, it is the little things that can add up quickly to a decision to never go back to a place.  I feel we wasted our points on this place and would recommend that Bluegreen rethink what originally seemed like a good opportunity for its owners.  If BG continues to offer, it should come with some disclosures, so that folks are not blindsided and disappointed.  Lower the expectations; it is not all that it is advertised to be.","travelDate":"2017-03","tripType":"SOLO"}

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":99321,"title":"A Great Base for New York City Exporers","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2017-02-18","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Summary\nI\u2019ve concluded that the Manhattan Club is perennially top-rated and difficult to trade into because of its location, just north of Times Square and the only independent timeshare resort in New York City. (This doesn\u2019t count Hilton\/Marriott\/Disney owners using points for hotels.) Were it not in New York City, this would be an average, but expensive, place with little to recommend it. However, its position adjacent to some of the top attractions in the world gives it a panache that justifies its ratings.\n\n    Unit Features\nWe exchanged a timeshare into a studio unit on the 24th floor, 2 floors below the Owner\u2019s Lounge\/Fitness Center\/Business Center floor. The unit was about the size of a \u201csuites hotel\u201d standard room. A side nook held a queen bed with two nightstands, and was open to the living area. The living area had a queen pull-out sofa, one upholstered arm chair, coffee and side tables, and a small caf\u00e9 table with 2 side chairs. A lowboy dresser completed the furnishings. Two windows in the nook and the living area looked out on the opposite side of the building and the street below.\n\n    Kitchen Features\nThe \u201ckitchen\u201d was a 4-foot span of cabinetry with a bar sink, a microwave, under-counter refrigerator, and narrow, apartment-size dishwasher. Dishes, glassware and flatware were provided for four people, but it\u2019s clear that no one expects guests to eat very many meals in the unit. The lack of a real stove, or even a hot plate or toaster, is testament to that. A coffeemaker is provided with complimentary coffee.\n\n    Resort Amenities\nThe Manhattan Club has relatively little in the way of on-site amenities, other than a nicely-equipped but small fitness center, a business center with numerous desktop computers (both PC and Apple models, and all relatively new), and a spacious Owner\u2019s Lounge with a fully stocked and staffed bar. The Lounge serves a \u201ccontinental breakfast\u201d each morning for $19.95 per person, or $13.95 for \u201cgrab-n-go\u201d. Don\u2019t bother \u2013 their are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops in the immediate area that offer better value.\n\n    Size of Unit\nOur studio unit probably had about 220-250 square feet or so, larger than some other studios we\u2019ve been in.\n\n    Condition of Unit, Resort Buildings, and Property\nOur unit was very clean when we arrived, and daily, hotel-style maid service was a welcome difference from most places. The resort was carved out of the Park Central Hotel building, with the time-share conversion in the upper floors of one wing of the U-shaped structure dating to the early 1990s. The dove-gray color palette that looked sophisticated in the \u201890s looks a little tired and bland today. There were no \u201cpops\u201d of color in the d\u00e9cor, just a bland, overall gray tone set. Fortunately, you don\u2019t have to (and shouldn\u2019t want to) spend much time in the unit. The property is in good condition, and appears to receive conscientious maintenance daily. \n\nDon\u2019t bring your car. Driving in New York City traffic is an acquired skill, and one better practiced with someone else\u2019s car. Also, the $35 daily valet parking fee adds up fast.\n\n    Staff Friendliness and Responsiveness\nWe arrived a day late due to other commitments, but the front desk was staffed and ready for us. We found office, housekeeping and maintenance staff cheerful, friendly and helpful as needed.\n\n    Convenience to Area Attractions\nThe Manhattan Club is located on 56th St. between 7th Ave. and Broadway, in an area generally known as Midtown North. It is very handy to the Theater District and Central Park. Check TripAdvisor.com for many, many, many restaurants throughout New York City\n.\nThe Theater District is a short walk south on Broadway. We recommend using \u201cTKTS\u201d, the discount ticket booth at the junction of Broadway and 7th Avenue. Anything on the Broadway stages (basically, 42nd to 50th streets between Broadway and 8th Avenue) will entertain. We saw \u201cKinky Boots\u201d (lots of fun) and \u201cHamilton: An American Musical\u201d (indescribably good, a cultural phenomenon).\n\nNew York City is full of attractions. We recommend the 9\/11 Memorial Museum downtown, the Metropolitan and Guggenheim art museums, the Paley Center for Media, Mario Batali\u2019s \u201cEataly\u201d food hall on lower 5th Avenue, and South Street Seaport near the east end of Wall Street. Any good guide book will give you thousands of other ideas.\n\n    Any problems encountered such as check-in problems, room changes, etc.\nNone.\n\n    Your opinion on numerical rating for the resort and why.\nI rate the resort as \"very good\". It gets top marks for location and nearby attractions. I down-check it for the bland decorating and the lack of on-site amenities common to other resorts, such as pools, hot tubs, and so on.\n\n    Planned Resort Activities such as welcome parties, barbecues, kid programs, and outings\nThere didn\u2019t seem to be any regular recurring activities. We arrived on Super Bowl Sunday, and there was a food selection and party in the Owner\u2019s Lounge being promoted.\n\n    Suitability of Resort for Couples and Groups\nOur studio would be cramped for any more than a couple. There are 1BR and 2BR units in the Club, but they are smaller than average.","travelDate":"2017-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This time around, I invited my husband and 10 girlfriends to help celebrate my 50th birthday.  We were given a decent rate so all of us stayed at this hotel, primarily for it's convenient location to Broadway, Central Park and other areas of interest.   Most of the girls who were staying for a long weekend were given a nice suite with separate lounge\/dining area and two full bathrooms.  Most got updated suites as well.  My husband and I were staying for almost a week so I was a bit miffed (being the birthday girl and all) to be given the smallest \"studio\" type room.  It shouldn't have bothered me except we tended to congregate in my room versus the others; only when we decided to meet up in another room did I realize my room was the smallest (even the girls that roomed solo got a bigger room).  We then decided to congregate in the large lounge on the 26th floor, which had a nice bar and served complimentary tea and coffee around 4pm.   I just figured reception would have thought it best to put two people in a larger room versus one.  Fortunately, our room was updated and the bed very comfortable - best nights of sleep in a while - no city noises to wake me up.  The only other complaints were that the water pressure in our shower\/tub was not very strong and we couldn't control the temperature in the room (sometimes it got too hot).  The little kitchenette with a coffee maker was nice but $8 for a bottle of water seemed a bit steep.  We went to a Duane Reade drugstore nearby and bought water and just stuck it in the fridge - no problem.  The hotel also has a nice gym on the 26th floor (4 treadmills, ellipticals and free weights) and is well maintained.  There is also a nice business center with plenty of desktops and a printer.   Most of the hotel staff were very friendly and always willing to help.

For us the most important aspect of the lodging is the location and The Manhattan Club is ideally located for convenient walking to all of the things which we like to do: Broadway shows, Central Park, shows at Lincoln Center and restaurants---- close to Times Square but not in the middle of the chaos of madness of Times Sq. Because of its location at 56th street and 7th avenue, the Manhattan Club is perfect.  There is convenient access to many different subway lines at various stations within 2-3 blocks walking distance (either at Carnegie Hall or Columbus Circle at 8th Avenue or at 53rd street at 7th avenue).  Overall the stay was fine with no major complaints.  In addition to the location another aspect that I liked were the size of the rooms.  For New York  City these rooms are spacious and it is nice to have a living room and a separate area for the bedroom (although there is no door between the living area and the bedroom) with a \u201ckitchen space\u201d with a countertop, small refrigerator, built in microwave and dishwasher.. Also, for a building of this size with so many rooms (26 floors) I found the check-in and check-out process to be fast and convenient. Others have commented that the d\u00e9cor is somewhat dated and the furniture is worn\u2014these observations are true. However, I considered these to be minor details considering everything was comfortable, spacious and the location is ideal. The reality is that one does not spend a great deal of time inside the hotel room in New York City anyway. \n\nSome suggestions: 1) Bottle water in the room is expensive ($8 dollars a bottle). Go to the CVS at 57th street and 8th avenue and stock up on bottled water and other items that you can store in your refrigerator in the room. The gym on the 26th floor is very nice and has a filtered water machine which you can use to refill your empty bottles of water at no cost. 2) Breakfast: There is a breakfast that is offered in the owner\u2019s lounge on the 26th floor for approximately $12 for cold items (bread items and fruit) and $22 for hot breakfast.

Perfect location!  Could walk or catch a subway closeby.  I stayed in a studio which was fairly large.  The queen bed was a little hard but fine.  \n\nLoved having a small kitchen with sink, microwave, decent sized little fridge (with freezer) and a small dishwasher!  Housekeeping would run the dishwasher & then put the dishes away.  Lots of little delis, etc. around to grab food and bring back.  I never ate out in a restaurant.  I got some tasty spinach lasagne & grilled veggies at Cafe Oliviera (turn right out MClub & right on to 7th, then down a couple blocks on the right).  The grilled veggies were super delicious!  I also got a Blue Nut Salad there that had so many greens jammed in the container that I was able to have a salad with my meals for 3 days.  Thought it was a little pricey, but hey it is NYC.\n\nMy favorite place and where I got the rest of my meals (except for a few that were popcorn that was replaced in the unit each day) was Beyond Sushi, a vegan sushi restaurant down 2 blocks (turn right out of MClub-straight down 56th, cross 7th & 6th, on right).  As a vegetarian I'm always thrilled to go somewhere where I can order anything.  Meat eaters would like this too!  So so so so delicious!!  I tried a variety of their dumplings & rolls.  Their Watermelon Mint Lemonade was super refreshing.  They have two other locations in Manhattan.  They will also deliver to the MClub.\n\nUnit was spotless and the daily housekeeping was great!  Never missed a day even if I left later in the afternoon.\n\nI asked Front Desk about recycling and they told me to put recycles in a separate bag and housekeeping would take care of it.  Would be nice if they had a little sign up that told me that.\n\nBathroom was beautiful marble.  Good water pressure.  Sometimes got super fluffy towels (others were just fine).  Toiletries were very nice, made in US and all vegetable based\/cruelty free.\n\nLiving room area had comfortable (to sit on, nobody slept on it...) couch and nice size tv that could be angled to watch anywhere in unit.\n\n2 closets, plenty of hangers, loved the bathrobes!   \n\nEven though I was on the 24th floor and sometimes had to wait a few minutes for one of the elevators, once you got on, it was pretty quick to lobby.\n\nOwners lounge on 26th floor has complimentary snacks & coffee\/tea from 11:30-4:00 pm.  Cookies were tasty!  Nice after waking around outside in cold to go there & get a nice hot cup of tea!  Lots of comfortable seating.  Didn't use, but the bar area looked very nice.  Didn't go to the breakfast buffet, not interested at the price of $19.95 + bunch of taxes\/gratuities.\n\nAll staff very nice, friendly, and helpful.\n\nFree wifi which was reliable.  No problems with speed either.\n\nEasy quick walk to many of the theaters.  As a single woman, I really appreciated how safe I felt to walk in the area at night.  So many people around.  Had no qualms about walking back after the theater.\n\nEasy walk to Times Square, go down either 7th or Broadway.  What it took me a bit to figure out is that Broadway goes diagonally and 7th & Broadway actually cross in the middle of Times Square.  \n\nSubway station for 57th street could actually be accessed on 55th if you were going downtown.  Turn right out of MClub, turn right on 7th, down one block.  Take the R or the W down to Whitehall St\/South Ferry-takes you to Battery Park where you can go\/see Statue of Liberty, etc., also catch the Stanton Island Ferry (it's free!  and also a good place for clean bathrooms in that area), Financial District down there-took an interesting tour there!  Don't miss the American Merchant Marine Memorial, offshore a little bit near where you get on the ferry to the Statue of Liberty.  Very moving.\n\nOverall, I loved staying at the Manhattan Club.  Could not think of one thing that could have improved my stay!  I traded in here with timeshare points which made my stay for right smack dab in midtown Manhattan very inexpensive!!  But it is extremely hard to find availability but if I ever find it in warmer times, I will sure be back!!!!","travelDate":"2017-01","tripType":"SOLO"}

This is advertised as a four star hotel-it's maybe a two stars at best.

They had no flexibility with our request for a one hour late checkout time (we kindly requested 12 noon checkout opposed to 11am). We were refused a slightly later check-out even though they didn't have the housekeeping staff or other resources to turn rooms this quickly-and odd given check-in is 4pm!

Manhattan Club is awful and there are many other beautiful hotels in the Midtown and Central Park South areas that are leaps and bounds above this dump.

Upon our arrival we were greeted warmly and we were quickly in our room.  The room, by New York standards, was spacious.  A sitting area with a microwave, refrigerator, sink, coffee maker and plates. The bathroom was nicely appointed, marble tile and a big glassed in shower.  The drawback to our room, 227, was the view, there is NONE.  You overlook the courtyard of a roof, very little natural light enters the room. With that said, you are in New York City how much time do you spend in your room? \n\nI need to speak about the staff.  Every single person that we encountered was wonderful.  There are a couple that I can call out specifically.  Joel on the Bellman staff, he took our luggage on the last day secured it so we could enjoy our final day in NYC.  Not only did he take our luggage but went further to make sure we were set with first class transportation to the airport at a price less then we paid for a Yellow cab from the airport.\n\nNext is Carmi, the Concierge. His recommendations for tours and local places to eat were spot on for us.  He LOVES to talk and make suggestions. He spends time with you to make sure you are getting the service you want.  Be patient as he does this for each guest that was in line.  Everything that he suggested we did and enjoyed them all from the Woody Allen sandwich at the Carnegie Deli to the quiet dinner at Nocello, we truly appreciated. As for the tour, we did some research before we arrived and it was nice to see that they had the Greyline tour available at his desk. Just remember that this tour is time sensitive and starts at the time you purchase the ticket. \n\nNow the ONLY issue we ran into at The Manhattan Club was the number of towels we received each morning. The first morning we did the Green Thing, but the towels were replaced, so we gave up on that idea.  The next day they gave us fresh towels, but no washcloths.  \n\nWe did take in the Owners Club on the 26th floor.  Not really worth the visit.  The Grab and Go breakfast is cold cereal, bagel and fruit for $10.00.  We went to Fresh & Co on 57th for a nice selection of hot breakfast items. \n\nWe will be back!!  We are already planning our next visit and it will include The Manhattan Club!!","travelDate":"2016-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

For this last trip I wound up booking a last minute hotel through LMT undercover hotels and this was supposed to be atleast a 4 star hotel. Definitely this is far from a four star hotel and not worth the >$400 a night I was charged. The rooms are not only old and outdated, but the furniture is falling apart, the carpet was extremely dirty with stains everywhere and to make matters worse, the linen on the bed was stained with unknown yellow substance. It is a shame that they do not atleast make even minimal upgrades such as ensuring that you have a clean decent room. After the first night of staying in a very old and dirty room, having to change out my own sheets in the middle of the night as I was getting to bed, I was given a second room for the following evening. Although this one was a little more decent (decent furniture, not falling apart), I found that the sheets in the bedroom were also stained and dirty. I don't know if the hotel is having trouble with their laundry service, but it is definitely a huge turn off to get to bed after a long day, only to be grossed out by the lack of cleanliness. I will not be staying here again and will not be booking anymore \"undercover\" hotels. Not worth the money!","travelDate":"2016-10","tripType":"NONE"}

From his friendly greeting to the staff at the front desk, could not have been more helpful once they learned it was our first visit to the Manhattan Club.  That excellent care extended to the bellmen and the hotel household staff throughout our four days and three nights.  The room was outstanding, clean, and bright and offered everything we needed for our stay.  Whether you were leaving or returning to the hotel, the staff was there to greet you as if you were returning home.  First time at the Manhattan Club but not our last.

When asked a question, she abruptly hands you a piece of paper showing how to get to various attractions and then dismisses you.  But, the male concierge is superb.
