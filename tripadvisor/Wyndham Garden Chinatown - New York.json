So far, so good. When we arrived, the room was not clean, there were obvious tufts of hair and other things in the shower. The general condition of the room is rustic and old. After we complained that it was not clean (after all, you are paying for it), a cleaner came who did not speak English and was only equipped with a kind of vacuum cleaner; cleaning products and rags were not to be found. She used her hands and feet to show where it was dirty, and the bed covers were not clean either. Despite this, I still had to \"clean\" myself because it was not done thoroughly. You can save yourself the free breakfast. The ambience and the selection are minimal and not inviting... a few bagels, muffins, yogurt and above all everything in and with plastic (I have never seen such a bulky and unloving \"buffet\", for this price range you would expect a bit more variety). The hotel is in a central location, you have to be aware that everything is extremely thin. The doors to the rooms don't even go all the way to the floor and so you can hear everything. When the cleaner didn't come by one day, we were indirectly accused of lying because we apparently didn't take the door sign away (which we did). An employee then said that the cleaner wouldn't lie after all... we left it at that. At least there was a refrigerator that worked. There is also a ramen restaurant and a sports bar, which we didn't use. It was enough to sleep in (although everything was very thin) but for a comfortable stay with good service, I can't recommend it.","travelDate":"2024-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Easy access to Chinatown & Little Italy, which we much preferred. Hotel is dated and rooms are small but clean. Onsite restaurants and bars are great, breakfast options very boring if staying for more than 3 nights. Bagels, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, fruit and hard boiled eggs. Sounds like it\u2019s enough, but not for 10 breakfasts day in & out like us. And it is a compulsory fee. They mention this like an added bonus.$20USD a day for a breakfast I did not want. Staff were absolutely lovely, not their fault that we were stung with the extra charge upon checkin. I think the hotel now mention the extra fee when booking, but we booked in February and there was no mention of this in any fine print, so hence it dipped into our holiday money. We came from Australia so the extra USD$180 converted to around AUS$300 for us. A lot!!  The area is a little noisy but I think maybe the whole of NewYork is noisy, that\u2019s what makes it exciting. I would stay again, but after really comparing my options dollar for  dollar, if something was available for the same price with a better breakfast or some extra bonus, I\u2019d take the other option.

One of the reasons we had book this hotel was that it was only a 20-minute short walk to my daughter\u2019s apartment located in East Village.   The hotel is located on the busy thoroughfare of Bowery in the heart of Chinatown and very close to SoHo and Little Italy.   We had a king size bed in our somewhat small room; which had a small fridge and safe.  The bathroom was very adequate with a nice powerful shower which was great.  On our one-night stay on the 8th, we were on the 9th floor; on the later 3 nights we were on the 9th floor.  The hotel overall was very clean and bright and although our window overlooked the side street (Hester), we had to close the window at night due to some of the noise on the street.   The hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and went out of their way to meet any of your needs.   Since we arrived at the hotel from the airport around 0900 am on the 22nd, the hotel staff allowed us to store our luggage until we were able to check into our room at 3 pm.  Overall, I have no complaints.  We did notice that on our 3-night stay, the maids did not come into our room to clear or change the towels.  The bed was very spacious and comfortable and overall, it was a very enjoyable stay.    ","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Considering the size of the room they were able to fit everything I needed in it. I thought the price was super reasonable for NYC ($187 for one night with all taxes and fees). The Shinka Ramen Bar is really good! See my other review on that.\n\nCons\nDidn't seem like the best part of town to be in for someone traveling solo. I didn't feel comfortable venturing out after dark. Bathroom has one whole wall of glass, which was kind of neat, except it has a thin window covering and a frosted glass bathroom door - which combined caused night lights to shine into the bedroom. I ended up hanging some clothes over the door to somewhat shade it. I like my room very dark. Room was small but seemed average for NYC. Shower doesn't have a door that closes, therefore water sprays out of it, and you get kinda cold. It's a small sink area with very little countertop.\n\nJust because my cons list is longer than my pros list does not mean I wouldn't recommend it. Everything I didn't love was pretty minor.

Beautiful both day and night. Room was clean, bed comfy, small but comfortable bathroom with good hot water. Had drinks n apps at the beer garden downstairs, good nachos. Did not visit rooftop lounge. Location was good, steps to Chinatown (where we had Thanksgiving Dinner), next to Little Italy, Lower East Side, Soho, Greenwich Village, with all the tons of restaurants and shopping everywhere. We walked to the Whitney Museum in under 40 minutes, a nice walk. Still some street noise even on the 12th floor, but this is NYC, you just need to remember ear plugs if it bothers you. At check in the front desk told me where to get \"discount\" parking, which was still $55\/day because it was \"oversized\" (Ford Maverick). I guess maybe that is a discount, but I think last time I paid for parking in NY it was about that. Oh well, you need to park in downtown Manhattan you better be willing to pay up. One tip about that: when we checked out they wrote stuff on our parking ticket to get the discount, but I didn't realize until later that it was the hotel that would charge for the parking, not the lot. Good for me the lot attendant didn't charge me, I would have paid twice! Nice hotel, good location, reasonable price (we booked using points so I don't have the exact price). Would stay again!

Being a sole female traveller I wanted to feel safe where I was staying but also be close to all the sights in NYC.\n\nI found the Wyndham Garden Chinatown, and read lots of reviews on different platforms including reviews for other hotels at a higher rate but found their reviews to be very mixed. I decided to just book Wyndham Garden Chinatown, I paid for 22\/11\/22 - 24\/22\/11 \u00a3268.00 inc. via Traveluro.\n\nWhen I first got to Wyndham Garden Chinatown I had landed at 09:00 and walked from Central - Central Park, taking in as much of the city on my way down to Wyndham Garden Chinatown to check in at 15:00.\n\nMena at check in was really lovely and helpful, and not long after I had got to my room  \n\nRooftop93 - The rooftop bar. I popped up here on my last night to have a couple of cocktails, I was met with really lovely staff a female and a male. The were both really helpful and chatty which was nice as I was alone and it was good to talk with them. I had their signature cocktails: the  Bowery margarita and their Lyc\u00e9e Martini, both really good $18 each (\u00a314.90). \n\nI enjoyed the great view the bar offer from the inside, I didn't get to go on the rooftop I didn't know it existed. I wish I had if it was open as from their Instagram page shows it has some great views.\n\nI would've like this to be open for breakfast too. Maybe it was and I didn't know about it?\n\nOn booking the hotel I was asked if I wanted a particular floor \/ room... from some of the reviews I had seen that rooms next to the elevator could be noisy so I requested one away from this and also a high level. I was very happy to see I had level 12 and this was away from the elevator. My room had a great Westerly view.\n\nThe room itself was very clean, well kept, and comfortable. When I booked, the only rooms available on Traveuro site were accessibility rooms. M room had no 'hall\/lobby' it was straight into the room. A huge frosted glass door,really big shower room, great if you had mobility issues. The only thing I felt the it was missing was a shelf to put toiletries on, I had to use towel on the towel rail to fashion my own to place all mine on.   \n\nI would note; Traveleuro's shown check out time on my booking was 12:30 but told on the day by Wyndham Garden Chinatown staff it was 11:00 am was it was a good job I checked.\n\nI would definitely return to the Wyndham Garden Chinatown, I enjoyed my stay!","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

So it's perfect in that sense. Truly.\n\nThe staff Saturday afternoon was more than friendly with helping me check in. However after that this is where things go awry. After checking into my room I turned on the AC to cool the room off (special shout out to the gentleman at the front desk who upgraded my room, I had spectacular views of NYC!) I unpacked my bag and then went to grab something to eat. I figured about time I came back the room would be cool to my liking. So I go downstairs to grab something to eat as I was hungry. The bartender was friendly but not attentive at all and it was probably because it was STIFFLING in the said area with no AC only industrial fans blowing hot air around. \n\nThe lobster tacos were okay but they tasted like imitation crab meat instead of lobster. Now onto the wings the wings were bussin! But seriously $14 dollars for some wings should be a crime. I got one cocktail, 6 wings, 2 lobster tacos and a diet coke and it was $50. Talk about highway robbery. \n\nSo I go back to my room to take a shower and a nap before heading out. Can someone please tell me why on earth was my room hotter than before I left. I was attempting to get ready and couldn't stop sweating. Cause it was so blasted hot in there. So I called the front desk and they sent someone up to my room the young man was nice. He says \"oh you're AC isn't working either?\" He took a look at the unit and offered to give a fan to help cool the room, which I thought was nice. However I want a billion dollar corporation to explain to me why the AC wasn't working in guests rooms but the lobby was cool and pleasant. \n\nIt was literally one of the hottest days of the year and on record and to be in a room that was damn near on the top floor with a barely functioning AC was criminal. I mean if you enjoy sweating while sleeping and getting ready this just might be the place for you. Other than that don't stay here during a heatwave cause you'll be SOL. \n\n","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The views and sense of airiness were superb--one felt like a bird flying high over the Bowery.  With two window walls, it felt like the Mr. Big\u2019s corner office.  Or, rather, Mr. Big\u2019s small corner office as the room was small, more like a Paris hotel-sized room than a NYC hotel-sized one. \n\nOur stay was a mixed bag.  As several comments noted, the absence of a second shower door made water on the floor unavoidable.  The lack of shelf space and narrow edges of the bathroom sink counter made it hard to find space for toiletries.  The bathroom was a textbook example of form over function and a source of frustration.\n\nThe desk was small, kid's size, really; the desk chair (the room\u2019s only chair) was sized to barely fit into the desk\u2019s kneehole, so the desk\u2019s inside edges were beaten up.  Worse, when in place, the desk chair completely blocked the narrow passage that was the direct route from the bed to the bathroom.  The bed had a nightstand only on one side though there seemed adequate space for another.\n\nTwo more caveats: Daily room cleaning is available, but only if you request it.  Though the sign on the room door indicates a noon checkout, I was told that it was actually 11:00.  \n\nI do think we\u2019d stay here again.  Without spending grotesque money, finding a perfect hotel room in NYC isn\u2019t possible.  The Wyndham Garden Chinatown wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was easily good enough, and better than we expected.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

Unfortunately, the AC in the guest rooms is lacking - It was not the heat of summer when we visited (6\/11\/22) but the room was somewhat stuffy and the air was chugging to get a good cool in the small guest room. One support to that is that our room was equipped with a tower fan - which helped somewhat, but is not a solution when you pay a premium to stay in a hotel - You just expect good, comfortable AC. The rooms are clean but my rating reflects that a hot hotel room is not fun - and the potential for that is pretty good given the summer season on the way.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Sweeping views north of Chinatown all the way to Midtown.  The hotel was quiet and spacious in the room and lobby, not like other NYC hotels that feel cramped everywhere.  The only thing to be weary of, and this seems to happen in a lot of NYC hotels, the ventilation from other rooms dumped into mine, and I came back at night to a pretty strong marijuana smell.

The Wyndham also got us a discount on our parking, in a lot just around the corner off Canal street.\n\nThe best part of my stay at the Wyndham Garden Chinatown was without doubt, the people. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Tiffany, at the desk could not have been nicer. She was available for directions, advice and assistance. She even checked our bags for the the day after we checked out so my daughter and I could go to a museum before heading to the airport.

Firstly, I would say some of the reviews on TA do seem to be a bit suspect, all 5 stars, all praising the staff and how amazing the hotel was and many reviews left by accounts just this minute registered and no other contributions.... very suspect. \n\nThe room was very tired and I must say, a bit dirty. Luckily, we had packed wipes and after wiping down the handles and touch points (Mainly for Covid) the wipes were black. Clearly cleaning protocols are not great. The glass door in the room was covered in finger prints, as were the windows. The blind in the bathroom and parts of the wall around the bed were covered in \"splatters\" of some kind of liquid. Hallways outside our room looked like they hadn\u2019t been vacuumed for some time.\n\nThe heating in the room was very noisy and couldn't be run during the night so we had to ask for a portable heater. All the windows in the room made it cold quickly. The heating would generally take hours to heat the room up. \n\nOn the first couple of days the shower had to be run for about 10 minutes before the water started running warm. Plenty of black mold around the shower tray. The sink had a crack through it which was poorly stuck back together with mastic. \n\nWallpaper around the room peeling off, lots of scuffs and damage to paintwork etc. Just felt like it needs a refresh. The TV in the room constantly displayed \"No Signal\" I did manage to position the broken antenna cable in a way that did it less. We were quite high up in the building which was lucky as the road noise is quite loud. \n\nIf you're not used to city travel then the area would be of a concern to you. We used Bowery station a few times and one night it had around 10+ homeless in it, multiple people on the stairs down to the trains jacking up with needles and leaving them all over the place. Lots of human \"waste\" around the surrounding streets. We're frequent city travellers and this disturbed us quite a bit to the point we regretted staying in the area. \n\nMost of the staff were polite and friendly but we did find it quite rude that some staff completely ignored us with their head down into their phone every time we walked through. No eye contact what\u2019s so ever. \n\nThere were some good points to our stay! The view from the room was really good, facing the city. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept on in a hotel. Most of the staff were friendly and helpful. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.  It wasn't cheap enough to stay that far out the way and certainly not a \"top\" NYC hotel as it portrays. If you're looking for a comfortable bed and can get a good deal but willing to run the gauntlet through the nearest tube station, then the Wyndham Garden could be for you.","travelDate":"2021-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Expedia called Shawn for confirmation as to my statement and told the agent he has no record of us speaking. I had called the desk back & Tiffany told me to call Expedia and have them give them her name.

I know theres always a possibility for that but, unacceptable. The shower head is like one ive never seen before. Very unhealthy to consume.

The rooms were a good size for our family of three, much more spacious than other hotels we had stayed in.  The view from the room was also nice. \n\nThis hotel is in a fun part of town.  It is right near the Chinatown ice cream factory, which has fun flavors to try, and some great Chinese restaiurants.  You can also easily walk to Little Italy.  It is walking distance to several subway lines as well.  For us, it was great that it was near a park with a soccer field (my son went over and got to play in a pickup game), as well as a 24 hour ping pong place.  \n\nIt was a bit noisy at night, because it is near a fire station, and also above the Bowery Beer Garden.  However, this is an expected part of staying in an authentic neighborhood where NYers live and hang out.   I wuold recommend asking for a room on a higher floor, if possible.  \n\nAlso, the shower is a little tough to work - it doesn't have a curtain, just a partial door, so no matter what you do, some amount of water gets on the floor.\n\nOverall, I would definitely stay here again.  The neighborhood gives you a real NYC expereince, which is worth the slight inconveneiences mentioned.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

I was able to sleep comfortably. On leaving, Sean offered to make things right, demonstrating great customer service. Definitely would stay here again.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

No prior notice (they had to have known well before this) and no offer to place us in another Wyndham or other hotel.  Just \"free cancellation\" or \"30% off room rate\" to stay in an 80 degree room.  So, at last minute, of course, we had to pay top dollar elsewhere.  Hotel management should have done something for us and they did NOTHING.\n\nLooking at reviews, many must be fake.  The hotel is nicely located in Chinatown, but that's where the good part ends.  Lobby looks solidly 2-star.and shabby.  The desk agent was friendly enough, but no management around and no help.  Hard to believe this is part of a chain that usually has some standards for customer service.  Not this one!  Avoid it.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

Not sure if it was the same size or smaller than my original one though.  I took it anyways.\n\n  Hotel is easy to find, right on Bowery and close to Grand Station (D\/B trains) and\/or Bowery Stn (J\/Z Trains) and easy to find because of the covering for the Bowery Beer Garden which is sort of attached to the hotel.  It's also right on the main street too.\n\n  Room was alright, not very big, but had 2 beds, wardrobe with a safe, small fridge, desk and a nightstand that had several USB slots and plugs.\n\n  The balcony is not what one would expect if you hadn't previously looked at photos (I had so I wasn't sure I really cared to have it).  You can walk out, but not really sit on it, and it's more like a narrow roof section it seems than a true balcony.  But you can walk around the outside of the hotel on it and get some great views depending on your floor.  I was on the 7th and I could see downtown and Midtown pretty well and even better seeing them at night.\n\n  The room has some bottles of water there as well as standard shampoo, body lotion, etc in the bathroom.\n\n  The bed for me wasn't as comfortable as I thought it would be.  I'm not sure if it was the bed or the pillows for some reason.  They had enough pillows, but I didn't get the best sleep in the beds.  I also would have to put a towel under the door to keep the hallway light out and that helped out.\n\n  The bathroom is a good size, lots of towels (as maid service was scaled back due to Covid).  I found there wants any place to hang towels though at all.  There were no towel racks and the shower wasn't a typical shower one would expect.  The shower has no door, it's just a partial glass window that you can't shut.  So you would take your shower, but anyone that walks in could see you.  You also have to watch the water coming out, so that it doesn't spray and go out of the open part onto the floor.  There is also no fan in the bathroom either.\n\n  Maid service as mentioned has been scaled back due to Covid and you need to request service a day before.  I was there a week and never needed it as I was alone.  Though if you see them in the halls, you can easily ask them for extra shampoo or towels if you needed them.\n\n  24 hour check in desk and fast express check out with a friendly staff.\n\n  Compared to other hotels I found this one to be highly recommended and a good price in comparison. ..","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

That made choosing a hotel very difficult.  I'm glad booked the Wyndham Garden Chinatown 5\/1 - 5\/8\/21.  It was superb.  The rooms were VERY nice and VERY clean.  I can't imagine a better location than this anywhere in NYC, located at the Manhattan foot of the amazing Manhattan Bridge.  This is in the VERY SAFE Chinatown district with Little Italy only two blocks west.  The Grand St Station is 2.5 blocks (no, really..... less than a tenth of a mile) away.  and the B and D lines can get you anywhere (either alone or by transfer, usually at 4th st).  The front desk was superbly polite and helpful.  Annie was especially a delight as she checked us in and kept an eye out for all of our needs throughout our stay.  Wifi was perfect in the rooms and throughout the hotel.  The room included a refrigerator that was everything we needed.  The bed was very comfortable and honestly, NOTHING could have been better about this stay.  The Bower Beer Garden is a really nice Craft Beer Bar in on the ground level and food can be ordered from that (pub fare) menu or from the also attached Shinka Ramen and Sake bar.  Everything we had here, including a wide array of local, regional and national CRAFT beer was fantastic.  Manny, our server was someone we talked about for the entirety of the trip.  Superb.  Again, I don't know where some of the crazy reviews come from.... I think just unhappy people in a tough time (pandemic) but take it from me, you will not regret staying here.

He and Sean were very helpful, polite, and accommodating.\n\nRoom was definitely small but honestly wasn't expecting it to be spacious to begin with. I can confirm what I had read from another review which is the strange shower design with no glass door to keep the water from splashing onto the floor.

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":2622936,"title":"Great Value","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2020-11-16","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":5,"text":"This stay was taken during COVID and noted for clarifying my experience. This was also my first hotel experience in general.\n\nCheck-in was quick and easy. We were greeted, and after an ID check, my information was found. For the safety of staff and guests, there were plastic guards, which made it a bit more difficult for me to hear in addition to speaking through masks. The only difficult part of the experience is using the key card for the elevator. We often found ourselves swiping a few times to get the green light and holding down the desired floor a bit longer until it lit up. The key card worked effortlessly for our room.\n\nThe room is pristine and a digital thermostat is available by the entrance. We got there towards the early evening, so we were a bit puzzled on how to turn on the light fixtures, not realizing there were brown rocker switches underneath, on the wall. It became second nature once we figured it out. I'm not certain if the ID was specifically mentioned, but it was easy to find the guest wifi and connect to it.\n\nWhile the TV has many channels and offerings, we wanted to use our own devices and external services we've been accustomed to. We needed to ask the front desk for a technician to come and take down the TV in order to access the HDMI ports, located in the back. An Amazon Fire TV stick just barely connects to the lower outlet (connecting with the TV outlet makes it difficult to remount the TV). After minutes, we were set up and running. The TV is easy to unmount after knowing what to look for, but is best left for professionals for safety. In addition, staff were ready to answer questions and assist where possible. The front desk had single use pouches of toothpaste should you forget your own. They will point out convenience stores nearby for your needs, and greet you as you exit and re-enter the lobby. I hate calling by phone, so it was important to me to be able to approach the front desk and request housekeeping needs.\n\nLocated in Chinatown, there isn't a shortage of eateries. However, due to Covid the rooftop bar was not available. The property owner did not update this in Google, and while not owned by the hotel, it was an attraction we were looking forward to, especially for some good photo opportunities. We did find another rooftop bar not too far away, but again, it was an unfortunate inconvenience that was not noted beforehand.\n\nOverall, our experience was great. My only minor gripes were fiddling with the key card in the elevator, and accessing the HDMI ports on the TV. The key card is just trial and error, but having HDMI extender cables already hooked to the back of the TV would simplify customer experience.","travelDate":"2020-11","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I booked this past weekend for an anniversary surprise and the staff could not have made it better during these times. From a few days before I even checked in I stopped by after work and met Giovanni who greeted me with such hospitality and assurance. I understood not all special requests may get to be accommodated and I thought there may have been a chance that mine wouldn\u2019t even get to be read--but as soon as I stated my name he already assured that everything was planned to get me a great room for the occasion as long as it was not occupied on my check in day. I had read about a specific room number being \u201cthe best\u201d on one of the reviews and when I mentioned it, Giovanni went above and beyond to inform me the room next to it was even better and why! With that being enough for me to already be so happy and excited with the effort and service, he took it upon himself to note my stop-by and our discussion for his colleague the next time I arrived to check in and decorate (I mentioned I planned to do this on the phone and clean everything up, I was warmly told by Sean that is no problem at all and not to worry! Another great experience communicating with the second staff member I encountered). On the day of check in, eager to find out if the assigned room was still going to be available, I made a call to ask a few hours before I left work to head over and decorate - which was when I encountered Calvin yet another AMAZING front desk staff member who so kindly confirmed it was available! I can\u2019t stress enough how these gentlemen put all the pressure and anxiety I felt to make the weekend perfect at ease. I was blown away. I checked in and finally met Calvin who was even warmer in person and made me feel so welcomed. Check-in was very simple and clear, and he even answered my deposit question so kindly. The room was perfect and had everything I needed. The water pressure and temperature was great, the views were amazing and my partner who has never stayed at a hotel in the city loved every bit of it. We were even left a sweet greeting note congratulating us and wishing us a great stay that we surely did have. Despite changes in daily housekeeping due to covid, when we needed fresh towels and a new comforter from the prior stay, it was done with ease. The ramen restaurant was amazing, we both loved it! We even enjoyed 2 free drink vouchers from the staff--I honestly cannot stress enough how much they made this such a great experience. I could go on and on. If you love ramen and asian fusion food you will be steps away from heaven. Love Italian? Little Italy is also blocks away. Honestly you are right in the vicinity of just about anything you could want, we got to stop by so many nice brunch spots and bars just minutes away via uber. If you love to shop like we do, you will also be minutes from heaven as soho shops are so close! We were able to explore and enjoy the city, while having a comfortable and serene setting to come back to and relax in. I will definitely book with this location again in the future. Outstanding staff, exceptional service and breathtaking views. (I should have thought to take better pictures, I took videos and had to screenshot, but believe me when I say they were incredible in person, so next time :) Thank you so much to the team at Wyndham Garden Chinatown from the bottom of my heart for everything.

They appear to be racing around cleaning rooms as guests arrive. One employee told us they're only working one day a week. \n\nAs we checked in we were told the air conditioning will not really get below 74, and we were offered a fan. I'm not sure if that's a setting to save money or if it's always like that, but it sounded like a new thing. We accepted the fan, and it was fine. \n\nWe knew there wouldn't be daily room service by then, but that was not at all clear when we booked the room. We were there for multiple nights and were told that we could request service if we needed it.\n\nI should add that our room had amazing views, and the hotel was very quiet. \n\nOn day 3 we were out of towels and coffee, and we requested service. We were told to be out of the room around 10 so they could clean it. We returned to a dirty room around 6. \n\nNew person at the desk said there is NO run service, even if we're there for an extended stay. He did hustle up some fresh towels and waters and coffee. There's no room service right now, and finding coffee proved somewhat difficult, so we appreciated the additional pods for the room. \n\nIf you are staying here or really anywhere right now, I would recommend calling the hotel directly and asking the manager what to expect. I think it's reasonable to expect room service every few days for an extended stay, but I would get that cleared up ahead of time so nobody is unhappy. \n\nIt's a strange time to travel, and being flexible is important for hotels as well as for guests. \n\nThere is room for improvement in setting expectations. Is this hotel a repeat? You betcha. Despite the confusion, everyone has been lovely.","travelDate":"2020-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I visited NYC for 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang's fundraiser event happening next door at the Bowery Beer Garden.

I mean, I wanna come back anyway but it'll probably be a long time from now because of finances and stuff. \n\nBut yeah, great hotel.

He is disabled so I was looking for a hotel close to Little Italy and Chinatown.  I originally booked the \"special offer\" for the room and parking on the hotel website which reads, \"Parking in New York City is no problem with our special travel package. Enjoy a stay in our plush accommodations with an upgrade to Deluxe Queen Empire View room (when available), a $15 credit to Grab and Go, and complimentary valet parking right here at our downtown Manhattan hotel. What could be easier? Package is based on availability, and black out dates may apply. Standard hotel cancellation and deposit policy apply.\"  \n\nMy husband decided we should take the train instead.  When we got to the hotel I asked them to honor the day's prevailing room rate of $284.00 because we did not drive and I was not going to use their parking.  They said they did not see the parking on the room and they could not accommodate my request.  They DID NOT give me the $15 credit to \"Grab and Go.\"  All they gave me the manager's business card so I could try to contact him after the stay.  They were not \"helpful\" at all.  The room was not what I would consider a \"Deluxe Empire Queen Room;\" there was barely enough room to turn around in it.  My final charge for just the room was $427.56 for one night; $369.55 was the room fee plus tax.  I don't think I will be going to New York City again any time soon.  The rooms are ridiculously small and expensive.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

I called the front desk multiple times with no luck. A 'Hotel Engineer' came up, peeked his head in, and said hold on. Another 10 minutes past with the blaring, ear deafening alarm. Another hotel service person came up, and tried to radio it off remotely with someone at a panel on another floor. The panel was \"too far\" away someone yelled on the walkie talkie. Another 10 minutes of the ear piercing alarm went off, the man returned, pried the alarm off the wall (not a typical battery smoke alarm, but one of the large dome shaped official city alarms), and did something with a screw driver to turn it off. We were told taking a hot shower caused it to go off as the bathroom fan relies on a natural roof exhaust (not a motor fan). We were instructed to shower with low heat showers and to keep our hotel door open when we showered going forward? I can't think of a more vulnerable way and place to shower.  The front desk never followed up, apologized or offered any form of a coherent explanation as to why the deafening loud alarm went off for 20 minutes. It may have even been a fire alarm or carbon monoxide detector, but we didn't die so I guess it was neither.  \n\nThe service here is poor. It has been sort of average in the past and I was always willing to overlook that for the price and room cleanliness, but when we are talking about emergency indicators and consistently grumpy personnel, I had to speak up. Additionally, because of the Beer Garden and Ramen Bar on the first floor, there is now an ottoman sized cologne diffuser in the lobby which is bordering on intoxicating in how strongly perfumed and repulsive the scent it fills the lobby with. I imagine this diffuser is to the mask the smells of the two eateries, which it does successfully, but with the price of wanting to pinch your nose in the lobby.\n\nWe also saw an old lady struggle to pass through the main glass revolving lobby door with her rolling luggage as the side doors instruct you to always use the revolving door. She kept getting stuck, waved for help to the woman at the front desk and who responded by rolling her eyes, remaining at her station and yelling \"Thats why I told you to use the door!\". \n\nThe rooms are clean, location is great, the hotel is modern and well-priced, but I am now reluctant to stay again","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The maintenance staff and the maids also know me well.\nIt is like a second home to me . It is no doubt a home away from home. The hotel is great for business travelers as well as all types of traveling purposes. The restaurant is terrific. The roof top lounge offers the best view of the city anyone can ask for. \nNot only is the staff able to anticipate my needs , they also address them at a rate at which I can't ask for more. Just to share an example. I am a coffee drinker. They are sensitive enough to know that. I never have to ask for more coffee. When I check into the room there they are.

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-05-17","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":1,"text":"We are locals who needed a last minute hotel in the neighbourhood during a home renovation and this popped up on our Hotel Tonight app. Our parents had stayed at the same hotel about 6 or 7 years ago in a much nicer suite), and their room was quite nice and clean back then, so we went for it.\n\nPros: Every staff member was polite and helpful and came to the rescue when needed. Shinka, the ramen restaurant downstairs and the rooftop bar are both worth a visit. Shinka is a great spot even for us locals. The location is excellent, close to many great restaurants and  neighborhoods in Lower Manhattan.\n\nCons: We checked in at 9:30pm or so and went into our room. We couldn\u2019t find the lights. Went back downstairs on the super slow elevators and the front desk member told us how to turn them on. Not intuitive at all. Why would you put a dark brown light switch plate on a brown wall that allows you to then turn on the switch to the lights that are in the middle of the room? \n\nThe tiny hallway light barely lit up the entrance way, let alone the sleeping quarters where this secret switch is located. It wasn\u2019t even a master switch because turning the switch off did not turn off all the other lights in the room when we were ready for bed.\n\nWhile unpacking, I stepped on a mystery liquid in my socks on the dark brown carpet that turned my white socks yellow. The carpet between the two double beds had a big wet spot that clearly did not dry out even though we had the windows open for several hours while we went out. The smell permeating from the spot smelled like moss or mold or something growing underneath the carpet. We laid a towel over it just so we could get into bed since we wanted to take a shower and sleep after a long day.\n\nThe shower control was difficult to use. We are frequent world travelers and have stayed in hundreds of hotels, and we have never had to call someone up to show us how to work the shower. Not even in the Amazon rainforest! The front desk member I called agreed the showers are tricky in this hotel. There\u2019s always a first for every traveler, I suppose.\n\nThe glass door of the shower is useless at keeping the water from getting all over the bathroom. Everything ends up wet after you shower. Again, the moldy smell emanated from the shower drain. Coincidentally, the shower wall abuts the beds...\n\nMy husband, usually with a high tolerance for this kind of stuff, suggested that we Uber home after our showers. He did not want to deal with any more issues for a room that we paid a pretty penny for. We checked in at around 9:30pm and he wanted to leave at midnight. That\u2019s how bad it was.\n\nWe left the windows open all night even though the garbage trucks and police cars were loud on the street. However, the smell did not abate. We left in a hurry around 8am, informed the front desk of the problem, was promised that the manager would contact us when he or she arrived for work today, and it\u2019s now almost midnight. I held this review in draft mode until the end of the day to give management a chance to rectify the situation before I posted. We will not be back and will not be recommending this hotel to families or friends in the near future.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Room is light most of the night and of course worse first thing in the morning as the currents are not thick enough. The bathroom door is frosted glass, so since there is a window in the bathroom, that also lets in a ridiculous amount of light. The bathroom shower has only half glass, so the bathroom gets flooded.\nI asked the front desk to have someone check the A\/C as the temperature only went up from the time I first got into the room til about 3 hours later. I was told someone would fix it. Went out for a couple of hours. Upon return, front desk said it was fixed. She never actually confirmed it was fixed as no one had been in my room. Temp had gone up 3 more degrees while I was out. Perhaps check for accurate info before lying to guests.\nLast day of 2, a strong smell of marijuana has been coming through the A\/C vent.

We didn\u2019t stay too much in the hotel as we were exploring NYC for which the location is absolutely perfect. It\u2019s on the edge of the Chinatown one block from Little Italy and less than 5 mins walk to the nearest subway (Grand Street Station). We pretty much walked everywhere in the Lower Manhattan from here. It\u2019s also in a great proximity to Brooklyn Bridge so you can simply walk straight from the hotel.\n\nThe rooms was clean with enough space. Even though it is on a corner of a very busy street and they were doing some reconstruction on the hotel building it was very quiet in the room. The service was excellent, really can\u2019t complain about anything.\n\nThere is a great rooftop bar with nice views up to Empire State Building. Definitely recommend to come and check even if you don\u2019t stay in this hotel. There is also some bar downstairs and if you are after a great food then there is Little Italy with many Italian restaurants or walk up to NOHO for other options (Tip for Australians if you are after a great coffee - there is an Australian cafe Two Hands on 164 Mott St).\n\nHow to get from and to airports:\nWe arrived at the Newark International Airport and with a shuttle bus (we were the last one the dropped off) it took 1,5 hours. That\u2019s not great but it was a morning busy traffic so I assume that\u2019s fairly normal. When we were leaving NYC we took subway to Jamaica Station and then AirTrain to the JFK Airport which took over an hour but it was much cheaper then the shuttle bus and no extra discomfort (no need to walk little bit from the Jamaica subway station to the AirTrain station, I would say around 5 mins walk.) We simply wanted to avoid the unpredictable traffic when using shuttle, cab or Uber so that\u2019s mainly why we decided to use this option.\n\nSummary\nI would definitely recommend staying in this hotel for anyone who comes to visit and explore NYC. It\u2019s in a great location, rooms are clean and service was great. Rooftop bar is an extra benefit.","travelDate":"2018-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, and Louis Vuitton are all close by.  There was also a refrigerator in the room, so you can stop at a nearby deli and stock up on water and snacks if you choose.

L'hotel ha camere discrete, nulla da eccepire. Ci\u00f2 che pi\u00f9 ha di spettacolare \u00e8 la vista sulla citt\u00e0. Eravamo all'11mo piano e avevamo un'intera parete vetrata. Aria condizionata al giusto livello. Pulizia soddisfacente. Letto (queen size) comodo. Poco spazio per riporre gli effetti personali, nessun appoggio in bagno. Stupendo il rooftop tra il 18mo e il 19mo piano! Per la sua bellezza, per\u00f2, \u00e8 molto frequentato anche da esterni, dunque nel fine settimana risulta sovraffollato ed accessibile a fatica. Birreria all'ingresso dell'hotel, con discreti hamburger (per chi la sera non avesse voglia di andare in giro).

Never had a bad experience here and hope we never do. Some of the comments may be seem overly detailed but may help you get a better picture of the property:\nShower \u2013 plenty of hot water, great water pressure, tile area clean, at least 3 towels. Perfect. (No shower door so the floor gets wet...go figure.)\nRoom \u2013 average size for NYC although some (corner rooms) may be a bit bigger, always clean and modern d\u00e9cor. Small fridge without the pay-as-you go minibar. Heard nothing from other rooms.\nWiFi - works well although you do have to keep entering the password when you leave the area and return. No biggie.\nEntrance \u2013 quite busty and it\u2019s hard to pull up out front, especially if you are coming south on Bowery or coming off of Canal Street. My advice is to park at T&K parking ($40) on Chrystie just around the corner and walk the half block or so to the front door.\n\nLocation \u2013 At the edge of Chinatown and 3 blocks to Little Italy, so it\u2019s busy on the street and the sidewalks. Five minute walk to the Lower East Side.\nStaff \u2013 A BIG 10 for the staff. Every single person we encountered was friendly and helpful. Servers were attentive, housekeeping friendly and the maintenance guys were polite. Front desk was always manned by a friendly and helpful person, no matter what time of day or night.\nBAR \u2013 The Rooftop 93 bar is absolutely great. Wonderful views and well-made cocktails. This is a bar manager that TV's John Taffer (\u201cBar Rescue\u201d) would be proud of!\n\nTIP: My tip is to call the hotel directly to check on the best rates and availability, especially if you\u2019re a repeat visitor.\n\nNOTE: There is a major construction project going on to replace windows in the hotel (July 2018) but we were not interrupted in the least by the work. There is scaffolding around the building but it shouldn\u2019t affect your stay.\n\nThe only downsides we found were: \n1). a lack of neighborhood restaurants that were not Chinese (snails? really???). But the food at the Bowery Beer Garden (connected to the hotel) was excellent (burgers!). We did not try the restaurant in the basement (Mr. Wu\u2019s). It's a short walk to the LES and Little Italy where there are many options. \n2). The A\/C was a pain in the butt and required a visit from the polite maintenance staff to get it cranking after 2 days. In all fairness, this was during the July heat wave, but that made it even harder to get comfortable. In the end it worked fine.\n\nBottom line, this is a well-run, well-managed, clean, affordable choice for your NYC visit.","travelDate":"2018-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":2622936,"title":"1st time at any Wyndham, good experience, right next to Chinatown and Little Italy","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2018-06-30","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"Have never stayed at a Wyndham property before, but I got a rather slick deal so I opted to stay here for a single night while working downtown in NYC. Otherwise, I would normally opt for a Marriott properly.\n\nI drove in and the hotel is easy to find using GPS. First thought upon finding the hotel is where is the valet? I read from other reviews that you could do valet (which I wasnt planning on doing) but I was really looking for a place to be safe to unload. Well you do it on the street; there is a sign that says loading area and its about the length of 3 cars in front of the hotel. The good thing is that if you are unloading, the front desk says you are okay to leave your car there for a bit ; you wont get ticketed or towed. What  didn't like about the front entrance is that its stairs only. If you have heavy luggage you are not going to have fun, and there are no special needs entrances that I could see. Then its just a revolving door to enter, so my thought is how limited the entrance is. \n\nSo l grabbed our stuff, checked in, went to the room, yada yada, and came back to move the car. From other reviews I read about using the local parking garage a block over for cheap instead of the hotel $60 valet (didn't even see a valet person around). I already booked on spot hero for $25 overnight parking so dropped the car off and its 3 minute walk back to hotel. \n\nSince I never stayed at a Wyndham, I was surprised when they front desk upgraded us to a high corner room on the 10th floor (especially since I paid next to nothing from the room). Front desk staff was extremely friendly, and I saw this outside of the fact that they upgraded my room. Corner room has some nice view of the city; empire state building one way, world trade tower 1 the other. You are facing the street so you will get some noise obviously, but nothing too bad. \n\nI definitely enjoyed the size and layout of our small but cozy room (small in nyc is normal); great views from both sides of the room, and bathroom. The bathroom has a full window facing the street. Bathroom was modern, updated, and clean. I am not a fan of the European shower thing with just half a glass window, and water goes everywhere outside the shower, but the water heat and pressure were good. \n\nBed and pillows were very comfortable, but only had a night stand on one side of the bed, so I had to put my phone (aka alarm clock) on the top of the bed post. \n\nRoom had a nice sized desk, fridge, free bottle of poland spring water, standing upright closet (instead of built into the wall), LCD TV hanging from the ceiling, modern alarm clock with usb charger. I was definitely happy with the room itself, and my fiance slept like a champ. Couldn't test the hotel wireless; saw the network and its asked for a password, but I don't think it was included with out stay. I had great cell coverage anyway so not an issue.\n\nTherein are my two annoyances with my stay: I found I could not sleep good because the AC duct is right over the bed, and the sound and way it blew over me made it difficult to sleep comfortably. This is ymmv as the layout will change be room but this was very frustrating as the point of a hotel is to get a good night's sleep. \n\nSecond thing that frustrated me was the amount of light coming into the room in the morning. This is the result of the the bathroom that I initially really liked. It has a swinging glass door that is translucent. Its really nice looking, but even if you close the bathroom shade and the door, you are going to get a good amount of light coming into the room in the morning. So I blacked out the rest of the room, but the light from the bathroom is full force in the morning, and it makes the light in the room too bright.\n\nOther points noting; there is a rooftop bar on 18th floor but can't comment on that. Also a bar\/restaurant basically built into the hotel at the entrance. There are some other restaurants\/bars in the hotel but didn't make it to any of them so cannot comment. \n\nYou are however in Chinatown so a lot of good restaurants in walking distance. We walked about 3-4 blocks to Little Italy and had some of the best pizza ever around 11pm -- ahhh! Location of the hotel was spot on to make it there. \n\nOverall, hotel was average, and similar to a lower end Marriott I would normally stay at. I would stay here again if I was walking to the hotel and needed a quick overnight, but not if traveling with a car and luggage.","travelDate":"2018-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We were not expecting much, just a decent room to stay in and that's what we got. So far so good.\n\nIf I don't book a Hilton I don't need a lot of service and don't care much for it, however I am sad to say the opposite of service was what we received. On the last day we wanted to check out at 10 (noon checkout available) and leave our bags behind until 1.30pm. The lady behind the counter wanted $3 per bag - odd and this wasn't charged when we arrived and left our bags until check in. As we had three bags the grand total was $9. I didn't want to kick up a fuss and just accepted it, reached for the wallet and pulled out a $20. The lady mentioned that she didn't have change and that was it. I expected her to get some from the bar in the foryer but nothing, she wanted to charge it to the card. As I had cash left and didn't want to exchange $20 I said $10 will do. The response was that she only had large bills. I think the charge in the first place is poor service and if a small arbitrary charge is raised that is uncommon and not mentioned anywhere, change should be on hand.\n\nBeyond that throughout the stay, the staff was not visible or welcoming, just neutral.\n\nThe lift buttons and card reader didn't work - we stayed on the fifth floor and had to press the up button to get a lift to the lobby. Tough luck if someone on an above floor called the lift as well. You'll have to go up first. One of the two lifts didn't have a function card reader which meant anyone could go to the guest rooms. This happened multiple times when a questionably looking fella just strolled in and followed us to the room or didn't know where he was going.\n\nWhile the room was good the soundproofing was not, we heard taxis and cars honking frequently. We were on the fifth floor.\n\nDon't look out for signage at the entrance. It is a construction site with scaffolding, however nobody actually works there. If you have heavy luggage think again, there are some stairs at the entrance and no ramp etc.\n\nThe location is alright but then again, unless you're keen on a Chinatown and walking past smelly fish on the way to the train station this light be a bit of a negative.\n\nThe advertised rate on their website was $319 for the night, we got it for $120 - it wouldn't be worth much more than that.","travelDate":"2018-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The stay here was comparable to a nicer motel at best.  First off, the front desk messed up our reservation, which seems extremely common with this hotel.  We had 3 people in our group and had booked a room for a king size bed + queen size bed.  Instead they said that room was unavailable and had given us a smaller room with 2 queen beds.  Front desk staff failed to clearly explain why the room was unavailable.  However, after venting my dissatisfaction, an \"upgrade\" was offered.  We were given a larger suite with just a king bed, with an option for a roll out bed for the 3rd guest. Larger room was a plus, but 3 nights on their springy roll out bed is not recommended unless you're under the age of 10.\n\nNot a full service hotel.  No concierge, no room service, front desk personnel is just okay, but not helpful.  Asked the front desk for an estimated taxi fare to JFK airport, and they didn't know and told me to just take an Uber.  Seriously?  Did not even offer to help when we were in the lobby clearly having trouble with our 4+ pieces of luggage at 5am.\n\nThe good:  Hotel location is great if you want to get away from the city.

(I\u2019ve paid extra before for a rollaway but never $30 a night.) The room was extremely small to begin with and then throw a rollaway in.  Shower did not work very well at all for the first two days.  They had to install a new shower head.  Not once did they replace the toiletries in the room.  I accidentally spilled some soda on the comforter and they never bothered to replace it with a fresh one our entire stay.  Never did restock the coffee that was in the room the first day.  A couple of days we weren\u2019t sure the room had been cleaned because the bed and rollaway were made very haphazardly.  Staff was nice enough at  check-in, but basically ignored us the rest of our stay.  Had a great time while visiting New York but was very disappointed in this hotel.","travelDate":"2018-02","tripType":"FAMILY"}

There are no doors on the shower and that can make for a cold bathroom at first. My only complaint - if you can call it that - is that the shower squeals at a certain temperature.

And that the public will come in at night to use the elevator to get up to the rooftop. I did not feel unsafe at any point mind you. Again, thought this was relevant to let people know.

This is not our first visit to New York and we wanted something different to the tourist trap of Times Square. \n\nThe area on first glance is ok but nothing special, Bowery is the edge of chinatown so you don't get the \"watches, watches, bags bags\" while on the road itself as soon as you're off the road the area leaves a lot to be desired and I would suggest only breathing through your mouth especially on a morning! There were discarded pigs legs, fish and rubbish strewn in the road right outside to hotel! There's a subway station a couple of minutes away though which is good. \n\nThe hotel checked us in quickly and we went up to our room on the second floor. This floor has a balcony outside the glass door in the room which is shared with all other floors so you can't open your curtains as there's always someone strolling by! The door had some tape on the edge of it I assume this was to stop the draft coming in but it didn't work as it was freezing on a night on that side of the bed. The room is a good size and has a fridge, large tv and coffee making facilities. The bathroom is good too but the fact you can see others showering when in the bedroom is massively offputting - perfect for a peeping tom! The shower was hot and powerful but the fixings were loose and the shower tray rusting, the shower also makes a screaming noise when running which I'm sure our neighbours didn't appreciate at 6am (we were in room 204 if you want to look at fixing that). The housekeeper did a great job of keeping the place clean and tidy, the main problem I had is that whenever we were in the room we were getting bitten by something which was leaving large red lumps on our arms, legs and bodies, we never saw what was causing it but it was definitely only when in the room. \n\nThe rooftop bar has amazing views BUT the music is too loud, like ridiculously so. So much that you genuinely can't hear the person sat next to you and it stopped us going up again after the second visit. The bar underneath is also very loud - I'm writing this draft while on night 4 of the 5 night stay and I genuinely cannot sleep due to the noise from downstairs and the noise from the road too, I'm dreading tomorrow as it's our last night and we need to be up at 3am for the airport. The lifts are also just full of people going up to floor 18 making it harder to get to your room. Also, we asked the receptionist where we could buy some water for the room and we're sent into the hotel shop where we got charged $4 for a small bottle. The Hong Kong supermarket over the road do a large bottle for under $2. \n\nIn summary - I'm genuinely confused as to what this hotel is aiming itself at as it seems nice but the uncomfortably loud music and number of visitors who don't seem to be staying in the hotel are stopping us enjoying the hotel for what we booked it for - relaxing and sleeping. That, coupled with the bites from whatever is feasting on us mean that on our next visit to New York we wouldn't consider this hotel again which is a shame as it could offer guests so much more by way of being a hotel rather than a nightclub. \n\nIt was difficult to choose between 2 and 3 out of 5 for this hotel but I went for 3 as the description of 'average' is about right for what is on offer as a hotel meant for sleeping in and relaxing in.

Decided to check out lower Manhattan this time. This hotel is decent. We all know NYC is terribly expensive, noisy, dirty and crowded. I wanted more cultural experiences rather than the time square\/disney experience. Chinatown is perfect, steps from Little Italy and Soho. \n\nArrival at the hotel was shaky. Was stuck in the elevator, because the button to 10th fl was stuck and had to go to 11th fl. and walk down. Rescued by a security guard. I avoided that elevator on the return.\nKey didn\u2019t always work for 1st, 2nd try in the other elevator either.\n\n \nit's midnight and I'm hungry. NO room service but Highland Deli delivers. Got a burger and fries. Good flavor however, no salt or ketchup provided so everything was a dry, dry, dry. Make sure you request it if you order.\n\nMy room is good., nice view, small and clean(mostly) something weird on my sheets. NO counter space for my cosmetics in the bathroom, that\u2019s a HUGE pain. Put some of my things on the toilet seat to get dressed. The mattress is encased and therefore bedbugs are not an issue.:-)\n\nThe closet is a problem too. it's a half closet and my clothes can\u2019t hang without hitting the bottom and getting wrinkled. So I use the \nBathroom hook. Why the bar is so low I don\u2019t understand.  No dresser drawers either.\n\nNo tub in 1001, but good city view. The shower has a weird design, only half a glass and the water spills onto the floor under the sink after showering. So the floor is wet, not great while you are trying to get dressed.\n\nFridge works, but it\u2019s not turned on, you must open the door and dial the number up before it gets cold..\n\nWindows don\u2019t open. Small rooftop lounge for drinks. Cosy restaurant below, but it was closed.\n\nYou have to pay $3.50\/bag after you check out and want them to hold your bags\u2639  Also, 1st water in your room is free, then they charge $3.00\/bottle afterwards.

There are some pluses, (floor to ceiling windows that provide a nice view, decent bar adjacent to hotel, fairly close to subway) but on my most recent stay (I've stayed here before) the air conditioning was not working.  It was 95 degrees in NYC and the only thing you want after walking around in that kind of heat is to come back to a cool room to rest.    It was awful - even the bedding was damp from the humidity.  The front desk clerk who came up to check it (not even maintenance - the front desk clerk!) said maybe it was because the blinds were open.  Um, it's midnight and the sun has been down for about 4 hours and the room is the size of a small closet, so I think if the temp in the room has gone UP since we arrived and set it at 68, it's probably not because the blinds were open.  Then he tried to tell us it takes a little time for it to cool down.  Like 8 hours??  No, not buying that.  I asked to be moved and he said they were sold out.  He offered a fan, which we accepted, however it did not do much to cool down the room.  So we were not able to sleep much, which is really what we were paying for.  On a separate issue, I asked at check in to change the credit card the room was booked under and the front desk clerk (same one from earlier) said he took care of it, but NOPE, he didn't.  Vanessa, the morning front desk clerk was fantastic in helping to clear that up, and provided us with a late checkout which was much appreciated.","travelDate":"2017-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Plenty of towels and cold water down there, also a daily paper on the counter.\nThere is a rooftop bar (one of our reasons for booking here) but we discovered it is NOT affiliated with the hotel and is actually quite a dump (see separate review). In my opinion Wyndham Garden would do well to completely disassociate themselves from it.\nThe hotel is located on a very busy crossroads and I was concerned before we arrived about noise. Our room had floor to ceiling glass looking out over the main road and was very noisy- that would be our main criticism. I don't know if any rooms were less noisy but on the 5th floor the traffic, sirens, horns and traffic cop whistles were irritating to say the least, preventing us from getting proper sleep. \nThe room itself was furnished to a good standard with a comfortable bed, large TV and basic coffee making facilities. \nThe bathroom lacked thought though. The shower screen was attractive but not sufficient to prevent the rest of the bathroom (including loo rolls) from getting soaked. There was nowhere to even hang a hand towel and not one shelf to put any toiletries on, meaning we had to nip in and out of the bedroom for everything.\nFinally, the long gold curtains in the room would have been a lovely feature if they hadn't been desperately stained and in need of a good wash!","travelDate":"2017-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Why on earth would you have only HALF A SHOWER DOOR? It just doesn't make sense.  It probably isn't because of a price thing, cheaper for just 1 shower door.  It has to be a design thing.  Let me tell you, DESIGN FAIL!!!! I sincerely hope they have good flood insurance because they will need it.  They are just begging for a huge flood to occur from within.  Aside from that, I enjoy a steamy, warm bathroom when I'm showering.  With just one shower door, that did not happen.  I was too concerened with that growing puddle water where there shouldn't be any to enjoy my shower.  Even with 3 folded bath towels used as bath mat, not enough.   It's ridiculous designs like this that I might have to start bringing along a shower curtain.\nThe room is cozy, comfortable enough. (I've been told that by NYC standards, the size of the room is \"huge\". (don't compare, you only setting yourself for disappointment)  When did compact become the new acceptable standard?  It's not asking too much that I can walk around in the room and not be doing that walking on the bed. Becareful to not hit your head on the ceiling while walking!) Okay, I went off on a tangent there. The room isn't that small, I promise. I was able to stretch out my arms on all sides of me and not hit walls. It really was cozy and comfortable.  It certainly was clean.  Loved the floor to ceiling window. Looking out to a rainy and busy Chinatown on a Saturday morning is an experience.  Couldn't figure out why there's a portion of the room that was wasted space.  Perhaps it's a structural support beam or wall.","travelDate":"2017-05","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Outside noise was minimal, which is helpful when you are in New York.  It is right in the middle of Chinatown and about 2 blocks from Little Italy, so there are plenty of places to eat, as well as lots of markets with local flavor.  It is also about a 10 minute walk to Soho for great shopping and restaurants, and about a 5 minute walk to the nearest subway station.  One thing to be aware of - there is a frosted glass wall between the bathroom and the bedroom.  When you are in the shower, you are literally right next to the bed on the other side of the glass.  So, this could be a little awkward depending on who you are traveling with.

I called the front desk asking if there was anything they could do about how cold the room was, and the man came to our room, turned the thermostat temperature to 90 (the maximum) and said that was all he could do. The thermostat might as well have been a decoration on the wall because it simply did nothing. It did not work, and the room remained extremely cold. I called them again and said that the hotel heating system must be broken for this room as the thermostat does not work, and asked if I could be moved to a different room on a different floor. I was told that there were no other rooms available that night, and that there was nothing they could do. Frankly, I don't believe this, we were staying during a very quiet time and it's likely they had nicer rooms on higher floors available but simply refused to move us even though our room's heating was broken.\n\nThis supposedly 4-star hotel in New York city costing $200+ per night had a broken heating system and they did nothing about it, and they refused to even have us move rooms.

The coffee was excellent and was most enjoyable first thing in the morning.\n\nWe had floor to ceiling windows and had views up towards the Empire State building.\n\nWhat I loved most is you walked out of the hotel and you were smack bang in the middle of China town and there was so much going on, but it was great being around normal New Yorkers rather than in Times Square with the tourists.\n\nSo you can walk to the lower end of Broadway where all the shops are in 10 minutes, you can get to Little Italy in 5 minutes, you have at least 4 different subways  to hand, lots of coffee shops in Little Italy. Round the corner near Manhatten bridge is a dunkin donuts for anyone wanting a quick breakfast, also along Canal St there is a 7\/11 which is good to get snacks.\n\nThere are so many restaurants nearby but we were on a schedule with family that we only ate at one of the Chinese restaurants nearby, I wish we had had more time to eat there again.\n\nI would not chose another hotel as I felt this hotel offered all that you needed plus it was in an amazing location that would show a new visitor more than being in Times Square.\n\nThe hotel also have a fantastic roof top bar which we only visited once which i regret as the view was to die for!","travelDate":"2016-07","tripType":"FAMILY"}

For those driving in (and leaving your car overnight) the valet drop-off is nearly non-existent during peak times - nothing is clearly marked; it's simply a parking spot on the corner of Bowery. Your car will then be driven to a satellite parking lot (my car was unscathed so no complaint there). The front desk upon my arrival was super helpful but I was surprised to see that she was the only staff (they could use more). The elevators during this time were pretty slow and reduced to only one operating - wait time matters when you're trying to get some rest. Thankfully there's a lot of good food and shopping within walking distance. The centrality of the location is great for convenience but not the best parameter for restful sleep. The showers in this place are kind of weird as they are separated by a half wall. There are great views of Manhattan available in the hotel's terrace bar. The bartender was kind enough to escort us to the empty deck on an overcast evening - do note that there was a two-drink minimum to access the patio area. By my valuation, the experience was overpriced but it was the right place to stay for a weekend getaway in Chinatown Manhattan. It beat having to coordinate with an airbnb host.","travelDate":"2016-08","tripType":"COUPLES"}

While the location was great, the room was clean, and staff generally friendly, they had a major computer glitch where we had to be let into our room or wait for someone to be available to let us in.\n\nI also inquired about a complimentary upgrade since we were staying four nights, and were positioned right across from the ice machine, which made noise throughout the day and night. For the first two days, I was told they were sold out and they couldn't move us for the first two nights. You can imagine how upset I was during the third night (Friday) when I asked how full they were, and the person letting us into our room casually replied, \"Not too busy, we're not sold out tonight\".\n\nSince this computer glitch happened, into my second night there, another guest and I asked what the hotel would be doing to give us a discount for the inconvenience. We were told that they would straighten this out and by giving us a credit later. It's been 12 days since and my credit card was just charged, with no invoice or credit whatsoever for any part of my hotel stay. \n\nWhen I called and asked, they would not give me the name of a manager to talk with because they were overwhelmed with trying to fix the computer problem, and asked me, \"Could you call back tomorrow?\"\n\nI asked that they call me back tomorrow and gave them my number. Then I was told that someone might call me back in a few days, they \"could not guarantee that someone could call me back tomorrow.\" If this was the case, then why did he ask me to waste my time calling back, when he couldn't \"guarantee me an answer?\"\n\nI pointed out that they went ahead and charged my credit card with no notice of what the charges were, even though I left my email address with them. I also pointed out that the dates were all wrong. At least he acknowledged the date problem on the invoice.\n\nI would have rated them much higher if I had gotten some good pro-active customer service during the four times that I inquired about the problems.  Still waiting for this to be resolved.\n\nI get that it wasn't the staff's problem with the technical glitch; however, after seeing them note down my name and being told that they have to deal with \"hundreds of guests\" that was not good customer service.

I'd much rather stay here than the tourist traps near Time Square or Central Park. That being said, the hotel is showing its age -- a bit. I found my room just a little more worn and dirty than on past visits. There was hair in my bed and the bathroom smelled musty. Both were minor issues -- really no big deal. There are many good places to eat around the hotel so I usually eat outside the property. The beds are comfortable, showers run hot and room temperature easy to control. You might want to bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. The hotel is on a busy corner and noise from the street can be an issue if you are on a lower floor, though I can sleep through just about anything.

It actually extends the length of the building so you can actually pass other rooms if you so choose.

We did go to the rooftop (19th floor) and saw a more panoramic view where we saw the new World Trade Center.\n\nThe service was excellent. The room was small but hey, this is NYC so that is expected. My wife was here a year earlier where she said she did not have the view nor was the room laid out well. This time, the room was laid out better according to my wife. For me, the room could have been laid out a little better. We had a queen size bed with a nice flat screen TV coming out of the wall.
