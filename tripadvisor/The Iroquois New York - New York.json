She was not very helpful or showed intentions to be helpful - reluctant to provide a cup of tea, kept telling me tea is served only during breakfast hours, when I asked what about outside of breakfast hours, she said we don't. I said \"so there's no way I can get a cup of tea in the evening at this hotel?\" To this she said I need to go to the adjacent bar (Lantern's Keep) and check if they had tea, yes, I need to go and check to the bar that is accessible via hotel lobby. She also said I probably need to pay for the tea. Thankfully the bartenders had better etiquette and served me a cup of tea with a smile and when I asked \"how much\", they said \"on the house\"! The same lady at the front desk asked me weird questions (in condescending tones) like \"did you touch anything from the minibar?\", yes, touch, not open, touch, or \"did you pick up anything from the nightstand?\", not open, but pick up! Not my favorite interaction and I felt that I am being treated badly! After the whole tea debacle I paid close attention and noticed that I was not being treated warmly (by her only). To be 100% certain, next evening there was a different person (another and a nicer lady) at the front desk and I asked for a cup of tea. She didn't say there are fixed hours for serving tea at the hotel, didn't ask me to go the bar and check, instead she got other members of the staff involved and the tea was brought to me :-)\nMy interactions with the rest of the staff was fantastic, they were all very welcoming and helpful.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"NONE"}

When I returned, my yeti water bottle was missing from my bag. The people at the front desk said there was a shift change and there was nothing they could do about it. Each night I was there, all throughout the night when anyone on the floor opened their own hotel room door, my door & door handle shook like someone was trying to pick the lock so I was waking up all night thining someone was trying to break in. A few days after checking out I received a bill for $270 (about $30\/day for a 9-day stay). When I called to ask what it was for, they explained that there's a daily charge to cover the amenities, i.e. gym, sauna & grab & go breakfast regardless of whether they were used. This should be clearly stated on the hotels website when booking a room. If I knew it was going to cost me an additional $270 for the week, I would have booked it somewhere else that didn't have hidden fees. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had with a hotel.

Normally stay at the Sheraton Times Square, but decided to try somewhere new as the Sheraton has gone downhill.  Obviously the Iroquois location is good.  We booked a Supreme King room which faced 44th St.  Thought the room was small even for NY standards, but it is an old hotel, so that goes with the territory.  Only one small desk chair, which means one of two people have to sit on the bed.  The remodel is well done, but the windows are terrible!  Some of the worst street noise ever.  Sounded like we were sleeping with the windows open and felt like it with the amount of breeze that blew in through the gaps.  I would guess any positive reviews on quiet rooms were those in the back.  The only other real negative is the tub grout was moldy and no counter space in the bathroom (photos).  The rest of the housekeeping was good and the room was clean, the bed, lighting and a\/c all good.  Most of the staff was friendly and helpful, other than the initial encounter at check-in.  The breakfast is nice, but very strict on only allowing you to have one breakfast item.  The bar was closed on Sunday, but packed on Monday and Tuesday.  Good atmosphere.  Be careful with all of the taxes and fees as they never provide the entire cost until checkout.  With the reservation, they list a lot of tax rates and a $32\/night \"facility fee\", but it still cost almost $100 more than I self-calculated.  All said, we would stay here again, but it would have to be cost competitive.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Good water pressure and nice towels. The walls are thin or something because I could hear everything from the girls next door to the cleaning crew.

Yogurt or bodega style egg sandwiches (with runny yolk even, impressive) with OJ, water, coffee, tea. Very tasty and so convenient. I also took advantage of the free walking tour of the area that you can do. Informative and a nice perk.  \n\nThe Iroquois is close to many restaurants, Starbucks, subway stations. and stores.

I am always looking for accommodations that are centrally located and within walking distance of many of the city's attractions, exude a calming and peaceful environment when you walk through the front doors after you return from a day of exhausting sightseeing, provide fantastic service, and have a small bar or restaurant within the hotel for those times you would rather have a drink and a light meal in your hotel. The Iroquois checks all the boxes. The Lantern's Keep is intimate with pleasing decor.  Breakfast is included in your stay.  The staff is extremely personable and helpful.  Everyone we encountered was warm, welcoming, and very attentive.  The room was impeccably clean and beautifully furnished.  They also have an in-house fitness center and sauna if you have the time.

Unfortunately the restaurant was closed for refurbishment while we were staying so breakfast was served from the small bar at the rear of the hotel.

Most of the staff seemed pleasant, particularly the guys on the door.\n\nBut unfortunately, that's where the compliments stop because I did not enjoy my two night stay. The room was small, and the d\u00e9cor was not to my taste \u2013 1970s shades of brown with an awful patterned carpet (you say 'traditional' I say 'dated'). The bathroom was the size of a postage stamp with the toilet wedged between a wall and the sink, leaving zero space to move. There was nowhere to put toiletries, and the make-up mirror was awkwardly placed above the toilet making it difficult to use. There's a mini-bar fridge but it's the automatic kind with no space for your own items. The 'view' from my window was of construction scaffolding, and beyond that the wall of another building, making the room itself really dark and gloomy. The construction work meant that the carpet outside my room was covered in plastic, not great for the price point and star level. The room had AC, but it made a lot of noise. \n\nI did ask to move rooms, but was told that hotel was full and this would not be possible. Luckily I was busy with work and socialising, and spent little time in the hotel. I will definitely not be returning and would not recommend. ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The little extras were great (wine on Tues\/Thurs, grab & go breakfast, etc). But remember they are part of the resort fee you get charged, so do take advantage of them. Also having a glass of wine before heading out to dinner or the theater is nice.\n\nIf you are driving to New York there is a parking garage near the hotel but make sure you make a reservation. We didn\u2019t know that you needed to do that and were initially turned away. Thankfully the bellman stepped in and made arrangements. The garage apparently fills up fast so that may not always work. Taxis are plentiful around the hotel. Use them or uber. We booked the hotel \u201ccar\u201d because we were afraid we wouldn\u2019t be able to find a taxi and we had dinner reservations. It was expensive! We took an Uber back for less than a third of the price.\n\nThe room is comfortable. We couldn\u2019t hear our neighbors which is a refreshing change. The robe provided is nice to wrap yourself in after a shower. The only thing missing is a coffee maker. You can get a coffee\/tea in the Lanterns Keep and take it back to the room-but there\u2019s nothing like having a cup of coffee\/tea in your jammies in your hotel room.\n\nMake sure you remember that the $300 the hotel places on your credit card for incidentals will not be returned when you check out. It may take up to 10 business days to hit your account. So if you are using a debit card connected to your bank account be sure to factor that into your vacation budget.\n\nIf you want to explore Times Square or go to the theater this is a great hotel. And knowing the small details makes it even better and stress free.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"NONE"}

It did not disappoint.  \n\nSince it was just me, I reserved the least spacious (and most reasonably-priced) \"queen\" room. Despite being 200 sq. ft. it didn't feel small due to the triple window, clever arrangement, and high ceilings. Cozy but not cramped. Well placed closet keeps luggage, etc., out of the way. Small desk was handy. Elegant bathroom had ample storage surfaces, numerous lighting choices, and even a window. \n\nEnough about the room, the \"star of my stay\" was Emilio at the front desk, who from initial check-in,  numerous comings\/goings, check-out, and luggage retrieval hours later,  was indispensable.  He helped me find destinations, print a reservation, and even went on a treasure hunt for postcards\/envelopes for me to send. He is the kind who keep people coming back. ALL MY THANKS. \n\nBreakfast was included, and served in a space at the rear that appears to double as a bar, I'd gladly have a drink here on another visit.\n\nThe Iroquois is tucked in an elegant, yet quiet section of 44th Street, a nice refuge from the rest of mid-town.

When we got to the room, it was 77 degrees and very stuffy. Fortunately, we were able to open some windows for relief. While we were showering, someone walked into the room, and we had no idea they were there until we heard them talking. They announced that they were there to check the AC, but we were given no prior notice that they were coming. We informed them to come back later but they were already inside the room.\nThe next morning, while filling the bathtub, the water pressure suddenly dropped and then started spitting out foul water with muddy contents. When I called the front desk, they said they would send an engineer to check. It was close to an hour before anyone came to our room. When I explained the issue, he simply replied that someone must have exercised the main valve causing the contaminants in the line. We checked and found the same conditions were at the sinks and in the shower but eventually ran clear after about 5 minutes. \nWhen we went down for breakfast, we found a very limited menu of pre-prepared food and an overcrowded dining area with no open seats. The food was something you would find in a Best Western or similar motel.\nWhen we were checking out, the front desk staff just said sorry and offered no other compensation for our troubles. \nWe also notice that the door was left unmanned and the employee who seemed to be responsible for the door was hanging out by the front desk not offering to help with bags or anything of the sort.\nOur overall experience was poor at best and not a good value for the price. The ratings on Booking.com were certainly misleading and we would recommend that anyone considering this establishment think twice before booking.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"NONE"}

The location is great for my business as well as personal travel for theater. The restaurant used to have a well-prepared boutique Italian menu many years ago, but now functions as a bar in the evening and a place to get an inedible breakfast sandwich or yogurt in the morning. The rooms are quirky but nicely appointed and spacious enough. The staff is well-trained and welcoming. But the infrastruture has not kept up with appearance. Two antique elevators service all the floors and when there is a rush in the morning or evening, one can wait a long time to get to the room or out of the building. On this trip NOV 1-2 2022, the HVAC was broken. The room was ~ $600 nd the temperature was 77 degress. Fortunately, the windows on the back of the hotel could be opened to let in the night air, as well as every siren, truck backup signal and other NYC noise the city has to offer. The staff was helpful enough to move me to a \"slightly cooler\" room -- it was 73 degrees -- but the windows were fixed shut on the front of the building, so it was a hot night, and actually 76 degrees when I woke up. I really like this hotel and the location, but until they spend some money on infrastruture improvements, I'll be trying the other hotels on the same block.

The location is perfect for theaters and dining and the room rates are reasonable given the location and amenities.

The grab and go breakfast including coffee and juice was delicious with several options and was included with our room.  The two staff members attending the breakfast were so helpful and genuinely concerned that we got what we wanted given we were a few minutes late.  Also, we didn\u2019t realize hailing a cab at the time we needed one was nearly impossible, and the young man at reception worked diligently in the rain to secure one for us.  All hotels in this area are pricey (New York sales, hotel, and occupancy taxes can raise the rate up to 25%, but that\u2019s the same for all hotels) depending on the time of year, but this hotel distinguishes itself with exceptional customer service and incredibly friendly and helpful staff.","travelDate":"2022-10","tripType":"NONE"}

And after my stay, I'm not quite sure what hotel those folks stayed in! While my stay was fine, it should have been better in many regards, especially for a property that advertises itself as a \"luxury hotel\" and charges as much as it does.\n\nFor one, it's one of those places that seemed to cut a bunch of amenities \"for Covid\" and yet has not brought them back despite mandates and such ending. Turndown service is advertised; it's not offered. Room service is advertised; it's not offered. The free breakfast in the morning is really embarrassing\u00a0\u2013 disgusting microwaved egg sandwiches, lukewarm cheap coffee, and oranges that were way past their expiration date.\n\nThe room itself was fine. Nicely decorated. Cleaned decently, with some dust along the walls. Tight is of course standard for New York, but I expected a little more space given the price and SLH billing. An old fashioned TV and a shower with a busted handheld attachment that sprayed water in every direction.\n\nThe service was fine. Not particularly courteous or anticipatory. I was initially given a room different from what I reserved without any mention of it, without an explanation or apology.\n\nThe decoration throughout the hotel is nice, but then there are like, printed out paper signs in Times New Roman every so often. It's that kind of place, you know? You get the sense it was a tighter ship until a recent manager, perhaps.\n\nAt checkout, I happened to touch the big, pretty plant next to the front desk and noticed that it was made of plastic.

Our room was quiet enough, but the soundproofing was not as good as the Sofitel.  I could hear traffic noise, horns, trucks backing up, etc.  Ask for a room not on the street if that bothers you. Also, you could hear some noise from other rooms at times.  Not bad though.  I'm just used to the Sofitel which is pretty much silent.\n\nBreakfast was a prepacked choice of either yogurt, gluten free muffin, or bacon\/egg sandwich, and all of those came with an apple, tangerine, and bottle of water.  They have coffee too.  That was nice if you want something quick, and avoid going out.\n\nAll in all, I have to say the Sofitel is a bit better, but the Iriquois is cheaper, and I would definitely stay here again in the future.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

In total this is 3 mistakes around $1000 each, which seems a bit careless to me.\nI didn't notice this third charge until weeks later, which means they're also not balancing their books to make sure their charges line up with their bookings, so if left up to them they'd never notice their mistake.  On the phone they agreed it was a mistake and started the refund process, but neither call netted any sort of apology, explanation or assurance that they'd follow up, just BAU. \nI don't feel like this was a trustworthy experience.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"NONE"}

For all the hotels I\u2019ve had the chance to stay in, I don\u2019t expect things to be perfect from the get-go. I do, however, things would be solved efficiently and effectively should they pop up. The Iroquois New York probably has the best of the best staff members I\u2019ve ever met. I\u2019d like to extend my appreciation to David, Carlos, and two amazing ladies I embarrassingly don\u2019t remember the names of. From my early check-in to surprisingly early check-out, David and all the staff members have never made me feel ignored; they always attend to those matters earlier than they claimed. David\u2019s \u201c5 minutes\u201d is way shorter than my partner\u2019s \u201cjust a second.\u201d From the bottled water, to broken A\/C and room change, everything was done swiftly. I\u2019ll add onto that David\u2019s charming yet calming voices and smiles (under his mask of course) also make you feel like you\u2019re working with your close friends or family members. Staying at Iroquois is just like staying at home, not like any other hotel I\u2019ve stayed in. \n\nThe Iroquois New York also benefits from its closeness to Bryant Park and Time Square, yet it\u2019s far away enough from the crowds so you don\u2019t have to squeeze yourself through tons of tourists to get back. If anything, at least during my stay at the Iroquois, I had to reserve my spot at the gym and there\u2019s no breakfast on the property. However we can only blame COVID for this. Even if you don\u2019t like the diner Iroquois is partnered with, the Gregory\u2019s coffee David recommends is just across the street and it\u2019s amazing.

The bathroom was also very large,I love that it had a little window and that the floors were heated. The room temp. and cleanliness were a 5. There was turn down service in the evening. Large windows in the suite. The reasons I won\u2019t give the hotel above 4 stars- the elevator was tiny and took a very long time. We were on the 5th floor and often took the stairs. The lobby is small and the elevator is by the front desk and the people at\nthe front desk rarely spoke to us as we waited for the elevator or as we came in. The Lantern bar was open and popular, Friday night when we arrived, and we never saw it open again. I liked the room a lot, so if you are looking for a really good hotel room,  I highly recommend it.

Housekeeping service every day hotel was spotless.The location is fantastic just a short stroll to Nroadway and Times Square and yet complete silence in the bedroom at night for a great nights sleep I am not sure how they achieve this. Lovely wine and cheese reception on the Thursday evening we were there in the lobby really nice idea to meet some fellow guests. Wasn\u2019t sure about the tea coffee at reception  in the mornings rather than this facility in the room,before I went but have to say it was ideal no faffing around with small cups and cartons we could get a very good take away cup of coffee just outside the lift door and bring back to the room without all the mess.  The staff we met during our stay couldn\u2019t have been nicer or more helpful from the bell hops to the concierge and reception staff all willing to go that extra mile to oblige special mention to DJ  Irma and Oliver. Negatives ? I honestly cannot think of 1 except cocktails are pretty pricey in the cocktail bar but I suppose that\u2019s New York prices.

The front desk staff was welcoming and efficient, providing superior service and responding quickly with anything we needed.  \n\nThe location cannot be beaten with quick access to anywhere in midtown Manhattan just a few minutes walk away.\n\nThe Iroquois (Presidential) and Executive suites are a good size and offer a comfortable, quiet stay.  Quite enjoyed the heated bathroom floors and in the Iroquois Suite the steam shower.  It's also nice to have windows in the bathroom for the natural light.\n\nI agree with most of the reviews that the absence of a coffee maker or tea kettle does dilute the overall guest experience, but we did bring our own kettle and mugs, so it wasn't much of a problem for us.  We did have a Nespresso machine in our Iroquois Suite, but there were no capsules or coffee cups provided, so the device served no purpose. Also, there was a dining room table but no tableware, so we made do with paper and plastic from take-away places.\n\nAppreciate the chocolates left on the bed each night during turn-down service but would have to say housekeeping needs to pay more bit attention to service details as we had a couple of hiccups, but none severe enough to elaborate here.\n\nWe've enjoyed our last 2 stays so much that we've already booked our stay for 2021 and look forward to returning then.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"NONE"}

It has been completey renovated in a contemporary style although I miss the library off the lobby, which has been turned into a small space for relaxing. The restaurant was under renovation when I was there but there is a bar adjoining the lobby.\n\nPros: I stayed in a \"Superior\" room. It was small but adequate for one person. It may be cramped for two. The furniture is attractive and very good quality. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom is an adequate size with good shelf space. The bathroom floor is heated (nice touch!) although there was no instruction card and I couldn't figure out how to work the controls (I had to ask at the front desk). There was a walk-in closet with an ironing board, iron, safe, bathrobe and slippers. The front desk staff is exceptionally friendly, polite and caring, knowledgeable about nearby restaurants and always willing to help. I was offered a glass of prosecco or a bottle of water on check-in. There was wine and cheese in the lobby for guests on the Thursday night I was there. \n\nCons: I asked for a quiet room on a higher floor away from the elevators. My room had a small window over the bed with a view of a fire escape and the back of another building. I asked if there was a room with a better view available. None of the rooms have great views because the hotel is sandwiched between buildings. I was told that any other room wouldn't be as quiet so I stayed where I was. Heat throughout the space was not uniform. The window in the walk-in closet was old so the closet was cold and my clothes were cold when I took them out. The window in the shower stall also was old so the stall was cold until the hot water warmed it up. The heating system was loud when it cycled on. None of these were deal breakers for me and I would stay here again.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Ovviamente qualche piccolo suggerimento mi sento di darlo ma sono davvero piccole cose.\nPartiamo dagli aspetti positivi. Posizione. A piedi si raggiungono le principali attrazioni di NY ed \u00e8 anche vicino alla fermata della metro che porta ovunque. Il Personale della struttura si merita davvero un bel 9. Tutti sempre gentili sorridenti e disponibili a risolvere qualsiasi dubbio o perplessit\u00e0. Un super + va al ragazzo che ci stava sempre la mattina che aiutava con i bagagli, chiamava i taxi, insomma un po\u2019 un tutto fare ma che ha conquistato la simpatia di mio figlio. \nCamere piccoline come da standard di Manhattan ma ben curate e pulite. Abbastanza silenziose ( forse isolerei un po\u2019 pi\u00f9 le finestre) ed estremamente calde, sopratutto il bagno che aveva il riscaldamento al pavimento a volte anche troppo bollente. Non tantissimo spazio per riporre i vestiti ma alla fine mi sono attrezzata considerando che stavamo una settimana \nBiancheria del bagno cambiata tutti i giorni e molto pulita. Buoni i prodotti del bagno sopratutto la crema corpo davvero molto nutriente. \nWi-Fi gratuito abbastanza veloce. Ho usufruito del servizio lavanderia e considerando che stiamo a NY i prezzi sono davvero onesti.\nOgni giorno una bottiglia di acqua a testa come omaggio dalla reception e non \u00e8 male \nI suggerimenti che mi sento di dare sono: la pressione dell\u2019acqua della doccia da aumentare sicuramente. Manca il bollitore the o caff\u00e8 in camera cosa assurda nel 2020 e per una struttura di qualit\u00e0 come questa. \nCosto della colazione proibitiva ( 40$) a persona. Alla fine ho optato per usufruire a volte del caff\u00e8 che ti omaggia la reception e andare al market dietro l\u2019angolo e prendere biscotti, frutta e merendine spendendo un terzo. Comunque di fronte e accanto ci sono degli ottimi bar che hanno buone cose a prezzi pi\u00f9 onesti rispetto al bistr\u00f2 con cui \u00e8 convenzionato l\u2019hotel \nQuindi quando leggete ristorante  tra le cose che ha l\u2019albergo non calcolatelo perch\u00e9 viene tutto da fuori e vi conviene uscire direttamente voi.

It is a gracious and sincere service, not fake like many \"boutique\" hotels can be.\n\nThe always-spotless rooms themselves are super comfortable.  The heated bathroom floors are marvelous on a cold NY day.  The bed linens are exceptional.  The pillows are clouds of joy.  The beds themselves are amongst the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  The bathroom toiletries are pleasant and there is a full range of them.\n\nThe hotel itself is not large and has a cosy feeling and is super quiet at all times of days and night.  The front rooms face 44th Street and can have some road noise like all of NYC, but 44th is not super busy as it terminates at Grand Central just a couple blocks down so I have never had issues.  The interior rooms have no NYC noises at all.\n\nThe best word I can use to describe the Iroquois is cosy.  I rarely use that for a hotel.  It is the warmest term I can apply to a space and the Iroquois deserves it.\n\nI highly recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2019-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We upgraded to a Superior King Room which had an absolutely enormous bed. The room and bathroom were a good size and very well soundproofed, we didn't hear any other guest's TVs, showers, conversations or footsteps unless they walked directly past our door. The internet was strong and we had usb chargers in our bedside tables-a great touch, as was the heated bathroom floor. Our room was at the back of the hotel so we didn't have a view like some people have said but we really only used it to sleep in and prefer peace and quiet so it didn't bother us, neither did the lack of tea or coffee making facilities in the room, although the front desk staff did say we were welcome to come to the lobby for complimentary hot drinks and water. We thought this was a really good compromise by the hotel considering their bar and restaurant are still under renovation.\nThe staff were all very friendly and greeted us with a smile. We both felt we would rather stay in this fantastic little unique hotel than the larger resort style ones, particularly when you spend most of your time out in the city.

The newly renovated suite was nice and definitely value for money. Also the other rooms we booked were great. But like the suite, the entire hotel was boring in design  and hard it is to understand why you would make such poor choices in color and furniture when you are updating your hotel. \n\nAmenities as a coffee maker, bottles of water in the room and fresh flowers were missing. Bathroom was tiny for a suite but functional and a had good rain shower.\n\nStaff was friendly and efficient and location is great.  So far so good and a reason to come back.\n\nThe hotel is renovating and we knew that, and we tried to be flexible and understanding when elevators were blocked or working crew was irritated and not very friendly when we got back after dinner. I was understanding when they wet vacuumed the hallway on the 12th floor, had noisy heat blowers in front of my suite to dry the carpet and that we were informed that the sauna and fitness was also undergoing maintenance and not accessible.\n\nThis review would have been positive regardless that the complimentary wifi is not working very well and sometimes not working at all.\n\nThis review turned bad when on the last night I received a letter under the door. This letter was informing all rooms and suites on the 12th floor that someone had been smoking and that management was investigating and that you would be confronted with a $350 fine if you had smoked in your room. They also asked to report if you saw someone smoking.\n\nI am a non smoker , I don\u2019t like it when other people smoke, but I also think it is a huge mistake of management to decide to approach the issue the way they did. You sort of Make everybody a possible suspect. It leaves me with a bad taste and it is a horrible customer experience.\n\nEspecially when you consider that the whole day they were wet vacuuming the hallway and then had noisy massive heat blowers in the hallway without any written heads up from management. Apparently the hotel is more busy policing the guests than they are interested to ensure the guests have a flawless experience.\n\nSo purely based on this letter I most likely would not choose to stay at Iroquois in the future. I don\u2019t like to be considered a suspect! Solve guest issues in a different way. #unprofessional #1203\n\n","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Old-fashioned in all the best ways - no hip trappings and funky lighting, no undisclosed 'facilities charge' (a currently fashionable scam among NYC hotels which I can only hope one day results in a class action lawsuit), just a good honest concern for the welfare of its guests. It feels like a slice of an earlier NYC.\nThe staff are excellent - friendly, informal, always ready to help and creative in dealing with unforeseen issues.   Seriously, you can ask these people for anything and they'll find a way.\nMy room was recently refurbished and immaculately appointed in retro 1960s brown and beige, Norman Parkinson 1940s\/50s Vogue photographs, enormous and wonderful tiled bathroom (with a tub - hooray), plentiful towels and thick bathrobes.  Much attention has been paid to the bed (it always amazes me that so many hotels skimp on what is, after all, the main point of staying in a hotel) - it is huge and wonderfully comfortable.\nNB.  Renovations are currently underway at The Iroquois, and so the hotel is running at half speed - no bar or restaurant.  The desk staff were apologetic but clearly excited about what the place will be like once the work is done - and I share their enthusiasm.  Meanwhile, the sheer charm, value, efficiency and comfort of this place is enough to merit a 5* review even without the bells and whistles.\nI visit NYC a lot, and have tried a lot of different hotels.  In its philosophy of care and evocation of an older NYC, the hotel which the Iroquois most recalls for me is the The Mark on 77th\/Madison but at \u00bc the price.  My only reservation is that the Times Square radius is not my favourite area of NYC, but The Iroquois can't really help that and it's going to be my regular bolt hole in Manhattan from here on.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We like a smaller hotel with old world charm and enjoyed our stay. As other people have noted, the renovation work makes the lobby look like an apartment building and there\u2019s no restaurant or even drinks available (as was stated on the website). We missed having a coffee maker\/tea kettle in the room. (The fridge is full of costly things we don\u2019t drink.) A few times we had hot water brought to our room so we could make our own tea~adequate but hardly luxurious.\n\nThe room itself was of good size, comfortable and quiet with a generous closet with shelving and a safe. Bathroom was exceptionally nice: very roomy with useful shelves and extra long towel bars. A make up mirror and windows that open also a bonus. Staff we encountered seemed friendly although some were new and not that knowledgeable. I wanted to try the sauna but it was closed. To print boarding passes I had to email the front desk so they could print them.\n\nLocation was great. Easy to walk or take the bus and\/or subway to places of interest.

We received a call around 2:00 pm advising us that our room was ready.  We stayed in Suite 370.  The suite we were in was huge and everything in the room and central air conditioning worked as it should.  There was a mini-bar fridge stocked with items in the room with a small area for guest use.  Also noted, if you needed a fridge in your room for other items to store, guests would be accommodated.  We ordered one and a small fridge was delivered to the room and turned on.\n\nOther comments about the room include shades and drapes that kept the room quite dark out when it was light outside.  This was very nice.  The beds were very comfortable with 4 large pillows on our king bed.  The only small inconvenience was ice needed to be ordered each time vs. having a machine located somewhere in the hotel for self-serve.  Also, there was a lobby \/ restaurant renovation going on while we were there which only allowed for one elevator to be in service.  This made wait times for the only elevator serving the building to be well over 3-4 minutes at times.\n\nOverall, the room and hotel were excellent.  Vanessa, Tom and John were also very nice and had the perfect customer service skills.  Thank you all, we\u2019ll be back.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

My main gripe is I'm a big coffee guy. No coffee maker in the room and they only put coffee out in the morning (which wasn't very good).

The breakfast advertised at additional cost had to be taken at another hotel nearby. There was no functioning bar or caf\u00e9 and the restaurant had a sign saying \u201cRe-opening Summer 2019\u201d! There were sounds of banging and drilling during the daytime. \n\nDuring our stay, the hotel had only one functioning elevator for guests over 12 floors leading to waiting times of several minutes. \n\nWe have stayed in New York on many occasions and our \u201cDeluxe King Room\u201d was one of the smallest of our many stays. The bathroom was tiny. Perhaps the clue is in the first word of the group title \u201cSmall Leading Hotels\u201d. The room had the smallest closet I have ever seen which held precisely 9 hangers sideways on. No adequate room for setting up suitcases and no room to store clothes if you\u2019re staying more than a few days.

We were 1 of 2 couples traveling together for the 4th of July weekend. We finally decided on the Iroquois because I called in and had the pleasure of speaking to Kristoff. It is difficult to find someone willing to answer your questions and act as though they want to be of assistance. I booked this hotel based on this interaction with Kristoff and how nice and helpful he was.\n\nWe arrived and were greeted warmly by Kristoff and another lady. They promptly checked us in, Our rooms were ready, They had even put both rooms on the same floor. They also offered us a glass of prosecco (Which they had available at the front desk 24\/7).\n\nThe room was very clean and recently updated. I would not say it was spacious, but it certainly was not small and there was plenty of room for the 2 of us. The decor was stylish and the heated tile floor in the bathroom was a nice touch. The linens were high quality (Frette) and the bed was comfortable. Our room was also nice and quiet on the 8th floor. I would definitely recommend a room away from the elevator because it might not be so quiet there.\n\nThe location is very close to Times Square and the theater district. Fantastic location really, because you could walk to so many attractions in just a few minutes, but not have to deal with the shoulder to shoulder crowds on the sidewalk or the street noise.\n\nThe real highlight here is the employees. As nice as the hotel was, the staff out-shined all the other wonderful attributes of the Iroquois. I wish I would have written this as soon as I returned home, because I am unfortunately failing to remember some of the other names I wanted to mention.\n\nThe concierge- sweet girl who offered our friend her Blink182 ticket which we could not take her up on. Very friendly and engaging.\n\nNight time desk clerk- Oliver maybe? Always smiling and greeted us so warmly when we came in late in the evening and always offered us bottled water to take up to the room. There was another employee, I am not sure what his position was but I think his name was JJ, also always chatty and smiling. In fact, we did not encounter one single employee there that was not doing a great job and making us feel welcome.\n\nIn the lobby, they always have something out for the guests. In the morning it was coffee and tea, throughout the day it was iced water and juice, and in the evening it was iced water, juice, an alcoholic beverage of punch or wine, etc. They also had fruit and Hershey kisses. Speaking of the lobby....yes, the main lobby, Lantern's Keep, and restaurant are being remodeled so the makeshift lobby is small and unremarkable. That being said, it was still fine and designed well to isolate the construction which we never heard or saw. I do hope I get to go back and see everything once it is complete.\n\nGreat job, Iroquois..... you guys are definitely getting it right!!!!","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

A beautiful Boutique hotel frequently visited by no other than Barbara Streisand herself. The hotel is situated in the perfect location Mid town Manhattan which means we were within walking distance of all the best places to see. When leaving the hotel if you turn right it will take you to Times Square and Broadway when turning left you have Central Park and the Museum Mile. Our trip was firc11 days and we were able to see all the popular attractions as well as visit Coney Island, Queens, New Jersey  Ellis Island, not forgetting all the great places to eat. We found a place called Europia where we had our breakfsstcevery morning and a great pie shop called Two Little Red Hens in Lower Manhattan. The transport is brilliant just buy yourself one Metro ticket to share the fare is \u00a32.75 one way so just top it up when you need to. The Metro ticket can be used on the Air ztrain, the Subway, the Trams and the Ferry. Don't bother with the hop on hop off buses if you are ok walking as you will miss so much if you are not on foot. We covered 73 miles walking around this beautiful city and we would recommend the hotel 100%, however there are no tea making facilities on your room so we did go and buy a very small kettle for us to go have a nice cuppa each evening and early morning. There are tea and coffee provided to all guests each morning down in the lobby so you could pop down to get a warm drink but not during the evening as cold ice water is provided at this time as well as hibiscus tea and lots of Hersheys little kisses chocolates, which was a lovely little treat. All the staff are very helpful and courteous, the rooms are spotless and cleaned every morning. All together it was an amazing holiday and we would definitely return.

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":93396,"title":"Location is Everything in NYC","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-05-14","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"I've made no secret over the years I've been writing TripAdvisor reviews that I'm a big fan of the Small Luxury Hotels\u00a0brand. Recently my wife and I made our semi-annual visit to New York City to see a Broadway show (Come From Away), attend a concert at MSG (Billy Joel's 70th birthday bash), eat some great food (Oyster Bar at Grand Central Station and Keen's Steakhouse) and tour a few museums (911 Memorial and the Natural History Museum). The one thing about The Big Apple is that it never disappoints and is the very definition of world class. With that in mind I wanted to stay at a hotel that would live up to that billing without forcing me into bankruptcy at the same time. We found it at The Iroquois. Here's why.\n\nManhattan is a big island with a zillion things to do and see. You can take the subway quite reasonably to get anywhere on it and we use it a lot when we are in the city, but if I have a preference it is to walk. Only by walking can you really appreciate why New York City is, like London, Paris and Rome, a city that has a unique vibe of its own. That is why my first choice is always to stay in Midtown Manhattan. That's where you'll find Times Square, the Broadway theatre district, Madison Square Garden, the famous shops of 5th Avenue, etc., etc. etc. However, the last thing I want in a hotel is to be too close to the swarming crowds that can be claustrophobic at times. The Iroquois has a perfect location on West 44th between 5th Avenue and The Avenue of the Americas, two blocks from Times Square. The street is relatively quiet, but only a few minutes walk from Broadway. I've stayed in well over a dozen different hotels in NYC and none has had a better location than The Iroquois.\n\nI also like a little history in my hotels and The Iroquois has that as well. It is just coming up on 120 years of age and for most of its existence doubled as an apartment\/hotel with a number of luminaries as residents. James Dean lived here for two years. For a while in the 1980's it featured a cabaret restaurant run by the legendary Jan Wallman who jump started the careers of Woody Allen, Rodney Dangerfield, Barbra Streisand and Joan Rivers among many others. More recently the larger apartments were converted into what is now a 120 room boutique hotel.\n\nThe rooms at The Iroquois are quite typical of most New York City hotels, or at least the ones that ordinary mortals can afford. They are not large, but they are luxurious.\nLike all SLH hotels, the mattresses, linens and toiletries were excellent. I wasn't cracked about the minibar which had virtually no room to store our own beverages, but that was easily solved by having our own mini fridge brought up at no extra charge.\n\nThe bathroom had a heated marble floor and a really good shower with a great flow of water. That should be a given in any good hotel, but believe me, it's not. Also, I liked the fact that you didn't need to be an Einstein to figure out how to work the darn thing.\n\nYou can have the best built hotel in the world with the greatest amenities, but it doesn't mean a thing if the staff are not up to snuff. If they are surly or treat you as if you are an interloper or obviously expect huge tips for the most nominal of tasks, it will ruin the experience. The staff at The Iroquois were none of these. Many of them have worked here for decades. They were uniformly exactly what you would expect from a quality hotel - polite without being obsequious, friendly without pretense and there when you needed them. As an example, after checking in I could not locate my cell phone and figured I'd left it in the car which was now somewhere in the offsite valet parking garage. One of the guys on duty accompanied me the two blocks to the garage and we had a great chat about the city and life in general there and back.\n\nOn Tuesday's and Thursday's there is a manager's reception from five to six. These are not uncommon these days, but usually they are quite parsimonious with the spirits. Not so at The Iroquois where the glasses were refilled by the chap in the picture above as soon as they were half empty. He seemed genuinely determined to make sure everybody was having a good time and by six we definitely were.\n\nOne thing The Iroquois has that is quite unique is complimentary walking tours six days a week in conjunction with Streetwise New York\u00a0that start at six different hotels in Manhattan. On Sunday's the tour starts at The Iroquois and features highlights of Midtown Manhattan including Bryant Park, Grand Central Station and the New York Public Library. On other days you can make you way to other hotels and visit TriBeCa, Hell's Kitchen, the Upper West Side, NoMad and Times Square.\n\nOne thing I should mention for anyone who might be thinking of staying at The Iroquois in the next few months is that there are renovations taking place on the ground floor. The hotel's restaurant and lounge is currently closed.\u00a0 That's not a hardship because there are tons of great eating and drinking places nearby, but the hotel is also offering a food service from famed chef Daniel Boulud's db Bistro Moderne\u00a0which is literally right next door. For cocktails try the Blue Bar at The Algonquin which is just two doors down. Finally, if you want more than just a coffee for breakfast go just a few steps farther to The Red Flame Diner\u00a0which is as New York as you can get and could easily be mistaken for the fictional Monk's from Seinfeld.\n\nI've stayed in many hotels that are under renovation and it can easily ruin the vacation if the noise and construction dust are not controlled. I can honestly say that if they didn't tell you that there were renovations going on, you wouldn't notice it. There was no noise and no dust. In fact, for a New York City hotel The Iroquois is extremely quiet. I now have a reason to return when the revamped restaurant and lounge open in the late summer or early fall.\n\nSo, in conclusion, The Iroquois easily lived up to my expectations as an SLH member hotel","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"COUPLES"}

We knew the Iroquois was perfectly located, being very close to Times Square, Broadway shows, restaurants, Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave. and main lines on the subway.  However, we hadn't expected the Iroquois to be a place of great warmth and kindness, after losing my wallet in the cab on our way into the city from the airport before 9 a.m.\n\n     The Front Office manager, Christoph Duerrbeck, was so gracious and helpful, showing us that all the banks connected to our credit cards were a few blocks away, having housekeeping get our room ready quickly so we could relax, and even asking days later if the wallet had been found. He has a wonderful staff which truly made us feel like the hotel was home. \n\n They have recently upgraded the rooms, which have very comfortable beds and beautiful spotless bathrooms.  We appreciated how they set aside a small space in the mini fridges for guests to store their own water and how efficient and unobtrusive the housekeepers were.  Since we were out most of the time, we did not mind that there is no view from the windows, and it was extremely quiet.\n\nThe Iroquois would have undoubtedly been more pricey but we got better rates due to a remodel of the lobby, which does not affect the guests at all because it has been walled off.  We would recommend getting a slightly larger room if you are staying for a longer period.  We thought our Premium King was worth the difference.\n\n  We loved being able to walk to our 2 Broadway shows and the restaurants nearby.  The only places we used the subway for were the 9 11 Memorial and Hudson Yards, which were very easy to get to from the subways nearby.  \n\nNew York can be a impersonal place.

{"helpfulVotes":5,"locationId":93396,"title":"Always good to go home.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-04-16","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":5,"text":"Three years ago, I wrote a review stating that after staying at the Iroquois for many years, it had gotten expensively stale and just didn\u2019t compare with the amenities provided by more up to date hotels springing up in New York. I subsequently stayed at several excellent properties who then decided they would build on their growing popularities by adding a \u201cresort\u201d fee or \u201camenity charge\u201d. I have made it a matter of principle to refuse to stay in these hotels always letting them know that they should be ashamed  for charging what they should be including in the first place. I find it the worst of scams.\n\nHappily the Iroquois, which I must admit to missing staying at, does not indulge in such subterfuge (and hopefully never will) and I am happy to report that not only now does it compare as favourably with many of those same hotels, but it provides an even higher standard overall and at a relatively  lower and more reasonable rate\n\nThis was my second visit in the last 3 months and both times my visits were excellent and very comfortable. First the staff are exemplary and make you feel welcome and appreciated in every encounter. Being a light sleeper I always request a quiet room at the back of the hotel away from the street. Though the view is non-existent from the windows, it still allows you to see what the weather is doing but more importantly you don\u2019t hear a thing except maybe on the rare occasion in the evening or morning when thoughtless empty headed entitled fellow guests slam their doors when entering or leaving their rooms or decide to screech at each other while they are awaiting the elevators in the hallway in what they think are normal speaking voices.  \n\nHappily the refurbishment of the compact rooms includes the ability to control the temperature in the room where before it was centrally regulated. Also a great improvement is the fridge in the room which allows you to store your own beverages as it is an honour bar (how very civilized as opposed to those monstrosities that charge you in a heartbeat should you make the mistake of jostling anything) . The lighting in the room is also greatly improved and the bathroom with its rain shower head and great water pressure is a joy. The crowning achievement is the incredibly comfortable bed in which I sleep like a rock in with its wonderful linens and pillows. Also the internet is solid, consistent  and strong. \n\nThere are  still no coffee or tea making facilities in the room ( one would be hard-pressed to find room for them though the room does not feel cramped at all)  however there is delicious fresh coffee available in the lobby every morning which can be brought back to the room.\n\nI am so happy to have rediscovered the Iroquois after staying at pretty much every property on the block where it stands going all the way back to my first stay at The Royalton back in 1972 then after its makeover where the large spacious rooms were transformed into trendy little dark boxes, at the Algonquin before its myriad takeovers and renovations, then The Sofitel\u2026etc. \n\nHowever now that I think back overall I still prefer the Iroquois as, pardon the clich\u00e8 it really does feel like going home.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The negatives would primarily the be age and layout of the property including a dated lobby, strange flow towards the elevators, cramped hallways etc.  Not a big deal if you don't care about those things.  Overall, would happily recommend this as a high end 'value' property.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Among many things I appreciate (rooms, Location), I like to emphasize on service, i.e. the staff of the Hotel. I dare say that all those I came to know on my first visit are still working there (a good sign in itself) and I am grateful for that because it makes the Iroquois a special place for me. The reception is very friendly and quick, always keen to help. The doorman is like a friend. And Vanessa from Concierge has contributed so many times in helping to prepare my trips that I would not know half as much of NYC if she wasn't there. All are dedicated and fun to be with. Travelling a big deal, myself, I have yet to find a place to outperform this experience.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

The rooms are small and clean with quality linens and amenities. We have occasionally tried a different hotel but always go back to the Iroquois. Every single employee we have come in contact with has been professional and courteous. It is our hotel of choice in NYC. This last time, we received a call from the hotel, after we had checked out, telling us that we had left cash in the safe and that it was turned in by an employee, Derek. Needless to say, we were blown away that Derek had been so honest in alerting management to the found cash. We passed on our sincere thanks to Derek and gave him a well deserved cash reward. On top of this, Christoph and Vanessa went above and beyond in securing a money order for the remaining cash and mailing it back to us, as we had already left town. Stay here for the quality hotel and the quality people that work there. The Iroquois has our loyalty forever and remains our hotel of choice in NYC. Thank you Derek, Christoph and Vanessa.","travelDate":"2019-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}
