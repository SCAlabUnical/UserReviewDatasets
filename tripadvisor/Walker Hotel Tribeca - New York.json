However very pricey despite 20% discount for hotel guests. There was steamer in the rooms - small but effective. Would have prefered a coffee machine and fridge in the room so I did not have to wait for the cafe to open. \n\nCons:\nCleaning was very bad. We had 3 rooms and several were not cleaned every day unless we called reception and even then they could not get hold of cleaning (probably outsourced and not committed). They simply forgot was the answer, but they could send us some towels. And when they cleaned it was very bad. Floor was very dirty with weeks of old dust in clusters on the floor, and on day where the sheets were changed we found a clear trace of shoe-print ON the newly changed sheet in the bed (see pictures). \nThe rooms were extremely small and NO fridge and NO coffee machine. So until next morning NO coffee available in the hotel. It is simply NOT a quality hotel regarding cleaning or . But unfortunately also regarding management and staff attitude. The manager Jay was not attentive, positive and proactive - and neither was his staff. Simply not a positive and caring experience you would expect. Especially when you experience cleaning problems in several rooms. Despite multiple problems during our stay we never heard one single \"sorry, we will handle this\". Or a smile for that matter. One staff said that we had forgotten to put up a sign that we needed cleaning - which is not true. You have to put up sign IF you do not need cleaning. Again customers were accused of things with a negative attitude. Except from the staff in the small cafe in lounge area - they were very kind - but they were not from the hotel.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The room assigned to me was astonishingly tiny, with a bed that barely accommodated one person, let alone offering any comfort for a restful night. The cleanliness of the room was just average, which is not what one expects when looking for a pleasant hotel experience.\n\nTo my dismay, nearly half of the room (a loft) was left unfurnished and appeared as though it hadn\u2019t been cleaned in quite some time. This lack of attention to detail in maintaining the room was surprising and frankly unacceptable. Given the ample availability of rooms at the hotel, it baffles me why I was assigned this particular room on the lowest floor, which only added to the overall disappointment.\n\nThe layout of the room was another point of frustration, with the bed squeezed into a corner, touching three of the four walls. This not only made the space feel even more confined but also highlighted the lack of thought put into guest comfort.\n\nMoreover, the noise level in the room was unbearable. The constant clamor made it nearly impossible to enjoy any moment of peace or get a good night\u2019s sleep. This aspect alone significantly detracted from the quality of my stay.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there are much better accommodation options in the area that offer more value for money, better facilities, and a more enjoyable stay overall. I would strongly recommend prospective guests to consider these alternatives before deciding to book a room here.\n\nIn summary, my stay was marred by a series of disappointments, from the cramped and poorly maintained room to the excessive noise and below-par cleanliness. It\u2019s clear that this hotel needs to reevaluate its room assignment practices and significantly improve its standards to ensure a pleasant stay for all guests.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Although we didn't eat at the restaurant in the hotel we did take advantage of the caf\u00e9 and Speak Easy. The Speak Easy was quaint and the live music was phenomenal. Our room was very comfy even with the size - they made great use of the space and we were even upgraded to a bigger room upon arrival. The only downside to the room was that since there is no exhaust in the bathroom the room got hot when we showered and even with a towel down the floor was still wet. We arrived really early at check in but the staff (Edwin, Bridgette and Brandi) were extremely accommodating (drinks, answering questions) and they allowed us to check in a bit early without being charged. We were able to sit in the lobby area and they checked out bags while we went out with no issue. The staff were friendly and we loved our complimentary bottle of wine which we switched out for snacks (yogurt covered pretzels ad mixed nuts) :) If you haven't stayed here before I would highly recommend!","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The night prior to arriving in NYC, I called to see if we could have access to one room to drop our luggage and freshen up from the flights. The person over the phone said just to show up and there will be an option available. I would've preferred some assurance, or a plan to avoid the convo again when checking in. When we arrived, sure enough I had to give the whole spiel, and was told that they didn't say that, and they meant I could store them in a closet. I've been to many hotels and understand what's available and how it works. Anyways, we got a room after my lecture. The room had a pubic hair on the pillow, a large dip in the ground upon entry, the door threshold cracked had to SLAM the door to close it, toothpaste or something on the bathroom light switch. Just not comfortable and not what a room should be like. I figured I would just accept it and after the AC not working that night, knew I couldn't spend more nights there. The night desk agent was helpful and switched my room, and when going into that one, there was another pubic hair and stains on the vanity counter, in addition to the issues of leaking showers. There are definitely structural issues and water issues happening in these rooms.\n\nOne night, I was walking to show my sister Saint Tuesday. The young male host attendant  spoke to me so nasty and sarcastic, I was embarrassed and angry about it. I chose to accept it, but now wish I would have given it back to him. Completely unprofessional, rude, and uncalled for. I think he forgot who the host was and who the guest was. When I told the same night agent, she apologized and offered a late check out. Why the hell would I want to stay in this place longer? Not an acceptable resolution. Very disappointed and will never stay again, despite many trips each year to the city. The pictures definitely paint a different experience.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

I had to choose a hotel. I had not been in a NY hotel in many years, because I always stayed with him or friends. The hotel's name came out  of a string of names on Booking.com. The price was reasonable, the proximity to my son's home and City Hall ideal, so it came as an easy pick. What a pleasant surprise  then, as I entered the hotel, to have memories flood back from the Tribeca Grand or other great hotels from 30 years ago, when my son and I would go up to the City on a whim, for a weekend and come back to DC the next day after dining at a good restaurant and seeing an art show, or two. My room was very small, monastic, I could say, and perfect for me. Barely the size of the very comfortable king-size bed, with a very large window overlooking the street, it offered a glimpse on Tribeca worth of a Hopper canvas. A wall armoire with a tiny washbasin next to it, and a modern bathroom with two shower jets completed the picture. Mini-perfect. Beside all of that. however, what really stood out was the kindness and the promptness of some staff: I regret not asking the names of the women on the floor (4th) who were very kind. However, two individuals at the concierge stand stood out: Nelson, the very affable, smart and engaging gentleman who helped me with my luggage, a reminder of how people from other cultures can add texture and humanity to what are considered humble jobs and Randon, who very kindly replaced my room key, that I had lost somewhere.\nWould I come back? in a heart beat.","travelDate":"2024-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

The hotel is modern and stripped back, it's an interesting building.  It is in a downtown area, which is quite rundown, I wouldn't stay here again, leaving the hotel meant getting hounded to buy fake bags and sunglasses. (I know that TriBeca is coming up and seen as a trendy area).   \n\nAs everyone says, the rooms are SO SMALL - it is almost funny.  I did know this, but it was still a shock. Even the bathroom is tiny so getting out of the shower, turning and getting past the loo.... all comical.  We are slim people.  The room was cleaned badly, one day we got no hand towels at all, another day dirty laundry from another room had been left on our floor, and there was bits of someone's broken jewellery on our floor the entire stay. The room had some cool touches like the electric blind. However I wanted a towel rain, a bigger wardrobe and a coffee machine.  \n\nThe Hotel just seemed a little run down. \n\nOn our last day we booked a taxi to the airport directly with the hotel, they forgot to book it. I overheard one manager admit this, then he came over and made up an excuse about the driver having an accident and he would get me a new car.  I prefer honesty myself. \n\nThe caf\u00e9 directly above reception is so slow, and the guy never smiled, and just looked fed up to be there.  No trays, no cupholders. A slice of carrot cake for 12dollars! \n\nOverall, it was an ok 2\/3star hotel. \n\n","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

It will be up to the reader to decide if I'm being too critical in my rating. When I arrived, my room's AC didn't work. I called the front desk and was promptly moved to a new room over the course of an hour, after troubleshooting. Also, during my stay, I was stuck in the elevator with some other guests. We called for a repairman. But thankfully, those of us stuck in the elevator put our heads together and used a combination of key cards and pushing of buttons that somehow opened the door again, so that we were only in there for mabye 15 minutes. The hotel staff was engaged and apologetic as I encountered these unusual tech difficulties on my visit. \n\nOn to the hotel amenities. There is a welcoming first floor with two coffee shops on either side of a living room style seating area. The living room area has nice couches with side tables and low coffee tables, and two desks spaces side by side against the wall. There are two bars, one on the rooftop and one in the basement of the hotel. The rooftop has a great view and it is worth going up there with a camera. However, I do not recommend buying a drink unless they improve their bartending. The basement bar is a speakeasy style styled place, which I believe may have jazz musicians at some point, but I don't remember seeing them when I visited. This bar is far superior to the rooftop bar, it has excellent bartenders and unique and delicious cocktails -- what you would expect for any other excellently staffed bar in the city. \n\nThe rooms are clean and on the small side. I'd compare the feel of them to the offerings at the Arlo hotel in Soho, though newer\/cleaner, and the Walker Hotel rooms had city views that surpass the Arlo. I had a view of the intersection of Broadway and  Canal. And the hotel is far enough removed from the street traffic, and is on a quiet street. I don't remember hearing any noise from the traffic (and I'm pretty sensitive to noise). \n\nThe location is great for getting out and exploring the city! You're just a couple blocks from SoHo. And if you don't mind walking, its a nice stroll from the hotel into many interesting neighborhoods (soho, chinatown, fidi, greenwich village, west village, east village, lower east side), and several subway lines are a within a 2-5 minute walk from the doors of the hotel.

Hotel has a very hip, trendy, cool vibe. Check-in was easy. Room was quiet in a very noisy area.\n\nNow, the bad: My husband had specified that it was our 20th anniversary when making the reservation, and my mother-in-law had called to pay for one of our nights as a surprise gift and while speaking to the front desk, also requested that something celebratory be sent to our room to mark the occasion. We stayed for three nights and nothing was ever sent.\n\nUpon returning to our room the first evening after a long day, we discovered that our television wasn't working. We called the front desk and they informed us that the engineer had gone home for the evening due to illness, but the front desk manager would come to our room to try to resolve it. Well, she did not, and insisted the problem was that we were not able to connect our personal devices to the web-based server. Not only had we never heard of having to connect a personal device in order to watch tv, there were also no instructions to be found anywhere in the room or during the check-in process to inform us. Miraculously, the tv was working the next day, but it was a disappointment. The front desk person offered to send us up a bottle of wine, but it was 11 pm, we were exhausted, and I don't drink. Other than that, there was no attempt to try to make things right, or a clear plan as to how the issue was going to get resolved.\n\nThe room was small. I mean REALLY small. My husband had to crawl over me in order to get into bed at night. The shower\/toilet area was TINY and the sink was outside of the bathroom in the main area. The bathroom door was a barn-style door and was broken. I get that it's New York, but for $500\/night, I was hoping for a little more space.\n\nThere is a resort fee of $34\/night and I'm not quite sure what that is for as there is no pool, or any other amenity that would justify that kind of charge. The front-desk manager removed that from our bill when we explained our dissatisfaction, but I'm really not sure why it exists in the first place.\n\nSadly, this wasn't a great experience for us. We love New York but this property fell short of our expectations in numerous ways.\n\n","travelDate":"2023-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The reception is located one floor below, so you are checked in away from the hustle and bustle, great for privacy. There is also a casual lounge area with low sofas and chairs, and a communal table which many were using as a co-working space so it gave the hotel a friendly buzzy atmosphere as soon as you enter and throughout the day.\n\nI requested a high floor as I had been wowed by the reviews on social media of the downtown views, and as the hotel staff were only too happy to help, when I entered my room I wasn\u2019t disappointed. The room itself was lovey and spacious, and I was also lucky enough to get an upgrade to a \u2018Walker Cozy King\u2019, which featured an ultra-comfy bed, a desk for those who need to work, a leather chair, and full wardrobe. The hotel rooms have made excellent use of space so you have room to move around while it remains light and airy. The shower and toilet were neatly tucked away and I actually found the sink - which was in the main room - much better situated as I could do my morning routine much more conveniently. And as many hotels have been removing perks, it was really encouraging to find a robe, as well as a steamer, and daily bottles of water, which was a necessity during my stay as temperatures hit the 100s. The rooms under bed storage also allowed me to hide away luggage, something I rarely find in other hotels. The hotel is conveniently located next to several stations which run along Canal Street, so you have plenty of options whether you are going uptown, downtown, or to Brooklyn.\nI chose the hotel for its location and vibe, but also the fact that it has its very-own rooftop, as well as a restaurant and a speakeasy-style bar. But the rooftop was the star of the show, you are given access by staff at the hotel, and the current partnership with The Flower Shop meant the seating area and bar had a vibrant floral theme as its d\u00e9cor. Make time to spend a few hours up there as the sun goes down, and order \u2018The Pirate Rose\u2019 cocktail, you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nI cannot recommend this hotel enough, it really elevated my impromptu trip to New York, from the staff, to the location, and the rooms, going forward this will be my go-to hotel when I\u2019m in the city.","travelDate":"2023-07","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

However, this time, I could clearly see how the hotel has gone downhill despite the upgrades with the roof and restaurant.\n\nThe rooms itself seemed to be in degrading condition. I first checked in to Room 204 and none of the lights or shades worked. We were moved to Room 208 and it was better. We checked out to go upstate but came back for one night and checked into Room 1012. The AC did not work and it was about 78\u00ba inside. Maintenance came to check on it and they insisted it was fine but would check downstairs and to give them an hour. It was not fixed but at that point, we were so exhausted from our travels we just ignored it and slept since we had to wake up at 4am for our flight home. Room 1012 also had floorboards that seemed to be extremely warped (there's a pretty big dip in front of the bathroom so I would check for mold or water damage).\n\nUltimately, not worth the price anymore even if the location and lobby were great. Please fix.\n\nIn addition, we requested a mini fridge for both stays. On our first stay, they said repeatedly they would send one up but never did so we gave up.

Ask for a room on the higher floors to get an unobstructed view of the city. The lower floors face an old factory looking building. The room came with a motorized blind that wasn't good enough as a blackout so daylight streamed in which made it hard to sleep in, especially when dealing with jetlag. \n\nOn a positive note, this hotel is very close to SoHo with lots of shopping (5-10mins walk away) and about 30mins walk away to the Pier where you can take a boat ride to see the Statue of Liberty or walk on the Brooklyn Bridge. 3mins walk away from the Canal St subway station.\n\nNote this hotel doesn't serve breakfast on the weekends, only brunch from 10am, which was quite disappointing as we expected breakfast that was included in our room rate.\n\nAlso, there are stairs leading up to level 1 and lower lobby. When asked about accessibility, the hotel staff didn't seem to know how these areas could be made accessible. Perhaps there is a gap in increasing the awareness of the staff or building the hotel with more accessibility features.

We are not sure wht is aonsidered the norm for a US hotel but as much as there were many good points for this hotel there were also a lot not so good.\n\nCheck in was really easy although we were a bit early and our room was not ready even though the couple we were travelling with room was.\nWe were put on the 6th floor. There are two lifts which are spacious but are quite dark so it is difficult to see the numbers of the floors as they are not lit up. So yuo end up bending down and squinting to see the number of the floor you wish to go to.\nThe room was clean, tidy and well lit. The wardrobe was spacious and a free safe was installe in it. We were not keen on the sink in the bedroom however but am guessing this is something to do with it being a boutique hotel. The shoer had plenty of room and water was always hot.\nNice big TV on the wall which only didn't work once but a maintenace guy was quick on hand to sort the problem.\nThe room had nice big windows but a big downside is that they are not soundproofed and with NY being a 24hr city our sleep experience was not very good. Cars tooting horns, people shouting and sanitation vehicles collecting through the night made for a restless nights sleep.\n\nLocation is good with Chinatown on the doorstep and Little Italy around the corner. Not far to walk to Brooklyn Bridge and subway easily within reach at Canal Street.\nThe main hotel foyer on the ground floor seemed to be more a coffee shop and open to the public so seating was sometimes hard to get. We did not see a lounge or bar in this area. We were told that they had a 'speakeasy' in the cellar which is accessed via an outside door. We went down once and one drink as a coctail was $22 which is crazy prices. Drinks in general were very expensice and no draft beer.\nWe went to the Square Diner for breakfast each morning which is just around the corner.\n\nAll in all it is an ok hotel and location is its attraction more than anything else. We wouldn't stay again as it just didn't appeal to us and expensive for what it is. The staff were always friendly and helpful though.\n","travelDate":"2023-04","tripType":"COUPLES"}

City\/traffic sounds) you might want earplugs, but I felt it was on par with any other city I\u2019ve stayed in. ","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"NONE"}

Mercedes checked us in and was wonderful to bring us a tea pot and cups. Ironing board and iron and a second bench bc our closet was not sufficient. The regular rooms are extremely small and the bathroom sink is in the room. The close in the largest room leaves you six inches to hang clothes off the hangers.

Bed and pillows we average. Not drawers. No 24 hour room Service. I believe it ends at 6pm. \nRestaurant: had breakfast and for us (from the UK) was very expensive however for New York rates I suppose it was normal.

The main reason I am writing another review is that I checked out 2 weeks ago and am yet to receive the refund of the $200 deposit the hotel asks for upon arrival. This is simply unacceptable. They say it's been paid but provide no paperwork to prove it. It's \"virtual\" so they cannot provide proof of payment. That is unheard of, any payment I have ever made can be traced somehow.

It then never arrived. I later queried about surprise gift with a different staff member, he was very rude, said they had no record of it (even though the staff on arrival knew about it) and said that they \u2018don\u2019t do that\u2019. \nDay 2: Went back next day, complained about rude staff member and was told again that they \u2018don\u2019t do surprise gifts\u2019 even though I had email proof of the conversation of me pre-arranging it. I was then given wine in a can - appalling.\nDay 3: room not cleaned, blue light ignored by staff, had to request it to be cleaned. Requested new bottles of water, staff said \u2018we don\u2019t give out bottles of water\u2019\u2026we literally had them the first two days! They responded with \u2018that\u2019s weird\u2019.\nDay 4: room STILL not cleaned, blue light ignored by cleaning staff again. When asking for the second time, staff member was rude and said \u2018you\u2019ve already told us once\u2019 \nDay 5: room cleaned but shower gel not replaced, had to go down to retrieve more ourselves. Also, had to wait over 10 minutes for someone to show up to take us to the rooftop bar.\nDay 6: toilet paper not replaced, had to go down to retrieve more ourselves.\nDay 7: check out staff member was blunt, seemed like she couldn\u2019t be bothered with her job.\n\nAll in all, the staff do not seem to communicate to each other, or know what is expected of them to perform their roles to the expected standard. When queried they are rude and many of them seem like they don\u2019t want to be there at all.\n\nDaily room cleaning and toiletry replacement is the absolute bare minimum you expect of any hotel, so to have that missed twice and the staff be rude when requesting it is completely unacceptable. The hotel is a lovely environment and in a great location, but the incompetence of the staff really puts us off ever recommending or returning to the Walker Hotel.","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Its a struggle to fit two people in even the largest of rooms with luggage. Hardly any closet space and the bathroom is tricky.\nSecondly, the staff at this establishment are despicable, bar one guy, who is Jamaican, who helps with luggage. He was the only friendly and respectful person employed by this hotel and offered suggestions on what to do in the blistering heat, which was more local than the tourist hot spots. The cleaning in our room was not substantial as they found earrings that didn't belong to me and left them on the counter even though they were covered in junk\/dust.\nThirdly, which brings me to the most heinous point of all. I had a sentimental plushy which was given to me by my partner when we first met 8 years ago. The cleaners somehow took this from our room, and presumably got caught up with the sheets. When we reported it to the reception they told us we were lying because 'why would a cleaner want that' and said we must have misplaced it because the cleaners said they left it in our room. We were in no way accusing them of theft but explained to this incredibly rude woman on reception that we suspected it was caught up. She denied they had it explicitly and was not helpful. We checked in for the rest of our trip to see if it had shown up but were met with the same attitude. We left our details, so if they did indeed find it, it could be returned to us ASAP as, stated above, it holds extreme sentimental value.\nA few days after we left, my partner did in fact receive an email from Mercedes, saying they unsurprisingly had found the plushy. There was no apology, and no time frame stated as to when this needed to be collected. As myself and my partner do not live in the US, we enlisted the help of a friend to collect but they weren't able immediately as were working in LA. My partner called to check a couple of weeks ago about when this could be sent to us as we realized it may take too long only to find that the hotel had thrown it away. We received no communications from them stating that it needed to be collected before x date. They just decided that they would throw something away we specifically had asked them to find. THAT THEY HAD TAKEN FROM US IN THE FIRST PLACE.\nThis hotel ruined my birthday and has lost something that to me was priceless.

There is a 2-inch gap between the door and the wall opening to the bed and facing the toilet - not the most discreet of setups if you're hoping to give anyone privacy\n- Elevators were really fast for building height at rush hour times (departing for work) \n- There was a lightbulb burned out in our room that never got replaced and the in-wall buttons for lighting and window blinds were SUPER inconsistent when and how they worked - this was super annoying","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"NONE"}

While the rooms are small and narrow (I stayed in a Queen room), they are equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay. They even provide plush bathrobes! I stayed for 6 nights and asked for a mini fridge in my room to keep some snacks and beverages which they gladly provided. Due to Covid they don\u2019t clean the room every day, but ask that you request housekeeping a day before. I only had my room cleaned and replenished once while I was there and for me that was fine. There\u2019s a great rooftop bar with exquisite views which is definitely worth checking out. They also have an underground speakeasy serving craft cocktails made beautifully by Alex (I\u2019m sure there are other bartenders but he was there when I went and he\u2019s as skilled as they come). There\u2019s live music too!!\n\nThe location is great because the hotel is within walking distance to China Town, Little Italy, Tribeca and the Financial District. It\u2019s about a 30 minute walk to the West and East Village and a little shorter to Soho. \n\nI would totally stay at The Walker again, however I\u2019d like to try their location in the West Village because that\u2019s the neighborhood I grew up in.

On Mon 10\/04, I started getting bites on my ankles. Tuesday 10\/05 I started to feel raised bumps on my arm and on Wed the bites were painful and itchy. I asked for a new room and got placed in a new room. At this point I was hoping they were hives or an allergic reaction. I submitted pictures to a dermatologist through the teladoc service through my insurance and she responded right away that the bites were most likely bed bug bites. I learned that bed bugs bite in a line called \"breakfast, lunch, dinner\" configuration (you can see this along my elbow in the attached pictures). I immediately notified the front desk and checked out of the hotel. I was supposed to stay at friends' places for the rest of my stay but couldn't risk bringing bed bugs to their homes so had to buy a new flight home earlier than expected. \n\nThe hotel said that in order for me to get a refund they were having an inspection done of the room.  They would refund me if they found bed bugs but if they didn't, i would still have to pay the full amount. They called me the next day and said they didn't find evidence of bed bugs and they offered a discount on my next stay. I understand that they have to protect themself from saying they are at fault; however, given that I incurred the costs of medical appt, medication, new flight, new hotel, cleaning supplies, laundromat, dry cleaning, new luggage, plus cutting my trip short it is very, very painful for me that I still have to give them >$1,000.  \n\nSome things I've learned: \n1. Even seemingly nice hotels can have bed bugs\n2. Always do your own check. When I left the room, I was really hoping they were hives so didn't check myself. I'm also going to do a thorough check every time i get to a new hotel.\n3. Don't get too upset about things that you can't control.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"SOLO"}

The bathroom door does not completely close (it is a sliding door and leaves a big gap with a nice view of the toilet when \"shut\"). We were in a king room and that means that the rest of the space is the bed. All of the space. You cannot walk around the bed and if two people are in it, one must climb over the other to exit. There are no chairs (one little bench where you might put your suitcase). The space is comically small. One other weird feature: our TV would not shut off. I would turn it off with the remote and it would turn itself back on a few minutes later, showing the welcome splash screen for the hotel. So, a 50 inch night light. I called the front desk and their solution was to tell me to unplug it. Which I did -- but that involves climbing around on the bed.

I often wrote down the names of hotels to try as we walked by, so when our son needed to be in NYC for work for a few weeks, but did not want to be locked into a lease, I called the Walker Hotel in Tribeca, which was on my list.  Peter, the manager, was exceedingly flexible, making our son's temporary home\/office comfortable.  The room was bright, with white walls and large windows that open and an incredible view, which you seldom find in the city.  Frances took time on the weekend after he was technically off duty to make sure my son's computer was hooked up properly and helped him get the supplies he needed to work efficiently in the hotel.  I have not seen this level of customer service in quite some time, so it was refreshing to be treated so well.\n\nThe hotel is new, so the rooms are clean and modern, with a high-speed network for those that may need to stay and work for more than a few nights.  The location was ideal, just off of Broadway, with proximity to my son's office and all the food and supplies he needed.  It has a neighborhood feel, with access to shopping and entertainment just footsteps away.  There is a great coffee shop called the Blue Bottle in the lobby, so you are never far from all that you need. \n\nWe have finally found the boutique hotel experience we were looking for.  Once Covid is behind us, and we can return to the great city of NY, we will only stay the Walker Tribeca. Thanks again, Peter and Frances!","travelDate":"2020-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

From the beautifully decorated rooms and common areas, to the glorious waterfall shower that worked wonders after a long shift, to the prime location of the hotel, I simply can\u2019t say enough good things about this place. The most important take away from the whole experience was the incredible staff, Peter and Dominic; to say that they are phenomenal is a huge understatement. They went well above and beyond their duties and truly made me feel a sense of normalcy during my almost four-month stay at the hotel. Back in April when everyone was living off of panic and fear and having just gotten off of a flight that included three other people, to landing in an eerily quiet JFK airport, to seeing absolutely no one on the streets of New York City on the drive over, I was pretty anxious arriving at the hotel. I pride myself on being the first frontline healthcare worker that checked in and I realized pretty quickly the camaraderie between the staff and the guests. Peter and Dominic became a source of constant comfort during the trials and tribulations of this pandemic, working the frontlines, and just being alone in this big city. They helped me navigate the metra station, opted to give me two mini refrigerators and a coffee machine, and suggested different places I should see during my time there. As the weeks meshed together and my hours on the job became a blur, I looked forward to seeing familiar faces at the end of the day and it was such a valued outlet to unwind a bit with them. Working on the frontlines of this pandemic is an experience I will remember forever, but staying at this hotel that is made up of a million little things that they continuously did to make my journey easier, is something I will always cherish and be grateful for; it\u2019s just a true testament to who they are as people and the fantastic services provided at this hotel which makes a key difference with any hotel experience. I recommend Walker Hotel TriBeCa to anyone visiting New York City but also, to people living there looking for a wonderful getaway. I look forward to staying at this hotel again and seeing it in all its non-COVID-19 glory. Thank you once again, Peter and Dominic! I miss you, guys!","travelDate":"2020-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

That being said, Walker Hotel Tribeca has gone above and beyond anything I've experienced!  I'm the type to rely on reviews but rarely write anything so believe me when I say I wanted to share my wonderful experience.\n\nMy entire stay was Amazing but the cherry on top was definitely the service.  The entire staff was extremely helpful in attending my needs but also in going the extra step to help me feel at home, both in their hotel and in a new city.  Their recommendations of places to visit were delicious to try and beautiful to visit.   Among them, many places I probably wouldn't have known otherwise, being a tourist.  I'd like to bring special attention to 2 of my favorite individuals there, Peter and Dominic. In addition to being extremely professional, these two made me feel welcome as a friend.  I'm sure I don't need to tell you how welcome that is during these Quarantine times.\n\nThe hotel:  a sleek, modern design that gracefully treads the line between intimate and comfortable.  While still maintaining all the Covid-19 protocols, they've done remarkably well at ensuring I don't feel like I'm speaking to someone through plastic.   My room was among the most relaxing I've every stayed, including my own back home!  The hidden gem here would have to be the rooftop.  They have an assortment of tables and chairs that help you relax while drinking in the gorgeous view of New York. \n\nAll in all, my only regret is that I couldn't stay longer.  You'll see that I've given them an Excellent rating but I wish I could have given one that was even better. I highly recommend that you try this hotel for yourself and I sincerely believe your stay will be as good as mine was.","travelDate":"2020-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

We stopped by to see the hotel on12\/29. As soon as the door was opened for us, we knew the place was special. Steven welcomed us and asked how he could help. We told him we were checking in the next day, but wanted to stop by and see the place before having lunch.  He offered up several local restaurant suggestions and was just extremely friendly and seemed to genuinely want to help. We wound up taking him up on one of his recommendations, having lunch at Nha Trang One, a local  Vietnamese restaurant (highly recommended). When we came back the next day to check in, Miguel greeted us at the door and told us to leave our bags, stating that he would bring them to our room for us. The front desk staff was extremely helpful, very nice and all smiles. What a great start to our stay! Miguel went to the room with us, showed us a few things inside the room then left. He could not have been nicer or more helpful. We loved our little room! The king sized bed took up the majority of the space, but we didn\u2019t mind. It was exactly what we wanted. The shower was great, and housekeeping cleaned our room for us every day as we left to explore the city. Also, every time we called the front desk to ask for ice to be brought up, we were pleasantly greeted on the phone. Upon checkout Miguel again took care of us, comparing the hotel\u2019s car service rates to Uber\u2019s so that we wouldn\u2019t pay too much. Miguel remembered where we were from when we had talked about football during checkin, and asked if we were heading home. Having grown up with a father who was a longtime Marriott general manager, I have experienced customer service at a very high level. And at the Walker Hotel Tribeca, I witnessed some of the best yet. Every staff member was friendly, helpful and almost always had a smile on their face. It was truly \u201cnice to come home\u201d every day after bouncing around the city.

","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-11-14","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":3,"text":"I really wanted  to like this hotel as I always love staying in a new property.   Shiny new and at its best. Not in this case.  \nThis is just a slightly off hotel.  It has lots of little flaws that end up leading to a disappointing stay.   \n\nOverall the design is flawed in so many ways.  Looks great.  Works poorly.  \n\nThe bedroom is tiny.  I know people have mentioned this & excused it as a NYC thing.  And you can see the dimensions  when you book. But what you can\u2019t see,  is that this room is small plus badly designed.  In the king room the bed is on a platform and just awkward  to get up  into. Hard edges everywhere, as the platform is wooden and there are storage boxes underneath.  The wardrobe is super snug  and the safe is on ground level. And again hard to access. And dark!  The room needs a hook.  Or several.   As there is so little storage, somewhere to hang a coat or a bag would help. The sink is in the main  bedroom and is disproportionately big for the size of the space.  And no towel rail.   Also in such a tiny room the bin is big!  Sounds like a petty point and yes recycling is important but so is being able to move around. \nI was single occupant.  No idea how two people would fit unless one of them didn\u2019t get out of bed ever and had no clothes.  I could only unpack and pack my (small) suitcase on the bed.  There isn\u2019t even floor space to open a suitcase.  \nAnd yet the headboard holds art books and vases. \nThe shower has both a rain head and a hand held unit.  Which is useless due to its position.  Too high.  So it can\u2019t be reached and used as a hand held\nThe whole space is style over function. \n\nHousekeeping is sketchy at best. The floor isn\u2019t swept.  The sink isn\u2019t cleaned.  The sheets aren\u2019t changed.  There isn\u2019t even an option to have them changed.  The cleaners are super generous with the very nice bathroom utilities.  But the drinking water is not replaced. Nor the toilet roll.  One day my room was still not cleaned by 6pm.  The housekeeping supervisor was aware and apologetic.  But this is very poor service.  \n\nIn order to optimise space, reception is sub ground level and tiny. Fair enough.  But it is always crowded and also has a event space right next to it and is very close to the bottom of the main stairs so it is full of people squeezing past each other.  Bags.  Boxes.  Kit.  Plus guests like luggage.  All very claustrophobic.  And added to by the half light.  In fact the whole hotel is dimly lit and feels oppressive.  The elevator is just too dark.  Almost impossible to see the buttons. \n\nI have never encountered such apologetic staff.  They are charming and gracious but seem to be saying sorry all the time - for being busy or the amount of people or the computer freezing or something.   Their training obviously focuses on the customer always being right, which must be hard when the hotel is not.  \n\nOn departure, a car service is quite strongly pressed. Even when asking the doorman to get a yellow taxi.  Not sure this is customer care or incentivised sales.  \n\nPerhaps all of these things are teething troubles.  As the hotel is so new. And hopefully reviews like this will guide improvements.  \n\nCouple of photos show that even in first month the hotel is showing signs of wear and tear.  \n\n","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"SOLO"}

We were taking a weekend night away from our busy lives, and wanted to try something different.  We know the neighborhood, as it's smack-dab between my wife's and my offices.  It's a block from Soho, on the edge of Tribeca, on the edge of Chinatown, and close to every subway you might need. Location is excellent. \nThe great:\n1.  Staff is lovely: friendly, helpful, kind. Christian and others we met were exceptional.\n2. The room itself was very comfortable, clean.  Our room was small, but it was also unique. The space doesn't feel generic, with exposed brick painted white, huge windows, natural light, a gorgeous glassed-in tiled shower, a wonderfully comfortable King sized bed with soft sheets, great mattress and pillows.  Water pressure was very good, bath bits are nice, towels plentiful and high quality.\n3. Once you figure out the electronic smart room, everything works fine.  \n4. Aforementioned location\n5. Hotel lobby is really beautiful, and there's a Blue Bottle coffee there. We're coffee nerds, so this was a plus.\n6.  We scored a great rate, so it felt like we got a lot of bang for the buck.\n7. Sleeping in (Sunday morning) was exquisite. We went downstairs, bought coffee and the times and croissants, and hung out in our room reading all morning. \n\nThe too-be-improved:\n1. They're working out some kinks, so give them time: room cleaning in other rooms in the morning was too loud. Yes, you have a lot of rooms to clean. But you also need to accept people are paying you to be able to relax. Don't bring the cleaning crew in earlier than 11 on a Sunday. \n2. The big windows also let the neighbors peer in. Just across the way from our fifth floor room was an actual sweatshop, with neon lights that didn't go off all night. So we had to lower the shade for privacy, and to block those bright lights out. That said, the shades work fine :)\n3.  Broadway and Walker Sts. are loud. Opt for rooms higher up, or deal with the fact that you're in NYC, not rural Nebraska.\n4. If you need more space, or for a longer stay, this hotel might not be for you. (but for a one- or two-night stay, it's perfect)\n\nThank you for a wonderful stay.

From changes during our stay, to recommendations around, sent mail on my behalf and were constantly smiling and friendly.\nWe really liked the location (except one thing as listed below) - walking distance from Soho, very close to the subway. 7-eleven right on the corner of the street, a few restaurants close by. Not very touristic which was a big plus for us.\nThe price we paid was definitely good value for money.\n\nBad:\n\nThe rooms are very, extremely small. I've stayed at Manhattan hotels in the past and I expected a small space but this was something else. Very well thought of in terms of smart space usage but for a couple on a week long vacation to NY, with plenty of luggage, that was extremely uncomfortable. The hotel did switch us to a bigger room when we asked, but even the bigger room was significantly smaller then we're accustomed to.\nThe room was very poorly isolated. We could hear EVERYTHING that happened around us. Both from the street and from other rooms. We're not light sleepers but still we had a trouble sleeping, especially after 7am as there wasn't good light cover and the room got a lot of sunlight even with curtains on. We basically couldn't sleep past 7am or 8am tops. An afternoon nap (we tried) was completely impossible, because of above reasons but also house cleaning cleaned rooms with the door open around us very noisily.\nThe location was great (very close to subway, soho, far from most touristic areas) BUT very close to the hotel, on the way from the subway there was a corner with 3-10 homeless people. It was very uncomfortable passing through them every night. Sometimes we prefered to stay in as my wife was uncomfortable to come back late at night because of them.\nSome additional not critical but \"constructive\" feedback:\n- Some functionality in the room wasn't well installed - the toilet flushing cover was broken (we complained but wasn't fixed) so it fell off every time we flushed\n- It was very difficult to set the level of the electric curtains. Either completely up or completely down.\n- Our room wasn't cleaned every day. On our 3rd night we had to ask the front desk specifically to clean the room and get us more TP as it wasn't cleaned since we checked in. Same thing on our 6th night.","travelDate":"2019-10","tripType":"NONE"}

One of the best New York hotel experiences we've had, hands down. \n\nPROS 1) Service was a 10\/10! Shout out my guy Leo at the front desk and everyone else working there. I know a soft opening can be a little hectic as everyone is figuring out the flow and process, but Walker staff was excellent and it was a smooth stay! \n2) Location is ideal. Short walk to Soho, Tribeca, Nolita, Chinatown, FiDi\/City Hall\/Brooklyn Bridge. PLUS every subway line you could ask for is one block away at Canal Street, it's a perfect location. \n3) Hotel is very chic, lobby is great for working\/hanging out, the Blue Bottle Coffee connected to the lobby is great for coffee lovers. The rooftop is nice, and my room had an awesome view. \n\nSUGGESTIONS: 1) Rooms are small (like most other NYC hotels), so take note of the under-bed storage to put your belongings away. \n2) Make sure you have your room key out to access the elevator. The sensor wasn't noticeable and there was no sign, so it took us a second to figure out. \n\nOverall, it was an amazing stay in a PERFECT location. It was so much more reasonable price-wise than other overpriced hotels in NYC that we've stayed in.

I recently stayed here for business because of a very low nightly rate. I should have known something was not quite right. \nMy idea of a soft opening is for a hotel to show off their ability to look after guests and highlight their brand. The reception is in the basement and not well marked. Depending on what door you enter you either have to find the elevator if you have heavy bags or struggle down the stairs. They claim to have a doorman all the time but this is not what I witnessed. Check in was slow and confusing and I finally got my room. Apologies were made about the computer system that wasn\u2019t working. The rooms are small so if you have more than a carry on bag you may have to figure out someplace not to trip over your things. There is sink in the middle of the rooms with a separate shower and toilet room. Sink area has nowhere to hang a towel so you have to put your hand towel somewhere. (How hard is it to install a towel rack ) Oh, I forgot this was a soft opening so I guess I am a lab mouse for the experiment. The wall light in my room would not turn off so had to unscrew the light bulb.  The other weird thing was all the sawdust and dirt on my floor. The room had not been cleaned and may have been left over construction dust since I was probably the first human to stay in it. I called to have them clean it and then went out. When I returned late that night nothing had been done.  I guess when it\u2019s a soft opening housekeeping leaves at 5pm. The next day housekeeping still hadn\u2019t cleaned my room. Over 24 hours no housekeeping. Strange. Always good to hire housekeepers when you open a hotel even during a soft opening. \nOne thing that confuses me is the window blinds. I always thought when you stay in a hotel room that it\u2019s better to be dark in the morning so you can sleep? I\u2019m not light sensitive but there should be at least some darkness in your room when the sun comes up. No. Not here. When the sun comes up the blinds DO NOT stop any light from coming through. Huge fail. Bring an eye mask or if you have en extra t shirt you can cover your head with it. Actually, a great idea is for the hotel to provide an eye mask like when you fly business class? They could put some cute eyeballs on it and put a funky logo on the packaging. \u201c Wake up with the sun at the Walker TriBeCa \u201c\n Water is always a good thing to have in a hotel room. There was no water bottles in the room. I called the reception and they said they had run out of water bottles but there was a bodega nearby that sold water. The best part of my stay was when housekeeping banged on my door like a police raid with the do not disturb sign was on. When I confronted the gentleman he apologized and said it was his first day. The other housekeeper ran over to apologize. I think it may have also been the housekeepers first day of parole as well. \nActually the best part of my stay is when I checked out. Shame on you Walker Hotels for such a comedy of errors. ","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"BUSINESS"}
