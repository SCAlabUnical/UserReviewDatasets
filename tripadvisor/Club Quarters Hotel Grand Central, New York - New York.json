This hotel has a perfect location. It's maybe a 5-minute walk from Grand Central Station and the Chrysler building and about 15 or maybe 20 minutes from Time Square. In about the same amount of time, you could walk the opposite way to many consolates and the United Nations building. It's clean and provides the right amount of interaction with the staff. The staff was very helpful. Their lounge was very helpful as it's large and comfortable. Our out-of-town team had issues with our badges for our office on the first day so spending time together in the lounge was accommodating. I didn't realize there was a gym. (I also didn't ask to be fair). Otherwise, I would have visited it. For any comic geeks, there's a fun comic store across the street where I got my children some souvenirs. The location is also surrounded by many places to eat. I tried the ramen directly across the hotel for lunch at Oki Poke. The following days for breakfast I tried the Grand Central Station Coffee shop (1-minute walk) which had cool souvenirs, and Little Collins Cafe (get the Green Eggs and Dam! meal). Plenty of delicious places are within delivery distance as well, such as the Lebanese restaurant, Balade.  The bed was comfortable and I was able to find a movie to watch on their TV.

I was told to simply get a bag cart and carry it up alone to my room. It was prime time Friday on a major holiday weekend at 7pm, and yet not one person who worked there came to assist! I was pissed immediately, and if I could have received a refund and found another hotel I would have done so immediately. However, my go to hotel, which is literally just a block over, but I thought try something new and go with this option as it is based upon the recommendation of multiple positive reviews. I also found it incredibly deceiving that I receive an email asking if I want to upgrade 24hrs earlier and I solely need to ask upon check-in and then told to meet a kiosk (not even a human individual) and the one person who did chat with stated please check in on the kiosk terminal and there are no upgrades. I was then advised that the email granting an upgrade for $78 must be clerical error as the hotel is sold out! \n","travelDate":"2023-09","tripType":"NONE"}

Normally this wouldn't be such a big deal, but when traveling with a family and having a small space, it's an important reason we choose a hotel instead of an airbnb etc. To be clear, the custodial service itself was good and the hotel was very clean, but this added logistic was just a bit frustrating.

The lounge on the 27th floor with a self serve espresso machine and sitting areas was a nice touch.\n\nOf note, the room was pretty small, but for what we paid, that\u2019s fine. They were a perfect size for a long weekend in NYC when we\u2019d be out and about most of the time anyways. It was a little worse for wear however, and could use a renovation. That said, everything was functional, clean, and comfortable.\n\nThe negative: the service was very lacking. The first night we were there we called down for more pillows since there were only two on the bed and my partner needed to elevate himself to help with a persistent cough. It was somewhat late by this point, but it took over 45 mins to bring us two additional pillows. I\u2019m not expecting instant service after 10pm at night, but 45+ mins seems a bit much. \n\nThe late pillows would have been fine if they had come with pillow cases. Instead we got two pillows, still in plastic from the store so we knew they were new at least, but without pillow cases. It almost seemed that it had take so long because they\u2019d run out and bought new pillows for us, haha.\n\nAt this point, it was pretty late, so I didn\u2019t press the matter. In the morning, I texted the front desk to ask them to make up the room (housekeeping was by request instead of by default), and told them about the pillow situation. Instead of getting an apology for the mess up an assertion that they\u2019d fix the issue, I got a curt \u201cHousekeeping had been made aware of your request.\u201d Whatever, as long as they take care of it, which they did not of course. We came back that evening to a still messy bed, no pillow cases, and clearly no other house keeping having been done.\n\nAll of this aside, I\u2019d probably have not bothered writing a review if I didn\u2019t come home to a $200+ charge posted on my credit card from them for a reservation we prepaid for via AMEX travel. I know hotels typically place a hold on your card for incidentals (and they did tell us they\u2019d do this in the amount of $100), but this was an actual posted charge. I even confirmed that our balance was zero and there would be no further charges when we checked out. I called them and they said something about the payment\/charge being misrouted for the room. They promised to refund the extra charge. We\u2019ll see if this actually happens, if not, I\u2019ll file a chargeback with AMEX, but it\u2019s still annoying.","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They made a very small lobby hoping to limit check in to only an IPAD checkin. But computers were non functional so everything had to be manual.  The rest of the weekend was a mess  - the staff were completely powerless to improve efficiency.  Rooms very very small (even by NY standards).  No bar, no workout area, no lobby, no space to get coffee, nothing except a bunch of small rooms and 3 folks in a small lobby. ","travelDate":"2022-09","tripType":"NONE"}

It looked like a reasonably furnished mid-scale hotel from the lobby, so I decided that it might be worthwhile to reserve a Standard room for Jamie W. and me in their Grand Central location for the New York leg of our vacation. As it turned out, our non-stop flight from Oslo was cancelled due to a pilot strike, and we had to take three flights to get to the hotel.\n\nTwelve hours later than planned, we were so dog tired by the time we arrived close to midnight that I felt disappointed to see there was no lobby, just a young guy at a computer. It looked like a small office building. He did confirm our reservation and then made us create our own key cards. When we finally got to our room, we were further disappointed to see our accommodation looked like a well-worn dorm room with the carpet clearly on its last legs.\n\nWhat was worse was that it was a sweltering 96 degrees, and the air conditioner was broken. When I reported it, he said he couldn't change our room and that he'd get a repairman fix it the following morning. Eventually it improved marginally, but the spartan room was still a sauna. We tried to spend as little time as possible in there by using their guest lounge area on the 27th floor. However, it was frequently crowded like a bus terminal.\n\nEspecially popular was the outdoor terrace which did offer nice views. Bottom line, this was truly a business hotel for the low-demand company employee. The nightly rate was around $210, which we thought was reasonable until we experienced all the trade-offs. I can only recall two upsides: (1) the convenient location at 45th and Lexington; and (2) the attentive service we received from one of the staff, Loondy. Beyond those points, I can't think of a reason to return.","travelDate":"2022-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The location was great for me because it was 5-minute walk to Grand Central Station to catch the #7 train to Queens. The lobby staff was very nice and helpful with answers to my questions. Checking in and out was quick and efficient and there is mobile check in-out available. This is small hotel so there are not places to eat in the hotel. My room was moderate size and was in good conditions. There is ample closet space and drawers to put away clothes. The bed was comfortable, and I got a good night's sleep during my visit. The bathroom had stand in shower which I personally prefer over tub. I liked the amenity of every floor having a \"water station\" where you can fill up bottle with cold water repeatedly. I wanted to get a cab when I left for JFK and the lobby staff calls a number and gets one for you, waited only 2-3 minutes. The only slight negative is the room does not have a safe to put some valuables.

Purtroppo devo constatare che la struttura e il servizio sono decisamente cambiati. In peggio. Sono arrivata e la stanza alle 16.30 non era pronta. Durante il mio soggiorno di 4 notti nessuno ha mai rifatto la stanza e non hanno nemmeno pulito il bagno. Motivazione: covid ! Non mi \u00e8 mai capitato in un hotel nonostante il covid  e nemmeno mi era stato detto al momento della prenotazione. Sul sito anzi segnalano misure eccezionali a motivo covid: quali sarebbero? Non pulire le stanze? Il personale alla reception \u00e8 stato spesso scortese. Volevano prenotarmi un servizio privato per  l\u2019aereoporto al doppio della tariffa standard con la scusa che un taxi non avrebbe mai portato tre persone (senza bagaglio!). Quando ho declinato sono stata trattata con scortesia e oltretutto al momento di prenotare un taxi mi hanno detto che il servizio (taxi!) era stato cancellato. Ma quando mai!  Questi solo alcuni disservizi. Il peggiore \u00e8 stato per\u00f2 il blocco della mia carta di credito perch\u00e9 per 4 notti per una stanza che era gi\u00e0 stata pagata prima del mio arrivo mi hanno prelevato un deposito di 1249 dollari ! (Avete letto bene) che ovviamente ha esaurito la mia carta di credito. Mi avevano detto (solo al check-in peraltro) che sarebbe stato un deposito di 80 dollari a notte che gi\u00e0 mi era sembrato significativo. Sono rimasta a New York senza la carta di credito e mi sono sentita anche trattare davvero in maniera  scortese.  Ho aspettato a fare questa recensione perch\u00e9 ho scritto sia al sevizio clienti che all\u2019hotel lamentando la situazione e chiedendo spiegazioni oltre che il ripristino della mia carta. Purtroppo ad ora nessuno  ha  risposto nonostante il carattere urgente della email (la mia carta \u00e8 bloccata e la banca segnala che sono dall\u2019hotel possono sbloccarla). Penso che un trattamento cos\u00ec sia al limite della denuncia. Viaggio molto per lavoro e per piacere e mai sono stata trattata in questo modo.

I followed the instructions and after checking stated that I will receive an email when the room is ready and can pick up my keys. Because I am traveling from out of state and staying the night I have bags and was told that I would be able to leave my bags at the front desk until my check in\/when the room is ready. As I did that this morning, after dropping my bags off I was waiting for my uber and received an email stating my room was ready and I can pick my key up. Since I was already there I figured I can grab the key before heading out. As I was picking up my room key I let the representative know that I received notification that the room is ready. She asked if I checked in on the app, I stated I did, then she let me know that apparently by checking in on the app last night, that is considered \u201cearly check in\u201d and I may be charged a fee for that.\n\nI did not want to do early check in as I had no need for it and nowhere did it state that I unknowingly was apparently proceeding with early check in by processing this through the app 24 hours in advance, like instructed. To me this does not make sense and I should not be secretly essentially tricked into something I did not want or sign up for. Especially when this was not stated anywhere, I was instructed to do it by Club Quarters and I received an email from Club Quarters that the room was ready. I would have saved my time and not done anything on the app has this been detailed. On top of that I have not even gone to the room.\nI was instructed by the customer service rep I spoke to over the phone to reach out to the manager from her knowledge customers who knowingly want early check in and knowingly accept this fee are charged. This did not make sense to her either. I have since had fee removed as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d however in my email from Marta she states that apparently when you book through a 3rd party app you are automatically early check in, which is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. It also is not consistent with what I was told by the front desk rep, ORRR the two customer service reps I spoke to on the phone. Everyone is stating something different.

The reception folks were welcoming and I was able to store my bag before check in in a secure room attended by a fellow in a bellhop uniform (whereas at The Jane, where I usually stay, one must store their bags in an unattended room out of sight from the staff and things must get stolen all the time, that\u2019s my guess.)

I've never slept on a bed that felt like there was a heating element in the mattress.  It took me a couple days to figure out the combination of sheets, and air conditioner setting to sleep without waking up sweltering.\n\n-The TV's picture, and audio was never synced.  The sound was anywhere from a few seconds behind the picture, to more than 30 seconds behind.  More often than not, it was at least 30 seconds behind. \n\n-There was a gap of about an inch beneath the door into the hotel room which let the light from the hall into a dark room at night.  I had to lay a towel along the gap to keep the light out.\n\n-Even after using the text feature advertised in the elevator, I never received more toilet paper.  The one, and only roll when I arrived was only half full, at best, and by the last couple days of my stay, I began rationing toilet paper so I wouldn't run out.\n\n-This is the first hotel I've stayed in in years that didn't have an ironing board, and iron in the room.  I would like to have had them in the room.\n\n-There was no pen, and paper to take notes on.  Guests like to make notes of addresses to restaurants, or directions to places, etc.  Fortunately, I had a pen in my bag, and found a scrap of paper to take notes on.\n\n-A part of the plastic handle on the hand-held shower head kept falling off.  Very annoying, and uncomfortable to accidentally step on in the shower.\n\n-The hose on the shower head was so stiff that when the shower head was in its cradle, the spray was either aimed at the shower curtain, or the wall.  No amount of repositioning of the hose allowed the spray to actually spray where it should.\n\n-The noise from the elevators was quite annoying, especially at night.  The configuration of the floors seems to maker every room close to the elevators, so I'm sure everyone had to deal with the noise, too.  I happened to hear another guest complaining about the noise, as well.\n\n-The channel options on the TV were rather limited.\n\n-The water dispenser on my floor didn't seem to be working.\n\n-On the third day of my stay, I overheard an employee telling another guest that ice, and vending machines were available on the 3rd floor, and that there was a deck on the 27th floor.  I was never told these things, and there was no literature in the room providing this kind of information.  I'd hunted for ice at one point, and since there was not ice bucket in my room, decided there must not have been any to be had.","travelDate":"2021-06","tripType":"NONE"}

The walls were thin so you can really hear when someone opens that door but it is New York so you can expect it to be a little loud. The hotel is pet friendly which is great for people with dogs. I know it can be difficult to find a pet friendly hotel. The downside is when someone brings their dog that doesn\u2019t stop barking all day which was my experience unfortunately. You cannot get a better location since it\u2019s so centrally located in the city. I was in a superior room and was impressed with the smart design of every aspect of the room.

Elizabeth was full of much personality and she truly made the stay worth wild. She literally was remembering every persons name in the hotel during their stay, INCLUDING MINES! She was honest about my room and the options available to me because I had gotten there a tad bit early. I am a frequent traveler and I don't think I have ever met a hotel personnel like her EVER. My fianc\u00e9 was running a little late and they made sure once he got there he was taken care of and he also was treated well. I definitely plan on escaping here again. The location is easy to find, the food in the area is great. I ordered food multiple times during my stay and the front desk was so kind about holding it and making sure it got to us clean and safe.

From the Doormen who were always professional and friendly to the Lobby Staff who were exceptionally welcoming.  The service I received from the staff in the lobby was so refreshing in New York. Other places I've stayed I've received a somber and not so welcoming reception. No matter what time it was, sometimes at 3 in the morning, the staff was always friendly and went out of their way to take care of what ever I needed.  From just engaging in a friendly chat on my way in or out (who does that?)to providing dinner recommendations and advice on the best way to get to places like Central Park or the World Trade Center, they were always happy to accommodate.  One employee, Elizabeth, stands out as exceptional, although they all were, she had the opportunity to provide me perfect details on how to navigate the subway and provided me an excellent map and customized it.  I typically used Uber or a Taxi to get around so the subway, which was relatively empty during Covid, was a good experience and saved a lot of money.  I could not have asked for or excepted better service from a hotel in New York.  I'm looking forward to the lifting of the Covid restrictions and the rest of what Club Quarters Grand Central has to offer, I suspect I haven't even seen even half of it.

You would not find this in a large hotel.\n\nOnly downside of the hotel is the rooms are warm and to get to a sleeping temperature (71?) triggers the AC which then cycles on and off a bit louder than one would wish.

Es gibt die M\u00f6glichkeit mit Bus und Subway in k\u00fcrzester Zeit all die Orte zu erreichen, die zu Fu\u00df zu weit entfernt sind. \n\nWir reisten nach JFK. Hier nahmen wir bei der Hinreise das Yellow Cab. Hier gilt in NYC eine Pauschale von ca. 52$ wo dann nochmal Maur Geb\u00fchren, Trinkgeld und Steuern oben drauf kommen. So k\u00f6nnt ihr mit ca 70-75$ rechnen. \n\nBei der R\u00fcckreise waren uns die Mitarbeiterinnen der Rezeption wie immer sehr gerne behilflich und riefen uns einen Fahrer f\u00fcr die Fahrt zum JFK. Der Preis hierf\u00fcr betrug inklusive der Steuern und Maut 75$. Diese Variante war klasse. Viel komfortabler, sauberer, freundlicher und vor allem auch sicherer. Auf der Hinfahrt hatten wir einen Yellow Cab Fahrer der r\u00fcde war. Legte sich w\u00e4hrend der Fahrt aggressiv mit anderen Autofahren an. Er schlief permanent fast bei der Fahrt ein und gelangte ein paar mal fast in den Gegenverkehr!! \n\nKommen wir zum Hotel: Wir hatten ein Superior Zimmer mit etwas mehr Platz.

Leute, wer in Manhattan wohnt darf sich \u00fcber Sirenen und eine gewisse Ger\u00e4uschkulisse nicht wundern! Wir konnten trotzdem immer gut schlafen. \n\nIm 27.

T\u00e4glich um 17 Uhr findet zudem eine Wine Hour statt in der man umsonst Wein ausgeschenkt bekommt! Solch ein Service bieten die gro\u00dfen teilweise nur mit in exklusiven Bereichen und Executive Lounges an! Dazu bekommt man im 27. Stock als Gast nicht nur die genannten Annehmlichkeiten umsonst sondern auch einen tollen Ausblick!\n\nAlle Mitarbeiter des Hauses, ob Servicekr\u00e4fte, Reinigungskraft oder Rezeptionisten: Alle waren immer sehr sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. \n\nWir bedanken uns insbesondere bei Jillian, Sara und Sandy die immer gut gelaunt, freundlich und hilfsbereit bei allen Fragen waren. \n\nTolle 8 Tage alles in allem!

It was fun catching up with old friends (Jillian, Liz, & Greg) and making new ones (Crystal & Tre).  The staff is always so pleasant and friendly and willing to go out of their way to make your stay extra special.  Huge shout out to Jillian for going above & beyond!  Please know that it was definitely appreciated.\n\nThis hotel provides a lot of extra amenities that you just don\u2019t find in most hotels, especially not ones in NYC.  The rooms are spacious (esp by NYC standards) & well appointed.  The Midtown Manhattan location is great.  The lounge on the 27th floor has a TV, computers, printers, and bathrooms.  There is also an outside patio area, with great views of NYC.  \n\nThe lounge is the place to be at the CQ.  For breakfast there is fresh fruit (red & green apples, oranges, & bananas) and designer granola bars, such as Luna, Kashi, and Lara.  After breakfast they offer fresh snacks such as Wasabi peas, M & M\u2019s, Sesame sticks, etc., as well as packaged snack bags of popcorn, pita chips, etc., plus several different kinds of canned sodas.  \n\nThen every day from 5-6 PM (also in the lounge) they have their free wine happy hour, where they offer glasses of red and white wines.  Coffee, tea, and water are available all day long.  Plus there are Keurig coffee makers in every room and mineral water dispensers (and bottles) on every floor too.  \n\nI love staying at this hotel and highly recommend it to others all of the time.

It's a really disappointing happy hour compared to other hotels' (servers, charcuterie plates, various olives\/pickles, diff. breads, beer\/diff. wines, etc.).

There's an excellent diner (we used to call them deli luncheonettes), the Comfort Diner, further east on 45th St, just beyond Third Ave. Coffee, fresh fruit, M&Ms, &c. are available free on the 27th floor of the hotel 24\/7 -- the coffee and related hot drinks out of a complicated machine, and surprisingly good.

I wanted to spend a couple of nights in downtown Manhattan with my spouse to see a museum and the new Hudson Yards. I booked through Expedia as I often do. The $125 a night price on the Expedia site morphed into $165 with fees, taxes, etc. but being just a block from GST is a great location if you are arriving by train. Club Quarters is different, I\u2019ll give them that. Definitely not a grand hotel feeling with a tiny lobby no real front desk and dim lighting. It\u2019s a self-service almost dormitory vibe. There are amenities like a 27th floor terrace with snacks, coffee, computers and wine from 5pm to 6pm. There is an exercise place I did not visit. There is a closet on each floor with some items like steam irons available for guests but I could not get the coffee pods for the Keurig machine nor extra pillows I wanted and had to call the staff. They were accommodating.\nThe elevator buttons worked intermittently which was a pain sometimes riding up and down trying to get my floor button and the keycard to work. The basic room I had was quite small and I think set up for one person although our reservation was for two. The bathroom had two bath towels, one face towel and one wash cloth. The shower was great. Housekeeping is fine. There is little counter space in the bathroom. There was a microwave, a fridge and the coffee maker but no safe. Expedia listed a safe in their description but Club Quarter\u2019s web site did not list one. A message sent to the hotel asking about this went unanswered. The HVAC was just a little noisy but the street noise on a Friday night on the 19th floor was unsettling and not conducive to a good night\u2019s sleep. Saturday night was more tranquil.  I would not in the future accept a room across from the elevator the noise from which was also intrusive. We\u2019re I young and traveling alone this hotel might be ok had I had a better room. I think for the price I could have found a place with less noise and more space.","travelDate":"2020-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

They offer some unique and awesome amenities in this hotel, like the room on the 27th floor that always has snacks, coffee, ice and water available along with a great view. They also have a nice workout room and offer the use of a washing machine and dryer for free. Now with that being said, this place is not without it's quirks. They are bare bones when it comes to pillows, only two, guess we could have asked for more, it just seemed like too much trouble.  The A\/C in our room made a crazy rattling noise, again our fault for not letting them know and giving them a chance to fix it. And like many NYC hotels the elevator was a bit slow at times, and you had to use your keycard before choosing a floor, this was tricky to achieve and aggravating at times. One more thing, I don't think they offer king sized beds. Maybe they have a few but were no longer available when we traveled. \nNow with that being said, I would not hesitate to stay here again, especially if the price is right.

The luggage surface accommodates only modest-sized suitcases, so I had to hoist my large suitcase onto the desk -- but it's not really a desk, just a horizontal board resting on somewhat wobbly legs,  something clearly designed to look stylish more than offer any practical use. A lightbulb was out by the bed (sorry, but this is worth noting in a room with only two lamps) and the light at the bathroom mirror didn't work. Don't bother having any guest meet you in the lobby, which is a small room with no place to sit and a little ck-in stand like a restaurant maitre d' would use. When I asked for a 1pm checkout instead of noon, I was told that would cost an additional $50.

First impressions were ok, friendly staff and we were checked in right away. It appeared our request for a room on a higher floor was accommodated as we were put in 1904. The room had some definite wear and tear, and large water marks on the ceiling areas.  Whatever, no drips, we didn't say anything about it. Quiet except for the sound of neighbour's door slamming and extremely loud AC (though it effectively cooled the room, so pro con). \nAll seemed well but on the fourth night of our stay water started pouring from a vent in the ceiling onto our living room floor. Thank goodness we were in the room and were able to put a garbage can under the drip. When we called reception, they sent someone up to look but said their repairmen would not return til the next day. When we asked if any other rooms were available, they only offered a lower grade room on the second floor due to 'availability of room types'; a room on the 17th floor was promised to us the next day. To us, either a same or better grade room should have been offered to compensate.  So we slept through the night with the dripping. Then, when it came time to move us, we were then told the room would be on the 15th floor, not 17th. Clearly they gave the room away. Maybe not a big deal in any other city, but for light sleepers in NYC, not the greatest. Still, we sucked it up and were determined not to let it ruin our trip. The clincher came when we checked out and were told by reception that \"we were good\" and had no outstanding charges. A week after arriving home, we noticed a charge for $150 or so on my visa. An email to the hotel asking what it was for said it was for room taxes, and that our third party booking site should have informed us, and that it wasn't their responsibility to do so on checkout!

This hotel is supposedly renovated but in my opinion it is not 100% renovated. You can still feel the tiredness of the room, bedding, tiles, walsl in the washroom. Nevertheless, my husband and I enjoyed this hotel very much due to the location and service(coffee, free laundry and friendly staff), until I came home and checked my credit card statement. There was a charge of USD86. I was dumbfounded and contacted the hotel. According to the hotel it is the resort fee. Once again I found this extremely unreasonable. To avoid the resort fee or any kind of surprise hidden fee, I already have contacted CQ prior to my booking. In fact I have contacted Grand central branch + Wall St branch in NYC.  These two branches of Club Quarters in NYC have confirmed me that there is no resort fee. Since I got the confirmation of no hidden fees by the hotel I went through and booked the hotel. However when I explained this, the hotel simply responded that there is a resort fee if you book through the third party. I found this answer this extremely unjust so I requested him to lift the resort fee. He refused and asked me to contact the manager. Later of the day I have contacted the manager and the manager confirmed again that he could not do anything about this and just reconfirmed that there always a resort fee if booking is done through the third party. As a customer we have a right to know all the exact details to make the reasonable decision. When I was requiring regarding the resort fee before the booking, no staff specified that I need to make a booking through their websites to avoid the resort fee charge! If I have known about this detail, I would not have booked this hotel. But now that I have already stayed and left the hotel they simply charged on my credit card. The hotel should have informed me PROPERLY on the first place the details and terms\/conditions of the resort fee! I feel like I have been ripped off for no reason. Also when I was checking in and out there was no mention of the resort fee at all. It was simply charged on my credit card. I'm curious whether everyone who booked this hotel through the third party is aware of this nonsense. If there was no issue regarding the resort fee I have given 5 star on this hotel. But everyone please be aware of this misleading resort fee charge.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"COUPLES"}

When full with people checking in and going up in the elevator it can look a little chaotic, but do not go on first impressions. \n\nThe rooms are fine but there is more than meets the eye. Food can be ordered direct to the room from dozens of places or from the downstairs Italian place. The 27th floor room and balcony has free snacks, fruit and drinks all day (tea and coffee then wine from five).  The internet is always free both in room and up on floor 27 with computers to use there.\n\nMeetings can be held there or just to relax. Your phone can become a mobile door key with their app which also acts as a guide when in New York. There is free chilled, purified water on each floor in refillable bottles. Rooms have yoga mats. There is a fitness floor. The TV has all kinds of functions beyond watching programmes such as streaming to it.  There is a cupboard on the landing near the rooms with more room items to self-refill if needed. These are clever touches that really added to my stay.  \n\nThe rooms for central NY are a decent size with helpful bathroom items, iron and board, seating\/office area and bed, various lighting options and USB charing. \n\nI only had three very minor issues. First, a slightly loose electrical fitting (room 2109 near the door) and secondly, a crack in the sink. The other minor issue was the loud noise of the air conditioning but that was because it was highly effective. After a while it can just be turned off. \n\nBut these were minor issues and did not impact on my stay at all. Looking out directly at the Empire State building in front of me kind of balanced it out.  The shower was good, towels are plentiful. The bed and bedding were fine. I like their commitment to minimising washes, you can choose when they change the bed and towels.\n\nI'll be back. The place is great, the staff are friendly and chat when they see you. It's a feel good place. The staff cannot be more helpful and importantly, they seem happy and proud to work there.  We had some laughs and the free wine@5 kept flowing.\n\nExplore floor 27, order some food, get free coffees and cold water all day, try the linked restaurant directly from the hotel. Have free snacks, free fruit, relax in the club room and the balcony.  This is a different experience, more like being in an apartment block than a hotel. But then apartments don't have free coffee either!\n\nI've given a five star review. I'm not saying this is a perfect place, the lobby is small, there are tiny quibbles I mentioned. But you know what, I didn't care a jot. The experience here was great, the staff were helpful and the various features are a step beyond other places. \n\nI think of this more like managed apartments than a hotel, if you have everything you need such as socket adaptors and so on, you'll have a great experience. This is a different experience to an old style hotel.\n \nThe Thai food I ordered directly from my laptop is on my way to the room, last night it was great crispy chicken from another place.  You manage your own staff here. Somehow any minor quibbles go away when you can order food, get free refills and relax looking out at central New York.","travelDate":"2019-06","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Knew was going to be smaller so wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect. Surprised initially at the reception and the room (reminded me a bit of Premier Inn back home). Once in and settled though, checked out the club living room and that was it. Completely won over. Staff are a credit and deserve all their plaudits. Had a room on 20th floor to get away from street level noise as far as possible in NYC. Resort fee is reasonable in comparison to other hotels. The whole club room thing with wine and snacks is a winner and well worth a visit if you want to chill and re charge. Safety deposit boxes are in a strong room on second floor, which are a twin key arrangement (you and staff member), which seemed a bit inconvenient as apposed to room safes, but soon planned around this. We had a standard room rather than club room, which I believe were smaller, so would avoid if possible as a leisure traveller. Caught a few residents looking to change rooms at times in reception, which the staff seemed to be trying to accommodate. Reminded me of Premier Inn a touch back home at first.

I\u2019ve felt completely cheated because I had read bad reviews about Club Quarters and didn\u2019t want to stay there, so it was a big surprise when I got to the address and there was only a sign saying it was Club Quarters, it was past 10pm and I had to enter and ask the recepcionist if the hotel was Hotel Boutique at Grand Central. About the hotel: I had asked for fridge and microwave, there wasn\u2019t any at the room. The room is very tiny, you can\u2019t even open 2 bags and walk through the room. The bed is queen size (little), I was told they don\u2019t have king size beds. When I got to my room, the USB charger didn\u2019t work, so I\u2019ve called front desk asking if they had an adapter because I\u2019m from Brazil and the outlet is different, they told me they didn\u2019t have and I had to buy one (it was past 11pm). The bathroom is walk in shower but it\u2019s fabric curtain, I don\u2019t like it, and it didn\u2019t show that on the pictures. I had booked for 3 nights but after all the problems we\u2019ve decided to change hotels, so I asked for a refund for the last night, we stayed only 2 nights and I explained all the problems I had and that I thought it was a different hotel but indeed it was Club Quarters, even though, they charged me anyway for the 3 nights. It looks like they\u2019ve been receiving bad reviews under the name of Club Quarters, so they\u2019ve decided to use another name (Hotel Boutique at Grand Central) to improve their rating and mislead the customers.

The night shift guy that I interacted with ast the first night was rude, cold and not at all inclined to please or help. coming in tired after a long ride it wasn't a nice feeling talking to him.\n2. I booked a wheelchair accessible room and got a tiny room, almost impossible to maneuver and get around. I went down and asked whether there are other, bigger rooms (specifically asked about the 2nd floor) and the rude guy from above told me they are not ADA accessible. I went to sleep with a bad feeling and in the morning asked the clerk about bigger rooms and sure enough - there were two rooms on 2nd floor which were bigger and more suitable. I was transferred to that room and they didn't charge extra.\nAll in all it's a good and clean hotel, but if you are a wheelchair user you need a a superior room (2nd floor). Also, the superior room was not perfectly accessible: the sink has a big peace of metal underneath that does not enable full access. The folding shower chair is located on the wrong wall so for someone who needs to sit on it it will be difficult to reach the shower handle and the water.","travelDate":"2019-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

{"helpfulVotes":2,"locationId":4451787,"title":"How the other half lives...","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2019-05-22","publishedPlatform":"MOBILE","rating":4,"text":"I recently travelled to New York and stayed at this hotel for work and then pleasure. When I holiday I usually select reasonably priced locations with breakfast. However since I didn't want to waste a day changing hotels, I stayed on. This is a detailed review as I feel it is quite expensive for a tourist who spends the day out and only needs breakfast, a shower and a bed for the night.\n\nThe carpeted room is a good size (for a single person), furnished with a large bed (queen I think - a bit too soft for my liking and the pillows were a bit lumpy), a chaise longue with a reading light, upholstered chair, matching headboard, pedestals, a table, flat screen TV, a full length mirror, wall mounted coat rack and a wardrobe. There is also a radio with a USB port to charge your phone which was a relief as I did not purchase a US plug. The duvet cover is made from a slippery material, so if you use the blanket from the wardrobe underneath, the duvet slips off. I found the air conditioning unit a bit strange, it would heat up the room and when it overshot the temperature, it would cool the room. The light switches are conveniently located at the door and below a pleasant reading lamp attached to the headboard.\n\nThe cleaning staff keep the room so immaculate, I almost forgot to wear my shower shoes! You can leave a card on the bed so that you can help conserve water by not having your beddings changed. I bring this up for the reason  below.\n\nThe bathroom is also a good size for a single person, large mirror and a wall mounted magnifying cosmetic mirror. The shower itself is stupid, you have to turn to cold water to turn the tap off, so when you're lathered up, cold water shoots out and you waste water as you adjust to find your comfortable temperature again. So I kept the tap running for my shower instead of constantly fiddling with it. There is a hair dryer provided.\n\nThere is a capsule coffee machine and coffee and tea in the room but no kettle to boil water for tea. You have to go up to the 27th floor for hot water. This bugged me as I drink 2 glasses of warm water after brushing my teeth. There is chilled water with water bottles available on every floor.\n\nThere is a gym and washing machines available for guests to use on one of the floors but I didn't use (I'm not doing washing while there's places to go!).\n\nThe living room on the 27th floor\nis relaxing and you can enjoy your morning coffee while admiring the Chrysler building. It has a flat screen TV, four PCs and free internet (WiFi is free and available throughout the hotel). Breakfast beverages are available all day but there's no breakfast. In the morning energy bars and fruit are available but the station is unmanned. For two straight days, I arrived only to leave for the elevator waiting area to ring reception to send someone up to empty the grounds out of the complicated coffee machine as the other guests couldn't be bothered. In fact, another guest felt it was more productive to beat the machine than call reception.\n\nLater in the day, the station is manned by fabulous hosts. Wasabi peas, salted peanuts sunflower seeds, pretzels, chips and my new best friend, a huge bottle of m and m's are available as well as a glass of wine at five.\n\nThe staff at the hotel from the receptionists Ashley, a thin, short young man and a tall gentleman (I didn't get their names, sorry!), to the handyman and living room hosts, Elizabeth and Chris, are utterly delightful and want to be at your service.\n\nOrdinarily as a tourist, I would rate this type of hotel three stars because there's no breakfast and not having my own kettle was inconvenient but a cellphone charger in the room, free WiFi with excellent reception (which I needed thanks to MTN's crazy roaming charges), four PCs, a printer and exceptional staff tack on one more star.\n\nI think, in terms of value for money, this hotel is best suited to people who are looking to escape the hustle and bustle and value their privacy.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Op loopafstand van Grand Central Station, Bryant Park, Times Square, 5th avenue, Rockefeller Centre, Empire State etc. De kamers zijn niet bijzonder, heel basic maar schoon. Dat was voor ons het belangrijkst aangezien je er tijdens een citytrip toch niet echt bent. Het enige wat lastig was, was dat er 's nachts vrij veel lawaai was, waardoor we vrij lastig in slaap kwamen. Niet alleen de geluiden van buiten zoals sirenes etc. maar ook in het hotel was het gehorig. Wij hadden er geen ontbijt bij maar wat leuk is, is de lounge op de 27e verdieping.

The staff was friendly, the room clean and well laid out, and overall it was a good stay. The rooms are very small but well equipped, and the windows good enough to keep out most NY traffic noise (other than sirens).  I particularly appreciated the thoughtfully laid out bathroom that managed to provide adequate surfaces to place things, very good lighting, and a well placed mirror. Sadly, it had no ventilation (I finally figured out that the fan was broken, too late to have it fixed for my stay), which meant that the bathroom smelled strongly of bleach from the hotel's cleaning products my entire stay. The second night I discovered how thin the walls were when a small child moved into the room next door. I couldn't hear its parents, but its toddler voice just poured through (of course, toddler voices have that ability). My only other beef is with the dismal coffee set up in the hotel \"living room.\" There was one automatic espresso\/coffee machine, which meant a very long line in the morning and then it was just bad. I discovered why when I saw a staff member refilling the milk reservoir with skim milk - blech!!! Luckily there was a Starbucks and other coffee choices within two blocks, but I do think an approach to coffee such as multiple carafes with different types of milk is a reasonable norm to follow in this day and age.","travelDate":"2019-04","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

Our greeting upon arrival was warm and friendly (as was all contact we had with the staff throughout our stay). The rooms are quite small (as are most NYC hotels), but it was well equipped with coffee machine, hairdryer, iron and ironing board. The room was clean and well presented, the bathroom the same. I felt that the room itself could have worked a bit bitter with more useful storage and a better layout - for example there was a small table with seating around which we never made use of and nowhere to store our empty suitcases. Both of these things could be easily resolved and would have made our stay a little more comfy. I guess it\u2019s ok if you are only staying a couple of nights, but for any longer can become a little frustrating. The air conditioning was effective, the bed very comfy and for a city centre hotel I was surprised at how quiet it was and how well we slept! We didn\u2019t hear any noise whatsoever from any of our neighbours. The gym is a great addition, and although we came with all great intentions, \u201choliday mode\u201d took over and we did not use it, but the equipment there was great. The wine happy hour between 5-6pm daily was also a lovely touch. A nice place to go for a drink or two before heading out for the evening. Also great to have a little snack area for guests to help themselves to - small touches but great to have. The hotel is in a great location too, far enough away from lots of noise and people but only a short walk to Grand Central, Times Square etc so found it really easy to get around the city from there. \n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this hotel, and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay here again next time we\u2019re back in New York.

Well, I was put to ease immediately when I was treated with super friendliness and kindness. Graig (Greg) was  helpful and made my stay comfortable. He's like the everything go to guy, helped bring my luggages to my room (bc I hurt my shoulder) and my car bookings, and even lent an ear to hear me rant about my day. The room was modern & clean, with modern bathroom (most vital). Size is small like more NYC rooms and perfect for solo travellers. For couples, may be book a larger room. The  roof top lounge is my favourite,  its where guests hang out with all day complimentary snacks & beverages, use of  computers, simple breakfasts, and free flow wine in the evening. The Wine-server  guy (forgot his name) is so funny, he does a trivia every so often w give-away bottles. It brought the hotel and its residents a little closer.

We started our visit by stopping off at the hotel to drop our luggage at 9:30am, knowing that we could not check in until 3. The front desk staff was so accommodating. Surprised that there was no lobby, we asked if there was someplace to freshen up and change our clothes. This is when we discovered the hidden gem of this hotel. The bellman gave us access to the 27th floor lounge where we grabbed some coffee and snacks, used the restroom and regrouped. After a great afternoon at the parade, we arrived back at the hotel for a quick check in at a kiosk and friendly front desk staff who told us our luggage had already been placed in our room and there was a happy hour on the 27th floor from 5-6. Our room was clean, spacious (for NYC) and well appointed. After a quick shower we ventured to the 27 floor and were greeted by an extremely fun and festive atmosphere and our host CHRIS and his team. I am a jaded, former New Yorker and was not expecting to have so much fun at a hotel happy hour! Chris welcomed every new arrival with warmth and humor that immediately put everyone in the room at ease. After a rousing game of trivia that included everyone, we happily stayed behind and met people from around the world. It was St. Patrick\u2019s Day in NYC and we opted to hang in a hotel lounge thanks to the fun atmosphere created by Chris and the rest of the crew. \nI have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and will definitely be returning to this hidden gem on 45th Street!

No inroom safe, anon functioning coffee maker and an erratic tv\n2) I made one international call at the hotel as I was having a few problems with my mobile phone and had to urgently call my provider.

The bed is quite small for a couple, smaller even from a queen size bed which is uncomfortable. I liked the little bonuses in this hotel like the lounge in the 27 floor - every evening from 5 PM, there is a free wine and other drinks and snacks and you can have a seat in the terrace overlooking Manhattan which is beautiful. The only unpleasant experience was the alarm that went off suddenly at midnight and caused us some stress and was very spooky, we woke up because of it - apparently someone open certain door in the hotel and smoked and it cause the alarm to start working.. too bad because without this incident the total review would have been better.","travelDate":"2019-02","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Location is convenient to transportation, tourism, business and general access to many of Manhattan's highlights (Broadway Theater, Fifth Avenue shopping, UN, and Rockefeller Center to name a few). I would describe this hotel as business meets boutique. Rooms are well fitted with the basics, however, everything one can possibly need is accessible and comfortably laid out. Large televisions, comfortable beds, microwave and coffee maker, and in larger rooms a sofabed and small kitchenette.The key to CQ is their proximity to central locations in cities around the country.Some internationally. We have often been able to check in early if a room is available and staff will store luggage after check out should you want to stay in town. The bonus of this hotel is the lovely high floor lounge and enclosed, heated terrace with great views of midtown Manhattan. The lounge is outfitted with several computers and a printer, snacks including fruit and granola, and a high end coffeemaker - all complementary. There is a lovely happy hour with complementary wine, sodas, coffee and snacks. Today, we returned from our day out to be welcomed by Zishan, the Guest  Service Manager. There was light jazz playing in the background and the atmosphere was calm and welcoming. As a long term patron of the CQ hotels, I have to say this was one of the more welcoming and relaxing visits I can remember. Thanks Zishan for your generous welcome.

Of course, there's a subway station at Grand Central, which is nearby. The staff were very friendly and helpful -- especially Jillian and Ashely at check in -- and our room was nice and comfortable, if on the small side. We especially liked the \"living room\" on the 27th floor, where you can get snacks, coffee & tea, still or bubbly water all day and free wine at 5. The view from up there is terrific. \n\nMinor complaints: The shower--it was one of those that has a very slight dip from the floor of the bathroom and is not separated from it at all. The drain doesn't do the job of t's keeping water from getting all over the floor and of course the floor mat gets soaked. \n\nI also wish they had recycling bins in the rooms.\n\nWe would definitely stay here again.","travelDate":"2019-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I am a fan of Club Quarters pricing and its amenities.  I chose it for its location and glad I stayed here.  \n\nHowever, I am giving this a 4 stars because I was given a room that someone else smoked in.  I didn't realize it was smoke at the time I checked in and made the mistake of getting comfy.  Since I checked in late, I was tired when I got in and wasn't paying attention to the smell.  I tried to sleep but couldn't because of the stench and had to switch rooms in the middle of the night.  \n\nI ended up sleeping well in my new room but already lost a few hours of sleep due to the room change.

The only annoyance was that we had to put down a card when we checked in but told the money $150 refundable deposit would just be a hold on the card and not come out unless there was damage but the money did end up coming out and put back on  after a week or so. From the reviews this has happened to others so they probably need to stop telling people it is just a hold when it actually does come off.","travelDate":"2018-09","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Hotels in NY are expensive. It took me a few weeks to finally decide on one and we choose the Club Quarters Hotel at Grand Central. \nLocation: We liked how this hotel is so close to the Grand Central station and hence it was easy to get around to most parts of NY. There's also many eateries nearby and the Grand Central station itself has bakeries and a food court. We could also walk to nearby attractions like Bryant Park and the NY Public Library. SAKS fifth ave and Rockefella Center would be about a 10-15 min walk away. \nRooms: We travelled as a family of 4 and we were given the biggest room which was the one bedroom suite with kitchenette. It comes with a sofa bed, a small dining table with 2 chairs and a tiny kitchenette with a sink and a microwave. There is no stove in this type of room configuration. It was quite a tight squeeze for us but it was manageable. The bed was comfortable and housekeeping did a good job too. My only gripe was that the room on the 7th floor was noisy. Not only did the sirens from the police cars and fire trucks kept me away at night but the heater in the room as well. It was noisy and loud and it made me feel like I was staying in some crummy hotel. \nOther than that, service was good and the staff were all very polite and helpful. If you don't wish to splurge on expensive accommodation in NY, this would be a good choice. ","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We originally booked this hotel when it was Hotel Boutique (or prior to Club Quarters taking Hotel Boutique over) so there was some confusion when the taxi dropped us off as noone had informed us but it was a great stay.\n\nStaff - all very friendly and helpful - they always checked that you were ok and wished you a great day\/night, we had great recommendations for cars\/taxis which saved us money! \n\nRoom - this was spacious for a New York room and given we were only on the 10th floor it was very quiet and we slept really well. We were also located quite near the lifts but were not disturbed at all by them or any guests. \n\nHotel - location is great and right in the middle of Manhattan making most tourist attractions within easy walking distance, it is also located close to Grand Central so getting the subway is easy. So many food options surround the hotel too. The hotel adds great value for money with the free wine and drinks every day along with free soft drinks and snacks all day, use of computers and printers and a lounge\/balcony area with views of the Chrysler Building. For a small gym room it had a good mix of equipment meaning you could get a good workout in and quite a few people could fit in all at once.\n\nOverall, we had a really great stay and would recommend this hotel for anyone coming to New York.","travelDate":"2018-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

Plus a happening happy hour from 5-6pm every day with free wine (a solid, dry white wine from the North Fork included) and snacks (SO yummy granola) and fruit (apples, oranges, pears). But then there are the cons: the lack of a room minifridge is SO ANNOYING. You can leave food with the reception to put in the staff fridge but it\u2019s really trying to have to ask for it each day or night. There\u2019s plenty of room in the room for such a minifridge. The WiFi is also not great: it cuts out here and there and at times made it hard to work in the room. Finally the staff made made me grit my teeth sometimes. I guess they\u2019re trying to be hip and cool but it came across as unprofessional at times: with their jaunty behavior, playing hacky sack in the lobby and the braying guy giving out wine.

Our room was a club-sized room, which is a little smaller than the standard room, but fine for our needs.\nIt was overlooking Lexington and on the 3rd floor, but we were so tired the street noise really wasn't an issue. It was neat, clean, and in good shape. I would like to compliment the staff as a whole.  Check in was super fast and easy, everyone was pleasant and very friendly.  The staff appears to love their jobs in the way they interacted with guests.  Chris was hilarious!  On our last 2 stays, the lounge didn't have happy hour, but now it does, which is a nice addition.  Chris mingled with guests and was a superb host. Thank you!\nI would make some suggestions regarding housekeeping.  It would be great if at least a couple of additional towels were stocked automatically.  We had 2 bath towels, we were 2 guests, and when I asked for 2 extra they were quickly delivered. I left a note the next morning to please leave us an extra and housekeeping did. \nOn our last night, the tv would not turn off. A tech came up and looked at it, touched something, and the tv went off.  In a few minutes, the tv came on again on it's own, and we called back.  The tech came up, pulled out the wires and just totally unplugged it so we could get to sleep. We did make sure upon check out that the staff knew that the cables were out because there was an issue.  \nWe had a late flight so we hung out in the lounge area until it was time to leave.  We enjoyed conversation with Chris again, and some of the other staff members who were preparing things for a gingerbread making party upstairs.  \nThanks for another great stay!
