Handy for Broadway, Times Square, 5th Avenue and shopping. Also not too far from subways so basically great spot for reaching everything.  \nRoom one was a good size King Room. Room 2 was the junior suite with a pretty decent sized  double sofa bed. (Family of 4) \n\nDownside - room 2 was a little cramped. Both rooms lacked decent storage for clothes etc. \nBathrooms in both rooms had broken plugs. King room had chipped sink, black marks on the side and an odd square of paper on wall as a patch up job. Still liveable though and clean.\n\nBreakfast is buffet style but could do with more choices.  Plus for 300 rooms and only about 30 tables, they really need a bigger dining area or at least on 2 floors. We went at different times each day and struggled to get a seat every day regardless of the time guides in the elevator. \n\nStaff however were great. Mercedes was an angel when we were missing some of our dinner order. We may have confused them when we ordered 3 burgers and a chicken sandwich though for one room of 2, but I was taking 2 meals for kids in their room (18 & 21- not toddlers on their own) She very quickly resolved this and was such a lovely person. Kudos Mercedes. \n\nWould I stay here again. Yes but just as a base.

The breakfast area is small and what makes matters worse is they don\u2019t have enough staff working to clean tables which is necessary because it is small. We sat at a table that had used dishes from the previous customers. The mandatory \u201cUrban Destination Fee\u201d ($30.00 per night) went unused because the bar area where you use it was only open in the evening when we were there. The \u201cstreaming\u201d TV local channels did not work during our entire stay. We called several times to be told they would send someone to look at it and no one ever came to our room.

The hotel was well-maintained and in a great location. Just a few issues:\n1) They charge a mandatory $30 fee each night, which can be redeemed for food\/booze at the restaurant\/bar, but has to be used that day or you lose it. I understand why they do it - they want the guaranteed revenue flowing in the bar. The problem with that strategy is it messes with free market economics. If you wanted food, you had to go down to the bar (they never answered the phone), place the order, then wait for it on the 4th floor. It took quite a while and the kitchen staff were not the friendliest. Management knows they're getting the money anyway, so they aren't incentivized to do better. Good for the hotel, bad for the guest. \n2) The included breakfast space is way too small for the number of rooms and you had to fight for a table each morning. There were long lines at the buffet. Just not a pleasant experience. \n3) The suites are not suites. They were small hotel rooms with a little partition in the middle. I know it's NYC and space it limited, but calling it a suite is a stretch. \n\nFor the positives: front desk staff was great.

This property lacks leadership from General Manager and assistant managers.  The hotel entry was dirty and smells of urine.  Our family spent 9-days at this hotel and that was the beginning of our horrible experience and nightmare in New York Time Square area.    Our stay dates were March 8-17.   Check-in was a nightmare, the room was extremely small with the tiniest closet (not able to accommodate clothing for two people staying for 9-days let alone one person).  Bathroom ceiling was caving in and we had to be moved, (speaks volumes about the property) we were moved to another room on the 5th floor above the Sky Patio on the 3rd floor...  Second night in our new room we were awakened at 5:30am by a loud bang that sounded like a gun shot, looked out the window and couldn't see anything so we went back to bed, got up at 7:30am looked out the window again at the Sky Patio and saw a dismembered half naked body that had been laying there since the loud bang at 5:30am...  (NO SECURITY GUARDS, NO STAFF AND NO CAMERAS, NO ONE PAYING ATTENTION!!!)  Terrified, we called the front desk and 911 and were the first on the seen.  We have been traumatized and the lack of concern by this hotel and management is beyond deplorable!  No reasonable compensation was offered by this hotel and management.   Star rating for the hotel is ONE!  Star rating for the staff is a FOUR...  Star rating for management is ONE.  Recommend spending the extra money and stay at a well staffed and professional location that provides comfort and safety.","travelDate":"2024-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Expectedly, the rates were really high at this time all over the state (not just the city), but we got a (relatively) good deal via Hotwire. \nBaggage: The problem with most hotels is they're less than 24 hours, since check-in is around 1 pm and check-out at 11 am. That's where the helpful concierge steps in. We reached NY at 10 am, and handed over 6 pieces of luggage to the Bell-desk. We were not sure if it would be an additional cost or not, but thankfully there were no costs to it. Tipping is always welcome anywhere in the US. \nFront Desk: We were checked in by a helpful young gentleman. When asked, he looked up possible upgrade options and gave us a room with a view of the Empire State building. Check out isn't in person, unless you want it to be, so very painless and quick. \nUnused $$$: Based on our room rates and number of rooms, we had $60 of complimentary food and beverages to use - which we couldn't, given the duration of our stay and the fact we wanted to be out exploring the city instead of sitting there to avail their F&B. While the offer is great, I suspect only business travelers actually get to use it. \nFood: Breakfast was included and is served buffet style between 7 and 10. Plenty of hot and cold options, lots of seating place. The hotel also offers an evening beverage and snack service, but we weren't able to check it out because of time. \nRooms: Clean, neat and not as scarily small as my other NY hotel experiences. For the room that was booked for 3 people, we had a long comfortable couch, and extra pillows, quilts for a makeshift bed. I used the couch and had a comfortable sleep. \nLocation: Excellent! This was the primary reason (and the cost) for the booking and we were not disappointed. In warmer weather, one can hop to and from the hotel multiple times for sight seeing + rest, but because of the early Jan weather, we avoided multiple back and forth trips. \nOverall: definitely worth repeat stays!","travelDate":"2024-01","tripType":"FAMILY"}

They have bag holding areas if you arrive before checkin or you have a flight late after checkout. Adam not only made sure our bags were taken care of but was thoughtful enough to suggest the car service they provide for our ride back to LaGuardia. Embassy Suites cleaning staff kept our room clean and towels changed out. The bed was comfortable, the couch had a  full size fold out bed, which great for our 21 year old and provided a barrier between us and her. The room had a nice bathroom walk-in shower, clean towels, and blow dryer. You won\u2019t need to bring Shampoo, Conditioner, or Body wash. They have full size bottles attached to the shower wall. They also provide individual bar of soap and a full size bottle of lotion by the sink. There is a small refrigerator that you can keep snacks and beverages in. The closet has a safe, iron and place to hang a jacket and some clothing. Our room also had a television in the bedroom space and in the living space over the desk. We used the foldout table to eat our takeout pizza at night. Each morning we enjoyed a full hot breakfast, The buffet included fruit, cereal, bagels, yogurts, pastries, fruit juice's, & coffee with all kinds of soft drinks, milks and creamers. Served between 7:00-10:00am, They also do made to order Omelets on top of all that. Can not say enough about the service, especially chef and the wait staff. We enjoyed the complimentary bar service where you receive 2 tickets for alcoholic or non alcoholic beverages. The free options were varied beers, wine, and Pi\u00f1a Colada was delicious. They do change out there free options and of course you can purchase additional drinks. Non-Alcoholic beverages and sodas are available for those who do not drink alcohol or are underage. The snacks were not the best on Sunday night. The Cucumber salad was good but the Hummus was not kept cold and was not how we liked it. They have a nice waiting area  and bar on the first floor, and a small store for purchasing anything you needed. I wish we had taken advantage of the $30 credit at the restaurant, if you stay here please use it.  We did enjoy how close to everything the hotel was. There is so much to see, do and eat! 10\/10 will stay again. Again, Thank you to the whole staff and especially Adam for making our 3 nights and  4 days in NYC a fun experience.

Was a base for our days out. The price was the best part about it. A close second was the guy that worked in the lobby that helped us with our bags on check out day. \nBreakfast food was ok we skipped 1 day and didnt miss it. \nThe lifts are the biggest issue with this property. There are 3 lifts for 40 floors. If you take out the gym, restaurant lobby and such forth that leaves you with roundabout 35 floors of guests with between 8 and 12 rooms a floor thats a lot of rooms and alot of guests. Breakfast was between 7-10 ish. So we'd go down for breakfast then back to our rooms to go out for the day that would put us back to the lifts for about 0915-0945 but by then everyone else was coming down for the last half hour of breakfast and the all 3 lifts only travelled between the upper floors and the restaurant(4th floor). After about 35 minutes of waiting on the first day i rang the front desk and this was explained to me, i was told to use the stairs instead. Luckily for us we was on the 6th floor. Just something to think about if there are mobility issues. My kid broke her back 6 months ago so obviously we didnt want to overly stress her back , she took it slow and was fine, but the front desk didnt really seem to care.\nA plus is the location was pretty good to be fair easy walking to lots of places.\nShame really.\nOverall wouldn't spend my money here again.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

{"helpfulVotes":0,"locationId":11998087,"title":"Great Staff and Good Breakfast, But Not a Comfortable Stay","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-12-29","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":3,"text":"For all of its good qualities, there are a number of reasons why I would not stay at this hotel again.\n\nLet me start with the good:\n\nLOCATION: This hotel is located only about 1.5 blocks from Macy\u2019s, and an easy walk from many of the main sites in the city, including Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, and the Diamond and Fashion Districts. There are numerous places to eat within a two-block radius.\n\nROOMS: As other people have noted, the rooms are not as large as one might find at other Embassy Suites. The room in which my wife and I stayed had a large bed, desk, flat-screen TV, small refrigerator, and microwave, as well as two chairs, side tables, and a large bathroom. The bed itself was comfy, and, with some unfortunate exceptions \u2013 see below \u2013 we found the room was quiet.\n\nAMENITIES: The hotel offers a full breakfast that includes various breads, cereals, juices, fruits and yogurts, as well as hot dishes (scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and waffles\/pancakes). One can also request made-to-order omelettes that are delivered to you.\n\nWORKOUT FACILITIES: There is a gym on the second floor, where one can find cardiovascular equipment (elliptical machines, treadmills, a recumbent bike, and a standard bike), dumbbells up to 50 pounds, a multi-use Precor machine, an adjustable bench, medicine balls, and yoga mats. One note: The room is quite warm.\n\nSTAFF: The staff (with one minor exception) are wonderful. They are kind, responsive, and will bend over backwards to make sure patrons have a terrific stay.\n\nBut there are reasons why I would not stay here again:\n\nROOMS: When my wife and I arrived, the first room we were offered had a smoky smell to it, so we requested a different one. The staff member with whom I spoke said that the reason we were offered our room was that others that we might have been given did not have working TVs in them. To us, that was not really relevant information, for our concern was simply being put into a room. \n\nOn the last morning of our four-day visit, my wife was in the shower. The other mornings, the water had not been as hot as she would have liked, but this time, it was perfect. In the middle of her shower, the smoke detector in the room went off. (I cannot overstate how loud it was.) I stepped out of the room and called the front desk while she hurriedly got dressed. When a member of the staff arrived, he asked if she had been taking a shower. So apparently this is something about which the hotel is aware. It did not make for a comfortable morning for us, and I feel terrible if others were woken up just because my wife took a hot shower. \n\nUnrelated to our room was a fire alarm that went off in the hotel on our third morning because of something that happened on the fourth floor. That made for another unhappy morning.\n\nSTAFF: As I mentioned, we found virtually all the staff members were wonderful. The one exception was the first morning of our stay, when I asked someone at the front desk for a toiletry to be delivered to the room. The staff member said housekeeping would bring it up, to which I responded that my wife was still asleep. The staff member then said again that housekeeping would bring it up, to which I said \u201cokay.\u201d I apparently needed to add, \u201cBut do not bring it now,\u201d as within about five minutes, someone from housekeeping came knocking at our door and woke my wife up.\n\nSo, out of four mornings, three were most uncomfortable, especially for my wife. \n\nBREAKFAST: Breakfast is served from 7-10 am each morning, and patrons are told that the best time to get a meal is 7-8 am, as it is the least busy. My wife and I found that it did not make a difference, as I had breakfast anywhere between 7:45 and 8:30 each morning \u2013 and my wife between 9:00 and 9:30 \u2013 and each time, seating was in short supply. The problem is that the hotel, which has rooms on 37 of its 39 stories, simply does not have enough seating for the large number of people who stay there. (While breakfast and most of the seating is on the fourth floor, there is additional seating on the third floor. However, that additional space is not opened until later during the breakfast period.) My wife and I also found that some utensils ran out.\n\nI do give kudos to the breakfast staff. They deliver omelettes to those who order them \u2013 do be prepared for them to yell out your name as they try to find you \u2013 will replace utensils that have run out if asked, and keep the food stocked up. The point is that when going for breakfast, one must be prepared to deal with a mass of humanity and the possibility of not finding a place to sit. (I guess it\u2019s good practice for hitting the tourist spots in town!)\n\nTO SUM UP: My wife and I cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel, and the location is nice, especially if one wants to be away from the most-highly-traveled areas of the city. But the problems with our room and the difficulty in having a relaxing breakfast convinced us that when we return to the city, we will stay elsewhere.","travelDate":"2023-12","tripType":"NONE"}

We walked all the way to the M&M store and had to take a cab back because it was too far.  The name suite really doesn't apply either.  When the sofa bed was opened we had only a narrow walkway to get to the bathroom.   The room was small and cramped.  The breakfast area is horribly mismanaged; too small and cramped for the number of guests staying there. You had to stand around letting your food get cold while you waited for a place to sit down.  At the managers reception I set a full plate of food down and went to get a drink.  When I returned my plate was cleared and someone else was sitting there.   At checkout there was only one person at the desk (9:00 am).  But the absolute worst was the alarm clock.  The display was completely dead and every night the alarm would go off at 3:00 am.  We unplugged it but the battery kept the alarm alive.  You needed a Phillips head screwdriver to get to the battery.  It was wired through the night stand so I couldn't even yank it out and flush it like I wanted to.  We complained and someone came to the room and did nothing.

We ran into our maid as we were leaving. I asked her about the things we need and she said \"No english\" and walked away. I figured that since she knew which room we had just left, she would service it. When we returned a couple of hours later, nothing had been done. We spoke to the front desk about what we needed and he said that he would make sure it was taken care of. When we got back in the late afternoon, nothing was done. We spoke with the front office again and she sent someone right up. It should not be so difficult to get a couple of things.\n\nAt the end of our trip we debated how to get to the airport.

They were false alarms but disrupted our sleep\n-Room service was not responsive to calls. We called front desk who advised that we come down to the restaurant instead (kinda defeats the purpose of room service)\n-The elevator was down on our last day.

My friends got the spaghetti and meatballs and the orecchiette pasta. Both entrees were delicious. I ordered the tacos, which coming from southern California, wasn't the best I've had but it did it's job. \n\nEach of us had different room types. The king room was a small room but sufficed for the my friend who was in her own room. I had a jr suite which was slightly bigger and I enjoyed the separation to be able to sit in another space other than a bed.\n\nThe next morning we enjoyed the hot breakfast and enjoyed the bacon, potato, and eggs. We were curious about the omelette station but it was a long wait so we decided to pick the hot food that was available. The seating was limited and it was hard to find a table at 8:30am. We eventually did and the remainder of the stay had better luck with seating at 7:30am. Also, elevators were slow during these times but that is understandable. I should mention that there was an elevator issue on one of the days that didn't affect me but it did affect one of my friends who had to call the front desk a few times to get her using the service elevator since the elevator was not going to the higher floors. Even with this hiccup, the staff was apologetic and quick to get her down to the lobby. \n\nThe staff is a gem in this hotel.

(Our only real disappointment was in the weekday housekeeping staff.  Weekend staff was great, but weekday staff left a dripping black plastic bag in our room with a dirty cleaning cloth and missed a few things they should have done in our room.)  Breakfast was very good - hot items (eggs, potatoes, meats, french toast\/waffles), breads (regular and sweet), cereals, yogurt, oatmeal, and made-to-order omelets.  It was an incredibly busy area with not quite enough seating.  However, the staff was amazing - efficient in replenishing food, replenishing dishes, answering questions and delivering omelets to guests - all with a smile.  Wish the dining seating area was a little bigger but I realize they only have so much space to work with in NYC.  Finally, the front desk staff deserves the biggest shout out.  Specifically, Bruno and Mo were the most stellar examples of courtesy and professionalism.  As we were in the lobby area at different times, we watched each of them interact with non-English speaking guests who were asking for something or, in one case, being quite demanding - they never raised their voice, never lost their patience (though these situations lasted much longer than they should have) and exhibited professionalism on an extremely high level.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":11998087,"title":"Service disappointments and letdowns at ES in Manhattan","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-08-10","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":2,"text":"I booked our family\u2019s vacation at Embassy Suites in Manhattan near Times Square in early August 2023. We stayed in two connected mini-suites with king size beds and a small living area with another TV and a pull out sofa.\n\nI am a loyal Hilton Honors member, and I have stayed at dozens of different Hilton Hotels in the last 20 years. My 5-night stay in August 2023 was by far the worst experience I have ever had at an Embassy Suites. My low rating is NOT about the three small 5\u2019 x 5\u2019 elevators getting overcrowded, the tiny lobby, or the very crowded breakfast and evening reception \u2013 those are symptoms of a 39-story hotel with a Manhattan-sized horizontal footprint. The low rating I\u2019ve assigned for my vacation at this Embassy Suites is about the apparent short-staffing, overall poor customer service, and a lack of maintenance in the guest rooms. I will highlight the examples I experienced. \n  \n1. My check- in was delayed for both rooms well past the promised 400 pm check in time. I was told that the previous guests in that room requested late check out and they were behind with cleaning and inspecting. I was told I could check in to one room at 500 pm. I got in line for the check-in again at 515 pm, and the room was still not ready and I was told without apology that it would be another 10-15 mins. I finally got into one of the rooms at 545 pm and the other one after 600 pm. Why does Hilton charge guests a $150 fee for checking out even 1-hour late, but incoming guests are not compensated in any way for being denied a room for 2+ hours? I requested to speak to the manager to ask him\/her this question and I was told by the front desk personnel that a manager would come up to my room in 15 minutes to chat. The manager never showed up as promised and I did not speak to a manager during my 5-night stay. My impression of the front desk personnel: when something goes wrong, they will mislead you with a promise that they cannot or will not keep in order to temporarily appease you. \nThe Customer Service ethic was severely lacking with all front desk personnel I interacted with during my stay. While waiting in line at the front desk and during my personal interactions with front desk personnel, I never heard phrases such as \u201cThank you for staying with us\u201d, \u201cWe apologize for your inconvenience\u201d, etc.  that are staples at every other Hilton hotel . Maybe this is the \u201cNew York\u201d culture of Hilton hotel customer service? I expected more from an Embassy Suites.\n\n2. The air conditioning was not cooling sufficiently in one of our two rooms. I reported this to the front desk after our first night and they said they would send someone to take a look. As far as I know, no one ever showed up to address the problem. We had to endure a warm room (approx. 78 degrees) during our stay despite our thermostat being set at 70. When I tried to report the problem a second and third time I could not get an answer at the front desk. Part of the problem may have been related to accumulated dust\/lint in the bathroom vent (see pictures) which pretty much blocked all airflow.  Since the situation was not unbearable, I gave up with trying to get the AC fixed.  That turned out to be a mistake when the AC failed completely and started blowing warm air on the last day of our stay and the temperature in our room got up to 85 after we took a shower. Luckily, the AC was working nicely in our 2nd room so we were able to spend time in there to avoid sweating. We were within hours of checking out so I never reported this last-day AC failure. \n\n3.  We got locked out of one of our rooms, and it took almost 2 hours for us to get back in. This was 10% our fault for letting the connecting-room door close when we walked into our other room and 90% hotel\u2019s fault for designing connecting rooms to make it easy to lock yourself out without a quick and easy correction. \n\n4. We ordered self-serve \u2018room service\u2019 one night after we got back from Times Square and just wanted to relax and eat dinner in our room. We ordered our food at the downstairs Heist Bar from a limited menu and took the food upstairs to eat. The $28 chicken tenders (see pics) I ordered were severely overcooked and inedible. I wouldn\u2019t say they were burnt --- more like fried or re-fried\/cooked too many times with very dry\/tough meat. I immediately tried to call Room Service for a replacement meal using the hotel phone in my room, but there was no answer and the call went to voice mail. I then called the front desk to help me reach room service\/restaurant, but the person at the front desk told me it was their busy time for room service and they couldn\u2019t answer the phone --- if I wanted room service I should go down to the hotel lobby and place an order at the Heist Bar. I didn\u2019t have the energy or patience to deal with or even explain the issue, so I gave up and ate some of my wife\u2019s order and called it a night. \n\n5. The $30 food and beverage credit that is offered to all guests as an offset to the mandatory destination fee is an example of the classic bait-and-switch tactic that businesses use to make money. IMO, this is a fraudulent tactic since the Hilton website says \u201cdaily $30 food and beverage credit for use in ALL hotel outlets\u201d but when you look at your bill when you get home you find out the Cokes and bottled water you got from the lobby store does not count toward the $30 credit. I feel this is a fraudulent practice, or misleading at best, and Hilton should at least clarify this on their website. \n6. I had other issues during my stay that I did not report. These were relatively minor and I didn\u2019t feel like it would be worthwhile to spend my time reporting them. When you are spending $300+ a night for rooms, you should not experience these types of \u2018routine maintenance\u2019 issues.  \na. One of the two TVs in one of our mini-suites was not working. \nb. There was no soap to wash your hands in the bathroom sink. \nc. The sink stopper did not work in my bathroom sink. I had to use a washcloth as a stopper while cleaning my contact lenses.  \nd. We were unable to get service at the Heist Bar on the last evening of our stay on 8\/6\/23. The single bartender was overwhelmed with 6 full tables, another 5 folks sitting at the bar, and a line of impatient customers waiting to get a drink at the end of the bar. After a 20-minute wait, we gave up and went elsewhere for food and drink. This was extra frustrating to me since that Heist bar is really the only way to use the $30 food and beverage credit! \ne. We were given inconsistent information on housekeeping services. There was a sticker in the bathroom (see pic) that mentioned you had to request all housekeeping services. But the information sheet given to us at check-in mentioned routine housekeeping for everyone unless you requested otherwise. I had to call the front desk and housekeeping to clarify that, in August 2023, all guests receive routine housekeeping services during their stay. \n\nThere were a few examples of good customer service during our stay. I interacted with the housekeepers on several occasions and they were very accommodating with providing clean towels and extra coffee. The staff working at the breakfast on the 4th floor were working as fast as they could to clean tables and bring out additional food for the buffet.  The bartenders serving the free drinks at the evening reception were friendly and fast with their service. \n","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FAMILY"}

We didn\u2019t have anything big planned. We arrived at 11:15 am on Saturday morning as a group of 10. As we were checking in, we got cut off by a large group of obnoxious people (not an issue with the hotel just to clarify) who cut us in line. Whatever. Upon checking in, the front desk clerk informed us our 4 rooms we had booked would be on separate floors (we were told prior to arrival that all the rooms would be on the same floor). Another thing to note\u2014it was very dusty in the lobby and one staff member sneezed three times behind the counter (very respectful of him, but still gross). None of the four rooms were ready so we headed out to start the activities. We returned back to the hotel later that night at around 6 to get ready for dinner and drinks. We were split up into 4 rooms so I was staying in a room with 2 other bridesmaids. As we entered the room, I was appalled at the size of the bathroom. For a three-person room, the bathroom could not even hold one of us (to clarify, we are fit and healthy, not large people). When one of the bridesmaids was on the toilet, I opened the door and it slammed into her. Literally millimeter space between the door and toilet seat. The shower was filthy. Shower gel had a nasty odor. There were only two towels and three of us so we had to call the hotel services to get another towel. They didn\u2019t pick up the first time, so we called back five minutes later and finally someone picked up. The person was rude and hung up while I was asking him to send someone to pull out the couch. On our way out of the door, 45 minutes later, someone finally arrived with 2 extra towels. We asked him to pull out the bed, and when he did, the bed broke and he had to leave it half open until he sent someone to fix it!!! One of the bridesmaids was forced to stay out of the shower until someone came back to fix the bed (which was after we came back from dinner). Finally someone was able to fix the pull out couch. Later that night, we went to bed and me and my friend noticed the comforter had brown spots all over it. Disgusting!!! Regardless, we were so tired we passed out. At around 8 am, when I was still asleep, my friend informed me someone knocked on the door. When no one answered, the person ENTERED THE ROOM, stood there for a minute, and then left. Totally unprofessional and frightening. What were they doing in that one minute? And why were they in our room after no one answered the door? Huge security breach. Understandable if it was noon and cleaning staff etc. But it was not, it was 8 am. As we left later that day, checkout was horrible. It took 30+ minutes and stressed out the bride. A man working in the parking garage was acting ridiculous and hitting on the bride (she was flattered, but weird). He almost ran us over when pulling the car out. Overall, these were small issues in an overall good stay but they added up and caused stress for everyone. Since there were so many issues in just one night, I\u2019m concerned what would have happened in a longer stay. Wouldn\u2019t recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2023-08","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

We spent 9 nights at the Embassy Suites Times Square and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's in a great location - very near many landmarks\/attractions and transportation, but on a fairly quiet street.   (Exterior noise was not a problem.)   The hotel is quite walkable to lots of restaurants\/eateries, too.   \n\nThe staff is amazing!  They are all welcoming, attentive, pleasant and accommodating.   Luis (front desk) and Adam (bell captain) provided incredible service!  They were SO helpful and made us feel genuinely appreciated.   We arrived early, and they happily stored my luggage, allowed me to have breakfast, and hang out until they could arrange for an early check-in.  It's a bit cramped in the lobby because the hotel has a narrow (but tall) footprint, but there are other quiet places to relax on the 1st floor.  It's hectic at check-in and check-out times, but they do their level best to make everyone happy.\n\nThe free breakfast (on the 4th floor) is quite good!  And, they serve until 10:00AM on weekdays, and 10:30AM on weekends, so you don't have to rush in the mornings.   Yes, it can be crowded (more so on the weekends), but we always found a table.  I noticed that some people took their breakfast back to their rooms.  \n\nWe were on the go so long every day, that we only made it to the complementary Happy Hour (from 5:00 - 6:30 PM) once, but it was well done with a good assortment of drinks and appetizers.   \n\nWe were charged in advance $30 per day for food\/beverage at the restaurant, which was enough to cover a couple of cocktails\/wine every evening at The Heist (which is the hotel restaurant\/bar off the lobby).   The $30 charge is 'use-it-or-lose-it' each day, so it was actually a good motivator for us to take a little time to unwind each night.  The bartenders were very friendly and affable.  The Heist (hotel restaurant\/bar) is deceiving.  It is very small space, but the menu is delightful.  You can use the $30 credit for room service, also.  \n\nI've read the complaints about the elevators.  It's true that there was sometimes a backup at the elevators, so you do need to plan for that during peak times.  But, everyone seemed to take the wait in stride.  \n\nThe City View Room had a great view of the skyline.   (I personally preferred the layout of those rooms vs. the Empire State Bldg Rooms.)

We understand that routine maintenance\/repairs must continue and cannot be avoided during guest stays. And we appreciate the hotel\u2019s efforts to update and renovate. However, we should've been informed in advance of the date and time(s) of the intended repairs. The hotel must've known well in advance when this service was scheduled, and they should've properly notified us during check-in. There wasn't even a note posted on our floor's hallway wall. To add insult to injury, the carpet installers were rude and offensive. Overall, the hotel is clean and comfortable, but I will NEVER stay here again due to its mismanagement and inadequate complimentary perks.","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"FAMILY"}

I felt like it was too crowded, the 2nd tv didn't work, there weren't enough towels, the room was too small, and the happy hour was too packed.  HOWEVER ... upon staying the night and experiencing a full day in NYC in July, I totally appreciated the fact that there was a delicious free breakfast AND an evening happy hour every night.  The drink selections were great and the food was fine (I couldn't get enough of the cucumber\/onion\/tomato salad)!  I compared this to staying at a hotel without these features and I soon realized how much time, energy, and money we were saving by being able to have breakfast and happy hour each day at the Embassy Suites.  Seriously - if I had to find a breakfast place for our party of 3, it would have been very stressful to please everyone AND it would have cost at least $75 a day (NYC prices).  Same goes for Happy Hour!  The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and every employee I encountered was SUPER NICE.  That goes a long way with me!

We walked to and from our theatre on 50th street comfortably. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was ready early and was a good size for our needs. AC only goes down to 68 but that worked for the space. \nThe set up with a bed and sofa bed with a high back gave us the privacy that a Mom travelling with an adult son needed.\n\nBreakfast had a great range of options and was delicious\n\nThe negatives \nNo acknowledgement of Hilton membership, no water and we were charged for wifi.\nThe sofa bed sheets were stained and had a dirty sock from a previous guest in it. We called down about this but nobody picked up the phone (they are always busy down there and do a great job with the volume of people). We found spare sheets in the drawer in the king bed and changed them ourselves.\nAs others have said the elevators can be a nightmare.

It is supposedly a 4 star hotel and it tries but falls way below the mark.\n\n1) Most important is this.  I got a KING BED CITY VIEW room and made my reservation thru their website.  They show a largish room with floor to ceiling windows and a beautiful view and say the room is 293 feet.  I had done my research going over reviews with photos on TripAdvisor as well as Google and I saw over 5 different variants of the City View room with some yes being quite big and some with floor to ceiling windows while most were without.  Also many were tiny.  Some had a chair, some a couch.  Mine did have floor to ceiling windows but it was only half of the wall and the room was half the size of the larger ones.  It was just me luckily for I felt so claustrophobic.  No way was this room 293 square feet even if you included the bathroom.  It just in no way looked like the photo advertising the room.  If they said on the website that the designs of the City View rooms could vary then it would not be an issue but they do not.\n\n2)  Now remember this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel.  I am a Hilton Member and got no water or acknowledgement of being a member at check-in.  I got a keycard plus the digital key.  The digital key would not work on the elevator but would on the room door.  The key card would not work on the room door but would on the elevator.\n\n3)  The mattress was hard as a rock and pillows light as a feather.  Sleep was very difficult.  My room also had a very hard cushioned chair that could be a sofa bed but there would be no room to open it.\n\n4)  The air conditioning was ridiculous.  It only goes down to 68 but my room was very very small and that room was no way 68 degrees.  And it was very hot while I was in NYC.\n\n5)  The hotel lobby is verry small as is every floor.  This is just my personal preference.  I felt claustrophobic just being in the building.\n\n6)  I did not have trouble with the elevators as many do.\n\nI am trying to leave a honest review and you can make of it what you will.  I expected much smoother service and accountability for a 4 star hotel.  And I am tired of them saying the rooms are what you get in New York etc.  I have stayed at many other Hiltons in NYC that ran better and had better and bigger rooms.  Seriously I got no good sleep due to the bed and the poor air that I couldn't wait to get home.   Just know in advance the room you get may not be what you expect.

It took one of my daughters and hour and a half to get down to the lobby from the 29th floor. After waiting an hour for an elevator she had to walk down 19 flights of stairs with a suitcase and several pieces of luggage!!! She had asked for help from 3 different staff and they all refused to help her. Finally, the bellman helped her after she had walked 19 flights of stairs. Down at the lobby the front desk staff could care less about helping stranded guests. The manager said, \u201cBad things happen sometimes.\u201d They were using some guest elevators as service elevators to get the maids to rooms to begin cleaning as well as well as accepting a large linen order and using the elevators for the linens. Leaving just 2 small elevators for a hotel with 40 floors during check out on a Sunday. Also, the front desk claimed their service elevator wasn\u2019t working but I saw staff using it. Other guests were stuck on floors and some missed their flights. ","travelDate":"2023-06","tripType":"NONE"}

I have stayed here numerous times and it used to be my \u201cgo to\u201d new york hotel, however with recent changes we may change. It is still a great option.\nLet\u2019s start with the positive.\n+ The staff here is excellent. I have stayed here several times and each time the staff embodies what it means to be guest focused. This check-in Latesha went above and beyond to make my party feel welcome and a part of the family.\n+ The location is hard to beat. This hotel is one block from Macys and Herald Square, a few from Bryant Park, 3 min from time square and right in the heart of Broadway. Everything is very walkable.\nGood and bad.\n+\/- The continental breakfast is always delicious HOWEVER the hotel does not have enough space for guests and after April they close the additional 3rd floor seating only making matters worse. Because of the number of people they are often running out of food, usually they restock quickly, but sometimes its quite a wait. But when there is no seating, not having food makes sense.\nBad\n- This hotel recently changed how they allow guests to use the $30 \u201cresort credit\u201d that you get. You are now only able to use them at the bar or room service. Problem is, the room service menu has 6 things on it total, and the bar has about 10 tables and only open from 5-10:45pm. You used to be able to use the credit on any food or beverage purchase and charge it to the room, but I assume they make significantly more money this way since most people cannot use it every day.\n- The dreaded elevators. This has always been an issue at this hotel. They only have 3 elevators to service 39 floors so during peak hours (8-10 am and 4-6pm) it can take 15-20 minutes to get an elevator.","travelDate":"2023-05","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

He helped us with luggage storage several times since we had show tickets but our room wasn\u2019t ready yet. \n\nWithout Adam, I give this place 3 stars. The check-in experience took a long time. So many people waiting at the front desk at all times during the day. Do not expect an early check in as it\u2019s nearly impossible, but 4pm feels a little late to me for check-in. \n\nThe room itself is nothing spectacular, but I do wish it was cleaner.  It\u2019s pretty roomy for NYC. The telephone in our room was pretty gross, there was a large footprint on my pillow upon arrival, and overall it just felt a bit stuffy. It\u2019s pretty roomy for NYC tho and a nice bathroom. The air con only goes to 68\u00b0 which was a little warm for us during sleep. We did open the window briefly but the smell from the alley was worse! The bed was comfy and room was quiet which was appreciated.\n\nThe elevators are probably the worst part. There are 3 or 4 elevators for all 20+ floors and they are slow. It could take 5-10 minutes to catch an available elevator, particularly during breakfast. If you\u2019re on the 15th floor and trying to get to the 4th, best believe you will be stopping at almost all the floors, even though all you\u2019ll do is open the door, tell the people the elevator is full, and move to the next. Frustrating for all. Doing this with luggage is a joke. \n\nProximity to things was great and overall we probably won\u2019t stay here again but it did work well for us for this shorter trip.

We checked in on a very busy Saturday during spring break. Traveling with my family of four it was important for us to have adjoining rooms, so we paid extra for the guaranteed adjoining rooms. Another employee checked us in and we arrived in our rooms which were not adjoining. After a long day of traveling, having the wrong rooms was the last thing we wanted. I returned to the front desk and explained the issue to Latesha. She calmly assured me she would do her best but the hotel was sold out. At worst we could move into the proper room tomorrow, but she kept trying and after a few minutes she was able to move something around get us in adjoining rooms right away. She also explained to her colleague that checked me where things went wrong. She was great in a stressful situation on a chaotic Saturday for the hotel. She was wonderful in a few other interactions as wel. Give her a promotion! \n\nAs for the hotel, we really enjoyed it. The couch area was big enough to have a couple local friends comfortably visit. The beds were good. The location is fantastic, lots of stuff close by. The breakfast was really nice and a huge money saver each day.

This property is in dire need of an undercover boss style, mystery shopper type corporate review.  Operations and management are a mess.  Luggage storage overflowing with bags all over the lobby and stored in the lobby bar unsecured every single day of our stay.  Will not stay at this property ever again.  Housekeeping does not start until 0930.  It\u2019s amazing they can turn over rooms at all.  A Jr. Suite is just a small room with a divider sofa bed.  If you want extra linens.  They ran out.  Don\u2019t  expect your mag charger to fit in the bedside outlet.  The connection is loose and won\u2019t charge because there is no connection.  Maintenance engineer\u2019s solution was to bring an extension cord.  Any other room I would just plug it in a wall outlet elsewhere in the room.  But with just 2 to 3 feet clearance around the bed edge to the walls on windows it was not convenient and I prefer to charge my phone at my befside.  Again not a problem at any other Hilton property but not this one.  Be prepared to ask for extra towels because the glass shower doors are not fitted properly and leak a river.  Oh and the solution to a fridge that is not cold despite the room being previously occupied and not ready for check in till 4 was wait for it to cool down.  I had medication that needed refrigeration.  If you like seeing your floor hallway filled with trash and room service dishes.  This is the property for you.  Left in the morning and the mess was still there\u2026. Again not worthy of the Embassy Suites level of hospitality and service.  Just 3 elevators for 30+ stories can make for long lines and waits during peak hours.  Certainly not enough seating for breakfast.  Maybe provide takeout containers so you can just go to your room.  Manager\u2019s Reception.  Again not worthy of typical Embassy Suites reception.  2 drink tickets per person.  Pre made cocktail of the night.  Pita chips.  Cheese cubes and cookies cut into quarters.  No hot item choice.  We only went to the reception on the last night of our stay because we left our room around 10 in the morning and when we returned around 4:45 our room had not been made up.  Called to ask for service and front desk said they were done for the day and had the gall to ask we put the do not disturb sign up.  No we didn\u2019t\u2026. So then housekeeping appeared so we had to leave the room and went to the sad managers reception.

When we booked the hotel we expected a \u201csuite\u201d  since it is an Embassy Suites property but instead found ourselves in the smallest space you could imagine.  We called the front desk to see if we could get a larger room but the answer was that we were already in their largest room which is hard to believe.  We will admit the room was clean.  Housekeeping was non existent.  We asked to have our room made up and towels replenished on our second day and it did not happen until we called for the third time at 7:00 PM when they finally brought us fresh towels, shampoo, and soap.  We were told that there was no one available from housekeeping to address our needs so a lovely front desk clerk brought us our requested supplies.  Many of the offerings in the complimentary breakfasts were inedible.  The pancakes were literally like rocks; the oatmeal was mostly water, and the scrambled eggs and omelets were dry and tasteless.  The croissants and muffins were OK.  In addition, the hotel charges a ridiculous $30 per day \u201cResort Fee\u201d which we are still not sure what this fee entitles a guest to.  For us, this hotel had only one thing going for it which was its location.  It was convenient to what we had planned to do.  We have stayed in other Embassy Suites and other Hilton properties in the past and this one was the absolute worst.  Luckily, what we did in the city far outweighed our experience in the hotel.  We would not recommend this hotel.","travelDate":"2023-03","tripType":"FAMILY"}

Rooms are understandably small given this hotel\u2019s location, but that makes common areas even more important. The sky lawn was also locked to us every time we checked during the posted open times. This is a very expensive area to stay in, so we expected high standards. The room was also not as clean as we expected on arriving (with laundry not free of hairballs) and we were delayed an hour after the 4:00 check in.  We should have asked for different pillows because they were awful, but honestly, the staff were unapologetic about delayed requests (toilet paper) so it didn\u2019t seem worth the effort to keep complaining.

Arrived around 7:30pm and while the arrival experience was different from other Hiltons, the time for check in was quite speedy for NYC.  Janiah was the agent who assisted and provided a welcome for being an Honors member along with the customary arrival amenities.  \n\nThe lobby was quite when I arrived and their Heist bar area looked quite popular.  Sadly I missed the manager hour earlier in the evening.  After getting my key I headed up to my room on the 26th floor and wow.  What a view.  This room is amazing, the balcony\/patio area can\u2019t be done justice in these photos.  Trust me\u2026if you want a one of a kind experience in NYC and happen to have peeps to hang with you\u2026this is the location!   The room itself was smaller than your normal Embassy Suites\u2026but hey, it\u2019s the only one in the city, and compared to other hotels\u2026the rooms are spacious.   You\u2019ll see one photo from the bed\u2026.of the Empire State building\u2026was I comfortable, yes, do I wish I took a daytime view, yes.  \n\nPlenty of room to spread out and put away my items.  I enjoyed having a fridge and microwave as I got some popcorn and make that while watching TV.  I will say the TV options have the opportunity to be upgraded.  And despite being the only one in the room, I wanted to test out the 2 TVs going at the same time.  Quite surprised that unless you have them very loud, there was minimal cross over between the spaces.  \n\nAfter I did my initial loop, ended up FaceTiming not once\u2026not twice\u2026but three times with friends to show them this room and the view from the balcony.  The Empire State Building was so close\u2026felt like I could reach it!  \n\nRoom was very quiet and didn\u2019t hear any outside city noise which means I slept wonderful, comfy bed and pillows.  Got up early to have breakfast and arrived around 7:30am.  Breakfast selection was typical of Embassy with the main difference having to write down your omelet order vs standing in line.  The attendants were very prompt to remove empty plates and keep the flow moving.  Coffee was good, took two to go cups back to the room with me.  Seating can be limited\u2026and I recommend seeing it more as communal seating and share with someone.  \n\nShower was great too, water pressure amazing wished I didn\u2019t have to leave.  Spacious bathroom as well, loved the waterfall faucet.  \n\nGlad I woke early as I got the perfect shot of the Empire State Building before the clouds rolled in and covered the very top.  \n\nDavely upon departure was wonderful.  Her energy was contagious.  Made the day start on a good note. \n\nOverall I enjoyed my stay and would return when in the city.  \n","travelDate":"2023-02","tripType":"SOLO"}

Good Location.","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2023-02-01","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Overpriced but in NYC.  Happy Hour not so happy.  Small but clean room. Good Location.\nWe are loyal Embassy Suites fans, so stay in them whenever they are available in the cities we travel to.  We were happy to try this NYC Manhattan Times Square area Embassy Suites on our recent trip.  It is not really in Times Square, maybe a half hour walk and a mile of more from there, but at least in the general area of midtown Manhattan.  We had flown on a long red-eye flight, so were very pleased when they let us check in early our first morning, upon arrival around 11 AM, rather than being stuck waiting all day for a typical 3 or 4PM Check in time.  GOOD JOB!!  One of us napped and the other did some walking around town in the area.  \nAt about $530 per night US Dollars, this is probably the most expensive hotel that we have ever stayed at, and Embassy Suites all around the USA are usually more like $135-$200 a night, USD.  There was also a \u201crip-off\u201d extra $25 daily fee, like a resort fee, that was very totally unnecessary, since there were no resort features to the place, which added another $75 to our bill.  They said you could purchase snacks and sodas from the lobby snack corner, which we did to use up the $25 daily limit credit.  The bars were overpriced, so it was almost too expensive to get drinks there, to try to use the credit, and the credit had to be used daily or lost, could not be combined and used on 1 night, like at the bar.  The hotel room was also the tiniest room we have stayed in, in an Embassy Suites too, but of course we understand the real estate problems in Manhattan, but still, very small room.  The room had a tall padded back on the sofa in the tiny TV, refrig, sitting area, which they somewhat divided that area from the bed on the other side of the tall sofa \u201cwall\u201d (no real wall, so not separate rooms, not really a suite of two rooms, as is typical in Embassy rooms\/suites.  The room was clean and modern, bed was comfy, but the Air Conditioner was noisy and rattled.  There was almost no room for out two suitcases in the room, without tripping over them.  The hotel is only 7 years old and was built as an Embassy, per the front desk clerk, but you would think if they were building to their normal styles, they could have made the rooms bigger, and just go higher up.\nThe Happy Hour Manager\u2019s Reception was not very happy, it was only for 1.5 hours, not 2 hours, and you were limited to 2 drink tickets (unlimited drinks for 2 hours at all normal Embassy Suites Hotels).  And, to our negative surprise on the first night, drink choices were extremely limited.  There was only 1 choice of beer that night, not the typical 3-4 beer brands, with some on draft and usually something local, like a local craft beer, on draft).  There was only one wine choice that night, just 1 red wine, not white wines at all, no other red wine choices etc.  For Cocktails, the only offering was 2-3 fruity drinks he had made up in a few pitchers, and when the pitchers were empty, he had no more of those or any other drinks.  Also, the Manager\u2019s Reception was held in the overly crowded space that they also serve breakfast, so it was hard to get a table in the bar, for the happy hour\u2026\u2026  The HAPPY HOUR was VERY POORLY DONE & Management needs to improve this part of their Embassy service.  Even the nightly bar tender was unhelpful and was unconcerned that there were no choices or availability of standard drinks, that would be expected and standard at any other Hilton Embassy Suites property.\nThe included Breakfast was also problematic, in that the rooms were too small, so there was no where to sit and it was always very hard to find a table.  The Breakfast cooking staff and table waiters were working very hard and doing a great job, and the food, particularly the omelets were great\/tasty, so they should be commended, but again, the lack of sitting space made breakfast difficult.\nThe room had two nice large newer Samsung flat screen LED TV\u2019s, a safe, microwave, and refrigerator.  We had a nice view of neighboring high rise buildings out the bedroom window, including of the Empire State Building.  The front desk staff were nice and helpful as was the breakfast staff, but again, not the solo same Happy Hour bar tender.  The location is good, and it was a few long blocks away from the closest subway station.\nConsidering that this is the most expensive Embassy that we have ever stayed in (so overpriced!!), they should drop the daily $25 extra fee, and management could easily improve the very poorly run Manager\u2019s Reception, and then also consider figuring out a way to improve or add or find extra seating space, for the breakfast and happy hours.\n","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This first time if happen we were so scared as we lived really high up. After 3-4 minute the fire brigade arrived and left soon after. We had no clue if we needed to leave our room. We were very scared. We asked the reception the next day and they just dimissed us as it was nothing that we had been woken up so early and it was a false alarm. This happened 2  more times , so 3 times total. Reception never even said sorry. We were informed it was probably someone smoking in their room but the ones we spoke to didnt seem to care .

With our luggage it was very difficult for us to move around the room.  We decided we would check to see what hotels in the area were available with more space.  First, I thought I would go down to the front desk, explain our situation and inquire if there were room options before we checked into other possible hotel space in the Times Square area. I would like to commend your employee named Rasheeda who immediately provided us with a couple of room options.  Her customer service was excellent.  We appreciate her kindness and concern for us.  We wanted to let you know what an exemplary employee you have in Rasheeda. Please commend her for us.\n\nAlso we wanted to commend the bellman named Deni (Dinu) who helped us with online tickets for several New York tours and answered our many questions. \n\nWe decided to extend our stay an additional night and signed up online for the stay.  We were told there was no record of our online stay request and were helped by your front desk manager named Ken or Kevin to resolve the additional stay request. \n \nThe breakfast buffet in the hotel was excellent. Great omelets!\n\nIn essence, we are proud to be customers of the Embassy Suites and appreciate the excellent customer service shown to us by these 3 excellent employees.

Embassy Suites will always be our first choice when looking for a great hotel.  \n\nSincerely,\nMrs. Blanche Parks Jones & Darryl Jones\nTopeka, Kansas \n","travelDate":"2023-01","tripType":"COUPLES"}

This turned out to be a lie as according to the staff member the next day nobody would have told us that the room would be cleaned every day. The reception staff had a bad attitude most days. How can a room not have just the basics done everyday? Daily bin cleaning,  replenishment of coffee, creamer and paper cups? No glasses in the room. Note on the mirror that room will be cleaned only after 4 nights\u2026.The breakfast area was beyond crammed, the staff tried their best to keep it clean. The complimentary drinks between 17h00 an 18h30 each night was yet another crammed and badly organised affair. Not enough glasses for the number of guests, the worst snacks imaginable. Staff in reception area despite their attitude deserve better\/warmer environment. The doors leading to the outside and the ovedhead  heater were not working properly during the extreme weather experienced.  Some of the staff like Adam and Denu always had a smile.

Out of 6 people spoken to you could tell only 2 of them actually wanted to do their absolute best and I'm ashamed to say i didn't get their names but a lady on the desk who seemed to be in charge on Thursday morning and the guy looking after luggage etc at the same time absolutely spot on! The main issue was asking multiple times for an issue in the room to be looked at by the other members of desk staff to give up after 2 days and sort myself. Customer service is everything when the little things let you down, like room standards i.e. faulty fridges, wires hanging down from tvs and god forbid toilet seats that might land you up in the shower but view wise and location its a great spot so just needs TLC along with some more of your top colleagues ","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"FAMILY"}

The hotel fell far below my expectations of a NYC hotel (or quite frankly, a hotel anywhere I choose to stay). Below is a list of the issues we encountered. We stayed in Room 805.\n\n1. We arrived around 12:30pm, understanding that check-in wasn\u2019t until 4:00 and our room would probably not be ready. The bellman who checked our bags is quite frankly the one positive staff person I have to compliment. In the midst of chaos, other people experiencing issues, and a just generally poorly managed lobby, he was friendly, maintained a smile, asked us there was anything he could do for us, and was the only staff member I can say that I recall I remember having positive interactions with.\n2. We arrived back at the hotel at 4:45 for 5:30 dinner reservations. Our room was STILL not ready. I was still in my sweatsuit from the airplane. Somehow, the staff behind the desk scrambled and found us a room. They were not friendly, apologetic, and did not seem to care about our plans (dinner and a show). I had know time to fix my hair or do my makeup and my husband had no time to shower.\n3. When we returned to the room and used the shower, it was not sealed and water went all over the bathroom.\n4. Someone locked the tv and\/or remote in Spanish with Spanish closed captioning, so we had no tv during our stay, and I like to use the sleep timer, as I have a hard time sleeping. The maintenance engineer who was sent to our room could not figure it out.\n5. Checkout was ok, but again, the staff member wasn\u2019t friendly and I don\u2019t even think she said, \u201cthanks.\u201d\n6. I used 100,000 Hilton points for this stay. I wasted 100,0000 points on this stay. Quite frankly, the hotel was a dump and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to an enemy.","travelDate":"2022-12","tripType":"COUPLES"}

No apologies, no support - just a rude acknowledgement that it is not working and will come back sometime.\nI was shocked that we had to specifically ask if we wanted the room made up and fresh towels. I of course requested this and was told they would do it if they had time, I specified that it had to be done. After a long day out, returned to find that nothing had been done, i had to ask 3 times; in the end I got towels but no room service.\nThe attitude of the front desk staff was very unpleasant and unprofessional ( this improved on day 3)\nThe highlight was Adam, the concierge- what a pleasant, professional and caring person. He was happy, customer centric and the only person who cared.\nBreakfast had its limitations also with a sign - no omlette due to lack of staff.\nI really feel for the staff in the breakfast restaurant- there was not an air of happiness at all.

Check-in was somewhat smooth as they could not find our reservation at first but were able to find it after. Upon getting into our room 709, everything looked clean and proper. The big issue was our TV was not working. We phoned guest services and they sent in maintenance but couldn't fix it. Maintenance then said he could not fix it now but will tell guest services and maybe they can change us room. Guest service called and told us maintenance say it will take a bit longer to fix and they could do it the next day on Saturday or they could change us room but no longer had the room type we reserved. We had traveled all day friday and just settled into our room. We were too tired and just wanted to rest and as we were to spend the whole Saturday out visiting we said ok and they confirmed it would be fixed the next day. Imagine our surprise that after spending a whole day out on Saturday and getting back to our room around 8pm and wanting to unwind watching TV  to find the TV still not working. We complained again and they said they would come and check but never did. By the end of our stay on Sunday, the internet was no longer working. So considering the hotel name and for the price , one would expect to have working TV and internet; but no. This was disappointing. We spent most days out but early in the morning and late at night we would have enjoyed some TV time. They just never bothered just saying sorry for the inconvenience. My husband was not impressed by that and he is not a TV guy much. That just goes to show. This made for a not really enjoyable stay at the hotel.\nOn a plus side, location is great to everything we wanted to do. They had breakfast. But also had a cocktail evening around 5 which was welcomed as we were hungry after long day traveling and it was raining outside. Restaurant at the lobby was also a plus as we were too tired to go eat out after long day walking and visiting. Also the lady at the bar in the lobby was excellent. She added a plus in the hotel experience. I have stayed at other Hilton and never had such issue.  It was our first time staying in that hotel and can't say we will stay there again when we go back to visit.","travelDate":"2022-11","tripType":"COUPLES"}

No but they could put me in one of the other Hilton's at nearly 3 times the cost of my original booking. I said no.\n\nSo I got in touch with\u00a0booking.com\u00a0hoping as I booked through them they would not be able to help. I was in a mad panic by now. In New York with my wife and son. Booking.com reassured me they would sort things. After about 60 mins on hold they said sorry the room have gone. We could booked these other rooms. I said would that be at the same price I booked originally as it was not my fault. No they said you'll have to go onto the website and book yourself.\u00a0\n\nWe did this and we booked a Hilton Doubletrees in the hope that using the same companies then maybe it would be easier to deal with them hoping either one would have the compassion to refund us the difference.\n\nThus so far neither have.

In fact you cannot book 4 in a room on Hilton\u2019s site , it only allows 3. I had called the hotel and you can indeed have 4 in the room but you need to know that 2 will be sleeping on a pull out couch sofa and 2 in the king bed. \n\nI wanted to add this on my trip report since no one had commented about allowing four to a room in all the reviews that I had read. I thought this would be helpful for families .\n\nWe were travelling with two teens and they were OK with this idea since we were doing so much sightseeing -it was a place to crash. It worked out perfectly there was plenty of space for the four of us.\n As other posters said they do give service towels and toiletries for two to a room,you have to request more . When we did make the phone call to the front desk immediately Concierge came up with services .(towels , soaps , tv converter repairs) \n\nWe always stay at Embassy suites on travels as we love the full  breakfast(omelette bar )  and happy hours. \n\nHappy hour was defiantly lacking . \nDay 1 brownies and a spinach dip with natcho chips . The dip was not appealing and brownies and chips had to wait for as gone right away with the crowds .some people grabbing 6 at a time - they must of been really hungry :)\n\nEvery night only two drinks were allowed per person most embassy suites they have unlimited drinks for two hours not the case at this location.\nDay 2 cheese, crackers and package shortbread cookies  2 drinks only.\n\nVery tight to find any room to sit on the weekend once we hit Sunday and Monday things freed up. We then went on our way to sight see in the evening or dinner .\n\nLet me get to the movie part on the upper deck , first off this is a offsite company that does this and you have to pay for the popcorn and your headphones definitely not worth it. Watch a movie in your room and relax . \nSo we had Hilton honour points for 3 of our 4 evenings therefore we didn\u2019t have to pay the $25 resort fee but Hilton honours paid for this portion so we were entitled to this for three evenings. \nWe went to the rooftop patio where the movies were being played . I went to order a glass of wine and it was $19USD !!! $25 Canadian ! I said is this not for the two glasses of wine ? he replied nope it\u2019s New York City.  So your $25 usd  Resort fee only covers a glass of wine so we opted for 2 beers and even that they give you 355ml cans and that\u2019s your $25 gone  ! Biggest rip off \n\nOr you can let your kids have a grand time in the pantry area and buy snacks! One little bag of chips that you get maybe eight in bag is $7 . Frozen lemonade $7 \nAt least you can buy something with your $25 resort fee but it sure doesn\u2019t get you much.\nBreakfast \nWhen you come in there\u2019s a table that you have to fill out your form what you would like in your omelet . You then go to the kitchen area and drop off the form. We waited the first day 40 minutes and they still had another 20 minutes to get to our omelet so we cancelled our order. Sunday I was able to get the omelet and the cook was fantastic ,very friendly and funny. \nRepeat like other guests say it\u2019s  hard to find seating and then lack of staff trying their  best to be able to clean quick for the next customers, The morning staff were fantastic very friendly and tried their best. \nOne of 4 days had bacon the others were Turkey or pork sausages. Overall breakfast was nice to get you on your way for sightseeing. \nFront lobby was very inviting clean modern complimentary water infused with lemons.\nThe rooms were compact but had a small fridge , microwave with a dishwasher. 2 tvs. \n\nThe washroom was roomy and the water pressure was fantastic. \n\nIt was a quick walk to Macy\u2019s , central on train station , Times Square, library , and so much more .\nIf we returned to NYC We will stay again at this property.\nThank you to all your staff for our enjoyable family trip","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

It felt like we were staying at a low budget version of Embassy Suites.\nThe positive: The staff was friendly (especially Adam), the location is good and the breakfast was good.  \nThe negative:  They have cheapened all the things that make staying at Embassy Suites pleasant, such as:\n-The rooms are small.\n-You have to request room service.  They did not tell us this at check-in.   I cannot believe any decent hotel would put this policy in place.  Nothing more disappointing than coming back to your room after walking around 10 hours in a heat wave to find out that you have no clean towels etc. \n-They are cheap with amenities.  Only two bath towels per room.  If you have a third person in your room, you have to call and ask for a third towel and sheets for the pullout bed.  Why don't they automatically send up necessary items for a third guest when you check in?  We had two rooms for 3 nights, and received two small soaps (one for sink, one for shower) and one small bottle of shampoo and conditioner.  They did not replace these items, even when room service finally showed  up.  We were showering with slivers of soap, and ran out of shampoo.  We also ran out of toilet paper and Kleenex, and had to call to have some sent up.   \n-This location's manager's reception is the saddest I've seen.  The snacks were wiped out when we got there, and they give each guest two coupons for a drink. \nWe were yelled at by the hostess because there was nowhere to sit and we tried to bring our drinks to our room.  All the other locations we've been to have an open bar, and a fun relaxing atmosphere.  The fun vibe was definitely missing here.\n-Our key cards stopped working twice.  This is not the biggest thing, but was yet another frustration we didn't need.\n-You should also be aware that this hotel charges a $25 Urban destination charge, which is really just a thinly veiled attempt to gouge you for more money.  You can spend it in the hotel, but you have to spend it each day or you lose it.  They won't tell you this at check-in, probably hoping that you do not use it.\nOverall this is an ok hotel, but it could be so much better with a little effort.","travelDate":"2022-08","tripType":"NONE"}

So today during my 800 mile journey, I had to stop every 2 hours to place fresh ice around my medication. This added 4 hours to my trip and I now had to stop overnight and stay at a hotel.  A waste of money. I really should be home tonight instead of a hotel.\nWhy don't your employees care? \nFurthermore, I am trying to load my car with luggage, yet you fill the sidewalk with laundry so I am unable to pull the luggage cart to my car. Why do you do that? Why do you make it impossible for your guests to load their cars?\nMy 3 night stay at your property has left me with such a bad experience that I do not know if I can stay with Hilton again.","travelDate":"2022-06","tripType":"NONE"}

I traveled with a child (toddler) and I am dairy free, gluten free. \n\nI did have one big issue during my stay. For me, its not the issue that matters (issues will happen every where) but how it is handled that counts.  Their delivery food service had a serious issue with delivery.  That means that I only got sccess to a full breakfast one day.  The other days they apparently improvised providing something hot (tator tots, mixed veggies) and a somewhat contiental breakfast (toast, orange slices, juice).  The customer service of staff, like Vianel, was still superb in very frustrating conditions.  They worked hard with very limited resources and many guests were more than frustrated.  Managers were immediately available to discuss the issue with the guests, which is exactly what I did. I spoke with Anthony who allowed me to vent without interruption and then worked to understand my needs.  We problem solved to come up with a win-win situation for msyelf and my toddler and he delivered on his promises.

The first days Breakfast included turkey sausage, potatoes, juice and pineapple.  This meant I could eat breakfast in the hotel with my restrictions.  For those without, they also had a bakery section, made to order omlettes, cereals.  They had gluten free dairy free lemon cookies and pop chips in their snack pantry. (MAJOR)\n\nThey provide a cocktail hour with free wine and beer and $5 selected drinks.  Sodas are free.\n\nThey provide a $25 credit for each day to use in the pantry.  Granted the market pantry is expensive ($4 for a canned soda or for a Nutella snack pack).  They had mommy-toddler favorites- pop chips, Nutella,  yogurt). \n\nThe location... literally just a few blocks from the center of Times Square.  There is a subway, Macys (largest store in the world) three blocks away on 34th.  Food chains like Chick Fil-A, Give Guys MC Donald's and Taco bell within a block.  Coffee shops on the same  block.  And wonderful special to NY only food places that offer gluten free, dairy free options within walking distances.  It was perfect! (MAJOR)\n\nService: They have fast service.  When I asked for towels, they came up within minutes.  The reception always smiled even in difficult times.  They offered advice and quick tips. Loved loved the service. (MAJOR)\n\nNot so Loved:\n\nThe rooms are smaller than typical rooms in other Embassy Suites.  (Remember this is Times Square). The suite is separated by a partial partition rather than a wall.  It makes the room feel closed.  I am guessing they did this as a way to provide an element of privacy and a separate TV to two spaces. There is very little walking space in the room.  If you have a toddler and plan to spend a good amount of time in the room, this may not be the place for you. \n\nThe only drawers are located under the bed.\n\nThis Embassy Suites doest have the typical layout. And there was  no indoor pool.  (I only mention this because if you are accustomed to Embassy Suites they often have an indoor pool and a very specific layout.)","travelDate":"2022-04","tripType":"FRIENDS"}

One on the 33rd floor with a wonderful view of the Empire State Building that was very spacious, the other was on the 8th floor that was more cramped. \n\nThe rooms: \nBoth rooms were very clean and the one on the high floor had a great view. One room was very spacious but the other less so, but for NYC I think this is fairly common. \n\nThe rooms were only cleaned once during our week stay but that did not bother us too much. \n\nThe room on the 8th floor along with the whole corridor however stunk of smoke during check in, but this smell seemed to disappear after a day or so. \n\nThe hotel: \nIt is in a very convenient location close to Times Square, the Empire State Building, penn station and herald square meaning it is a perfect base for exploring the whole city. \n\nWe appreciated the $25 per room\/per day credit to use in the pantry but this was sometimes not well stocked and so we didn\u2019t take advantage of this as much as we\u2019d like. \n\nThe free breakfast was nice but very limited. There were no allergens marked so one member of our party with a gluten allergy did not know what they could eat. The space available to sit was very limited, so it is very difficult to find a place within the breakfast after to eat. The breakfast also started to get packed away 10\/15 minutes before breakfast finished so if you wanted to go down to get a quick croissant\/slice of toast before heading out this was not possible. \nBecause of this we often skipped the hotel breakfast and chose to eat elsewhere. \n\nThe staff were all very friendly and attentive.

{"helpfulVotes":1,"locationId":11998087,"title":"Connecting Rooms","lang":"en","publishedDate":"2022-03-26","publishedPlatform":"OTHER","rating":4,"text":"Connecting rooms at an affordable price was the reason I booked this hotel.  I found other things I liked but also some drawbacks.\n\nPROS\n-Connecting Rooms: NYC hotel rooms can be small - having connecting rooms gave our family some room to spread out.  Plus, two bathrooms!\n\n-Room Amenities: There was a desk, iron, refrigerator, microwave, closet, plus one TV across from the bed and one by the sofa.  The bathroom was a good size and had nice fixtures, though the shower door handle setup baffled me.  There is an outlet and USB charging port by the bed and desk.\n\n-Lobby\/Entrance\/Elevators: The lobby has a number of seating areas, particularly as you move back from the front door.  Restrooms are at the back of the lobby.  The three guest elevators were relatively quick (with the exception of breakfast time or the early evening hours, which is typical).\n\nOutdoor patio: The third floor has an expansive outdoor area that would have been wonderful to enjoy had the weather been nicer.\n\n-Breakfast: I was really impressed with the breakfast.  There were at least 4 hot options per day plus the made-to-order omelets, as well as cereals, toast\/bagels\/breads\/rolls\/etc., fruit, yogurt, juices, and more.  Seating was limited in the fourth floor breakfast area but you could also take it to the third floor indoor seating area as well as the massive outdoor 3rd floor deck, weather permitting.  As you might guess, seating gets to be more limited later in the morning.\n\n-Staff: We encountered many helpful and friendly staff members.  There were a couple less-than-cheerful front desk attendants on the last days of our stay but fortunately they were not the ones that greeted us upon arriving for our stay.  I\u2019ll mention two especially helpful members of their team: Allen greeted us upon our arrival and took great care of us, and Adam was extremely helpful at the end in taking care of our luggage and helping us as we departed.  Thanks to both of them for their work!\n\nCONS\n-The \u201cUrban Destination Charge\u201d: I knew about this $25 charge per night, but didn\u2019t fully understand how it worked.  I figured with 2 rooms and $25 per day that I would never fully spend the total at the pantry (you can also spend it at other locations in the hotel).  However, as I now understand it, the fee only applies to the \u201cdays\u201d of the \u201cnights\u201d that you stay.  For instance, if you want water for your departure day, you should pick some up on one of the previous days of the stay.  With 2 rooms for 3 nights I had what I thought was $150 to spend at any time over my stay, but that was not the case.  :(\n\n-\u201dSuites\u201d: If you were expecting an actual suite, you will be disappointed.  The \u201cwall\u201d between the bedroom and living area is about 5 feet tall and is essentially the back of the sofa.  It does do a good job of dividing the area but it is not truly divided.\n\n-Key issues: On the third day of our stay one of our keys stopped working.  The digital key didn\u2019t work either.  Fortunately we could use the door to the other room, though that deadbolt malfunctioned periodically.  We didn\u2019t mention these to the front desk because it was in the last days of our stay but I thought it was worth mentioning in this review.\n\n\u2014--------\n\n*Overall, I would return to this location and stay here again.  The location is great near the Herald Square subway stop and just blocks from Times Square, Bryant Park, and Grand Central.  Hopefully this review helps you enjoy your stay in NYC!","travelDate":"2022-03","tripType":"NONE"}

The check in process was really easy and if you arrive early or will be leaving late you can have your luggage held downstairs.  We requested a room with a view of the Empire State building and received one without an additional cost on the 17th floor.  The view from the video was obscured by other buildings because we're high enough but still great nonetheless.\n\nThe room was small for an Embassy Suites but expected in New York.  There was just enough space to walk around the bed and to and from the bathroom.  It would have been cramped with a third person using the pullout bed.  \n\nThe room has a microwave and mini refrigerate in addition to a cofee which we did not use because of the full breakfast offered every morning.  \n\nThe closet and safe are located in the bathroom.  The bed was comforable but the pillows were too soft.  It would have been nice to have a firm option.  The fitted sheet didn't appear to fit the bed and basically was laid on top of the bed and couldn't be tugged into place.  \n\nInstead of having Housekeeping Service our room each day we opted for a daily towel service. \n\nYou MUST have proof of vaccination with identification to enter the space for breakfast and the manager reception; the staff do check.  There was only complimentary beer, wine, and snacks for the manager reception with a drink limit of two per guest.  If you go to breakfast anytime around or after 8:30 am be prepared for larger crowds and hard time finding a seat.  You can't take food to your room from breakfast. \n\nBeing on the 17th floor we tookt the stairs alot because it was faster.  You get a $25 credit for the pantry each night.

He took care of our luggage, got taxis for us, recommended good places to eat and just made us feel like family.\n- Bar and bar staff. I wish they had longer hours, but when they were open, we had great service and drinks. The food was also pretty great! We had buffalo wings and they were so good.\n-Location! We were right down the street from Bryant Park and about 3\/4 mile from the theatre district.\n-Price - we thought the price was great for NY! $307 for a junior suite.\n-Cleanliness - both in our room and in public places.\n\nCons:\n- We were supposed to have a junior suite with a view. We got a junior suite with a view directly into the office building next door.I guess that was a view; just not the one we were expecting.\n- I really can\u2019t stand the \u201croom cleaning only on request\u201d policy. We aren\u2019t needy people, but I make my bed at home every day and I, at least, want my bed made. However, I forgot to ask. We did ask one day and it did not get done.\n- I know it\u2019s NYC and they can\u2019t spread out like we do in the Midwest, but the breakfast\/nightly cocktail reception area was just not big enough. No matter what time we came for breakfast, there were no seats. And, it was so incredibly hot in that area and in our hallway. Not sure what that was all about.\n- I like a softer bed, so I found the super firm mattress very uncomfortable.

The hotel has 39 floors and I stayed in 2408 (first 2 digits is your floor) and I loved my room (King Room with View) and had an amazing view of the Empire State Building.   Each floor only has 8 rooms.  There are 3 lifts which at peak times can get busy \u2013 breakfast especially, but any other time of day or night I had no issues. Now onto my room, 2 locks on the door which I really liked, Bathroom was glorious \u2013 walk in shower, large sink and lit up mirror, thick white towels and a hairdryer.  Just off the bathroom was the closet with hangers to hang your clothes (2 very large drawers are at the end of the bed), iron and ironing board along with the safe.  Room had full length mirror, luggage rack, heating control (the actual system was in the room and could be quite noisy, when I arrived the room was quite warm, so I set it to cool down whilst I went out, I then switched it off whenever I was in the room, especially during the night).  There is a Fridge, Microwave and Tea\/Coffee maker, Dressing Table\/Desk with lamp and large TV \u2013 I loved this as it had the Lifetime and Hallmark channel, so I even managed to watch a couple of Christmas Movies when settling down for the evening.  The bed I found was soooo comfortable, top sheet with thin duvet, I had a great nights sleep every night, there is a small bedside shelf which has plug and USB socket each side.  Due to Covid rooms are cleaned every 4 days (if you stay that long), I came back to find my room immaculate.  The window has a black out curtain aswell as normal curtain and you can open the window slightly (obviously restricted due to height).  Breakfast is on the 4th floor, I had breakfast and it was lovely, it can get busy so go down early.  I could also see Macys from my room, a short walk away with a Target opposite which sells travel size toiletries.  Nearby there are many restaurants, takeaways and fast-food shops like McDonald\u2019s, Chick-fil-A and Five Guys. Toast is just around the corner which sells drinks, water, milk, and deli style counter food options. Bryant Park is 3 blocks north and had the Winter Village which was great.

A visit from the maintenance technician and multiple calls to the front desk yielded no resolution, just befuddlement as if no one else was having this problem, even though staff later admitted to many A\/C-related calls that evening. Finally at 9pm with the room temperature exceeding 76 degrees, I went downstairs and told a member of staff (Willy, I think) that I couldn't take it and moved to a hotel down the street with proper A\/C. Yet, as of now, my credit card has not only been charged the full amount for the room, but also the snacks I bought, which were less than $25 and thus covered by the food and beverage credit for Diamond members I was told about during check-in.

Needless to say, this room was on the top floor and had a great view of the Empire State Building.  Wonderful service.\n\nThe room itself was not overly large, but this is to be expected in NYC, and we were quite comfortable.  \n\nBoth the afternoon reception and full breakfast were running as normal.  Plenty of good breakfast food.  The seating area is not real big and can get crowed pretty quickly.  They do tell you at check in that the busiest times are prior to 8:30, which did seem to be the case.\n\nSince we were running the marathon, the location was great for us.  It was a quick 5 minute walk to Bryant Park to catch the bus out to Staten Island.  Plenty of subway options were also available nearby.

I stayed for 5 paid nights for Halloween weekend. Their housekeeping service is NONEXISTENT and forget about getting room service, they won\u2019t clean it for you. Upon check in, the agent briefly and barely mentioned the amenities of the property. I had to ask her about gym, breakfast (which she provided me wrong times and caused me to miss it). I called to get my room cleaned on the 3rd day and I was told by the front desk I needed to make that request one day in advance, I told him I was told by the agent upon check in I could get it serviced on the 3rd day which I accepted, in the end they never sent anybody to clean my room and I had to call twice to get some basic toiletries. I am not the type of guest who needs his room serviced every day but when I do I expect the property to deliver. Management is doing a terrible job at running that facility. You can notice front desk understaffed and overworked but they keep on selling 100 % of their rooms. As a matter of fact, despite being Diamond I wasn\u2019t upgraded at all upon checking due to the house being fully booked but they keep on saying their service is impacted due to \u201cCOVID\u201d. However, there\u2019s a huge contradiction when you see more than half of the staff unmasked, even the ones on the breakfast area (you\u2019re required to show proof of vaccination to dine in or use the gym). This property has huge potentials not only because it\u2019s located on a prime location but also because its breakfast was good too and offers a wide variety of options. It\u2019s sad that Management has not done a better job at hiring more staff in order to provide a good  service according to the price they charge a room \/ night. You can\u2019t charge someone 300 \/ night when your service is below standards of a candle-wood suites.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The tv programming wasn't worth even turning it on. Due to limited space in room must be the reason we had to call housekeeping to get a blanket and pillow for fold out bed. Housekeeping was only by request. Having no internet cost us more money because we spent more time away from room than we would have if there was wifi.

Uber was easy to use, but be mindful that 37th is one-way going toward 6th Ave, so traffic gets backed up. Plan to walk a block or so toward your destination to order your Uber. Rooms are on floor 5 and above. Each floor only has 4-6 rooms. 2909 (king jr suite with view) had corner windows and beautiful views of Empire State Building and Macy's Herald Square. 2807 (king jr suite with view) had similar views but a much smaller window. Yes, rooms are small, but it's NYC. We heard zero noise from the street or other guests. Great cold, quiet air conditioning.\nNo managers reception. Breakfast really crowded so we got something from great choices around the corner. I still don't understand how the $25 credit guests have to spend at the little lobby market really works. \nWe previously stayed in the Upper East Side at Garden Suites which has much bigger rooms, the option of 2 queens, a very quiet neighborhood, and nicer subway stations. I like the convenience of Embassy Suites, but we saw IV drug users shooting up in broad daylight right outside the Embassy Suites entrance on 2 occasions.  We intentionally did not want to have to use the subway as often this trip, so we chose a busier location. Embassy Suites does not offer 2 beds in room - only a king and sofa bed. \nCOVID has some NYC activities\/attractions\/shopping not open or open fewer hours, so check websites before you go anywhere.  Dinner reservations were much easier to get than previous visits. The city was definitely less crowed than pre-COVID. Most people outside wore no mask, but inside most were masked.","travelDate":"2021-10","tripType":"NONE"}

TV is a 48-inch Samsung, and the bedside clock has displays on three sides. Mini-fridge and microwave are in a desk-side cabinet, hence hidden in photos. The room safe (in the closet) is sized for a laptop. Large closet with plenty of hangers, and drawers are *beneath* the bed. Mind the bedframe; it's bulky, easy to stub your toes. Individual thermostat for fan and A\/C; windows open for ventilation. Black-out curtains. Pillows are very squishy.\n\nAmenities: Complimentary buffet-style breakfast has hot items (pancakes, sausages, etc.), cold cereals, fruit, many breads and pastries; extensive seating. The \"Skylawn\" rooftop patio is located on the south side of the building (i.e., facing away from the street) and is quiet\/relaxing. \n\nDesign flaws: Kohler-brand sink fixtures are a little weird (the drain plug is actuated by a switch on the back of the spigot), the sliding shower door is tough to move from the inside, not enough towel bars (bring suction-cup hooks). Bedside clock three minutes slow (guest can set alarm but not time). The lobby is a little cramped, what with pillars, seating, and guests loitering.\n\nHotel helpfulness and current conditions (July 2021): Upon check-in you're given a one-sheet summary of current amenities (floor and hours: breakfast, limited housekeeping, etc.). Initial allotment of towels was inadequate, but when I asked the front desk, Housekeeping showed up within a few minutes. Wifi was down for a day but the hotel called in their ISP immediately (suggestion: since *everyone* was asking, could've broadcast status to room phones). For the pandemic, there are signs in the elevators re: masks and distancing; staff and guests generally wear masks; the two bars are closed, but breakfast is extensive. Front desk can call a taxi.

I was stunned to find out the bar and restaurant were not open as I specifically booked a hotel with in hotel restaurant as I knew we would be exhausted. Their pre arrival email did not mention it was closed and the app listed as open. One of the two rooms had a weird smell to the sheets, and the smoke alarm fell off the wall in the middle of the night. They then charged me $500 for smoking due to alarm falling off the wall (which left glass on floor on which my daughter cut her foot). I called the front desk each day to ask for housekeeping to come as instructed and the phone just rang and rang until it disconnected- this happened each time I called FD. I then approached front desk to ask them to take off $500 charge - the clerk met me with blind stare and told me I was charged due to smoking. I told him We do not smoke and that alarm fell if they would like to come inspect. He looked at his manager who looked at our account - wordlessly took it off no apology- assume he did as he saw our Diamond status. Many more smaller incidents to mention but last straw was that I received 0 points for my stay. Took me 2 calls to Diamond desk to get them credited.

There is a 25.00 per day urban charge, like a Resort Fee.  However, for that we were to have access to daily cocktail hour, a bar\/ restaurant, an outdoor bar\/ lounge deck, WIFI and daily housekeeping service. None available.  WIFI died half way into our stay.\nin lieu of above we were to get 15.00 worth of items from the hotel store but that was almost empty containing only a few bags of peanuts and snacks., and they had the Gaul to pcharge us for that one day.  We disputed the bill and the fee was reversed.Breakfast was available at a tiny room with few tables.  We brought it to our room after waiting for elevators. It didn\u2019t help that they closed a portion of the breakfast room for a private meeting removing even more seating space.\nFront desk seriously understaffed.  Snaking lines at all hours and too busy to answer phones.  With no housekeeping we ran out of shampoo and soap.  Didn\u2019t mind drying and reusing towels. An answered call to desk responded that someone would bring it up but never did.  I went to the desk at an odd hour and was able to get a shampoo.\nmany negative reviews have been responded to with the same lame excuse that they\u2019re recovering from COVID and having troubles.

Just know that things may improve in the near future. Every person I dealt with was obviously trying very hard and was quite pleasant. \n\nPros: For NYC, the rooms are nicely sized and the views cannot be beat\u2014 we had the Empire State Building RIGHT outside our window. Additionally, they charge you $25 a day resort fee but you can use it as a credit toward snacks in the lobby pantry. In my experience, the front desk was swamped and never cared what we took. The staff is polite and hard working and trying very hard to get up to speed. The breakfast also seemed well rounded and the hotel is near good squares and parks for people watching or downtime.  Also room AC is great and many people wore masks. \n\nCons: The hotel staff is SWAMPED and getting towels or other things takes hours. The AC in public areas is spotty and we often encountered very warm areas. Elevators are on the slow side and you need a room key to access them. The wifi went out during our visit, so that was challenging, and many features were closed, like the outside deck (maybe due to covid staffing?).   At breakfast there was an odd rule that you HAD to eat in the dining area, which made us nervous due to number of unmasked people. \n\nTips:\nRooms that end in \u201c09\u201d have awesome views! If you need housekeeping things like towels, ask for them between check out and check in time as that is when it is least busy.  Definitely get your money\u2019s worth of snacks (you DID pay for them). Also, join honors and you can check in online to skip the massive check in chaos downstairs.  Finally, if you are vegetarian be aware that the number of good restaurants in the area is slim. \n\nOverall, I\u2019d say this is a perfectly good budget hotel for a quick stay. Go into it knowing that some things won\u2019t be comfortable or run as usual due to covid and appreciate that the staff is trying hard.  If you are ok with that, you can\u2019t beat the price. If you\u2019d prefer more prompt attention and well rounded experience this probably isn\u2019t for you.","travelDate":"2021-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

I booked this hotel specifically because of my birthday. I wanted to come up to New York I haven't been there since the pandemic I wanted to come back do some shopping see some friends and family have a good time. I was experiencing issues with my card so I called Hilton Hilton directed me to the property and I spoke to somebody. I have no clue who I spoke to but I spoke to somebody who worked at the desk. They confirmed that I could come in and I could use an alternative form of payment. Fun fact, I recorded that phone call and I know one of their side they recorded it too just to protect myself so that there will be no confusion. I also informed them that I will be arriving late they told me it was okay. I get to the hotel late there is a gentleman behind the counter and he immediately starts barking orders at me as if I'm a child demanding for my name. He didn't even give me time to walk fully into the doors he's demanding that I tell him my name or I leave the building. So I asked him what's the problem and I give him my name. He does some clicking on the computer and tells me that I no longer have my guest here he gave my from to somebody else. That I should be more responsible adult and have money. I didn't know that's what we said to people who spend money at a place especially when I told them about my situation. He kept constantly telling me how he did not care he was very nasty and he was embarrassing me in front of two other gentlemen who were checking in. He boasted on how he gave my room up to one of them so I would have to sleep somewhere else either the train station he didn't care and when I didn't respond he started trying to talk to me as if I was a child demanding that I respond or acknowledge Him. I told this man I'm a grown woman I'm 30 years old not a child suddenly his little mood change especially when I told him that I recorded the phone call confirming from his coworker whoever they are that I could ride and pay with a different form of payment. The movement of indicated that I recorded the call he wanted to be friendly but mention the phrase that nobody even told him about any changes and because he has to do his audit sacrifices had to be made and I was one of them. As if this is some weird ritual. He wanted me to get away from him give him six feet he vocalize that. He expressed intense doubt that I was a Hilton Honors member and that I probably booked off of a third-party website I build my phone to him which I'm certain their cameras seen everything where I'm turning my phone and I'm showing him that I booked off the Hilton website and I'm currently using the Hilton app and he told me he didn't want to see it. It is now 2 in the morning I just came from Philadelphia I'm tired and very agitated. What took me over the edge was the fact that I had to rebook a room but I couldn't get the room originally picked which was room 1706 I had to book a junior suite. And I had to pay junior suite prices. I gave him the last four digits of my credit card number and he say when he has to do his second audit he will confirm all of my booking information would make me so angry was the fact that he said that at the time he does his second audit if my car does that work he would personally come into the room and kick me out with the police. I did not know this is what Behavior is at any Hilton property. I never even experiences at a Hampton Inn and now I'm experiencing this at Embassy Suite? This matter was supposed to be handled privately with management but apparently I'm not worth the time of day it has been five days since I checked out nobody has answered my call every time I call and I asked to speak to apparently somebody by the name of coral suddenly I'm either hung up on or put on hold until Oblivion and then I get a random voicemail so there you have it folks if you want to be treated like your garbage if you want your money and value as a paying customer to be diminished to next one non-existent level you should look your stay here.

I didn't expect much, only the usual Embassy Suites treatment--that's why we booked this hotel.  It failed in almost way.\n\nThe night we checked in, there was only one person at the front desk.  He was busy answering phone calls, while three parties were waiting, for more than 15 minutes.  Once we got into the room and found that something was missing, we called the front desk and no one answered.  We had to call more than 5 times in a 40 minutes span (finally answered by the same front desk guy) to get our supplies delivered.  So the whole Embassy Suites only has one person working on the service\/check-in\/front desk duty on a Friday night?  Unbelievable!\n\nThe room is small, which is understandable.  But they called this room \"Junior Suite\" and charged a premium when it's smaller than a regular hotel room?  Come on!  Even worse, the room, despite having the sticker on the door saying \"cleaned and sanitized,\" was dirty when we got in.  There is dust all over the place, crumbs on the floor, and the phone headset was very sticky to touch.  There is no way that the room was thoroughly cleaned before we checked in.\n\nOn the second day, we called front desk and asked for housekeeping service.  We were then told that it has to be arranged the day before!  OK, then right there we asked for housekeeping service on the following day.  the manager wrote it down, but of course they never came!  So for the three nights, we never got the trash taken out or room cleaned (despite putting in the requests); all we could do is to request new towels!  Then to make things worse, on the day we're checking out, housekeeper knocked on the door at 8 am in the morning!  So they never wanted to clean our room during our stay but wanted to clean the room on our checkout day BEFORE we check out? Ridiculous!\n\nI went to the \"limited service\" breakfast and was completely disappointed.  It was truly limited; there was really not a whole lot of items.  (It's good that other guests told me that I could ask for yogurt and bananas, which were not present.)  The toaster were broken, and the server just shrugged his shoulders and said \"yes, it is.\"  Then at 10:15 the servers came out and cleaned up.  By 10:20, everything was gone, including coffee!  A woman came in then to ask for something to eat and was told they're closed, fully 10 minutes before the published closing time of 10:30!  I have NEVER seen anything like this, let along in an Embassy Suites!  I never bothered to go to the breakfast again during my stay.\n\nWe did get a room to sleep for three night in a good location, but that's about it.  I can't think of ANYTHING good about our stay.  This is truly a very disappointing experience.","travelDate":"2021-05","tripType":"NONE"}

It's not very big but cleverly divided into two \"rooms.\"  My husband and I were both able to work without bugging each other.  The view was extraordinary of the east side of Midtown, and in particular, the Empire State two blocks away.  Bryant Park, one of the most beautiful parks in the city is also only two blocks away - the rest of the neighborhood is Midtown, so not so charming, but central.  The bed was GREAT and totally silent room with a great shower.  But the highlight was Coral.  We are in town from Chicago for a few weeks to visit out daughter who lives in Harlem and is sick. Our airbnb doesn't open until tomorrow, so we stayed here.  In addition to that stress and worry (during Covid), I am a teacher and teaching remotely (8th grade!), and was struggling to find a place to teach all day today.  Coral (front desk) seemed to intuit the stress and worry we were under and COMPLETELY took care of us in the most gracious way.  She gave us a late check-out so that I could teach, and when she first saw us this morning she called out \"Good morning 2707 (our room number)!\"  How she remembered that I have no idea.  Anyhow, she was the bright spot we really needed to start this time with our kid and all the unknowns.  Thanks, Coral - you really took care of us more than you'll know. :)","travelDate":"2020-09","tripType":"NONE"}

I couldn\u2019t stand the thought of a dirty toilet, especially a gross toilet seat. what if someone had stds just used it...and it is clearly not even been cleaned at all.  The front desk lady was very nice and helpful and she gave us a different room. Oh man, the second room doesn\u2019t have a Dirty toilet issue, the sofa has white stain and nasty stuff on it, the part you pull to lock the door from inside literally has white sperm looking sticky thing covers it....I can go on with a list all day, but seriously in the middle of a night with a tired toddler, I am here. \nThe front desk lady was nice and kind, but I don\u2019t think anyone is cleaning this hotel.

When we got there I realized that it didn't seem to fit with the description of the room I booked so I went back down to try to clear up the mistake. Coral seemed a bit surprised to see me so quickly and when I told her about the mix up she asked me to just wait a minutes in lobby while she took care of it. It was clear she up to something. \n\nShe walks back over a few minutes later and says \"I see in the reservation notes that it's someone's birthday. I guess everything happens for a reason, please enjoy your new room and I sent a little something up to your room to help you celebrate\".\n\nI guess when I came back down she was in the middle of having a bottle of wine sent up to the room and I almost ruined the suprise. We went to the new room which had an unbelievable balcony and view of the Empire State Building. I was so close to picking one of the smaller boutique hotels and I'm glad I didn't. Coral at the front desk truly made our little one night getaway an unforgettable one. \n\nI don't think our treatment was because I am a diamond member either. I believe that Coral saw an opportunity to make our unfortunate situation better, and she did. If you ever read this, thank you again Coral!\n\nThe hotels location was amazing.

I had waited almost an hour for his arrival, I called the front desk twice because of this.\nI removed the stained sheets for the handyman to take with and noticed the blood stain had seeped into the mattress cover as well, which had to be replaced.\nWhile making the bed, I noticed I was missing the appropriate bedding.

The  'nightly reception' was a joke.  Unless you're gonna gulp down as many drinks as you can in 2 hours, it's not worth paying the extra money to stay here.

The furniture was in good shape and the bathroom was newly remodeled. We paid for a room with a city view. It was a tremendous view of the Empire State Building. The elevator situation was rough.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but the evening reception and cooked-to-order breakfast both sounded enticing. \n\nSome good points - I liked the location. Away from the serious hustle and bustle of Times Square, but a short walk to loads of points of interest or the Subway. The hotel was very busy with long lines to check-in, but the concierge soon called me over to his desk to check in there instead. \n\nThe evening reception is a nice idea, but it's much less than an executive lounge you'd find in some Hiltons. There were a few bar-snack nibbles, and drinks on offer - not quite sure what was included, but I had a beer so I know that is. It was very busy and noisy, with few seats available, so we only stopped for one quick drink on one night. \n\nBreakfast was really good - nicely cooked and a good selection. The staff were also working hard to keep tables clear. The space is quite small, however, and the hours quite limited - 06:30 to 09:30, with warnings that it's extremely busy towards the end of service. We 'chose' to wake up extra early every day to avoid the crowds. It's all a usual buffet, apart from eggs and omelettes which are cooked fresh - which is what most hotels offer anyway. I was only here for two days, but each day the breakfast choice was slightly different - a very nice touch. \n\nThe room was comfortable and clean, although the bedroom itself is quite small - just enough room to open the door before you hit the bed. The bathroom is nice and spacious, however. The whole hotel is very modern and clean. \n\nLong wait to retrieve our bags when leaving, so we ended up just having to go into the bar area where they're stored to retrieve ours.\n\nGenerally, I got the feeling there aren't quite enough staff or facilities for the number of rooms or guests. The breakfast and evening reception should possibly increase the hours, so that there's less of a crush at peak times.\n\nOverall - not a bad hotel at all, just not quite what I'd expected or hoped for. All the staff are working hard, and are pleasant enough - especially most of the breakfast staff, I thought.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Unfortunately there were no rooms in the (massive) host hotel, so I had to find another facility.  I saw \"Embassy Suites Times Square,\" on the Hilton Site, so I registered there.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was at first struck with the fact that it is actually no where near Times Square - over a half a mile away.  This eventually became completely inconvenient, and really represented nothing less than false advertising.\n\nUpon arriving, I learned that there is no valet parking offered, which was a first for me.  So I had to unpack my bags, leave them in the lobby where I was told they would \"be OK,\" and was given the wrong directions and wound up in the wrong garage.  There was no \"handout,\" telling you the address of the garage or more efficient directions, just verbal directions from a friendly desk person who unfortunately was not a New Yorker.\n\nWhen I arrived, I then learned there was a major problem with my booking.  Apparently, I was booked to arrive the night before.  Although this may have been a mistake by my staff, there was little of no attempt by management to assist me.  I was initially told that it would be removed from the bill, but later was told that was not correct, that I would be billed for it, and that there was \"nothing the staff could do.\"  This was from a very nice desk person who had no authority to assist in any way.  No one from management ever contacted me to discuss the situation with me or give me any further advice.\n\nSo after I got to my room, I put the \"Do Not Disturb,\" sign on for a half hour.  As the result, I could not get my room serviced for the next two days.  On both days, I had to go down to the front desk to ask that my room be serviced.\n\nIn terms of the \"free breakfast,\" yes it is offered, and one morning when I went early was able to enjoy.  But as many other things about this hotel, it is poorly organized, such that from 8AM on it is too busy to actually be able to take advantage of this benefit.\n\nIt is \"Embarrasing,\" that such a facility by associated with the Hilton organization.\n\nThere were other problems, but I cannot bother with some of them","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"BUSINESS"}

It's one thing to have a fee, it's another thing to lie and call it a tax from the city to make it look like you're not charging a fee. It's dishonest and I reported it to the NY Division of Consumer Protection so hopefully it stops.\n\nPros: nice hotel rooms, spacious with nice layout. Breakfast is free and pretty spectacular for a free breakfast. \n\nCons: Elevators are a disaster, not enough capacity, guests who seemingly have never used elevators before, you often have to wait 5-7 mins for an elevator.","travelDate":"2019-11","tripType":"NONE"}

Residence Inns or Homewoods not really having a traditional kitchen, etc. While this property didn't have a huge 10 story sprawling atrium, they did a great job delivering what I would expect from an Embassy Suites hotel.\n\nCentrally located near Times Square, very easy walk to the theater district, and multiple Subway lines.\n\nThey unfortunately did not have a true \"suite\" to offer me upon my arrival, but my room on the 32nd floor was comfortable and had a beautiful view. Because it's Manhattan, the closet was small and stuck in the bathroom, and the only drawers to put away clothing were under the bed, but overall I tend to anticipate these type of modifications in Manhattan.\n\nI was not able to enjoy their breakfast secondary to my early morning departure from the hotel, but I did stop by their evening reception each night on the 4th floor. There was always a nice array of chips, dips, and a crudite. The bartenders were friendly, and poured a nice complimentary cocktail. Of note, you can choose to upgrade to some top shelf cocktails and wine during the reception. I found the complementary offerings quite satisfactory.\n\nLobby was welcoming, and there was always a couple of containers with very fresh fruit waters, sometimes with cucumber sometimes with mixed berries, and once with fresh pineapple.

The walk is doable to this hotel both from Grand Central and Penn Station.  We prefer Penn Station, but a taxi will get you there in no time.  \n\nThe front desk is friendly.  There is no problem if you need to store your gear before or after your hotel stay.  I did inquire about having a \u201cfan,\u201d as I like the noise and circulation.  This hotel does not carry fans. The AC system is cold enough to your liking on those hot days in NYC. \n\nThe room is smaller than your normal Embassy Suites due to location.  The comfort you expect is quite evident with comfortable beds and a modern bathroom. There is even a small refrigerator.  \n\nWe stayed at this Embassy twice over ten weeks.  Both times we selected a room \u201cwith a view.\u201d  Our first experience we were on the 38th floor with commanding views of the Empire State building, World Trade Tower in the distance and you could see the largest store in the world\u2014Macy\u2019s\u2014down below.  It was quite an experience to view a storm coming over NYC.  We felt totally safe.\n\nOur second experience was not so thrilling.  We were placed on the 24th floor facing a building.  \n\nOne of the highlights of all Embassy\u2019s is the breakfast. Jorge cooks one superb omelet and even better \u201ceggs over easy.\u201d  An Ecuadorian, he is indeed friendly.  I am so glad that the computer machine on the wall was not working on our second visit.  You could actually converse with Jorge. Ordering by the grill is much better than the computer on the wall.  \n\nBreakfast has all your favorite meats\u2014bacon and sausage\u2014and different types of cereals and yogurts.  It did not have, though, hard boiled eggs or even poached eggs\u2014my wife\u2019s favorite source of protein.  I brought this fact up to the manager who called the kitchen.  She learned that they do not cook these styles of eggs.  \n\nThe Managers \u201cHappy Hour\u201d is well attended. For a solid two hours, beer, wine and many cocktail drinks are on the house.  You may not get a seat if you get there too late!  \n\nIf you are not so lucky, the ice-machine may be on another floor.  This can be a hassle.   The elevators for the most part, are quick. You may have to wait longer for one of the four elevators in the morning.  \n\nOverall, we were pleased.  The hotel is centrally located to many attractions and to metro stops.  You can get a comfortable night\u2019s sleep. The only major complaint is they don\u2019t have my wife style of egg\u2019s\u2014which is commonly carried In Hampton\u2019s and many European style hotels.","travelDate":"2019-09","tripType":"NONE"}

However, this stay got off to a bad start from the beginning. When we checked in, the front desk clerk said they were overbooked and we couldn't have a suite (which is the entire reason we wanted to stay there). We agreed to just have a King bed instead (really no choice). The clerk said we could switch after the first night to a suite, but we were going to be gone the entire day so when would we even have been able to switch? It was just too much hassle. The next day when we came back around 7:30pm, our door was propped open (I assume by housekeeping). We walked in and luckily nothing had been stolen, but of course I made a complaint to the front desk about it and told them to let the manager know. I didn't receive any other communication from them during our stay. The other reason we stayed there was because of the free breakfast, but each day we tried to go it was a literal madhouse; you could barely squeeze by and get your food. It was like the entire city of New York was trying to get breakfast for two hours. We gave up after the first day and never went back. We won't stay here again; the prices were higher than comparable other Hiltons in the area, and attempting to get a free breakfast as part of the deal just wasn't worth the higher price. And as I stated, you cannot count on getting a suite at Embassy Suites! Oh, the only good customer service we received were the bartenders- they were great!","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

It did not disappoint.  The reviews showed long waits for the elevators, but we never encountered long waits.  The breakfast area can get crowded, but in the elevator there is a notice of busiest times.  Avoid the busiest times and it is not bad at all.  Normal hotel crowds.  The breakfast is very good and they had choices.  Made to order or buffet.  Always very good fruit.  The room is not your typical Embassy Suite, but a New York hotel room, but was very adequate.  The couch is a high back divider.  The room was very clean and surprisingly very quiet. No hall or street noise.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  I would definitely stay here again.  They also have an evening reception.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}

The reception staff were all very nice.  The elevators were always crowded and, and you had to wait forever for them.  The rooms were fine, but they were a little cramped.  The table was broken in our room, and there was barely enough room to open both of our suitcases.  Free breakfast was ok, but it was very poorly designed in there for people to move about without running into each other.  They had trouble keeping the food stocked in the chafing dishes.  We enjoyed the location for a change.","travelDate":"2019-07","tripType":"COUPLES"}

The hotel has been recently renovated- grays and purples in the interior, which are beautifully done. The rooms are nice, with microwave, mini-fridge, desk, updated bathrooms. We stayed in a \"studio suite\", which was a bit small\/tight, but was fine for three people. The sofa in the \"living room\" was a nice-sized pull-out sofa. The only complaint was the comforter on the bed. The material on the back was really slick which made the covers slide onto the floor 5 minutes after getting into the bed. Very annoying, but otherwise, it was a nice room. You couldn't hear outside noise or neighboring rooms at all- 37th street is not that loud in the evening, but it's at the corner of 6th street which is really busy. Our room was very quiet.  \n\nThe front desk staff were nice and they held our bags when we arrived a few hours before check-in so we could explore the area w\/o baggage. \n\nAs with any Embassy Suites, full breakfast was available and a nightly reception with snacks at 5:30. The breakfast area gets REALLY CROWDED, so go early - like 7am. Any later than that, and it's just so crowded. \n\nWe'd stay here again when travelling to NYC.","travelDate":"2019-08","tripType":"NONE"}
